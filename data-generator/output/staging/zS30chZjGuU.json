    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hello once again distributed data show I'm live in the studio with the Tillman hello everyone and today as a special treat we have our Vanguard Solutions Architect wave ding and we are going to ask him a ton of questions about securing distributed databases super hot topic and we're gonna have a lot of fun with this so once you take a minute and introduce yourself away hello hello so my name is wade in and information security has been my main area of interest for close to 20 years during my whole career I've been working at various IT rows from research to development to operation to management to training all of them are somehow related to security stabbing here at data stacks for four years and a lot of what I do here is to help our enterprise customers to understand how to leverage many of the data stacks enterprise security features so that they can increment their security data platform that is able to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data so another part of my job is to put together training content of data stack advanced security for both of our field engineers and our customers so that they understand the concepts and they see some hands-on examples and they learn best practices to speed up their deployment and since this mass is my 4 years anniversary with Stax congratulations oh thank you thank you told me that but I also want to add another interesting fact so when I when I join the data stacks in 2013 it was just a few masters of the dis axe released at the SES 3.0 with a whole slew of security features so that include authentication and authorization framework password and Kerberos authentication SSL transparent data encryption and then auditing so that's a lot and remember this was also the first time we ever introduced security features into the DSC product ahead of many other no simple databases in the market so being able to offer such a comprehensive set was pretty impressive that was no small feat I still remember some blog posts at that time were titled like no seeker means no security or other mean words yeah yeah we've seen those articles absolutely we still see those are yes yeah yeah nice that was yeah that was a general of perception there was a general perception of the no sequel world like you know no sequel is fast and loose right so you don't have security and and Dennis tax was actually the one that who was leading the charge in changing that perception so it was amazing for me to like you know from my personal perspective it was amazing for me to watch over the last four years we've got a lot of adoption of those features for our NFS customers and we continue to add more capabilities such as LDAP authentication the k-map support for external key management role based access control and role level access control so that we can help our customers to meet their ever-changing ever more stringent requirement of the data protection so I have in in one word that I have stayed long enough to be that eyewitness to see the full progression of our security features ever since this inception very cool so like I'd love that we had UI that were having you on right now just because you know we kind of said you know you see the news articles all the time and you've seen a ton of them like you know the Equifax breach recently you know like his security is constantly in the news somebody's getting hacked and there was just a there was just a Bluetooth vulnerability a big Bluetooth vulnerability that just came out recently so it's awesome to have you on to talk security like kind of I guess it's probably always it's a timely sort of topic but so maybe you can start by kind of talking about what kind of security risks were trying to address when we talk about securing securing distributed database oh wow you're asking a really really big question in three senses all right they're probably good to be a book right so at least a book chapter so so what I'm going to do is to to mean a few examples that comes to my mind and this one be comprehensive that I would try okay so that's it basically when I look at the risks I tend to look at different actors so no matter if they are Manisha's or not I look at those different actors and then I'm looking at the potential strats they can incur to a data system so for the actress what I mean is they're normally in three categories that these are authorized users there are authorized user but without the proper access per village and then there's an authorized user with access privilege but they they may be deliberately or unknowingly disclosing data so so then I listed the potential threat they can bring and what we can do to prevent them respectively so so there are the the stress I can think of right now so the first one is tampering the data so this could be tampering the data by modifying the data packet on the wire or data file on the disk for example I have original record that you described $100 money transfer from account a to become B so if Manisha's are authorized user can intercept the packet on a while and then they can modify the amount from 100 to 1000 then he can have some financial game right do you know how to do this okay I think we're with you so far yeah so if directly modifying or replacing the network packet is difficult then another way is to sniff the original packet then you can also do work we play for ten times you can still get that $10,000 you want right so you know it's this is called usually called replay attack right and then similarly if the user is authorized to association to this database server that does not have the privilege to access the record from the database directly they can still go directly to the directory the file system where the data files stored and what if record so to prevent this from happening we will have to leverage some of the features like from dsee we have the in flag encryption so if everything every packet that's transferred out a while is already encrypted then there's nothing you can do about that modification attack or the replay attack or you can ask it for the data on the disk you can actually apply the address encryption from DSC and also DSC have some feature that's called checksum for that's a stable four-foot data file so this way if you combine all these address encryption in flag encryption and checksum and digital signature then you will be able to maintain the integrity of your data so that's that's the first kind of threat you know for people to temper your data to impact the integrity of your data there's some some kind of the mechanism will be able to prevent that and the second one is you know how about stealing data right so either the string data from your network or from the disk again in this case any authorized user who can sniff the network packet or have access to data file on the disk they will be able to steal the data in this case similarly DSC in flight and address encryption what we opt can be used to protect the confidentiality of the data and the third one is faking identity so in this case you will need to hope to have effective authentication mechanism to make sure that a user to the database is indeed the user this this person claims to be so you will also need to have some way to prevent session hijacking by a malicious user like because once your session is established from some kind of server if that session got hijacked it then whatever that you have already passed the house on occasion will be malicious user will be able to reuse that that's not good right yep so DSC in this case DSC provide multiple authentication methods such as password or her prose or to address this kind of threat and another one I want to bring up this you know this always is just human nature right so we all we all are required to use password that we all tend to use weak password right Hey yeah monkey I believe is the most popular one two three four five six yeah exactly yeah for authorized user with privilege taxes the data you still want to prevent them from using it you see to guess password or or use the same password against many systems or don't change possible for too long right so in this case if you can leverage the SDC Kerberos LDAP authentication method then you can actually manage the password complexity and then enforce the possible policy on a centralized external authentication server such as like you know Microsoft has Active Directory server which is very popular among our customers so that you will be able to address this kind of a threat okay then another thread is authorize accessing tables and rows what I mean by that is your database may have some sensitive data storing some tables or some rows within the table and you you really shouldn't open them up to all the users or sending it to the database so in this case authorization mechanism based on the user or the users role becomes important and to prevent authorized access provided to the authenticated user we can also leverage the SC's authorization control so that you can you can actually just issue some command like a grant a permission of revoke a permission those commands are very similar to what you will see in the relational database and at the same time you can also make this membership of of those rows to be managed internally in the DSC table or you can track that externally in some directory service so is this the kind of thing that's gonna prevent a dumb developer like me from dropping a table that I'm not supposed to drop you know because somehow they let me on the production system and they they should never give you their IMing access to pay with right so you're you a developer you should not have any accident that's probably true yeah probably true but does this also mean that there are some rows that I as a developer can see within a table and then there's some rows that I can't is that what you're talking about yeah yeah so so basically that's that's what I mentioned earlier there's a feature that's called row level access control so that I can actually base a content of one of the columns so that you can match up to your your user logging and some some salmon rolls can only be visible by one user but another user so even though they're in the same table you have that level of separation oh I've wanted this for so long because if you've ever thought about how would I implement a multi-tenant app hopefully using Cassandra this is this is gold yes to come up all the time in my previous job like yeah who's gonna have her level access and who has row level access and yep this was this was introduced in the se5 one - exactly to address the multi-tenant situation so yeah we do hear from our developer community our our customers and we got that increment in 5.1 yep yeah and lastly about the stress but not finally is this really just all I can think about is this lack of accountability what did I mean by lack of accountability is that for awesome authorized user whisper village to access the data or for the database administrator who can perform any action like add or remove user or create a drop table you will need them to be held accountable for their actions so you to achieve this goal DSC provide auditing capability that you can configure for different activities and then you can also specify what keep it key spaces you can include - through lock such activity and beyond that the blog entries can also be sent to a central lock server so once this on the central log the locks there's no repeating you cannot really deny you have ever done something so everyone's gonna know when I drop that table so wait I'm interested like some of the stuff that you've been talking about are familiar to me like with the relational database background like I've heard you know some of these similar sort of concepts so I'm curious you know what makes us securing a distributed database difficult and maybe how does like securing distributed database compared to maybe what some people who are listening or watching have done previously you know in relational databases that's a great question so in my view in general a distributed database really have to address the same kind of the security challenge like a normal single node or relational mission-critical database needs to address but on top of that it also needs to cover some unique challenges in the distributed environments so that makes the securing distributed database extremely hot right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to go into some details on each of the points here so first talking about the same security challenge comparing the distributed ways and relational database you still need to worry about those typical database security vulnerabilities like insufficient or ineffective input validation or weak authentication or insecure communication or illegal access to our encrypted data okay and you say you know insecure communication do you mean like between clients like between code that I'm writing as a developer and the database is that what you're kind of talking about that kind of green cage okay yeah exactly yeah you need that to be encrypted right so it's not protected then you you you will leaks and some very sensitive information okay that's a great point too because I securing your distributed database that extends all the way out to the driver all the way out to your application right where it first enters that yeah database world that's part of what we're trying to protect yep so beyond that the similarities between the distributed base and relational base there's no C called distributed database is well known to be designed with architectural flexibility to offer some some good performance and scalability right but the same architectural flexibility also presents some great security risks for example if you think about the distribute database in general usually you have to build in some horizontal scaling capability for example clustering sharding replication I'm not saying that the shotting is used by PSE but you know do you know who I'm talking about oh yeah but it opens yeah was this kind of the horizontal scaling capability it opens up a new attack surface where the data store is vulnerable to node impersonation attack do you know what I mean by node impersonation no I don't think explain it yeah so basically when you think about if you're familiar with the Cassandra how Cassandra like looks like you're green you can basically just if there's no protection on that you can just drop in another node and just give you the same cluster name and just tell it you to to bootstrap and then it will just immediately become a member of the cluster and start accepting rights right right and so it then has a at least a portion of the data that's accessible to it that's being streamed to it or being written to it right yeah so having having said all this the good news is that DSC does have security features to address all those challenges I just mentioned right so for input validation or the what they call some has called a no sequel injection this addition to encouraging the good habit in the application code and always filtering in that an input which is you know as a application developer you really should do all the time the DC driver user commands using preparedstatement as a best practice so then when you when you actually use the prepare statement the attack surface for the the no Seco injection of CKO injection will be a lot less yeah this looks exactly like if you're if you have an SQL background you'll be familiar with buying variables and yep it's the same sort of thing that you'd be reading used to yep yeah for authentication deity provide support for password of Kerberos LDAP and also allows unified Authenticator to combine any two of them to work together so in this way this is a lot stronger than just a simple possible md5 based authentication and for the client to server communication all the DSCC secure drivers have support for SSL or TLS so none of the sensitive information between the client and server will need to transfer in clamp acts to prevent illegal access to encrypted data DAC also provides transparent data encryption combined with the external key management will KMIP so for the note impersonation concern DNC also support SSL and TLS between the DAC servers using the same data center across remote data centers so now if you are actually in that CA in that PKI infrastructure then you don't have to worry about node impersonation because any node that's not signed by the CA will not be accepted by all the other peers now that's interesting with that when you're using that key infrastructure across a cluster do all the nodes then have to exchange private have to do key exchange between all those nodes no they don't have to do key exchange what they do is that they basically all of them will have to have their own identity so basically generate a pair of keys the private key and public key and the public key will be signed by a CA maybe it's a Enterprise da so that CA will basically say your public key is associated with your hostname so I trust you I I can prove to other people that I trust you and then if everybody else can trust the CA then they will be able to do that the initial key exchange using this public key certificate right so that there is little bit of extra work that's involved when you're using this PKI because if to add a new node for example that actually that public key needs to go to all the other nodes doesn't it or help me out yeah the public key does not have to go to all the other nodes it's actually it's it's way easier than that the idea about this is that when you when you actually start to doing that communication with the audio DAC nodes the first thing you are doing is that what we called SSL handshake so doing that SSL handshake you actually send your public key certificate to the remote end okay so so let me explain how this certificate works you do not have to pre distribute all your certificate to all the other nodes so what you really need to do is that during that initial SSL handshaking you are basically you are sending this certificate your public key certificate that's signed by CA you're sending that over to your remote party a remote party basically will just look at the signature of that certificate and see this is signed by a CA and this year I trust so then I actually trust the connection of this public key to this identity of the remote node Garrett thinks they saw the challenges from the just from the architectural and application design side but there are also some security challenges during the deployment for example some of the distributed databases you know who they are I I want name names that's why they are designed to walk out of the box they really try to design to be really really easy for developers so then a post installation there's really no little or no configuration required and one of them is that you know they just don't cover authentication never make that authentication to be enabled this is actually great for testing out a new product in a lab environment but obviously you will need to address the authentication prior to deployment in the production environment however people often forgot about that and put an unprotected database online so this is why you see news about like large number of no secret databases getting owned by hackers and helpful ransom this is a lot of things I really like about off-centre that is another management tool I haven't talked about yet but options is really has a fancy provisioning tool called lifecycle manager that can help you to to implement this kind of security by default kind of concept on your cluster so what what do I mean by that is that even if you don't want to spend the time to learn how to enable authentication for your DSC cluster as long as you hand your cluster over to option to manage it will automatically enable the authentication for you and what's more beyond that is at a click of a checkbox you can even automatically enable the SSL and TLS for client to server and server to server in five encryption so this this means that we just talked about like you know this a key generation a pair of probably key private key and then get camee that key is signed by CA and then generating that key in putting that back into the key store it's very tedious kind of process all that tedious work will be hidden by the option to say left like a manager provisioning so you don't have to worry about that but you can actually get to benefit from this additional protection I'm doing flag encryption so I'm curious I'm gonna ask you I'm gonna ask you something that's like sort of an opinion thing and you know you can refuse to answer if you know but so do you think that say open source Cassandra or DSC do you think it should ship with security turned on by default like do you think that there should be sort of you know the I guess we're weighing the secure versus ladies if you ease of use for a developer you know that's just trying it out or something for the first time like do you wish that that that kind of stuff shipped with with security turned on or would it even be worth it cuz it just be some default password that you know hackers would have just as easy of a time happening into and ransoming anyway you may have answered I don't know you know you know the the random password that that that kind of aspect you know the the default password that everybody knows that's always going to be published online yeah that aspect is actually perfectly addressed by this lifecycle manager opposite lifecycle management provisioning because what happens there is that lifecycle manager once it starts you to take over the control of your cluster the first thing asks about is for you to set a new password so it never used a random password never use like a defined password that everybody knows that's gonna be published online it's always going to be a possible that you sent a sign in to you so it's never going to be the same across to two different clusters option two LCMS managing and maybe that's really the way is to have something that coaches you through the best practices yep right yeah I really love that because you know that that's that's exactly to answer your question is that I I wish that everybody like even if your developer heard if you can actually make your dev cluster to be managed by ops enter it one makes things a lot safer so you don't have to worry about like you know just making that available on public cloud yeah I've known lots of dev clusters where they where it's a clone of the production cluster maybe with some data scrubbing done and you know it's it like yeah you can you can end up exposing stuff that you didn't mean to in a dev environment you know yeah and that actually that leads me to another question that I wanted to ask you way is that you know our database security is only one aspect of our overall enterprise security solution so it's usually the case that we're gonna be deploying you know our distributed database into an existing enterprise which has its own security infrastructure that's already in place so you know can we talk about that about how how a distributed database kind of needs to integrate with existing security infrastructure and what that looks like yeah so I always you know just just like to talk about this this is one rule one principle I've learned in all these years working in security it is the principle of a defense-in-depth right so there's really no one layer of security that would be your your silver bullet so when you think building a security environment you really have to consider you know there are at least like three main aspects one is called administrative security such as like good security procedures or Rob books you know for following those procedures or guidelines and then there's also physical security for example like you know your your data center your physical access control like your CCTV and then you need to have think about this all these technical security such as hardware security OS security storage security network security in addition to database security so really when you think about it database Security's religious it's really important because it holds the crown jewel of your organization which is your data but still right it's only part of your overall security design so wait what what security features should I be looking for in a distributed database then so I I can have the commad a little bit better I guess maybe I can just put that here you know to talk about those security features again so basically what I would consider as essential would be authentication authorization and auditing so this is some you know in the security of what people usually talk just just talk about this as tuple a right so this is the one of the most important aspect but then there's also encryption so that that include post at rest encryption and in flagging question and and of course if you want to be really secure for that address encryption you really don't want to store your encryption key along with your data that that would be similar to like your you use your key to lock your house and then leave your key under the doormat yep yeah that's a great analogy yes sort of self-defeating yeah so so go ahead so so the in this case I would consider compact with external key management will be a really important feature as well got it so sticking with the theme of features for a second is there some feature in DSC that sort of gets overlooked or that you wish people like more people knew about that that doesn't maybe get as much as much publicity oh yeah this one I really love that I guess we don't really have a lot of documentation about and you know people just don't realize how powerful it is which is this in the PSC's 5.0 ever since these 5.0 because we are able to allow you to use LDAP as external role management you can actually combine these LDAP external role management with Kerberos authentication so what do I mean by that is think about this and the typical enterprise like many of our customers they use Active Directory for for their both the Kerberos server and LDAP server right so everything is consolidated or the account management even the group management is consolidated so now if you can say I want to just use Kerberos authentication which is the you know really compared to LDAP authentication is actually the most safer way is the preferred way when you think about the deployment in price so if I use the Kerberos authentication but at the same time if I can actually make all these controls principles to be grouped together under some rows and I do not have to worry about assigning individual couples principles with some privileges within my database all I need to do is say I want to assign a particular role or a particular group some privileges within the database and the rest of that management is handed over to the Active Directory enemy that will be a lot not more natural for the Active Directory admin to manage all this like membership like adding new users deleting users moving one user from one group to another all of that is much easier for for the overall management so this is actually one of my favorites feature that I you know I myself figured this out like just this year when after five-o came out for like six months I realized this is actually very powerful I hope that I can help to to actually contribute to some documentation to make this feature to be more visible right so that that's actually reducing another place that you have to configure security is that right that exact that of having to go and yeah I have my Kerberos my groups and my users there and I have to set it up there and then I have to go and duplicate without a lot of that same work in my database now you're saying it could just all all that can that all of that user enroll in group configuration can just kind of live in one place right that's fantastic and it managed yeah I've worked that's funny I've actually worked in a lot of IT shops where that was sort of the preferred way of doing things was to you know you even managed your your users that were going to be used to do database access inside of Active Directory so I'm with you I've seen that seem that I'm in action but I actually want to go back to something that you kind of briefly mentioned in that answer and just to see if you'll if maybe you can kind of explain a little bit why you said this you said you you that in a lot of enterprises Kerberos is actually the best or the strongest or the preferred way of doing authentication as opposed to LDAP yeah you kind of said as opposed to LDAP authentication why is that why is Kerberos like what makes it better or more preferred or so-so Kerberos basically has this really nice design even though he's introduced in the 80s and then 1980s it's it's a long time now it does have a very nice design that one of the things that the Kerberos has there is that the use of credential the username and use of password is never sending clear text over the wire okay so so basically anybody can sniff the packet they won't get anything used for all of it okay cool awesome well this has been just super educational for us and we've learned a lot about security features that I didn't realize we're even there in India see and we appreciate you sharing your wisdom with us about security in general so what if we want to learn more my my appetite has been elevated here for for more security learning so where can I go what resources do we have available so I I would say these dense access tree has a dedicated website that's called security assurance so if you actually search for data stacks security assurance in Google you will be able to find that the decide so that one does provide quite a bit of a resources including you know some of the best practices and then even some of those our security stands like how we're dealing with third-party vendors you know that that kind of thing and even there's also see Vee sands and vulnerability kind of your last myth we have all there so that's definitely some some resources that you don't want to miss but on top of that there's also like our whole security section of a domination website as he has received a lot of new improvements and I highly recommend you to go there especially if you if you don't have any time to go over the whole document about security at least giradam into those there's a checklist security checklist they actually categorize this checklist in four different kind of the workload for search for real time Cassandra for a Linux for graph they all have some some checklist items for you to follow so that would be some very useful resources even if you want to learn more I mean that checklist especially I feel like that you know one less thing to try to have to figure out and we all know and we've heard of people who get creative with security and sort of invent their own things and improvise and that's almost never a good I feel like sometimes you do just want to make it as simple and straightforward as possible I'm gonna walk this checklist I'm gonna make sure that these things are configured correctly you know according to what some other person has thought through and and that really tends to reduce risk in a big way yeah and he won't forget anything right so exactly at least the important ones well where security is always a topic so I have a feeling we'll probably be seeing you again at some point in the near future thanks a ton for for coming on the province thanks for having me and thanks to everyone that is listening or watching out there we will see you again on another episode of the distributed data show see you next time see ya thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on
