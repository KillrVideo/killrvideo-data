    "text": "okay so welcome back here it data stacks accelerate here in DC and for this session of I'm with Patrick and Alice I will ask you to introduce yourself but ladies first from data stacks this is the distributed data show so I'm Elise I'm a principal architect in the AMIA professional services team and basically what I do working alongside with the other solution architects is going to customers and making sure that they are successful with their DC implementation so whatever that takes will make sure that everyone is happy so I'm glad to Callahan so I'm part of what's called the Vanguard team so it's technical pre-sales so I do a lot of marketing navigating the technical resource yeah so I work in the media quite a few years now yeah it's great to be back here in the US are the proper the sound or something that's very true so we all barely eat me and we will take over the the USA so we also all speakers I wear my jacket you don't you already did your talk so what what was about you what was your talk about and how this did it go well I think it went really well there was a lot of people there and we were focusing on time series and scale so I think now bigger bigger implementations now and I think the emergence of IOT and 5g and all the centuries and smart cities we're going to have this real challenge of data management at scale so we need strategies to not just the store the data but be able to retrieve it and how good performance not just today at six months six years ten years it's all about a model did you get any huge crowd good questions in the end yeah it was actually really really good to present and just see the level of interest in time series because one of the points that we made was when people think about time series usually it's IOT you think maybe you know LT data and my smartphone and everything which is definitely part of it and one of them great types of use cases but you have a lot more to it because time series is effectively any anything that has got to climb elements to it anything that is some kind of events that happened at a certain point and is immutable so you can imagine how many different use cases you can have without I think everything in the nature have some info that you could recall exactly so you track activity you track sensor data you track monitoring all sorts of things and so in the room there were people from all sorts of sectors telecommunications for example they asked for questions as well so it was some financial exchange I think developers as well and it was interesting to see how they really related to the challenges that we we explained them they were really curious and somehow the solution would work so I think it was kind of thought-provoking which was the point yeah sounds like thank you pretty happy about it yeah it's very great co-presenting because it was like a double act and I was shorter than the lectern so there is a talking less than that but you know next time I will take the Rhinos using my voice off and what about the conference overall did you meet some pretty technical guys in the corridors at lunch which interesting guy yeah it's been great it's a you know it's very developer focused a lot of people who just love the technology they're passionate and in a way you know having this event again seeing thousand people and three on the people go through camp and certification it's it's just it's a real fulfillment designers back you know yeah do you - Zi some excitement and everybody wants to share that it's going to you know it's been a long time coming it's PBC now a couple years but now everybody's talking again and pretty something at the roadmap 4.0 consolation there's a new data stacks products so it's been really exciting and I we have a lot of customers here for me as well so that's been really great to show off the product to integrate I think it's a it from my perspective I think I really feel when I walk around and I hear people talking and I really hear things like oh my mind problem is speaking out for to go next because there is so much going on like it's really great to hear that yeah and there's so many tracks so many such products if anything all the more interest exactly is making a decision maybe last question about the keynotes so you say we announced that a lot of things about the keynote today for me but but days were really interesting I think yesterday's keynote was more the opening statements and the vision where we want to go where we want to take the AC but also where we see Cassandra Doreen as well and how we can do that journey together which is really great and then today was a bit more about what is that actually happening completely so that I think says everyone thinking and I was personally really happy to be part of this kind of because the hearing what is coming up in Cassandra which is an incredible technology and it's a game-changing technology so watch Cassandra is something else and then you go and think how can we make things easier for people who want to use Cassandra we want to use the ax seed and that has been really yeah I think so yeah I think even just stepping back to Monday when choosing when the when we had the boot camp yeah and we had over 300 people was it yes about 300 in the same room doing casts on our training for exactly and they stood up they used constellation it's a constellation for a test drive as a start and it managed all of them still to spin up a cluster really quickly this is a product that is just coming out of the door now and look at that so it was very impressive from Apple - thank you we got very good feedback about the bootcamp and now the same force just do those casts on our certifications yesterday and today and we get pretty good rate of success so far so you will see almost 40 / a batch telling that they succeed that's funny well thanks you very much to have been with us to travel up to the US side just to be with us thank you look at you talking to that I don't tell me that a couple of minutes so I'll see you next time",
