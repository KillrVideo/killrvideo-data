    "text": "hey everybody thanks for joining today we're gonna go over using ds bulk load to estra uh things will cover uh four basic components of the bulk load um there's a lot more options to it but this is just going to show some of the the basic versions and using ds bulk 1.6.0 we'll also learn where to find the download for ds bulk and more information about how to use it and what some of the switches are for using it and then also show an example script of a an upload of some data and a demo of that that upload so just a a reminder that this is a knowledge share and uh future releases of ds bulk may have different options and different switches so um just be aware of that so you need four initial components to do a a basic load of data um the first being the data stacks bulk loader which you can get from the download site so you need to pick whichever version works for you whether it's mac slash linux or windows and download that and put it somewhere in a file directory that you'll need later um just to note here there is a link to the documentation which is uh really good to be able to go and get information about the bulk loader and a lot of the different options and switches that you can can use with it uh the second piece of information that you need is actually on astra and that is uh all of the the security and connection information that you need so you need the username password and then there's this neat little authentication package that has basically all of the other stuff that's needed to connect to astra so you don't have to fiddle with setting a bunch of connection options and stuff the third piece of information is uh the data that you're going to upload to astra and then of course the fourth piece of information is what is the key space and table that you're uploading that information to so let's look at the command that i've put together here and walk through what each of these different lines mean so this first line is simply where you've put the the bulk loader on your uh on your pc or laptop or server second line is the load command and where the data is on your local machine that you're going to be loading to astro so you can see mine is in this drive and i'm going to be using this citytemp clean file which you can see is in this folder right here third line is the key space and the table that you're going to be loading the data to pretty self-explanatory the next piece of data the next two pieces of data are actually the connection bundle and then the username and password so the connection bundle is simply this zip file that you download from astra that has all of the connection details and everything in it and then of course username and password so let's go ahead and run this command so you can see that there's this operational directory here and that's where all the logs go for this specific command see it starts uploading the data here and then i'm actually going to show you that location of the logs and each load uses a separate directory that has one or many files now if the load has issues with a specific record in that file it will write out a bad rose file into into this directory as well at this point i'm going to fast forward the video so that we don't have to sit here and watch this load as it does take a few minutes to complete okay so we can see that the load has completed about 2.8 million rows an average time of about 3807 rows per second with zero failed transactions just to note that this is being done on a a free cluster so performance may vary with uh different uh sizes of an astra cluster that you may have uh um have running probably get a lot better performance on a bigger cluster all right well thanks for watching if you have any questions feel free to reach out to your data stacks representative you",
