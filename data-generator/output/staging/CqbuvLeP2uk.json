These are a type of vertex-centric indexes, and are useful for vertices with multi- and meta-properties.\n\nLEARN FOR FREE at https://academy.datastax.com -- access all the FREE complete courses, tutorials, and hands-on exercises.\n\nASK QUESTIONS at https://community.datastax.com -- where experts from DataStax & the Apache Cassandra community share their expertise everyday.",
