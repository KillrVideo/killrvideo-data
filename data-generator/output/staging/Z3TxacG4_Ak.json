    "text": "hello everyone that's Alex Wallace Neff developer advocate at data Starks developer relations team and today I have a special guest Carlos Rowland yeah Carlos introduce yourself please from dead stacks this is the distributed data show hello my name is Carlos I work for the weekend as consultant American sultans and I've been with the Sandra for 8 years already so Wow that was the version like 0.6 or something like yeah 0.6 went life with 0.8 it was a long trip how it started for you how how do you started run Cassandra things so I went into a project that was supposed to scale really hard so we starting to do we starting to do some measurements and gathering performance metrics into my sequel and then figure out and then display those results in those metrics and especially around network bandwidth and we got to the point that our date ingestion about two billion in search today would not fit into my see oh well they would but they wouldn't get out yeah so we figured out okay we need to change the datastore and that's when we evaluate several things HBase was with you at the moment and Cosette was brand new but then we did start some testings with Cassandra and when 0/8 came out came out with counters and it was a go game breaking for us okay we need this because reach and our which our databases you have considerate because I believe you did some research yeah so well my sequel was mostly Alps because that was what was there before and was not dealing with it and we weren't still only like 10% of the capacity of the the product that was about lunch and then HBase was the alternative what I didn't like a lot about the sharding mechanism but I might not even understand no sequels brand-new for me I did three deployments of concern until I got it right so so age buddies might have worked but also Cassandra sounds simpler yeah so and we say okay we can scale this really easily so yeah let's yeah it was counters that's it I see and the questions of scaling queries of course like nobody torture is definitely so we are accelerate huge Cassandra conference Maryland you do a talk today yeah actually this gentleman has to talk in 45 minutes so I wouldn't keep him here for too long so what's your talk what they're talking so I'm going to talk about you Bri in multi cloud deployments yeah it's a really art at the moment and it's something that we start exploring like two three years ago and it has it was not as easy as we'd expect you have to be honest and well I'm going to talk about what is not easy about this it's like it seems like you know what we got Google you got AWS co2 Zune we just put some instances with connected Islands good no it's unfortunately that's not it no spoilers no spoilers but still what's the biggest highlight I would say of your talk so once you see where some guys vows will not attend at all because we're not in the United States for example so what to move what's remaining it's all about networking perfect nothing to add okay so now you work in consulting team in your empty town yes and you use it to work in management services in here so what did you do so we keep we keep buses running that's the same so consultancy it looks like what's the approach to get clusters into the perfect condition or how do we move into Cassandra and then manage services like operational actions yes this needs to be run 24/7 its mission critical and it's it's it's a really nice way like to do it's getting ownership and making sure it's tilted as your own yeah yeah so it's a nice team nice environment it's all remote which is something also fascinating first time for me yesterday River Jake we were talking about removing remote work culture yeah what do you find the most important in the remote work discipline is keep discipline is important so yeah because you are at home and not only your family as well and I answered you know it's like I'm at home but I'm working so it takes a while to get it yeah but I mean in comparison with all the benefits it makes yeah all right you're perfect I'll not take work back any time oh yeah same same to me for me that's like now it getting me eight seconds to get from my bed to my office that's just incredible mute before back back in Russia back in st. Petersburg it was like almost one hour daily yeah one hour back 10 hours per week yeah that's just know I always hated commute and I remember that I bought a car in my first work in Lisbon and I got the bike because bike was faster yeah and it wasn't the first time using bike in Lisbon not a lot of people did it I'm always against commute time like I said it's waste time you are sitting in a car yeah so remote for me it's how big is your team okay I have to are you in the same time zone no all people in wealth couple of people are the same time zone yeah all over the world so it's it's a follow the same approach yanti four seven support we need people every what's reasonable yeah that's the same to us biggest part of our team lives in a crisis in the United States yeah and me and Cedric in Europe you know it's every time we have a meeting it's got to get the plate but that's okay so for the meetings are the worst yeah as soon as you start to work for a big international company with headquarters in the United States that's just a question of time when someone will call you at 3:00 a.m. that's happening next day to me meetings at people saying it's dark in there yeah it's midnight good so everyone is very curious about reversion for that's kind of a biggest topic to discuss yeah there are a lot of great things coming but what's your favorite so I like a lot about so I'm an operator so mostly operations so I like the site cards in the virtual tables virtual tables it's for me really good because that's especially when clusters get really big picking up all the metrics it's a fun nest and all the monitoring tools you sometimes want to see like what is happening now and no tool gives you a more precise approach then so when you need to dive into don't have to dive into multiple nodes to try to figure out this is an old singer is the closest thing so that's a great great thing tell me one thing so fix me if I'm wrong we're all tables before you was able to get some kind of a data only via DMX yeah and now you're just doing the sequel query and you get the same data so it's way much easier when it was before if you care about matrix and you shoot yeah and now you can even expose them the applications yeah oh it's yeah connected right very query and you get the data so no needs to go into the nodes because jmx normal is tightly secure yeah so it's a great advantage yep okay what's next side card so the side card allows applications to not use JMX to extract matrix for example someone allows you to build holding for Cassandra without the worries of security oh of like j-mac security and my bat my baton this is allowed the tooling to grow which well we my company we work with a lot of databases and I see my colleagues like well we have this world this technology this for that and I don't have that much and I expect that sidecar will allow a great reflux and building of tools okay great so and simplify the life liked was great the keynote today exemplified what's about sidecars right okay and Zahra copy zero copy streamlined that's so that's a massive improvement really really massive the early benchmarks are showing massive improvements but why is this for me not the top one is because while on some clusters this will be completely game-changing and make life way easier than virtual tables or on some others it might not be that much so all in all the other two applies to everyone mm-hmm and wild zero copies team will be for everyone that works from my point of view will not bring been a similar benefit across the board okay so while it's a it's like the improvements in repair some places are doing really well at the moment repairs are the struggle a lot with it so it's those things that says yeah it's great to have them it's massive improvements I can say what for why I consider that so important I'm really excited about zero cover streaming I very I believe as you vary a lot into infrastructure automation and therefore out of scaling and the idea of you may for me that's always a big question how fast can you run and you note if you want to if you need to have some more firepower you launching out and then it starts to stream data from ours and you have like some petabytes of it terrabytes doesn't matter still pretty a lot and take my things yeah my testing a question might take days if I want to spawn some more nodes getting ready for I don't know Christmas I should either yeah a black bra black Fridays when I have to think like very a lot before wet but I want scaling to be much more responsive and the questions of time no it's going to be for those workloads yeah we're retail for example yeah the market that will benefit massively right now we have to plan black fighters head yeah all right okay let's look at what happened that's two kicked expectations and we scale the clusters beforehand and then but both scaling up and scaling down takes time and it takes a you and judo copy streaming is like I said say game-changing yes so Purvis wah and the outer scale ain't like me guys version force must have seems to be a all the guys are confirming what we have incredible score incredible improvement and the with streaming things so your work is a consultant yeah and for sure guys are asking you should I consider Cassandra or not what do you tell them then should you consider Cassandra so Cassandra is if for example if you need to if you and I veloci-ti data volumes Cassandra is a must go if you have scaling issues that you might like for the sort of like Friday scaling other technologies might be are yeah scaling Cassandra is that easy so that's something that you should always take a Cassandra in accountants and those are the perfect use cases like time series data Liam so there are and now with the web and the clouds this makes it all even easier yep like I don't understand why are you dealing with so you can scale your infrastructure really fast yeah and then you can't scale your database this makes sense so if you are into this there please go pick assembly exact here that's more or less easy to scale an application but if a database layer like we've a MySQL in my case when you try to scale it and then you try to shout it and then you are into troubles okay I see then next one man leaves one going to be bad ones maybe you will not like it when you should not consider Cassandra so Cassandra takes away a lot of the traditional acids so things that you take for granted to me city consistency durability and for for what we just talked about speed velocity ease of scale but if you still need those things and they are crucial for your business or your model is deeply relational yeah and you're not going to scale so that's maybe should stick outside of the center so it's not a one size fits all yeah technology it's a great technology but it's not a silver bullet yep yeah I can say what my biggest concern when I started to work with Cassandra Cassandra query language was the data integrity I'm used to be like okay that's what the user Vasquez contracts you have relations between them if you are trying to set some very odd for long things native illustrator will not let you in database supports where data integrity checks or I don't know on the leaf casket yeah all these things were so great and then if Cassandra you have to take care of it on its own but what surprise would have to pay sorry so you work a lot with different implementations in different deployments on Kisan of Cassandra and different new customers and I'm very curious oh no names please let's like but what would be what's the most typical biggest mistakes running Cassandra what do you guys without big experienced doom so mostly moving to Cassander without singing a lot about it so I had my sequel I moved to Cassandra cql is kinda similar so they part the model so this seems to be the biggest mistake and had a really big engagement recently where was all about so infra was good the configurations were good but the data malls look pretty bad and this is Cassandra offers a lot of help like secondary index materialized views and this leads to some well if you don't really deeply understand them it's really bad day tomorrow yeah yeah so yeah from my site I complete the can theorem usually events about data modem here that's people start to think very straightforward to feed but let's not like in traditional databases guys seriously data modeling course and Academy data structured converts absolutely must-have if you're on Cassandra like just have no doubts and moreover that's free so you don't pay for it just sign up it's a great one I yeah I do it I've checked Academy yesterday I see there are new courses I often take them like it's a refresher it's all good even if you are doing it all day exactly what was the situation I will call no names because that's not really a nice story I was doing some events and different companies and at one of them they were using Cassandra already for some years and so we run Cassandra day data modeling application development fundamentals and so on and in the end they use Cassandra for few years already and went it was like we were using it wrong oh that time yeah seriously just incredible so Academy Academy Academy we are almost out of time so I have time for only one question that's my favorite fun what's your favorite software back you ever encounter it so these takes me back a long time so really 1.2 2.0 somewhere around that so we had this massive already in production Cassandra cluster with massive use of counters in use to monitor performance with them and we did a rolling restart so we upgraded Cassandra yeah so we did a rolling restart of our cluster and then I go to our performance charts in fact Wow performances through the roof like wow wow it's really amazing well you're just dropping it you'll get exactly like this is like performance doubled before I laughter upgrade but the promise the performance was not monitoring extendable parliament's but the underlying infrastructure performance and then like that something fishy about this yeah I and then we thought well maybe some configuration seeing so we restarted some nails here and there well compartment keeps going up and so as long as the restart Cassandra keeps growing so and then we figured out there was a bug that if you restart Cassandra we reach the commit log and increments the counters again yes and in the opposite side was painful to get it back like okay done so we had to I let a net off at the same time to reprocess our ingress later how much time did you spend investigating that two weeks oh my god well from detecting the problem until we solved it completely was two weeks I learned a lot about Cassandra intervals yeah that's like after this kind of box words was my feeling we have learned it a lot today okay ladies and gentlemen that's Carlos raw Alex polish new thank you so my guest billions of us thanks have a good day today",
