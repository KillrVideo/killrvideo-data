  "description": "In this show we explore the options, paths, and ways to get development done with C#, .NET Core, Apache Cassandra, and DataStax Enterprise. Join for explorations into the code with Adron!\n\nIn this first episode I got into various different topics. The first was installing Mono, which has issues, then installing dotnet core which also had some minor issues, but in the end I got them installed. I also searched and found a library for random, yet realistic, data generation for .NET called Bogus. Another topic was IDE differences with the CLI, using Jetbrains Rider to create a console application vs. the dotnet CLI itself.\n\nI'll be covering this and much more on subsequent episodes, in addition to web development, and related all around connecting to and harnessing the power of DataStax Enterprise and Apache Cassandra.\n\n -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxadevs",

    "text": "oh hello hello welcome to the C sharp hour I am currently starting up JetBrains writer right now use yes is use markdown support on jetbrains hello everybody joining me so this is this is a new show that we're doing yesterday I did a kind of short hour-long intro to Apache Cassandra and c-sharp and thought you know how to make this a show because there's a lot of stuff to talk about with c-sharp c-sharp driver pachi Cassandra data stacks Enterprise all that good jazz and right now you can kind of see I'm just stepping through the process of setting up the material view for JetBrains Rider which is a dotnet IDE from JetBrains and it's one of the one of the hard decisions is picking which theme I want I'm actually gonna go with something pleasant like Dracula no we're gonna go with the deep ocean that's what I'm gonna use and set it to high contrast so it's quick and easy to point out things and then that should be enough can continue loading so we're gonna cover a bunch of different things on this show it's gonna be a weekly show at this time 10 a.m. on Wednesday pretty much every week unless something crazy is scheduled and or I'm out of town or on vacation or you know it's something like that otherwise I'll be right here talking about c-sharp probably using JetBrains writer or Visual Studio code or maybe even every once in a while Visual Studio so let's see it right now let's let's talk about what I did yesterday real quick just a few seconds set up a simple dotnet core console application got net core installed which is dotnet core to to same version I actually have installed on this machine this is an Ubuntu bougie version so slightly different OS mainly just a UI distro difference but it's it's mine mein de dev platform these days and we're gonna do some c-sharp development on this platform that's here I just get that set up so let's open up the terminal here one of the things I like about bougie Linux is it has Tillich's which is the closest terminal on Linux that I have seen that is it's it's basically like I turned to on Mac I always have liked I term 2 or I term 3 or whichever one you have that does all the tab interfaces and all that here's the so you can break it out like this I love being able to do this as transparencies as you can see so like I can pop that open do things and you can still kind of see whatever's going on in the background so during installation and stuff like that it's always nice to be able to layer things let's see here gonna get you a better view of all this magical interaction there we go so now I am Adrienne the host of this c-sharp our I'll be your kind friendly host with a few sarcastic or sardonic remarks everyone say well what are we gonna do what are we gonna do what we're gonna do the core as I was saying is it's gonna be c-sharp focused around doing Apache Cassandra driver work or work on the driver not particularly development of the driver the question is is what do we want to do what do we want to do this is this is episode 1 I'm gonna save settings ok thank you for not saving settings so the first thing I want to do is I'm gonna take some notes I always like to take notes so I'm out to the desktop let's see if we're gonna call this the sharp our episode episode 1 it can mark down because that's awesome whoops I have to spell it right or issue the command right I should say there we go and I'm gonna actually open up code to edit that it's kind of like how I like to roll ah stop moving around there we go it's a c-sharp episode 1 episode 1 of c-sharp our casts topics topics and tasks to cover one thing I'd like to do let's just start a new project and we're gonna say it's here she would make a console application or web application I think I'm gonna go with console because I don't really know the latest greatest with the web applications yeah so we'll go with a console application here put solution in the same directory create git repo C sharp F sharp VB we're gonna go with c-sharp not worried about that one yeah I'm gonna name it console that's your we'll call this data the maker okay just act I have down this okay so here's installing mono so that's one distro version get that 101 over here wait don't paste let's do this right get certificates mono then we're gonna get the key bottle-blonde and update and then add mono so this gives us some extra build paths beyond just dotnet core so getting that installed and then the other thing let's hear it oh it's and the.net core isn't installed cannot detect not network okay so go install this and then restart writer okay we're going to reinstall this on this machine we did this yesterday for the other machine not only takes a second here we're on a blue - distro let that finish that'll take a minute or two while that's running though we're gonna look up see your dotnet core data generation and library awesome got Nick or whoops well that's that's cool but I'm not looking for that right now simple insane fake generator JJ to general let's look at these two things packages matching data generation bogus bogus for dotnet alright c-sharp port of faker Jas fluent validation syntax sugar that sounds cool question is if you're done in standard I nest and one three whenever anyone 4.0 mr. James Jin food library you can use to generate realistic data that actually might be even better all right I need a whole list of them hey that's funny okay I don't really know what that does is that we'll keep looking at this one though see if we can't get this working in a project Gee's takes forever to install mono 81% let it finish look finish nope 92% still going so there's the dotnet core download location [Music] there is the mono project hmm bounced back to this just for a second while that's installing forever it's still going I guess I can start doing the W get I think it is no it's locked while that other things going town eventually I think we need some music the question is is what kind of music should we have any suggestions maybe we should have a audience music audience selected music I have to get a jukebox for everybody and then you can play the music during the strain that'd be kind of cool still nothing I'm tempted to kill this I just don't know what the deal is that's here net mono hangs okay occasionally crashes I love the stability issues of mana that seems to be an ongoing thing you know all right whatever I hate to say it but I'm a dude I'm gonna kill it mono pre-compile a c-sharp code analysis c-sharp yeah I just don't feel like I hear enough to this session yes please kill that one and it's still unlock bad burn it probably take a minute or two to shut down still Oh we're gonna do that let's do a hard reboot you don't have any bag bag fighter kini CI mono works on Linux - JVM dead by the way uh so mono is honestly it's barely supported these days compared to dotnet core dotnet core is the real path to take I just wanted to install it because I wanted it as an extra option so yeah I don't know I don't know if it if it actually installed or if it just flaked out or what the deal was but we'll find out here in a minute because if it was successful then Oh what's a writer will actually detect it she'll be cool so I'm actually gonna start that but also start up and get dinette core thing here work working let's pull this up an installer see what we get see we can do it this way but I like doing it I like doing it via the command line it just it just feels better feels like it's actually gonna work VIN that's such a silly emotional feeling but here we go alright there we go that's a setup mmm these bits running oh thanks for the follow-through day 82 welcome to the c-sharp coding our only got some other updates yeah those look safe famous last words let's install those while we're doing everything else oh now I'm not gonna be gonna yeah that was not what I should have done should only take a second and D update unpack that's the that's system D assistant D update interesting but whatever alright so clear that's why did that type thing sometimes I think I just type random commands because they're in my the back burner in my brain so let's here we have these and we're gonna add a actually let's go back in get jetbrains Rider started we'll see if it picks up mono so let's say new solution install it doesn't show dotnet core but it shows it's your console library get HD create a git repository that did this oh yeah that's right he wouldn't let me do it this way okay so yeah it's picking up dotnet framework blah blah blah 4.7 let's do 4 dot 7.2 we'll call this data day 2 builder mmm feel like I need to add another name element to it data builder Frank Oh actually let's do this let's call it Frank's data builder we'll do more of a c-sharp but your data builder game wearing out with 472 c-sharp great git repository that uh Adrian writer projects yeah let's do codes there we go and in there let's do Frank's data builder and nyan cat hustles up the project and do what do we got I always like to go in via the CLI just to look at it this way - Frank stay - builder okay so I did that and then inside of that is okay so there's our solution file user settings and then the project fall inside of that not too much nesting or anything yeah alright okay so that's that's where I wanted it I want to prop the solution name with the solution file in the solution name folder okay so that that works so I'm gonna close that for now yes I want to create an ignore fall Thank You IDE and I want to name it what do they do this visit net or is it oh I remember I bet it's Visual Studio no windows no that's a lot of good stuff to ignore but that's not really it Visual Studio code yes no no let's do that and then windows tags sublime text red car Redis oh let's do monodevelop - in case we open it in mono the monodevelop IDE that is and then let's do jetbrains oh this is this is so cool I love that they add they got this plug-in drop box not worry about that Caliban templates yeah man what's yo mate cover Oh bill distribute no modules bower components ah this is what it's like for visual studio we want that so then if we ever open individual studio it should be cool to a terraforming nor file that's cool okay that looks like enough enough of this to generate that one and then add it wow it's gonna be a seriously hardcore get ignore file look at that beautiful so we just ignored everything on the planet practically but that's okay alright we have this that's the basic line of text in here that's here right fine [Music] hello world okay and then don't forget the semicolon there we go and then this and hit alt enter and it added the using system namespace all right that's what we wanted so now in writer unlike some of the other IDs from jetbrains it automatically has a build debug and release setup for you which is cool and you can go in here and set various things it's a little more visual studio like but let's see what we have to build it with because it shows a little error little X there once it's a if I try to build it though it just a lot okay debug what is the complaint right run debug but hmm don't really say much about what's up there and that did run hey you ran all that stuff unable to acquire the lock again hmm oh that's right because we're still doing this waiting for this junk to finish gonna be done soon oh it's doing the mo no pre-compile so the update is working on that that's kind of freakish we'll just leave it running for a while that's probably what's giving us our debug issue here let's do debug and see what's stolen okay it's letting us do a build you just kind of trippy and the build completed successfully and does it run it okay there goes run it hello world alright that's cool so made a little progress we got our initial c-sharp application here I want to however pull in a library what was it bogus I think is the one so I just called so I'm gonna close that for now and close that so here we got topics covered what have we done so far we've got dotnet cores and installed but dotnet mono installed installing simple project started hello world works for dotnet for dot 7.2 so these things need to be over here there we go and then put up chromium again that's with dotnet data I feel let's go with random data generator there we go well it's 2011 closed yeah let's go with bogus I think that's gonna be the best thing and then also we want to do we want to get a C sharp data migration schema schema migration for Apache Cassandra that's about that then let's do this and also do one for see what we find for data stacks inter enterprise Cassandra migration countries is there a schema version tool for this yeah let's see what we find out there I like it here Cassandra migration built by the community here make 32 not sure who that is but I will definitely check it out two three and four years ago maven central deploy didn't really want a Java one simple and lightweight migration tool for Apache Cassandra database it's based on Flyway project Cassandra migration worked just like Flyway plane CQ on Java based migrations have supported Java migration interface provides a little bit ok it's good to note that Cassandra is not a relational database and it does not have transactions this looks like it is a bit dated but might be a starting point oh it's just doing it off this cql and I don't really want to do that cql schema versioning an example oh this looks like it might be a win human migrations developer guide is there a schema versioning tool for Cassandra there is a schema versioning tool I know this for a fact but we're looking specifically for oh did it finish yeah so it finally built that mono so maybe bag fighter we might find out if that actually worked so oh we're a is this the dry this is just the driver though right C sharp driver Quinlan nutnut right d SE do you see grass yes all that all that's good that there's the driver that we need schema migrator sequel I see like github online schema migrations for my sequel yeah this might be a thing to create actually cql schema versioning example Don Branson an example project to show how to integrate the Cassandra sequel versioning alright so what it what is this CQL schema versioning this is the same this is sequel merging example and this is cql schema version 3 together very quickly so career is bare-bones and clean installed then c c ql schema versioning example to see how it can be used mein all right where is come on I want to see the yeah might come I just have to create a c-sharp one ourselves maybe we'll do it on based on Don Branson's so we're gonna actually fork this my repo and I'm gonna fork this one to my repo there we go and then also I want to fork this cuz we'll take a look at that alright so a few few fork tree pose I'll set over there open this back up we'll go ahead and pull those this CT codes this packages actually want that there so C code it's clear list and get clone let's get this one alright then bounce in here and let's get those other two repos not the internet dropped tell you it seems like it does that a lot these days let's see the migration right now that's the gold library that one I got to get back to you soon because it is working for all of us though we may even use that instead of these things if it's working really well and we don't want to sit spinning away on that it's your dinette or starter kit this is what we built yesterday by the way you want to check it out new tables version without modifying existing ones right it needs to be additive for sure and not a mute ative process mute to take mutated process so you would even say that it seems kind of crazy you mutated yeah so I just want to get the links here for this so we got dotnet course starter kit right here just a little basic thing and then we have things I just pulled which where in the heck are they they really need a like organize your your repose by order or something I'm like of forks let's look at Forks I'll need that one we just got bogus Linux browser on under that machines Twitter coder swap teased a Pete I have a crazy amount of stuff worked oh there we go oh it's schema versioning example that's what that was called repose schema this one in this one all right there we go let's get rid of these and we'll little with the migrate later we're gonna go ahead and get into writer take a look at our stuff here so Frank today to builder programs and then let's get in here to nougat and I want to search for bogus from here yeah there we go so install this so I hit plus over here that'll add that nyan cat pulls in bogus and was this auto bogus complimenting the boats generated by adding auto creation in population in substitute c-sharp library complementing the bogus generator biting auto creation and population and capabilities locking options using in substitute I don't know if I need that yet premium data set for generating map data mapping location points of interest and GPS data for your applications UIs and databases that's pretty cool author Brian Jabez hmm tools analyzer auto generate fake rules for rules of C sharp with frozen analyzer premium data set of generating text okay yeah let's add this one bubbies healthcare yeah okay Hollywood what is this okay I don't care about that one taste it auto bogus mock country data okay waffle generator we get to create waffles I guess then fake it easy Australian electorate aunty strings okay not a time okay look that looks good so we added our audit in Auto generator in there here's our packages that config bogus boëthius healthcare bogus text let's see do we have got have some Doc's on this bogus dot health care well that's get out of here CenturyLink pile of trash bogus dot health care yeah there we go okay so there it is time to CLI package I'll get that way all right so I'm curious in the JetBrains Ryder IDE so this is it added the package is here right these are simply info culture description company okay that has all that stuff but if we go out via the CLI let's do a cross comparison to this real quick I'm gonna look at a dotnet core generated library and then we'll look at this one so if I go out into the terminal and then go into codes and we look at this so there's there's all the stuff there's Frank's data builder and then let's create will do dotnet new console sally's data builder okay that's installing let's see here I just started cross comparison of a console app created in JetBrains writer versus dotnet new so just do a little comparison here alright so what did I do that dosnt invalid input switch oh can I name the whoops that's what I need it's a dash dash name or - name-o - in okay that is that's a better result alright so now let's go look at sally's so in here super way simpler okay first off it didn't build a solution so you don't get a properties assembly and all that stuff I guess actually let's let's do this let's be more one-to-one so I'm gonna close this solution we're gonna say new okay let's not let's not do that let's do yeah okay new solution and I don't want do a have to I guess I have to create I have to create a solution fall in JetBrains rider which is which is kind of annoying hmm okay well well what did I do no I don't want to whoops so let's just open back up our previous one here back to Frank's data builder this window so as far as just the proc project goes though in this we still have our properties references simply's all that stuff and here we have this assembly dot CSV file here it doesn't yeah we don't have that we have CS and CS proj so if we look at that let's look at it in code talking about a usually different set of stuff here so our project ends up with a console dot write line four one and then the CS proj yes we have this and then if we go in and we we add those libraries to add the same ones dotnet this version 2602 let's just copy that go to the terminal add bogus healthcare and then net add package bogus bogus so you want to add that one too so we're gonna end up with a CS proj file that just has these two things yeah there we go okay clear and we'll do dotnet build that should just build clean there we have four seconds and does this provide some way thing premium license Oh interesting I wonder if I can even use these other libraries or whatever so bogus is free at least those analyzer how to buy and I'll has reset of frøydis hey thanks for the follow pic juice glad to have you aboard the C sharp our hmm alright so that's some paid stuff but we'll keep playing with core Lib and see where we get should be fun yeah no bogus premium I don't see where the the prices Oh quite a sneeze excuse me nope I survived alright so realistic but fake data it's a wonderful place but no nuts issues okay so maybe in the readme projects that use bogus graph QL library uh oh Crystalis did a thing I've worked with him he spoke at one of the dotnet fringe conferences that I helped organize so yeah I'll just look at those posts it'll be something we definitely want to look at to get this this fake data that's cool okay but let's let's finish comparing burned assets to build debug or missing from yes please please add that whatever that is so that's in there let's actually open up Frank's data builder in code also so here's the project and a console ended up in there we don't even even want that that's what I accidentally created so here's the settings for the user that's created the solution file is created um let mark place an extension for this search marketplace yes let's see what our extension is c-sharp for visual studio code right that's already installed face JSON is code c-sharp fixed format better comments extensions yeah why is there not a there not a thing whatever right back to this okay so there's there's our solution file which is written in some crazy formatting then we got our get ignore which we've created there's our dependencies are in our packages directory but then here's our project let's see what else we get with this oops here's our program which looks just like the one that the CLI created all right and then we have packages config here where it added an XML format the dependencies we have that to editor config to override workspace settings for editor config file I don't know enough I trust this one yet oh heck let's go for it why not right alright so that's in there and then we also have the project file so oh ho so what JetBrains brighter creates here the XML version of this CS proj file even though our project as you noted does the exact same thing yeah we get all this stuff so this is this is also dotnet 4.7 dot - where's the other one is dotnet core - - okay totally different things I'll be at the program does exactly the same thing and this one can't natively can't run in as many places on as many systems or whatever think you have to have mono or dotnet whereas the dotnet core one will run anywhere on any platform Linux Windows Mac OS etc whoo so yeah that had just boggles my mind looking at that so Frank's builder is gonna be a bit different than um Sally's builder I think we might might stick with Sally's builder for a lot of our work here but I also I still want to use JetBrains writer because it's an awesome IDE so we'll talk about it a lot more in coming days but let's see let's let's try to open that project file solution or project and then we're gonna open Sally's project with JetBrains render this window and let's see how that looks well one thing I want to do poop in the background because we didn't actually finish installing dotnet well did we yeah we did end up finishing dotnet core is installed why is version no version yeah - - okay dotnet is installed we know that's installed I'm pretty sure it was installed before even pulling this up but yeah okay so this is what we got done it four to two packages SDK so it just it just doesn't know where this stuff is managed NuGet packages see or what it does one thing I should go in here and let's see about settings when while we're at this let's change these to 18 make them a little more readable man editor general font here's you know okay that is 18 okay oh no what define color scheme",
