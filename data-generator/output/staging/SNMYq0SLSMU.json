    "text": "you know I I mean there's they're still in the growing process so it'll be interesting to see you know kind of hub where it goes I know kind of where they go yeah but yeah so that's been interesting - we've messed around with cockroach a little bit okay then you said - so is the other one the other one that we're seeing as an uptick in um like graph from dates now this is the distributed data show hi everyone I'm here with Aaron plots we're gonna be talking about some of the trends and shifts in the no sequel world so thank you for coming oh yeah yeah so you've you've actually been in the no sequel world for quite a while now kind of a bit yeah you have pioneering some of the things and yeah my my first you know real introduction to it was when I was on the cassandra team at Grainger well actually back up a little bit there I was the host on the web development team for one of their specialty brands and our director came by and said hey you do a lot of the database stuff here so I'm gonna move you to it to a team called Cassandra I'm like okay is that like  well you come a long way since yes long story short you know I ended up learning how to support this environment where we had Cassandra 0.8 running in production actually that would that was what we though that was what we had then and yeah yeah I learned on that for a couple years and it was around that time too that um I got my start in Stack Overflow basically was a competition between me and to my other buddies I used to work with Robert and Paul and and we tried to see who could rack up the most rep before Christmas of that year and I just never stopped doing it and said you know you're you're actually the top Cassandra questions answered on the board that's right how long is that how long is that been they spend like two years now that doesn't say I passed Jonathan so yeah that's that was that was hard to do I mean he had he has a lot of questions that he's answered that have been out there for forever right just keep getting rep I mean so that was it was hard to catch up to him that's awesome yeah perseverance right there sure so I kind of given this world and everything that you've you know been in you're now working at Target as what is the title I'm the the engineering lead for the no sequel team okay so you manage all no sequel basically for target that's right that's all the management no sequel services that's right target actually found me at at a start-up I was working at in Wisconsin called a key links which builds like CRMs for you know like special especially trade contact trackers like roofers and you know guys are deciding and you know so they can like manage their jobs and their customers read that and you know they had a product integration on the back end that I that I used to Cassandra to help kind of build out and so target brought me in as kind of a Cassandra Smee for lack of a better word to you know kind of help out with some issues that some of their dev teams we're seeing yeah and you know so I did a lot of like embedding myself of those teams and really doing a lot of like coaching on hey this is how Cassandra works this is how your code should work when you're when you're trying to pull data back or trying to write data to it and yeah and it just kind of grew from there where they're like hey why don't you run all of no sequel I'm like oh well okay right it's all the same thing right so that's kind of how we ended up where we are today right well very cool so I guess being in kind of that unique position where you're actually managing a lot of different infrastructure what are some of the trends you've seen in the last couple of years I mean there's been a lot of shift right there used to be like what 200 plus no sequel database contenders and now there's like what a handful there's I think two top ones or something along those lines it's yeah you know it's it's funny I was just I was just looking at the DB engines ranking today and I noticed that is all the way up to number four yeah and sadly Cassandra got bumped from the list we're at 11 you know four we got bumped out of the top ten so um you know hopefully we can hopefully we can bring that bring that back up you know with with our dev teams at Target I have noticed uh you know like is is our fastest-growing managed service that we have I mean we have people using go a lot and you know if I can quote Patrick you know there is it's because it's it's like crack yeah state they get them started in it's so easy and they can build something out in really easily but they really need that extra help when it comes to like getting something that's you know something that scales something that's robust yeah and that's you know when we we take more of a consulting approach where you know what kind of talk to the dev teams like about what their app is supposed to do kind of how their queries work how they expect their consistency to work and you know it's really a matter of like size consistency and and you know expected performance that you know really helps us kind of figure out which is the best one fortunate a solution I'm and that's the thing is that you know it with the way that we've done our or picked our no sequel products at target it's like each fills a specific gap if you will you know it's like if you take that take the cap theorem you know it's like each of each of them has its own little like place you know as you go around the triangle of the cap three room is it kind of how it handles things like consistency and availability and even like partition tolerance a little differently yeah absolutely so yeah so yeah we do have a fairly you know strong  presence but overall size-wise I you know definitely Cassandra is our is our top we have but we have eleven hundred nodes running in Prague so that's pretty impressive it's pretty crazy if that goes down its law on you right I have help I have I have three four other people on shore helping me out and then we have a we have a team in in Bangalore as well it helps us out Oh wonderful awesome yes and they do a great job too so like again with no sequel obviously that was a complete shift from the sequel standard have you seen any big kind of further shifts from the sequel standard in recent years well two actually one is that you know kind of the UM I don't know I don't know what they're called I they called like the new sequels the gigabytes the faun ODB's the the spanners and that's you know when the term is for them yeah cockroaches is like the open-source offshoot ish kind of spanner I've seen those take a bit of an uptick you know you know any any time you get somebody you know I mentioned Catherine but anytime you have a product that comes out and says oh hey well we can thwart cap theorem you know you can forget about it because we do this this and this and the entity consistency and you know tolerance and availability and you know they have some unique ways that they're doing it yeah so so yeah I mean those those types of technologies are game-changing you know I I mean there's they're still in the growing process so it'll be interesting to see you know kind of hub where it goes yeah I know kind of where they go yeah yeah but yeah so that's been interesting to we've messed around with cockroach a little bit okay we're trying to see what that can do then you said to so is the other one the other one that we're seeing is an uptick in like graph database technologies yeah so that's where we've been we've been doing a lot of work you know we we've we have a new 4j footprint at Target its I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's too big but even when we get when we get teams that that really again want to be able to scale yeah that's where we're Neill kind of has it's um I don't know it's restrictions for lack of a better word single single instance style neo4j community is that single instance absolutely and and you can you can cluster out you know if you have the enterprise license of course so you know we since that's a little pricey we do try and limit that so you know one thing that we're we're looking at is um you know building out an open source stack for that and that's where you know last month I presented here on Janice graph and talking a little about yeah well we've done with that and with Cassandra as a back end and then elasticsearch for indexing and then you know running our queries you know through like gremlin tinker pop and yeah building up your whole own stack there to complete compete with the big boys kind of our own little DSE but not really yeah right right well actually interestingly enough Janice I believe Janice and DSE Graf are both kind of cousins that they're our predecessor was light predecessor was tightening so that's yeah kind of a weird parallel there but you've actually done a lot of book writing too haven't you yeah yeah last year last year I wrote two books actually I didn't do much else last year other than work yeah so we're both on Cassandra or something more broad and in a way the pec publishing reached out to me about that about the first one and they said hey we're we're doing a project called seven no sequel databases in a week yeah and I said oh well you probably want me to write the the chapter on Cassandra they're like yes and the chapters on reticent neo4j and I'm like okay well write us I can do but I don't you know I don't really not really is good at neo4j as I am Cassandra and that and that's why they're like well it says you manage them on your LinkedIn profile that's room like yeah it does say that at my LinkedIn profile so I'm like okay alright and I you know I kind of buckled down and did the research on it and and figured out how to write a good intro chapter for um for a neo4j and that was really the beginning of my my graph journey if you you want to call it that very cool yeah yeah and then the other one would just Cassandra um I wrote the third edition of mastering Cassandra very cool so cool that was um yeah that was that was the rest of the year right those the the seven no sequel databases in a week published at this time last year and then I spent the rest of the year working on the master and Cassandra book and you know they wanted to have it out in September and and I was just over busy and I couldn't get to it as quick as I wanted so um actually brought in a friend of mine a co-worker tasia Amala potties one of our lead engineers over in in bangalore for target and he wrote he wrote the chapters on spark integration and monitoring I had her in that book so I brought him along to help me so you know tasia if you're seeing this Thank You bud awesome awesome well very cool well I really appreciate you coming out and talking with us this has been really fantastic you know it's always cool to talk to someone who's got so much street cred in the community so kind of a treat for me thank you thank you for having me alright so you've got some tremendous resources to offer obviously in your books if you're working people find those well they're for sale out there on Packt publishing Amazon of course and you know actually found them both in the in the Microsoft Store the other day yeah I I was really taken aback by they didn't know they sold books yabba-doo right very cool um yeah anyway um you know but for yeah people people starting out you know the seven no sequel database is one that's a real that's at a very beginner level but you know also you know what what I tell my engineers too is when they when they're starting out with Cassandra is to check out data stacks Academy because I mean that's yeah that's so that's really you guys really do have a good set of tools there for you know bringing new people along and kind of introducing them to the tech and you know I know that we've utilized that a lot I've gotten to say one of our engineers last last summer she's like oh hey look I did this and I got my certificate and I looked at it and like oh it's signed by Patrick McFadden I know that guy she's like what hey the spiky haired guy in the video yeah and that's something I've kind of told my engineers too is that you know what you're gonna find when you work or this stuff is that you know Cassandra is a really small tight-knit community I mean we all kind of we all kind of know each other and it's just it's really cool though you know do these get-togethers and get to see everyone and have a beer or two yeah absolutely yeah awesome well again thank you for coming this is real treat so all right hey thanks for having me [Music] you",
