Why are people using this in their applications? \n1:50 Adron: Talks about GO being a system lang\n3:05 Amanda: Okay makes sense.. its popular\n3:18 Adron: Talks about why popular\n4:06 Amanda: Okay so back to Go and Cassandra - So I know that the Go driver is around 3 years old, but does it support other versions of Cassandra other than Cassandra 3.0?\n4:30 Adron: Yes it does … but ponders on this for 4.0 \n5:24-5:31 Amanda: Awesome part of open source \n5:35 Amanda: Okay tell us a little more of the nitty-gitty about this driver? Do it also do automatic detection of clusters?\n5:48 Adron: Yes it does…\n6:40 Amanda: Asks about type detection \n6:41 Adron: Flows into automatic type detection \n7:47 Amanda: Let’s talk about the paging mechanism with Go-CQL? Is there something unique to the Go driver with paging?\n8:34 Amanda: Any final words\n8:47 Adron: It is an open source, and isn't officially supported at DataStax ... yet ...If you'd want to help out, there's plenty of TODO work and testing and verification to insure things work against Apache Cassandra v4.0. Some work that I intend to start tackling in the coming days, at least in an endeavor to help coordinate said effort!\n10:00 Amanda: More ways to contribute -- not just code\n10:32 Amanda: Keep following us on this series, subscribe, and see you next time. \n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "hi welcome to this episode of the distributed data show I'm Amanda I'm agent and we're continuing our series and application development and we're gonna talk about something very near and dear to Adrian's heart yep go and Apache Cassandra combined OC QL from Dan staff this is the distributed data shown [Music] so let's start this episode with actually correcting something that I said something I said that was wrong I know I know it's hard to believe but I said something that was wrong weird I know thank you I feel like I'm to the historic okay great uh so I was under the impression that there actually is not a go driver for data stacks or Cassandra right and I am mistaken yeah yeah I am yeah so they're actually why don't you tell us a little bit about that so there is a driver it's not a data stacks driver okay so not something we're always talking about every day but there is a driver it's called go - cql or go sequel okay um go cql it's hard to say that versus SQL versus cql yeah but yeah so there's a driver it's been around for a couple years okay it's pretty solid at this point very reliable driver I've used it a good bit myself it's out on github completely open source developed by the community developed by the community okay for Apache Cassandra which my proxy works with DSE so you can use this driver also with data stacks yeah either one okay great so let's think let's take a little bit of a step back so let's just talk a little bit about go and why are people using it in their applications so maybe a big can of worms yeah so there's a there's a lot of people using go for a lot of different things these days the primary focus and kind of origin of go is it's a it's a systems language around doing systems maintenance infrastructure type things okay the most immediate things that come to mind that that we're either written in go or rewritten from other things Indigo America's go is such a good language for these things is kubernetes okay Cloud Foundry okay docker terraform okay so you guess that yeah there's a yeah there's a lot of things that have been written or rewritten into go okay because it's just it's a great solid language for those things it builds into a native binary for whatever system you need it to run Windows Linux FreeBSD Mac OS write all those things and then it has a lot of very easy constructs around concurrency using routines which is comic threads it helps you do a lot of multiple things concurrently and wait asynchronously for different systems and machines okay okay so that sounds like something that people are definitely gonna be they're already utilizing and I'm gonna start you be utilizing even more especially with as all those technologies just become more and more prevalent in our everyday and at this point it seems to only be growing uh-huh sometimes I have a little bit of question mark whenever I hear things like I heard recently ago UI framework this is a systems language for systems infrastructure stuff right and hey if it works great but it did surprise me I didn't expect to hear about user interface programming would go yeah people are using it for just all sorts of stuff now from web development to services to the infrastructure of course but then also things like that and I even tried out writing some 3d stuff recently okay and it was really fast and really proficient at doing it so I don't see any reason go would be declining in usage anytime soon it's only gonna be upwards for quite the foreseeable future okay so let's get back to go an Apache Cassandra so we know like you said the go drivers been around for about three years or so it's pretty stable computing the community has contributed a lot to it to make this really robust driver but because it is so you know new does it support other versions of Apache Cassandra or just yes well that's a good question that you ask especially right now because we are bouncing from the three dot whatever versions to four Oh being the latest version and I'm not actually sure what the support story is for 4.0 okay assuming that it's going to support it to some degree sure I myself need to get in touch with more of the contributors and say like hey let's where we at where we at with this I don't know because all of the work that I've been doing with it lately had been against previous versions cuz it does support one dot X 2 dot X + 3 dot X version ok yeah it's backwards compatible but yeah the the 4.0 though is a big question mark ok but I'm making assumptions at this point and not worrying too much but I am gonna be reaching out myself to make sure that something is going forward and if not then I will be contributing myself awesome good good and that's the way to always think about open source right is if maybe someone else is already working on it fantastic if not it can why not me right so let's talk about a little bit more nitty-gritty about this driver so I know and some of the other drivers especially like the Python driver I've used before does it do any of this automatic detection around you know clusters and data centers and kind of all the things that I'm used to and that's in that space pretty much a lot of the standard stuff especially around the core system is there and I I'm not super familiar with every single one of the drivers but it's like the job of one that dotnet one it's it's pretty much on the level with a lot of that stuff some of the stuff some of the features and capabilities are a little different ok um issue issuing the weight issues seek cql is slightly different but you can issue that plane as it is but the detection of the systems they will detect your data centers your various hosts where they are that type of thing so it does that standard detection and the determining like how to do failover and things like that it handles that for you just like most of the other drivers do ok so anything else about maybe some likenesses we're on this automatic kick anything with like type detection or any of that so that's that's a really good one so I'm gonna tell you a short story about personal experience so I sat down and looked at all the types in Cassandra okay then I sat down I looked all the types and go ok made some bad assumptions and decided to write something that would map saundra types to the go types okay then I realized that the driver does it for me ya need that so I threw it away okay which I'm also happy to throw away code because that means that ya already works exactly so yeah the driver does the mappings for most of the basic types the collections and UUID types and for any of the more complex composite types etc it uses marshaling and like though marshalling capabilities to get those mapped across accordingly okay okay that's all automatic yep so okay so we've talked about like automatic detection of the cluster we've talked about automatic type detection now let's talk about something that we talked about a lot with you know you utilizing Cassandra Patrick Cassandra with our drivers and that's around paging so is the paging mechanism in the go cql the same as the other drivers oh we try to tell you a lot more about that okay I don't know in full detail how the paging works okay but I do know that it has some standard paging features like it'll give you the chunk you want enough time to display or you know work with however you want to so that there's paging features in it I don't know if they map and similar feature capabilities to the other drivers out there but nevertheless not something you have to do with that application right so don't go out and write custom code like I did for the types and realize oh oh there's paging takes care of it all for you not something you have to do in the application okay so any final words that you have about go Lang go driver with Apache Cassandra the open-source community any final thoughts that you want to share with the audience here yes I have a lot of thoughts but I'm gonna keep it to a few okay um one of the things get involved if you're using the go driver reach out to me reach out to people in the commit log however you want to kind of dig into it um I'm starting to get more involved in the driver myself since I write so much go and I want to get involved not just to add the new features but just to figure out who's been working on wood and that type of thing but the community is welcoming got a lot of features a lot of capabilities a lot of things that we want to work on like we'd like to get more testing documentation in there okay along with some actual testing of the wire itself there's also different little pieces of docks there around like we'd love some samples out there besides just the there's some samples in the driver like in the repo and they're great but never hurts to have a few more right right and somewhere outside of the repo maybe the nice dock yeah exactly I'm great to have not just in the repo but yeah and a dock like you said or if you want to write a blog entry or something like that that would be super useful because they just you know expand on the use case give people more ideas giving some options to kind of walk through a happy path and figure out how to implement with it and then run from there so get involved in it sound like there's a lot of different ways to contribute to the project it's not just strict coding you can also be doing other things around it as well darhk's coding I mean the bulk of it is working code sure it's pretty solid as is but yeah Doc's you get into the code a bit you could write sample apps or blog entries or whatever to help out the community in general so yeah there's a lot of different ways to get involved a lot of opportunities there to have impact and work with a cool group of people that's hacking on the driver cool well thank you so much so keep following us in our application development series definitely subscribe so you're always get the latest episode and we'll see you next time",
