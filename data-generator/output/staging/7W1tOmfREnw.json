    "text": "you test you all righty about to get started here last few tweaks of my interface so that we're not looking at all this extra craft how does that look for oh it needs to be it needs to be centered let me get that tada look at that beautiful beautiful beautiful all right so now we're really ready to get started here there's a couple things we're gonna be going over today and we'll take some notes while we do this and make everything basically if we do anything substantial which will be a little bit of intro code on how to put together a c-sharp dotnet project using the latest dotnet core stuff well okay not the latest on that core the latest release version of.net core against and apache cassandra or native stacks Enterprise library will take notes on that and then we'll put it on a repo put it out in a repo once we get it wrapped up so we're gonna do just real basic stuff here but start from nothing and get to at least the starting point of building an application with c-sharp so it's here right now I have Visual Studio code installed so I'm just going to work with that as our main IDE for this and then I have Firefox which isn't specifically the browser you'd always be using you know you might be using Chrome or whatever but I'm just going to use Firefox to go out and get the necessary elements here our prerequisites all right botnet core is multi-platform c-sharp for those that aren't super familiar with it you can run it on pretty much anything you've always been able to run dotnet on pretty much anything but it's always been limited with dotnet core though however especially with 2.2 and the latest release it meets a standard that works across all platforms so whether you're Linux Mac OS or Windows doesn't matter or as you can see below there's binaries for x64 alpine armed 64 armed 32 etcetera so even beyond those three core operating systems there's options for where you can run it and what you can build with it it's it's pretty awesome honestly I've been using it a bit and it's pretty quick it is definitely not previous generation net it's slightly different the language is still there though like the vast majority 98% 99% of c-sharp is there you can use F sharp you can use probably vb.net probably COBOL net probably the other dotnet runtime languages depending on their various levels of support but they're they're all there and available to get set up against Donette core so that's here we're running Ubuntu 1800 for Linux on this machine so I'm gonna go with the Linux and then let's hear I'm gonna I don't need to just run apps I need to build apps right because we're gonna build an app that will use data from Apache Cassandra or a data stacks Enterprise to do that I'm gonna need to get the SDK if you just want to run a dotnet app you can use the dotnet core runtime it's the same thing pretty much as what you have to do you have to go back to the JRE etc and the various SDK versus other options to either run a Java app or build a job at same kind of premise so here's our various distro open Zeus core Debian using 1804 boom - lets get a terminal out there I'm pretty clicky I'm pretty clicky the buttons are loud is that is that what you mean yeah my mic is right here Siri before installing dotnet you want to get the key so we'll go out just basically copy this stuff oh that's that's super interesting wondering if updates hasn't started or something I don't want to hold up the whole thing all right I just want to unlock it come on I always love it when it says something's locked and then it doesn't it shows you that it's not locked just lock that maybe the lock file there we go okay so we have the key now now we can just get out here start adding the repo all right cool and then we want to get app transport HTTP nice looks like I have a few of the dependencies already they want to do an update yeah it definitely looks like a restart is in my future all right I now have chat visible so everyone should see that appropriately on the screen y'all just y'all want me to restart don't you and then we get an update and then we're gonna pull in the actual SDK and install it you see the chat like on the screens because it's supposed to be there well maybe I'm using the wrong mic Oh me me see if I can transition tell me is to click any better right now weird the chat has a little a little bar which is super weird at the bottom like somebody could scroll it but it's it's not scrollable no not better oh that sound is clipping what you meant my like my keyboard or the mic test test test test test test is the crackle gone yeah so it should be it should be better now getting better okay if you're wondering I'm staring at my mic right now to see if it's crackling or whatever it's doing it's still quickie I'm have to fit it with it later I just want to talk too much all right let's hear well yet oh so it's actually installing no so you just did the update why why are you apologizing sonic dmg test test test test okay now get I'm getting crackle again woohoo well to fix it is that's some pretty crazy fix right here if you have a this error let's hope we don't have that error your guess no working on that right now now Phooey that might not be appropriate all right we got dotnet to to installed and I am fixing the screen here in two ways real quick so just bear with me does that make it a little bit better as far as font size it's like I'm hitting my head on this bar all right it's here I think this no that doesn't do it what is define preferences let's do this let's say term resize columns looks better cool all right oh and then let's do custom font and let's bump this up to 18 just for good measure anyway yeah there we go that's super way more awesome visible right boom all right I don't know about the browser though I guess I can just do yeah I can just zoom in so we'll go up to 100 something and I don't want to update Firefox at the moment you're working perfectly fine all right so we have this running now and that's you're alright so the next thing I'm actually gonna do is go out and get JetBrains Rider actually I'm gonna get toolbox in the JetBrains writer so you can do not net a couple different ways so let's talk about that though dot net create application actually will skip let's skip writer will just do it via the CLI purely right now so what is it lets your dotnet new this is basically how you would create an application write that new template Yatta Yatta Yatta it you give it a name and all that kind of stuff and then we can do the nougat to pull in the dependency for Cassandra look at that a minute let's see your dotnet new CLI our console app that's what my console I know they have a thing here yeah dawn that new that new console down that run oh wait let me let's create a directory for it first we'll put it in our new console application hey crutchy nougat our new console yeah now we do dotnet new console boom I just it looks like it does so much I guess it kind of does though so alright now we have our object directory a CS proj and a dot CSV file so if we open this up in code let's do that and we're where's our other okay like is this good enough so let's go with a few additions let's put a dot get ignore file in here then let's put a readme down in be a sample starter dotnet application or patchy Cassandra and data stacks enterprise description starter to her let's say with the drivers and assorted extra lateral needed to get started quickly alright yes store even though I'm on Linux I always add the D S store directory out of habit the ID a is a folder in JetBrains IDE so whenever I do use that you won't try to commit everybody else's configuration settings and then will fiddle with the rest of that a bit later that looks good so the CS / ah just take a look at that real quick real simple some time ago the net team let's do this actually yeah there we go now it's viewable the.net team opted to go with the XML configuration file instead of basically copying the nodejs style config file which was JSON so in that sense the CS project file has been narrowed down to what is extremely minimalized compared to what it used to be and it's now basically what you see right before you microsoft.net the SDK output type Exe that's not particularly correct for this machine because it's Linux but I don't think that's gonna be too big of a deal at the moment we'll fiddle later and then the target framework is net core app - - which is what we use to create this while I'm here I'm like read that and I love that Visual Studio code already determined that I'm using C sharp so it installed the plug-in for it back in here C is proj and we already have a console.writeline app right so if we do ooh the net thing say dotnet run boom it should build and then run the app hello world there we go success so we have a dotnet app running right now we want to get into your net core IG Cassandra driver and then let's your dotnet core data stacks Enterprise driver thanks Google for knowing what I wanted there we go the c-sharp driver let's see yep so this driver supports dotnet framework 4.5 which I is it on 4.6 now or something like that whatever the case if you're on 4.5 or better this driver is supported on that and also dotnet core 1 plus or round 2 - we've got that base covered covers a bunch of the features some of the getting started and what we want to do right now is make sure we have this and we're not gonna use PowerShell so this isn't particularly our command but let's go and see what our command would be on Linux so right here under dotnet nougat yeah push locals delete publish pack restores they should test there's got net build let's talk about that in just a second come on let's hear that or add yeah there we go so dotnet ad paste in Cassandra seashore ever required command was not provided on that ad oh do I need to add the project head Oh that project and Sundra is that the order enough dot shoot dotnet add our project is what our new console application and wait project had project package the tight package project file to operate thoughts not specify the command will search the current directory for one oh that's all I want to do package new commands package I had a new it Oh Sonny thought that I had packaged that thing right God is that simple okay there we go getting our package at it now so that should be in there and jump in here and let's take a look there we go there's our package added to the CS proj file okay so we have a Cassandra driver now now the question is what's the best way to write against a particular data source right we don't have a data source at the moment we just have all this stuff let's here let's get put this into readme so it'll be a bit useful started getting started with a chi oops GG Cassandra getting started with beta stacks Enterprise let's go ahead and initialize that to get our first commit in there get commit adding get it ignore whoops I'll get to config global user dot email if you have any questions comments or whatever feel free to email me Dave STATCOM get config global username I am simply Adrienne there we go that is add the rest oh we want to add the been an object directory actually to that get ignore file there we go um one of the other things that I often do let's talk about the dotnet build real quick if we do dotnet build we then get a build as you would expect right so we have no warnings no errors and it built in to almost three seconds if we look at everything now we will see let's see bin the bin directory an object directory in bin is the debug and there it is so the dot the net core app actually is that oh that's dirt there it is so so right now it just builds into a dll okay so the thing is is you want to make sure that you're not checking that in either so it looks good there so it's couldn't add the rest of that stuff and we'll come in first code project alright looks all good there we added that to our bookmark I don't know where that one that help talk was did we did that oh here we go that is the add a package that one so let's put that and I read me static or adding a package creating a application console there we go and then we want to get the c-sharp driver in there driver and it's pretty much the same thing for actually I'm gonna do this go saundra and a 2 stacks Enterprise there we go alright so now next step it is to get ourselves a database so there's there's two immediate ways that I think of that they're super easy to do this so we can go out to have patchy Cassandra and you can get a single node download it and install it and just run it locally right so this is a super easy way to do it maybe but it means you have there it means you have one more thing running locally on the box it's not it's not contained it's something that if you tweak it it's it's changed or configured per the local node and also you just have the one single node run it Cassandra of course is a distributed database so often you want to have more than one node running you want to have three or even preferably five since we're just talking about doing this locally though it does prove out that the application is connecting to something so we could just have one node and that that give us a lot of capabilities right there just to do development work against it put key spaces in it insert data a delete data that kind of thing if you want to move past that though you need to be able to run multiple nodes and the way to do that is at least the easiest way to do that is with docker one could of course buy hardware and add a bunch of hardware and have multiple computers running or whatever depending on your environment maybe that's the better option because then you can mimic production or something like that but for our case we're just gonna pull down plane all the patchy cassandra and install a node just to get started right now I'm go in here and it's kind of the same step to install it we're gonna pull key and then well that sets that in the list and then we pull the key and then we get an update real quick to make sure we're gonna pull the latest Cassandra when we install it we shall verify that and install Cassandra now down here it gives you a little bit of get started advice what to do and everything so you can make sure it's running by clicking that there's other various things you can do to the fright now we just want to get it installed and then make sure it's running what's there was there an error Oh weird you know I think that happened any yesterday but it still let me get to get the thing well it's it's installing so if it installs we're good good catch though I didn't even see that so are we starting hey that looked good no error so it's that easy to install a Cassandra node locally and then you work against it one of the things I like to use is beta grip because it's just quick gives you a lot of auto complete on your cql syntax etc but that's for another session right now we just want to see where we at with the console see if we get somewhere in regards to that so there's our hello world let's get a console dot write line connecting to to patchy Sondra I've been writing so much c-sharp and go I'm gonna forget my semicolons but we'll get it all figured out all right the next step here is to get out here Nick or c-sharp got here to the repo c-sharp driver and let's see ya make that one bigger we got it installed there's some our features getting started guide click on that what's that guy so that actually leads you out to the very short course do you get started with c-sharp and net um I'm not gonna create an account right now cuz we're not actually gonna go through all of this specifically here we're just gonna read it from the docs because it's kind of this close to the same time all right let's do this we're gonna snag this I'm actually curious what the build looks like if I change it to this so this is gonna be localhost and then connect to this execute select from sample table we just want to connect to a specific key space let's uh one thing let's hear no tool Oh gotta take the whole thing no toll status just to get a look at what's going on here alright just to verify this you can use node tool status to get your address which is 127.0.0.1 which is localhost I already knew that that's why I just went ahead and put that in but if you want to check it's easiest to do with no tool status you can verify it in the case of a lot of systems the node or the connection address would not be localhost if you're trying to connect to a remote cluster of course so you'd have to go out and verify what IP or get the IP from like ite or some support group that's managing your cluster alright then alright CQ LSH if you just type that if you're on port 9 0 for 2 on locos it'll just connect to that by default and we can go ahead we're gonna create a key space oh look cycling yeah my favourite why is this a copy to clipboard of course that's what I want to do I don't want all this stuff all right there we go knock that out oh it says oh that's gonna ok anyway but if I do that we're gonna use the cycling key space creating a space wait oops back this is a good one to put in our readme file so let's put that in there notice 2 status it's to build just to see where we're at here the name clustered is oh yeah I'm so used to my IDE just adding my imports using and then what is the this is this is something that should be added to the box actually so basically what we need is we need to include this but I'm not sure if there's a namespace before that so we'll find out here in just a second try to do it again let's see what we get yo type her name space that I could not be found Cassandra sea shark driver can't be found it should be there how do I have to do a restore yeah that's a little on the frustrating side let's open up the terminal in here do a dotnet store let's know does it say it in here and also does not have it in here that's your documentation I have let's look at these oh that needs updated so you're going to put addendums out here documentation taki documentation updates needed and then you're okay so that's that's good we got our key space which you just want to connect to our key space and then work to verify that console turn this he's doing is that different so you can do cluster dot builder at contact point builder just basically what we have I'm good let's actually change this to the IP well more specific there and then cluster connect demo but we still need to figure out that namespace so let's get out here and we'll do that so if regards our killer video Cassandra sample we should do to just look in one of these files and see where it's referenced okay so that's that namespace first David cash well let's see if we got it on our local machine we do well that's the all-in-one so that's gonna be a little different let's actually pull down this one Sharples and then we're going to open that in code 2 and then do a fine for C sharp Lib alright so there's the 3.4 driver there found the dotnet for mmm interesting as we pulled ours we're three point eight okay so we got a newer version yeah three done it for ya that's all in the packages config which I believe is the older file now I'm just gonna look through the through the files until finally so Cassandra search so these are individual maybe it's just that that's good with that one well terminal where are you oh there we go bear got net build type of namespace in a file expected the cs proj i renamed a suspected render right try to i'm gonna see the whole thing build fill so okay type it or namespace definition maybe one less semicolon come on there we go wait today it looks like it worked Oh way to go back to the regular terminal net build what's oh yeah hey that worked okay just had too much of a semicolon so the namespace is just Cassandra even though the nougat package is named something completely different so it's important to differentiate there so let's see your dotnet run just look at our app real quick make sure it still prints something out does not exist that is correct that key space Typho does not exist so what do we call it cycling I think is the one that we created boom alright so that worked so now my question is so we've proven that we've gone out and connected to the cyclin cluster but we also only know that based on the fact that okay we had an error that the key space didn't exist but now we connect to the key space that does exist but we don't get a message so the question is is what does session have in it for us that will tell us that we've connected to a key space so let's take a look and just see what we can get here because there's there's got to be something right so documentation index getting started guide was there anything here let's here so we can get a session we connect to the key space session prepare so this is an additional cql statement but I don't want to issue a cql statement I just want to verify that I do I have made an active connection and that it did work so I think the best way yeah there is some of the commands fairly straightforward sequel code that looks like sequel code see cql code that looks like sequel code so easy to say both of those exactly the same um it's here I just want to look at the session object cuz maybe that'll hold a key for us to get into real quick and it's really the the I session sit on there No okay where is yeah here we go cluster yes cluster keyspace gets the name of that I session her face let's look at this again prepare delete key if exists delete key space create key space we could create a key space create batch so one thing gets a snapshot containing information on the connection pool is held by the client at a time ah it's state let's look into this good state this instance instance so it returns an instance ok all right let's go with that let's do get state I'll have an error yeah whatever clothes killer video since we figured that out session and died get state of our result equals and then that result here we said get state which returns an I session this I session instance I session state type interface is get connected house get in flight crews get open connections turn type in 32 that's a good state static just returns this session well let's see if we can do this then do the console dot right I'm not sure right line let's just see if we can write it out build filled a new application expected oh did I miss the semicolon already oh those semicolons alright which which dock the data stacks drivers C sharp D s ce2 one HTML DSE extension skin state let's let's bookmark that too that's a good one for the readme is that the more updated one oh yeah cuz I'm looking at yeah two one thank you thank you for those updated drivers I also it's three four available oh look at there three four because I think that's what I have in this which is weird my oh three point eight so 3.8 are available and that's that's what aligns with the new get package so I'm gonna put that out there thanks for that catch I appreciate that very much always good to have the latest stuff not be writing the goodness only knows what so fortunately get state still works and still returns that instance so now we cross our fingers Oh success alright so dart net run and let's see what that spits out ah tada we now have evidence that we are connected to a Apache Cassandra node at least we have one open connection then we have zero in-flight queries so let's talk about what we did just now we got the Apache the latest base tax Enterprise Apache Cassandra driver for sea shark which is three point eight as noted we dug into the documentation there we also installed net core we use Visual Studio code do all of our short little bit of coding there and now we're up and running we're ready to write code against this application project to create a console app that works against patchy Cassandra or data stacks Enterprise with the data stacks Enterprise patchy Cassandra driver version 3.8 so hope that was useful if you have any questions or comments I will post a link for the repo as I add it actually you know what let's be let's be a good good open-source citizen here and actually I'll put it out there yeah I'll have to post a link later because I don't want to go through two-factor authorized at the moment I mean that clearly is something that I'd have to do so with that I'm going to sign off and if you stay tuned Jeff carpenter and I believe David Gilardi are going to continue onward in just a moment or two with some more good technical tidbits so with that I am out see you later",
