    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] it's Jeff carpenter I'm hanging out with Caroline Gorge in New York City as if you couldn't tell so Caroline you live here in the city that's right and you work for David Sachs yep for years yeah okay a little bit longer than me but who's counting really okay so four years of experience what he been doing with data stacks for these past four years or even before that like back up a little bit what's your background yeah so my background is actually a mix of Technology and finance I started as a developer did Java web iOS development before and I worked at Citigroup and Technology make maybe want to learn more about finance oh I did an MBA worked on a trading floor before realizing actually like tech better so then I went back to technology and now I'm date I'm a data statics of the solutions engineer nice so you came full circle came back to the tech world okay so even working for data stacks you said for years and what have you been doing since you've been here so I'm a solutions engineer okay um so I meet with customers or prospects I you know they tell me about what they're trying to do what's not working I explain our technology if you go if it's a good fit and then if it's a good fit help them you know do a little bit of evangelism education help them implement it and then hopefully they become customers so you're a problem solver essentially but you don't you don't tell everyone to use data Sykes Enterprise apparently all the time yeah I mean there's definitely you know the right fit the good use case for DSC and if it's not the right fit not the right use case we roll I mean we'll be completely candid about it there's no point in you know hitting your head on the wall trying to get something to fit when it's right there right exactly okay so you shared a few stories with us today we're in New York City today because we've just been doing a developer day here in New York City this is a developer focused event it's an awareness event come and get your hands on with the tech tuck technology kind of event and then hopefully you know go to data sex Academy to learn more and we've seen a lot of people here who are beginners with Cassandra and with data sex Enterprise today and you were sharing a few things about different use cases that you've experienced over time one thing that you the one thread that you kind of pulled on that I thought was really interesting that I wanted to bring you on the show and talk about is this idea how the conversation that you have with customers there's there's some themes that kind of come up again and again and you were sharing how like three of those themes and how there's been kind of a trend in a progression over time in the conversations that you're having with customers so you remember talking about this source so why don't you start like what what are the sorts of conversations that you were having with customers at first when you kind of first started this this world of data sacks and talking with people about Cassandra yeah so I joined data stacks a little bit four years ago in the beginning it was a lot of conversation about existing systems that could not handle the workload so a lot of traditional or DBMS a lot of Oracle where the data volume was just too much and so you know the easy approach is empty to a more hardware at the problem but at some point you've maxed it out then people cam thinking about splitting their data across multiple servers but that's actually really hard to do to implement maintain and that's right if the master goes down before it replicates the data then you risk losing your data so this is where people started looking at Apache Cassandra and data sex Enterprise because it comes with building replication so you can do active anywhere a multi DC replication of three per data center so if a data center goes down you still have your data available if a server like it doesn't have to go down it could just be down for maintenance or are you applying a patch so it's a scheduled maintenance and your data are still available that's just built in right okay so so those problems that you were hearing about specifically at first were scale problems well it was availability availability and skill so first yeah it was more well it's kind of two one is availability if you have a client facing application let's say the login page of your website if people can't log in they can't check their account they can't buy your product you need that to be available all the time and then on the other side is what we've been hearing a lot lately or I guess the last two years is about micro services so micro services it all comes down to agile development being able to iterate faster do production releases every two weeks or so and if you have a large monolithic system like db2 mainframe it's really hard to be agile with a mainframe and so this is where Apache Cassandra and ear Sykes Enterprise comes in because it's a scalable technology so as you bring in you know new services new features more data you can add nodes so you know doubling the size of your cluster you double the amount of to put as much as well as the amount of data volume you can handle okay so it sounds like the conversation started to change over time at first you were having these conversations with people about oh hi you know I can't fit my data base on a single server anymore I can't you know keep buying a bigger and bigger box so I need to scale out my my database to multiple nodes and that sounds like that was conversation one people started talking about my car services because what scaling out the application tier as well or what do you think drove that change in the tone of the conversation well people move to I guess it's going back to just the general architecture yeah of their system so going from one large machine one large database mainframe to you know web services REST API what all that micro service are kidding right right okay and so by isolating each process you know it gives you also more flexibility and then having a scalable database actually aligns really well with that kind of architecture is it is it easier to talk about using Cassandra if you have a micro services architecture is that like an easier certian point or not as much to be fair I mean you don't have to be you know you don't have to have microservice architecture to fake you know to be a good fit for Cassandra you could even you know sometimes let's say you're you're a telecom company and you do you have iPhone launches every I don't know how many like twice a year now probably you know you're the volume of the you know of of your website usage it's gonna double or it's gonna peak and so you need to plan for high usage so you need a scalable system where you can actually handle that kind of throughput okay makes sense so okay start it out with just I'm gonna replace my old large database server and then it was I need to break my monolith up into micro services and then you were saying that you've you've encountered a new trend in some of your conversations more recently it's kind of like that next stage of the architectural maturation in the cloud like so what is that third stage yeah and so lately it's been well you know now I have a ton of data what do I do with it so lately it's been all about insights it's all about machine learning and AI it's about don't just show me what you know my transactions tell me what it means to me don't you know yeah I know I did these purchases my credit card but you know show me a Tran of what am i spending my money on if I'm trying to save help me save something it's kind of like that even the recommendation engine right I don't show me what I just looked at but show me what's complimentary to it so if I'm shopping for let's say a new dress don't show me the same dress again show me maybe the shoes or the bag that goes with it okay right that makes total sense not that I shop online is nearly as much as other members of my household let's say but I totally get it I totally relate so okay so if I am now in this world of kind of machine learning and recommendations what is it about Cassandra that still makes that a technology that's good to have in your underlying data layer that helps you to build that out yeah so when it's it's flex like because it's scalable it's flexible so as you bring in new data sources you can add more nodes to be able to handle the data volume especially with data stacks enterprise we also integrated pouchy spark so you can have let's say Kafka has a message queue and then you can use smart streaming to let's say in which your data before you save into the database or do aggregation before you save into the database or then use the analytics you know ml lib to then do machine learning algorithms on your data and then in DSC we also integrated apache spark a patchy solar so you can do advanced search capabilities so now that you have all this data it's an easy way of searching through it and filtering got it okay so there's a lot of complementary technologies that are kind of in this big data space that's data space that are being combined together so the data is that a combination that you're seeing a lot kind of like that Kafka along with you know ingest data into Cassandra and then processing the spark I mean do you see that well you mentioned the spark streaming in there too forgot that but yeah yeah no so yeah we see different ways of loading data into into DSC I mean one way it's we see a lot of message queues so it's mostly Kafka I got to say on this one right so you know Kafka and to spark streaming into DSC but then again you know see QL is probably the fastest way of loading data so if you have really fast real time ingestion then you can just do execute async and just load your data that way okay nice so where do you see things going you have any any predictions kind of what are the conversations that you're anticipating you're going to be having next with customers that you talk with so I think it's gonna go we're gonna expand on that incise of data so now that you have your data you know how do you use it how do you get the value out of your data so more machine learning more it's also a great graph use case because when you're trying to match okay yeah when you have multiple data sources and you have different data sets from those data sources how do you link them together how do you know that hey this is my ATM card my credit card this is me calling the customer service number and then all of this represents this that one person right so it's a great fit for NTT resolution okay good yeah and we've had a couple episodes where we talked about that in the past you can check out some of the back catalogue for first some of those we had one with Denise Gosnell and Jonathan Lacefield I think so good content well worth going back and taking a look at thanks to Caroline for joining us we really appreciate it and for giving a keynote today and actually we're gonna take some
