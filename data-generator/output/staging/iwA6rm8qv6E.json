    "text": "[Music] let's talk about jvm garbage collection logging i know super exciting topic right but it can be because when you're having a bad day with jvm you need to know what's going on gc logging is really just what's the state of the jvm jvm java virtual machine of course is a virtual machine a real one that runs on top of your cpu has its own memory space and it's really complicated you can go into that in depth but what we really need to know is that that memory state needs to be healthy and when it's not healthy it can make your life really miserable especially in a cassandra node or anything running java because that java process needs to be clean and ready to rock and if it isn't well time to find out why gc logging is a great way to start most problems with your java virtual machine end up being something with garbage collection the gc law gives you a lot of great information about what's happening inside the jvm the first thing you need to do is turn it on because it's not on by default and you're going to want to turn it on periodically this isn't something you want just on all the time because you're not expecting problems when you do wind up having a problem turn it on see what's happening the things you're going to see are like your heat filling up and big pauses on the system itself so a lot of the configuration files are in the jvm options file and these are flags that have to be put in front of the running java process now of course you can run a external process to look and inspect inside of the jvm running process but when you add these options into the system when you start the running process then it opens up a whole lot more logging and it gives you more information in the areas of the jvm you're interested in for that dynamic configuration j info which is really about how to manipulate the jvm external to the jvm that allows you to do some runtime changes sometimes you need to just do it for a few minutes understand what's happening get out it keeps you from having to do a commitment of yeah i'm going to put that into a log file and if you're afraid of commitment it's a great way to go the output that you get looks kind of like this actually is exactly like this because what you're seeing is all the different parts of the jvm and what they're doing how long it took etc but here's the thing if you don't understand what any of this means you need to get into a little bit of the jvm logging in this case we're looking at garbage collection and just at a basic level garbage collection how long it took and how much left the system the big number is that how many seconds did it take if it took 0.04 seconds that's 45 milliseconds that's a pretty good long time in computer time but it's not detrimental we don't want to see numbers crawling up that high but if we start seeing it in single integer numbers of seconds like two or three seconds big trouble that's not okay so these numbers break down in this young generation space young generation is a part it's also known as young gc young gc is a part of memory that we want to manage the most when we're looking at the heap we're seeing those numbers changing that 109 to 142 that is the heap before and after sizes in this case we're seeing that number going the right direction it's going down quite a bit the next one is how much of the young gc space is available and we want to see this alive and well and moving young gc is where most of the problems start in the jvm heap and when we see that time to get the required gc done keeping that low means that things are moving along in the jvm pretty well so hopefully this is a pretty good explanation of how that logging works to really get into what the jvm is doing that's not this course but you can find a lot of information out there about jvm itself now let's try some exercises on how to use these tools to monitor and diagnose your running cluster",
