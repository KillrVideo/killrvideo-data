    "text": "in this week's distributed data show I'm hanging out with Eric Zico our newest developer advocate and he's gonna take me down the rabbit hole on lightweight transactions in case and robbed a staff this is the distributed data show so we've been talking a lot this month about application development and the reason that we were doing that is because you know as developer advocates were out talking to people all the time and we hear their questions and concerns and there are things that come up again and again right right so you've actually been on the developer advocate team for a few months now but you have a way deeper history in that with Cassandra Yeah right he gone back quite a ways so tell me a little history there yeah so I actually kind of skipped the relational part of most people's career I want unfortunate circumstance for you okay yeah I'm a little younger so I I got it in the generation right when no sequel was kind of becoming a thing yeah okay I went from you know some application development software stuff straight into like Cassandra started work as an essay for data stacks yeah did that for a couple years men now I'm here alright awesome so yeah so you've seen enough you've talked to a lot of different customers is you worried we're getting a startup program so yes you probably seen every problem in the book so see if you've seen a lot of stuff over time and one of the things that I want to talk about with you is about this idea of using like kind of like using the mechanisms in Cassandra well yes we have this problem of we talk a lot about data modeling and the importance of having a good data model and a lot of times people will go through and do a good data model and then the way that they apply it and build an application around it they start to sign it kind of stumble yeah and fall down and until I actually have this ongoing conversation with the curriculum team because they have top they have topics like batches and we transact yes that they talk about in the data modeling course right I don't like those are those data modeling topics it is it is because it's data modeling is really the fundamental way you think about how your data is going to live and how it's going to react to what you need so when it comes to batches it actually affects how your denormalizing data or how you thinking about it because normally we think about how am I going to keep my data consistent how is how is my you know table over here that has mostly same data as my table over here how can I guarantee something about that because I think I need the data to be in BO so these are relational habits by the way everybody like we have this we've been encouraging people for santur data modeling right your data to multiple denormalized table yes like okay I got you I'm gonna do that what next but then I want to keep it in sync across those two variables because you told me to write two cars by color and cars by mate and so I'm doing that but okay now how do I keep those in sync when I do writes at the same time exactly so okay batches are one that's kind of a data modeling topic for sure but then what about lightweight transactions yeah I need I need acid semantics on my right I might read I got that right now right language transaction I'm all good well so first off I'd like to say Cassandra is actually we see eventual consistency yeah it is actually quite consistent okay um tunable I like to say to the floatable exactly and you know at the right consistency levels of operation you're actually pretty good you're the chances of you writing something and getting something bad back are extremely finite right especially then you're losing like core money yeah yeah that's right yes yeah you're gonna be doing pretty well but let's say you're a bank or something and you have to guarantee like we can't just say pretty good we have to absolutely guarantee that we're getting the most current data okay because think about if you had you know someone like swiping their card five times and oh well they get charged twice you did not get charged yet what happens right we got it we got actually number one yes we got to have some solid guarantees so transactions are kind of the answer to that problem what a lightweight transaction does is it actually it's a blocking sort of operation where it actually locks the data across notes cuz we're distributed that's kind of a hard problem because in a single box okay I'm walking data I'm doing all right like who cares right right this one we actually to coordinate between a lot of different places in an intelligent manner still being somewhat fast and performant because I mean if it doesn't perform why are we using it right and so to do that we use things like Paxos we actually with practice so Paxos is kind of a common way to do a request acknowledged and basically one through a bunch of different steps like guarantee everyone's gonna be happy everyone's gonna have the same thing at the end of the day and no one's gonna be mixed up right so a few senses exactly exactly okay so with like like there's like a key word in light-weight transaction which is lightweight what is that what's the light weight all about right so the light weight so you're familiar with that like a heavy transaction in a relational world we're in transaction blah blah blah blah blah commit right right there's similarities but we're not exactly okay you know you tease out the differences here I mean with light weight transactions what you actually get is a a right comes in yeah and that right basically gets put it gets assigned a value and that value is used to determine what was for as if if you have like a delete and a read and hold myself hitting really quick off and you want to do a delete then you're doing a range query on stuff you don't want that thing you just deleted to come back that's right so the light weight will actually basically force that delete to happen before that range where you read it can read over that same data set so you don't you don't get the same data back and that's that's you know if you're using CL all or something you're gonna actually get pretty good data but you're gonna be able to guarantee that things happen in the right order especially asynchronous it's just there's no way to guarantee okay yeah that's at that quality that we're looking for then cut to linearize a little consistency yes well these I want these operations to happen in order but I can't lock across multiple tables it's got to be in a single row or actually more it will be precisely a sex position yes yeah right which partition can have multiple rows it's definitely scoped it down to that level and there are two semantics that if not exists yes like read something if not exists or update the other one is if exists right yeah and then the other the other one I've seen is the semantics of the if this if like if value equal equals yep inequality answer and I've used this for like inventory counts like if inventory count on this particular asset or product is for make it three right for hotel rooms left and that's what I think it I think there's four words on these left but right problem it's that I'm Elise Elise do we have open yeah what how can we guarantee cuz Hanover book so yeah it's it's exactly exactly so it's if it's if I think it's four and I want to make it three but it turns out that the database actually thinks that it's five it's gonna reject the transaction right and there were good people fall down is maybe thinking that like expecting that I can make a transaction that spans multiple tables yeah yeah when you use a batch you'd use a batch this actually brings up something I need to look up later which is if you can actually use likely transactions in batch because I want to say you can I remember reading about this that's right but I think it's a week ago yeah a research bonding for us yeah and we should run a test book yes we should we should post it later okay yeah there's actually some different consistency levels yes associated with transactions can very much are you like there's a regular consistency level and then as serial so yeah I mean get your normal Cassandra you're running with quorum in like ninety you know some crazy high percentage that we used yes right okay so to enable for this blocking of the things that need to happen we actually run with serial and local serial so the kind of the rough equivalency would be like quorum or local quorum respectively yeah so how many nodes and what data centers you're right right yeah all that behavior is going to be exactly the same as what you're used to with your quorum and work before so but basically what it's doing is it's saying hey this table it you know we're handling this it with light rate transactions that's how we want to behave here and so you get there's actually an interesting anti powder if you use let with transactions in non light weight transactions against the same table because you can actually get into this situation where see that same problem we're talking about from before where I do a delete and I do like an immediate read and yeah if I'm doing a you know a delete with a light weight transaction I'm doing a read obviously I could get back data that that shouldn't you know be there should been deleted depending on the order and when he hit the fatal ordering or vice versa I kinda already deleted you know something I was trying to read or the bad things can happen right so you know you don't want to mix up transactions and I think it's kind of more complicated the deeper down that rabbit hole you get right right yes if I said to say people can get some very unexpected behaviors out of their data set okay so your explanation is kind of go all in yeah it do it one way or do it the other and then just call it a day okay well do you have any other best practices that you want to share about using my transactions I would say really just understand what it is going into it know the cost I mean obviously when we're adding the Paxos in that death rates network traffic there's a cost to using these we're actually in the cap theorem we're moving from kind of the the fault-tolerant available kind of more into likely fault tolerant consistency more and and yeah the availability obviously goes down a kind of a rough number that's been thrown around in a lot of different kind of discussions then somewhere in between like four and five times the time to do one of these queries as you with like a normal standard query and obviously that changes depending on where he is we're gonna take a latency bit on right absolutely absolutely yeah and anything you anything where you're adding an extra extra Network hop all right yeah it's just way it is if you think about it what you're talking about is there's actually like two levels of two stages of conversation happening in the Paracels that are conversations between the different nodes that are agreeing on this transaction right so of course it's gonna involve a lot more network a lot worth waiting for right also go back and forth you know that said though in the situations where you need guarantees they are what you want to use right trying to sit there and do like a CEO all and make this you know crazy structure around it so you can be as close as possible to guaranteed consistency right um it's just not worth it when it comes down to it when you have something that will guarantee and you might even end up kind of being more performant once you're done building up a monolith um uh yeah so this is one of those cases where you know cassandra has some very particular values about what it's the pallet of things that it's kind of trying to limit to you right so that I can guarantee very high throughput and then we've kind of added in these little extra elements like light weight reduction in batches it sort of rare to get let's see two insistency yes so basically end of the day cassandra is incredibly tunable for what you need you know you just you just have to basically use the right thing for your use case we've got lots of knobs lots of lovers if you understand what each of them does you can actually make stander whose some pretty crazy things awesome yeah okay good and if you want to learn more about these kind of topics we're having a bootcamp at our accelerate conference so all-day workshop we're even come and get some hands-on and actually do some real app dev it's gonna be good times and of course come to the accelerate conference in May and Washington DC area we're gonna be there yes we'll be available to talk gonna be a lot of great talks the community we're gathering the tribe together again so come join us there and we look forward to seeing you [Music]",
