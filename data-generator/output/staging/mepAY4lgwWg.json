two hours workshop uh today i do have the pleasure to be with kirsten hello kirsten hey it going i hope everybody's having a wonderful day yeah hope so hope so we are back at a time friendly time zone for anyone uh india emea uh la time we should have everyone with us today we are together for two hours so and we do have a lot of things to cover so you know let's dig into it i'm cedric linvin i'm leading the developer advocacy team at datastax uh today i'm just a java guy so not that javascript even if i do have some knowledge a little bit i created an open source framework a couple of years ago now the rockstar today is kirsten yeah could you introduce yourself i've been working with apis for almost 20 years now um i i love uh great developer experiences i'm super passionate about it i've spoken at conferences and i try to um make sure that uh that people who want to use the apis get the best experience they possibly can because i know from personal experience how how frustrating it can be when you feel like you're working against the system so um and as you see i wrote a book on apis cool and you see the nice book from manning and that's pretty high quality stuff right manning is always the reference you can see here our twitter uh linkedin update for you to be part of our network you know why not um everybody is my friend okay so uh it's not only me and kirsten on screen as usual the for the world team is with us uh ending the stream answering your question helping with the promotion and everything here you get the full team yeah it's a pretty distributed team right so hi mate um so a little bit of housekeeping as usual we are live on youtube uh just on youtube today um so we are here to answer your question on youtube but only during the stream if you are watching the recording and we are not here to answer your question live you still have discord and the link is on screen you can bang this code on the chat and and get the link uh show up but you can pause the video and copy past pretty pretty easy to to to get that short link on this card about 17 thousand people on the discord room now uh to to help you during the live uh the links uh would be provided if you bang and a command like band tweet bang git bot bang um uh github but we will tell you uh each time all the materials are on github as usual but for the end zone we won't only rely on github of course guitar does have the the slide the exercises and everything you need to do but really is the the star the star of the day skeet pod git pose is an ide available in the club it's vs code in the cloud okay this is where we will do a javascript and we do have a very very interesting plugin called code tour that will guide you step by step how to build the app you know we will really starting with npx create react app and do the stuff from scratch it's a full app it's a full stack app so not only you will have the react front-end but also the back-end a back-end with the real database the database is astradb and for the back end this is something called netlify that we will explain to you what it does and uh i see that we have a couple of questions from the people uh in the uh whether a audience can do it and what i would say is first i think a beginner can absolutely do this but i also want to say that this is even more accessible than uh many of our previous workshops with the github instructions because it's got that step by step so if you get um lost or confused or you're having trouble keeping up just remember this will still be there you can come back and do it later you can watch the video um so uh it should be very accessible also with the self-service um experience so um so just you know if you're starting to get frustrated um maybe just step back listen to us and then go do it on your own okay right um okay yeah let's see how it goes let's see how it goes maybe just a little bit loud on the on the mic now not sure okay um so your mission today uh you know the title was how to build a full stack javascript app surprise surprise the app that you will build today is a clone of tick-tock okay it's just a clone not all the features do not expect to take over tiktok and be a millionaire today but still you would have uh a support of the same features so our mission in the next two hours is to build the tiktok clone go to production for free by the way over a global cdn using a robust and scalable nosql database also free and i give you two hours and so now it's you to work good luck i'm gonna just step in here to make sure i turned off noise reduction does that help any um folks in the chat yeah so looking at the chat and i will tell you if the sound is is better um so you will see it will be a step by step-by-step instructions and um each time you do something you should take a screenshot because at the end you can submit all the screenshots you made as homeworks and if you complete all the steps we will give you that's nice super nice badge uh you can brag on on linkedin on twitter or anything uh we have a dozen of badge covering multiple sample apps like netflix clone doing some java doing some graphql doing some some streaming so you know if you like the interactivity if you like the content today consider to subscribe um it will take for us about a week to get the the the review of your homework so there is no deadline to submit the homework but if you can complete them by the end of this week that would be better uh because we tends to review them uh manually you know on mondays okay all right so we will build a full stack applications so front-end backend and database three tiers the user interface is built with react the back end will be with netlify and that there is with astra it will be mostly ends on so kirsten will guide you through the git pod steps and you know i will take over time to time just to show you with the schema where we are and what are we doing so this is the scope of today uh starting the labs starting we take a few times because we will need to really start the the ide start the db and you know then we will be set and we can go and do all the steps building the react app building the back end with netlify okay so now is the time for everyone to start working so either do bang git bird um yeah bang it you know what bearing git board on the chat what i will do is also make sure i will copy paste that url for everyone in the chat um but it's also the url available on github so if you go to github here it is here is the github url okay now you will have everything on the github url you see this is what the application look like this is exactly what we will do and what we want you to do is first open in gitpod in a new tab or you know an existing an existing um or you can just click there it will open in the same tab so it it could take a few minutes to load you know depending on where you are on the planet uh keyboard may have to build the image but if the image is built others could benefit from from from it um if you live in in france probably you will already get the image built because i did it before this is what your screen should look like when the git pod stop loading okay as you can see it's an id it's very look like a vs code expected this is vs code uh and you know you will see code tour which is the pretty nice step-by-step helper that we will use today that will be loaded and set at the first step called astra getting started authentication right and and remember there's going to be a menu sort of in the middle of the top where you can choose the the step that you want to do so you just choose the first step it only comes up when it first loads okay so let's see yeah i see some git bodies crashing that's you know a web-based tool it's the same for everyone that's uh is there a time for git pod yes there is yeah it actually you have to start paying after a certain number of hours so that's kind of a problem yeah we are we are working with you know the the public a public github repo so you know should that be a problem to load that yeah try with firefox yes so are you still not not able to hear me yeah i mean hi he you i i hate you yeah maybe it's i don't know maybe it's a bit loud or they could check the sound level for me you sound you sound okay you know i'm not understanding what what uh the workbench is not connecting means uh you know it it should just load these okay i will disable my notification it it should load just this id for you pause notification okay okay okay so let's see um so far so good okay so finally we get some some few people having the the git pod loaded and uh you know the first step that we will ask you to do is to create the database because that guy will take a few minutes to load that step number one and so uh if you want you know step one would be to go on astra and uh create a database so uh to go to astra bank astra you will get the link okay so boom here is the link everybody can go there so this is what i'm doing right now opening the link astra [Music] okay and i will sign up with google because i i already have an account but this is where you can use any you know if you already have an account that's cool okay oh not sure was what why why is not happy but hey it's logging and loading and this is what it looks like so in the court tour you see that animation to to do you know to know what you need to do let me show you i will go create my database the database for today will be called workshops with the nes and the key space tick tock then you pick any region you like adws i know yeah you know i i've read that some of the cloud provider are not really uh in good shape today you can look at twitter so you know let's pick one that's i'm aware that you know i'm not aware any issue i will pick the aws for europe and but you know there is no change for you and you create a free database and it will still free until you use it you use 80 million queries a month that's a lot and those queries are renewed every month so before you reaching out the limit it will take sometimes and you know with that my database is pending creating i do have my git pod open i think it will be time for for kirsten to take over and do the real javascript magic okay well um so let me share my screen just one sec all right and uh so uh again this has sort of the overview but the steps themselves we had a question in the in the chat um the steps themselves um are in gift card so the way you follow them is you start the kick part i know this won't work in just regular vs code because we've actually created a docker image specifically for this with the correct versions of all the software and everything so um so my mine came up very quickly um it's still loading the the getting started stuff um and it should sign it doesn't yes it does okay so um i'm gonna select the tour to start i'm gonna select astr getting started all right so we're actually going to start from scratch um some of the uh workshops that we have uh people that can play here i'm just going to push this button because it's going to take a little while um some people have been concerned but they didn't really feel like they were building something um obviously we can't build a full-fledged application all from scratch so what we're gonna do is we're going to start with a basic react app we're going to build that up using existing code and we'll talk through that code as we get there so that you can see how all the pieces work together and uh in a moment um i'll do the after setup workshops um so did everybody um did we get a token subject did you do that part uh i did that back my baby you should redo it to have your own what i wanted to do because i have a safe token that i can use like if they saved the they don't have the same thing but if somebody wants us to go through it again um uh i report um if you go down to the lower left hand corner of the screen under code tour oh that's a very good point from daniel griot uh so i show how to create the database but i did not show how to create the token so maybe when when astra setup will ask for a token maybe you can show how to create a token please totally all right so um for anyone who gets lost in code tour um or the set goes away or something you can always come down to this uh thing in the left uh navigation bar and click on the stuff that you're doing and it will actually give you little green checks as you get through them so you'll be able to see where you were i'm going to go ahead and do an extra setup oh oh that's because i i probably hit return yes i did okay so i'm going to go to astra and i'll log in and i have um uh workshops uh database already but what i need to do there's two ways to get to the token management i'm going to show you one and then we'll use the other one okay so the first one is you can just generate the token in this in the little three drop down the little ellipsis on its side over here right so you just click on that and say generate a token and it will go directly to the page but if if you want you can also um go to organization settings in the upper left-hand menu down to token management and what we're going to do is we're going to generate a new token i just want to show you over here so in the drop down we selected organization settings token management and now we're going to select database administrator i just want to show you this because if you come through and do this workshop again on your own um it's sometimes people miss the database administrator is what you need to be so i'm going to pick database administrator and i will generate a token now generally you could of course use the api read write but um it's actually a separate api that we use to create databases and so we need a little bit more permission so there's three things here there's a client id a client secret and a token the only thing you need is the token all right so um you can do a cup and you can get it a couple of different ways i'm going to go ahead and download the token details that will give me a csv file that has the information in it um and the other thing i could do is i could copy it to my clipboard but what i can't ever do is come back to this page and see this token is this this computer this website will not show me that again so make sure that you're grabbing the one that starts with after cs and on the bottom called the token and now it's in my clipboard uh is there something i need to do to my video so when you say paste down here um it's gonna ask you if it's okay and it's okay okay so yeah let's you know let's wait for for people just to give us a thumb up because as soon as you do have git pod loaded the database up and the token hey now we can start doing uh some code because we do have all the to point out pieces um master setup is doing because it's basically checking to make sure that you have the database workshops that we told you to create it's checking to make sure that you do have the key space the correct key space right and um and so and then it creates um a dot e and v files as you know i probably know um if you're familiar with react uh react likes to have env files that have the um specific environment that you need for the application to run one of the cool things about netflix is that we're going to be able to just give that to that we'll find you so it's going to work um that that used to be a big pain for us so it's not anymore yeah so you know no uh no rush so i see question keep coming uh so how do you open couture because you know when you when git pod starts sometimes you need to go to the left side of the screen at the bottom so you see multiple tabs workspace outline timeline contour so culture is last at the bottom so click contour and click on the step one after getting started and you will see the same screen as kirsten so let's see uh so hd uh did you find kotor based on uh what subject said uh pending it's just your database um it's okay if it's still uh coming up um if you use the different name for the database that you created in astra uh in the in the website um then it's gonna need to create that database and that that will take a couple of minutes but yeah that indeed that was uh one comment we had in the beginning can't you create the database for us uh with the common lines in ion so i'd say uh yeah this is exactly what we will do for you with something called astra setup but unfortunately you need that token so this is why we did the account creation first and just so you guys know um you know we understand that this part is kind of grundy that you have to go over here and do this and go over there and do that and we don't like it either so we're working very closely with the engineers to try to come up with a way where we can get that token for you uh more more um automatically so that you can just get to the doing of the stuff instead of setting it up all right do you think we're ready to move um you know don't want to rush so hey uh so if you if you catch up if you know you are ready please tell uh tell us um you know tell us if you're okay so the the key space name is tiktok yes sumit uh told us he's okay no it's not what's the key spacing that's what's a key space and that's how we organize our tables um it's kind of the same as a database in other systems um so um let's see gallups okay so the db name is workshops so reading the comments it seems like people are creating the still creating the db uh and you know that that's fine you know we we are not uh you know that's not really the first step that is important and you will see then it will be mostly click click click we will just read the instruction even maybe too simple but it will do a lot for you yes and mostly what we're here to do is kind of guide you through you know what's happening and why so somebody asked if we could go through generated token again so i'm gonna go uh the first way was through the organization menu here but i'm going to show you the other way which which you probably would use when you need them is you're going to go and generate a token now um some of you may have generated a token and not saved it and now you don't have access to it anymore um if you create another token it's not going to make your first token stop working you can have as many tokens as you want as you see i have a lot so um we're gonna do a database administrator uh again um and then uh and then just click on generate token again we're either going to actually i suggest that you do both download the token details to that csv file or and and copy it to your clipboard right so once it's copied to your clipboard um you can go back to code tour uh you'll just paste it in on the uh where it says paste the database admin here and uh and you should be good uh the dp name uh it does not need to be specific um in fact it's kind of good especially if you're going to do more of these workshops with us um you're only allowed to have five databases uh in the fridge here and um but you can have a million pieces so we can just use the workshops database for all of our uh up your workshops and thus we can you know avoid um messing with the capacity pad for other stuff okay okay now first question uh fatal past spec yarn.lock did not match any file uh setting the git um yeah that's maybe that's just the one that maybe yeah maybe that's just a warning let's see how it goes yeah okay so um i think it seems like everybody's uh doing well and possibly uh ahead of us um uh hde we don't actually have another version of these instruments yeah that's just a warning this is what i expected yeah and we will delete that that log file i think kirsten did a comment just remove all right look all right so um now i'm going to set up git so um i i should just make a little script that does this so basically i'm thinking about channeling it my email is ticktalk example.com obviously it's not um and username is ticktalk so um i'm not if you look down here at the bottom of the of the screen i'm in the workspace after tiptop directory and that was created by the react um create react app um but it's not yet uh under source control so i'm gonna go ahead and do a get in it and we're gonna change the master branch to main because master is a word that we're trying to move away from um and i'm gonna add all the files and except i'm going to um remove ah oh i see uh you took out yarn so that step is it's not right anymore ah it it was that it's because you took out the yarn and then um hit commit uh that's a m initial submit okay so now you have a git repository with all your code uh in there all right uh let me uh okay good yeah again yeah let you know let's suppose because yeah this is where we just remove the yarn.lock and then we will commit and if you do have some no you should have any issue with the initial commit no no that's that's okay no it should be good but the github parts a little bit more tricky so yeah that's that's 1.3 where where we there is a little bit more information uh i think yeah copy the code to remove yarn.log yeah yeah you know uh with kotor you really just have to click on the lines in blue and they will be executed on the terminal that's the magic of this new way to deal to deliver workshop you don't even have to copy paste it just click and the instruction will execute all right so um uh it looks like it seems like people are still uh working on the get part um so i don't know should we go ahead and do the github part or should we move past it uh as of now i i do have a lot of uh thank you and thank you so i i think people catching up yeah yeah but keep going with the question i'm here to answer uh david as well we can pose you know we we do have time the setup is always the the trickiest part yeah so now um what we're gonna do here is we're gonna create a github repository um that that is the remote for your repository that we're just sitting in here um in your workspace so that means that tomorrow next week next year next month whatever um you can get back to this this uh repository that you created and um and get to it on github so the first thing you need to do is you need to do an off login um so i click the button and down here it says what account do you want to log into i want to log into github.com i would like to use https this is just defaults authenticate git with your github credentials yes login with a web browser copy my one-time code yeah okay so for this one i actually we need to go directly to the off website so as you see it's got the answers for all of those questions but the next thing you need to do is go directly to the off website um off websites do not like to work in get fun because they don't want to be in a in a box because they just never so um so what's really cool about this login is that so i it just popped up and you know it's supposed to pop up a browser but it tries to go in the id and that doesn't work but i'm going to press enter to continue and you can see it's all done i'm now authenticated to github so i can create a repository it's going to say hey what do you want to call it well hey let's call it ask talk to because i'm pretty sure i already have a one and then uh i'm not gonna put a description i want it to be public and yes i would like it to be origin that's what we usually work with for uh our github repositories so now there there is a repository on you know we can see that we can go to um to github and stories [Music] there's nothing in there right i created a repository but i didn't actually push stuff so i need to get the comments that i have of my react starter app out to get so to do that i do get push actually i will i will i'll do the clicky thing because it's nice okay so it's done right so now i have a copy and we can go and we can double check that right we can look at that repository that we created and it's it's got all the things okay so excellent excellent um so how's everyone dealing with that it doesn't matter um yeah it doesn't matter if you use that example for the email it's it's just um it's just forget it's fine yeah the git config git git description in step 1.2 git config global username git conf email it's just like some comments you know it's not really important this is not what makes you authenticate against github not just some settings we don't really care but need it to be there for getting it yeah because if you use um get to push things to your github um and you don't have those set then it'll complain and that's annoying so basically we basically gave it a pacifier so it wouldn't be said um uh oh um uh where's the fondos document frederick i suspect that's the issue that stefano ran into with the permission being denied okay so if you got permission denied on public repo this is uh what is written exactly on step three with the the ball text starting like if you got git push origin main command or you should and it will explain you that you need to allow git pod to uh interact with github public repo and so you do have the step by step that's really go to the permission panel on the top lower hand corner and you know go to git pod web yeah um do we have that document somewhere that people can look at or like that's that's totally written at the bottom of the of the of the screen right now on top of in front of you if you got i i i had it lately in the in there just for you to have exactly what you need to do to enable github there um for git config just click git config nothing to change i would the resources for the class are on github so bank github and you will get the link with the resources but just github won't give you anything you really need to run that in the environment uh gitbuddy oh he wants me to bank yeah i keep saying bank we got the permission panel um yes so the lower part in git pod that's really the the wheel the real really at the in the corner left or this thing yeah yeah okay let me oh that doesn't tell me anything i mean it's like there's no permission panel with what button yes yeah but you know that that's cool because then you know people can can can catch up i'm just looking for for the link here with the permission um yes that's where it is okay so yeah you know yeah this is really good uh on the little person the little person button on the lower left hand side see where i am here um i'm going to open access control and it's going to go to uh you'll notice this is getpod.io so you're actually changing your configuration in git pod not github they're separate um and so you can see that i have public repo and user email um i'm going to edit permissions and if you do not have public repo selected then it will not work so select public repo update the permissions and you should be good to go all right yeah again when when did you go to show the integration ui you know um where is the link to to show up this github okay worked okay nice seems like yeah no people are with them you need to change the wording here because it's not the first step yeah maybe we can also add some pictures for but this sure also why we no this is also why we are here right because otherwise you just service and you run that without us and it's just sad all right so now we're to the next step and that is what we're going to do here is we're going to pull in some code um we're going to first we're going to sort of sanitize the default react application by taking out stuff that we're not going to use so if you look at the code here you'll see um we're using report web vitals and then we call it down here that that's not useful for us we don't really want to do report web files so now i'm going to insert code and you see that it's the same but it doesn't have those two things right so in order to make that change you just click on the insert code button and it will replace the code yes okay we're gonna do the same thing with app.js so app.js um basically what this is is it's the react logo and um and some helpful stuff but we really just want to start from scratch here we don't want to start with their stuff we just want to start with the basic so it's just and and uh let me um just real quick um show you um i i was going to make a picture for react and we actually have a react getting started so when you go to react application it calls index.um and index.js is used to inject content into the html file so that's what it's going to do it's going to um take the element by id root of index.html and it's going to show this app in it but the app doesn't do anything yet react is made of components there's lots of different components and you build them all together like you're building with legos and that's how you create your application so in this case this is a very very simple component it basically has nothing but that's fine we're going to add to it later but this is kind of you're going to see a lot of this we have a lot of components that we're going to be working with how do i choose here i'm not sure douglas i'm not sure what you uh are looking at but in the meantime i'll click this button so we're going to get a react router and what that's going to do is it's going to do the routing for the endpoints so we're going to have um we're going to have some serverless functions we're going to have a home page and an upload page so we first have to install the uh sure go back to how to insert code um i can't do it again because okay messed up but um on the app.js and the index.js it's got the code in the step and then you just click on insert code all right okay uh christopher if you've gone to the authentication uh step in your code tour which is right here there's actually a little video and if you run at the astra setup workshops tick tock it will give you the instructions on how to get the token all right so what we're going to do now is we are going to um copy in some updated versions of our files so i'm going to do that copy let's check and make sure everyone's leave us i see i see somebody still with the tokens uh i believe you you just need to save settings and then go back to the other podcast uh you want to log into github repository it's it's on the uh it's in the stacks there douglas now just i just say after inserting code uh at the bottom of each page there is some next so you say go next step two to go to yeah the nexus and the other thing is there's also some navigation on the top of those so if you're not at the bottom of the of the set that works as well okay so uh we're gonna go ahead and import the routing and switching uh functions and we're gonna put a header in there and then we're gonna set up in the switch we're going to go ahead and set up routes for the home and upload video so if you just go to the base path you'll get the component is home and if you go to upload you'll get the upload component so it looks as you see here we have um we're going to import the home component from pages home we're going to import the upload component from pages upload and we're going to import the header note it's not pages header because it's not a page it's it's a component that we're going to use in a page so that we have those in components so again oh and uh good to notice when you're using uh the hashtag with the switch um the first match wins so what would happen if i put these in the opposite way so we had home first and then upload is that everything would go to home because upload would come through it would match the slash and we'd off we'd do it at home nobody would ever be able to get to upload so you always want to have your more specific things before your journey just fun stuff happening in the chat you know okay um so if we're gonna add a header that's gonna be consistent for the upload page home page and that's what we want um then we need to add some content to the components we need a followers column column where we can see people that we're currently following and then we're going to have a feed and a little box of suggested accounts so we need to install some more libraries ah let's see looks like we're all doing okay um douglas the instructions are in the steps in code it tells you how to answer each of those questions um um uh this one cheat um we have lots of different workshops we actually uh have a fairly simple one on github that does react basics which is a great place to start and almost all of our current um workshops do use astrophobia node and react so as you follow along you'll learn more stuff okay let's look at the header well it's just a really basic header right all we need right now is to know that we've got the header there um it's got an h1 element with header in it and so here this this actually shows you um remember we included the header in um an earlier file and this has a return so what this component is doing is you're defining the component and return is what's going to be shoved into the page at that point okay uh and then followers same thing really what we're doing is we're kind of making sure that our layout works correctly so we're styling with css so we have the followers column and as you can see we've made this um a very um bright and colorful uh layout but that's just so we can make sure the css is working the way we want it to right so we're going to have a yellow header that's going to be a red followers column and a blue suggested box so we're putting the followers column into our home duplex page so the first thing we do up here import followers column from components followers column um you're always going to need to import those those components so that you can use them in the files and here we have followers pane and um that's what we're doing and then uh you can look at it but basically this is the other page we have the home page and we have upload.js and when we go to upload.js it'll allow us to upload a video to our system all right um well actually we're just about to get to that network that part wow i know if i don't actually work now but um let's uh let's get this set up so that we can we can get our our netlify working so netlify is uh a cdn a content delivery network but what's really cool about them is that they support serverless functions and uh and that means that you it's just like lambda in fact on the back end it really it just is aws lambda so you can create little captions but you don't have to host them on a server so we're going to go ahead and copy the netify.com and if you're curious about netlify.com basically when i say that if i build what i mean is npm run build keeping my functions in a functions directory and when i say publish i rebuild so um so you know it's not a very complicated little guy but all right and so you can see i i lost my stamp but i can hand it back by using the left navigation okay so we're going to create a new network site based on your git repository note that this is actually based on the git repository that you're sitting in and not the github one that you have you know you know just then just i think um now just before creating the netlify site uh would be the time for me just to show the slide uh just to see what we did with the database what we imported while we set up and we go back we had the netflix fixed site okay what's going on in there yeah let me let me let me take over here any indeed so let me oh i have someone right no i think it can take over you know do not worry i think i'm sharing now uh just wait for youtube to update come on yeah okay so um i know it's it's a bit of magic you just click and click and click and the code happen and so so what happened under the hood so the first things we did was to create the the database the database is called astradb and the ask the database is based on apache cassandra it's just it's a nosql database but these database provide a set of apis rest graphql apis so because we are building a front-end app we want to use the rest api so um this is here in in yellow what we call stargate exposing some rest api this is what we want to to use to connect to the database okay so you created the db and you do have that running then we created an empty react app okay in git here we are in the middle we just say npx create app we do have an empty app then we did astra setup when we did astra setup and provided a token what what the the script did was to retrieve all the values from the database so if the database is up if not i create one what is the key space create the key space tick tock if needed and set up the app the connect setup the connection from the app to the database if you look at your git pod right now and try to look for a file called dot of you will see that there you find all the credentials for you to connect to astradibi okay so this is what we did then all the steps were really to update the indexed or files to create some root division on the ui and remove all the defaults that we don't need so we do have like a first screen everything needed to connect to the database uh but nothing in between so it's like we do have the front end we do have the database ready but we need something in between for the front end to to communicate to to astradibi uh not interacting directly with the database because we don't want to expose the the credentials over internet you know you really need a dedicated end and so this deity but they get dedicated back-end for today won't be expressed won't be something like that it would be something called netlify and you will see it just by creating some simple functions at the code level that netly file will host all the code for the front-end app but also expose your functions as endpoints to be invoked by the front end now that's a pretty powerful just create a set of function and netlify will do that for you so what we we are what we will do in step three is really you know go to netlify create uh a site uh ready to host our data uh do the link between your code and netlify github and applify and then each time we will commit on gitpod a github it will be uh neglify will will notice and we'll do that yeah that's that's true uh still yeah that's yeah this is why you don't need especially github for today but we with netlify command line we will build a project and deploy the project in this uh site created for us and so now instead of uh running some local express we will ask netlify to expose the the backend for us okay just looking for questions is netlify open source uh you know netlify is really uh like a huge platform if i go back to the github with some materials i gave you here more information regarding netlify netlify really here is text the code doing some computation static generator optimization and host your code so it's not like it should be open source or or something like that it's kind of an application server something that will host and run your code and neglify some server all across the world it's a cdn so content um content data network to have the website as close as possible to your users and this is by the way what is called the jam stack before we have the front end let's say react the web server and app server let's say express and the database now with netlify or verstel which is another one to do this jam stack client and backend is hosted on the same cdn so that's a super web page rendering that's decoupling from monolith app to to microservice because it's cdn it's super fast because the code is hosted somewhere else it's super secure it's scalable performance and i won't read all the steps but you you do have it on github to to know everything that is cool about having your code compile optimize deploy in the cdn uh and also some some nice way to expose a backend function okay so um that's it for the theory you do have the front end you do have the application or you do have the database now it's time for you to create the netlife sites and with that i think back to you guys okay let me uh let me share my screen again okay so um isn't great but um it'll take me a little while to find some other headsets so um so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a network site um have netflix cli tools in the workspace already for you now you see that it's trying to open this authorization link and as i mentioned gitpod doesn't play well with those authorized links so if you hold down command and click if you have a macintosh or if you right click on a windows box then it will open that for you in another window and the application is named network by cli and it wants to know um if we authorize it well i just asked so yeah if i come back you can see oh hey you've been logged in so now um it's gonna do the the create that i asked it to do um i'm not gonna choose a unique site name you can call it whatever you want um and then now it's created so then we're gonna now we're gonna link the internet if you've done other workshops with us this is done via a button that links your github repository to the netlife but in this case we're just working locally and with netflix so we just need to tell the workspace um so what i want to do is i'm going to go down we're not going to use the current remote origin because remember matlify doesn't know about that github right so we're going to choose from a list of our recently updated sites and what i'm looking for if you look over here you can see that its name is confident pain so confident pain that's the one that i want so now i'm going to deal with you this used to be one of the one of the biggest pains in in setting up things back in the battle stacks days um was setting up the environment well we have something automatically create those environment variables for you and we can now tell magnify use that env file remember i have the dot pmb file and now i basically it took that and it slurped it let's go take a look at netlifly and see what's happening now so i have to deploy it in order for those uh environment variables to show up but they will show up under environment it does happen that's cool so um so this means that network is going to hold on to those environment variables for me so i don't have to tell it that information when it's serving the content that i'm asking it to serve okay so that we go i'm going to build myself and again um remember the network.com file said if i'm saying that if i build what i mean is npm run build so that's a little um sort of framework stuff first and then it basically does the uh the npm run build so it will take just a moment um how is everybody doing yeah so so um yeah so just to wrap up because some question came so netlify sit create open uh this preview ugly preview you open on a new window and authorize net netlify okay so now you do have a site and uh you authorize netlify to interact with you netcliffe link and then the the third command is netlifyofimport.org so if you look at uh the dot dot of file on you know in in your platform you will see that hey there you will find all all the environment variables the astra token the astra database the the the astra key space name or everything is needed to connect to your database the way to import some environment variable from your environment to netlify is the command netlify of semicolon import and you're just exporting your environments variables to the target netlife website it's way easier than going to the netlify user interface and entering the environment variables one after the other yeah that's what we used to do and it wasn't super fun so um all right so i'm gonna do necrophy deploy dash p um that dash p means production so obviously we wouldn't be doing this in the real world but um all right so i have deployed now so let's see if i can open the site and there it is so remember i told you that we used the css just to make sure that all of the components were where we expected them to be right and here they are right there's the follower's column and it's red it's just accounts it's blue the header is yellow that was an early isle of pork that was um that you didn't do the networkify link was the second command did you do the first one the sites create and then that'll find link okay so um [Music] mr laporte does have an issue stating that netlify links need to be executed i don't think we saw all of the all of the commands here yeah okay so really make sure that netflix hit create is done before because that will generate some hidden netlify file in your folder just to create that interaction with the site how's everybody doing um have you got the chance to see your super beautiful um blue i mean that's that's so cool just that's cool but you know for next time switch the blue and the red you will get the french flash it'll be so much better right you actually need to command click or right click on that on that url and go give the authorization as it says i'm not sure why that didn't work because well then uh that subject that's different because it's going to have a different uh ticket name for each person who's doing the authorization ticket blah blah blah right you know can you repeat the authorization part yeah so that's really when you do netlify sit create a new url will open and will fail this is the the ugly gray on the preview you need to copy paste the link to open that a new window and only then you will be able to authorize you can actually just command click or right click depending on your platform and it will work fine okay so i link yeah okay i do love link netly 5 of import doing it right now netlify build and netlify deploy let's see yes you do need a network account to authorize and um it does ask some questions but it doesn't ask for credit card information and uh nutify is free for up to a really lot of stuff um i uh i probably have like 75 sites on there and i haven't gotten charged anything so you know yes what's look likes a lot of tools i get it i get it that dude likes a lot of tools but you will see that with all the tools set up you can create three line of javascript and have a seat in production for free so that that that worth the effort and you know re-watch the the the workshop i don't know in slow motion or step by step but as soon as all steps are wired together now each time you commit something in the guitar repo the website is redeployed updated already connected to the database so that's that's pretty cool all right um shall we move on do you want to talk about functions a little bit cedric did you have something for that yeah so i do i do i do so uh yes so as as uh yaya stated yes now that we wired things so let me share my screen sharing okay let me see waiting for my ugly to show up okay i think yes i'm good um yeah so as soon as we set up the site indeed each time you commit in the repo the the the website is redeployed like that yeah that's remember oh yeah deploy i told you i'm the java guy okay netley five wheeled netlife deep floyd and it's working now there is a way to set up netlify for netlify to be aware of any new commits but you know we did not do that today back to netlify so we have this guy that will take our code build and then when you deploy it will host the the for free your code and it's super performant available everywhere it's not the only features that netlify provide you you can also create very simple functions so a new folder in your project called functions uh one file per function and you will say hey this function will get as input this object abc and i will return uh the object x and it just it's just a javascript function really nothing special about that when you deploy the uh your project to netlify netlify will detect oh there is a function folder here so i will use any function that you put there and expose that for you as a rest api and then you can start executing some post requests against the end point there is nothing for you to do so no you know no no express no server for you to set up to listen to http requests no nothing only create a function as code deploy and netlify will expose an endpoint for you and the best part of that is this is what we call a serverless function you know the more capacity you need to run the function the more netlify will create some servers and scale out the function as much as needed not just scale as you need so it's not only take your code expose the code but also scale as you need and you know that's that's pretty neat so this is really what we will do right now we will create a new folder called function we will create new files there called add data post data and uh keystone will show you that just by creating those files you now have rest api in your project all right let me share again so i'm gonna move on to the next tour which is four functions again if you somehow um lost track of your uh code tour we've got this left navigation and you'll just go to four functions right so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and copy in that functions uh directory now um we can't nullify we're putting functions in functions right so that's great um if you look in functions you'll see we have add data edit and post and we'll go through what each of those does and uh what the code looks like now so our data.js um what we're going to do with um adddata.js is we're going to go ahead and populate the database so that um it's got some movies in it to to play with so what we're doing here is we're actually pulling in um the astrojax node uh um collections api we're actually going to change this all so it all uses clients so it's very consistent for you but right now we're still separate with um collections and rest um with the collections you can see we have a collection of collection memes so the collection name is um is is whenever we decide it to be right and and it's going to have a a collection of things in it right so because this is the document database it's really not a schema we're just going to put in json things and we're going to throw them into a named collection so our name collection is posts and we're going to go ahead and we're going to read the workspace resources.json which is um in your workspace let's see if this is switched as well there it is and that's just it's just a json file great so we got various things and we're going to load them up so i'll go back and so that's what adddata.js says one of the things we're going to note about add beta.js is that if it succeeds it's not going to say anything we might want to change that because it's kind of not a friendly setup but we'll see how that works so now we're going to set up post.js what post.js does is it's going to read that collection same collection name right it's going to read that collection and then it's going to map all of those all those various objects and and send them back so so far we have bad data and we have uh post right so i'm gonna run the server uh we're gonna get a new terminal that was trickier than it should have been but it works so it's going to start it'll take a little while to start up oh i clicked it twice um so what we're actually doing here is we're going to do a preview so it'll come up in this window um we're looking at our environment variables to find out what the getpod workspace url is which is actually tealpike whatever um and then um you know i'm basically going to this place but i'm going to add dotnet or five functions add data that's where netlify exposes your functions directory so i'm going to go ahead and click on that ah that's what i get that's interesting all right so it succeeded um and again it would be nice if it said that it succeeded but um yet so now i'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing to see what's in the database and hey how about that right we got we got those those pieces of data they're in the database now so uh let's make sure everybody's doing [Music] up it won't be found and then it will be found yep um yeah just looking page not found open the site um the server but it does a bunch of things first and it takes a minute or so so if you click too fast it's not there yet we should be there now yep all right um oh yeah so now that the as you can see the the function is responding some json payload and we're only creating two files uh add data and post um and you know just basic javascript so pretty cool one of the cool things about network now that we're now that we have some functions up there right is um we can take a look at the functions oh yeah you can see the function on the neglify web user interface not showing up um [Music] so i guess we have to have the um let's go ahead and get to the card component so um if you're familiar with sort of how to cut works um in those places where we had things um there's little cards each person has a card like they might have a face it could have their name um they can have their handle or their website or whatever right so what we need to do is we need to build those cards and then just shove them in the places where they go uh how they go so the first thing i'm doing is i'm copying um a new set of components a new set of pages um and uh so that so that i'm i'm ready to go right and so this is this is this so it's components pages and then there's public which is where uh ebooks at html is i'll do that again um and then i'm gonna you know we have an app component for in-app.js but it really wasn't doing much so we're gonna move it into index.js so that we just flatten out a little bit of the structure that we have okay so there's lots of changes to home.js let's go through them together so we're going to update the importance right so we've got um react obviously we've got the components followers column components card components mini card so we've imported all of the components that we need to build what we're trying to do um so so now we've got data coming in and out of astra i mean i i didn't really specify but but this um over here that came from astra that came from your database right so um we're getting data but we want to sort uh based on descending id order and this can be achieved through filtering so we've we've added the descending following we're following we're going to sort um by the uh descending by the number of likes so that people with more likes go at the top and next the data feature is so this is our home object right home is is is quite a big component it is a page in itself right it's in the pages directory and it's one of the two home pages so we're basically grabbing all of the information about the users and um so we want to know the top five following because that's our friends right we want to know the top five not following people we might want to follow and um and so we can show them differently in the feed and in the uh following so and and here we're just doing a post to functions add data let's look at what that code looks like real quick remember again we had that right so we created the aster client with the information and then we pulled in that data so that is where we are i think i just got myself lost we are here we go um so you know you can read through the code it's really um fairly straightforward right so we're setting up the descending users and top by following to use with different cards we're going to call the added endpoint to add into the system and then fetch data from the post endpoint to populate the page um it's okay that it's going to run it again and it's just going to put duplicate data and it doesn't really bother us much um so so what that meant is that if you went to home then you would have just gone ahead and run the ad data function the serverless function and the post function to get that information so that it could populate it for you so here we have the um the the not following users just ending not following and again that's we want people who have lots of likes lots of followers um but we're not following so we can find other cool people who have cool content and this uh again we're returning right so we're returning the content that's going to be injected into the html page um so we have defending users um our class name is container um this is how we're gonna do this the css is is by um using these class names and um we'll see what this all looks like in just a minute then we can come back and take a look at it if you want and again the top five following variable we need to pass that into followers column so followers column you know users top by following right so those are the the items that we're going to display so that in the feed we're going to map onto a curved component this will all make more sense when you get to see um the working code but just you can always come back to this part of the tour which is a little complicated i totally understand um uh sophia the port 888 is not found because that looks like that didn't finish okay so uh but we do also we need to um get the user information in card.js so uh we have user and we have toggle follow so what tug will follow is going to be is it's going to be am i following this person and if it if i am calling a person then it's going to it's going to say unfollow and then if i'm not following and then it will say follow right so we just need to toggle that back and forth um and here's the follow the button and the follow button um yeah i know this is very fast i'm very sorry but uh but it it's gonna be much easier you know once we're looking at it we can come back if you guys have questions about specific pieces we can go look at that code and figure out how it's doing what it's doing um so now i'm going to network my build and then i'm going to network deployed sp uh that sofia that is on the uh yeah okay um so now you can see it's packaging functions from the functions directory fantastic that that's really excellent right there's our functions and now it's built we can deploy it and then and now so these are cards right these are the top accounts that i have um i have following um here's suggested people these are people who i'm not following who are popular um and uh and there's the i don't think i have all of the pieces correctly that looks like yeah the user profile is we need that picture but um so how's it working are you guys um are you guys able to get to this one i do [Laughter] i do i do uh i'm not seeing any data just the home page oh maybe it's just loading right we should have all the same uh video to be honest oh although for fabio told us it is working uh you know for me not so much a javascript expert like like instead and such i'm not trying to uh fully grasp all the react pc's while other component how the components are linked one to other how the page is organized it just say hey so i do have a few files this is my web my website i create just two files now i do have rest api and it's super easy to connect to my database it's more architecture point of view but you know if you are real coders and like code and now you can commit what you do have right now git commit and you do have a full working app you know somebody asked for the code just git comments and boom you do have it in your account yeah um in the feed i i totally agree we need to make things clearer i think we should probably have some buttons for some of these things um because it's if it's all text it's hard to see what you're supposed to do um so you know if i had a button that said one server that would bright blue but it would be easier for you to see that you know that's how you um run that uh run the server all right um okay so we're gonna go to add functions now uh we're going to copy in a new card.js um what we're doing is we're just including information about the user okay the accept the user pass through to microcard oh don't do this all right i see that it's already done um let's just oh no okay so post see step six the two do that click in set code because it's there already yeah all right um and then we're gonna bring in a new version of microcard shouldn't be necessary but okay and then we'll look at edit.js so we're gonna we're gonna use a file called edit.js for follow unfollow we should probably name it i don't know follow substance because edit isn't very clear um so again we're grabbing the astra client um this is just a module that that has the the client set up for your astra client um and then we're gonna do a user's update and the body data is basically um am i following am i not following do the not thing so if i'm already following then unfollow and if i'm not following then follow right so this is the physical things it's a toggle right so that isn't correct um and then we're going to create a new so it's not it shouldn't be users it should probably be post dot create right um you know this is a demo so i'm always looking to make it clearer um step five number ten um uh you didn't do something earlier uh do um do that okay so we now know how to upload uh a file and follow and unfollow a user so we can check the implementation in home.js so again this is how it works right so um if the user to toggle is followed then turn it off otherwise turn it on and then the data that it sends through to that edit uh function is um is you know the new value okay i'm sorry we uh we just looked at edit so um so this is what's actually calling all right so in upload again this is a page it's in pages upload right and um we sort of have a default stuff right and when we submit it it says all these things and then we send it to network functions for everybody okay we're going to go ahead and commit that deploy and well the thing is um data sex developers that um that if you click finish if you click to the next step and you didn't actually push all the buttons on the current step it still gives you a checkmark so if there were six commands on a step on one of the tour steps and you click on five of them and then you click next except then it'll say we finished it all right um let's deploy i think we might be still missing a few pieces but probably got some pocket accounts here that's good um and uh we have the upload button it should show us the upload page so um so it is if you um uh run into issues or are wondering why something isn't working the way you want um there is also a completely functional tick-tock um repository that you can cheat on so we can we can send that out to you um so fn sync but it looks like it looks like our functions because that's what we told it to do in network dot tunnel so netlify uses that directory for the serverless functions yeah yeah so yes uh it is it just looks under the functions folder does anybody have any questions that's um that's that's the the full experience so um we have a few more minutes if you guys want to um look for stuff oh adds all of the files in your directory [Laughter] because you're famous you're so famous i learned for already you know um yeah yeah go away pio go epo i will buy some shares um i uh i think we're all done now um if you guys uh want to go through this again on your own time um just remember that there's uh there's a discord channel there's a discord which i i strongly suggest that you join but also there's a channel in there called workshop workshop feedback and we love to get feedback about you know things that you found frustrating or ways we can make things better so uh please feel free to jump in there um we we are a worldwide team so usually there's someone in there um who can we can help you if you have questions do you have anything somebody asked for their homework you know because already some folks are finished like us and they would like to do a screenshot and submit the homework you know as as you know as fast as possible and so this i i share the link with you all you you simply create a new issue to this github repo uh providing some screenshot your uh you know there is a template there oh you know what i will uh take over the screen if you don't mind that's fine okay um okay let me share screen start sharing here we go boom so let's see we will switch from black to white yeah so hey that's me uh okay so for all those who completed all step uh one by one taking the time and you know we we have rush time to time but really by following step by step uh you end up with the working full working app with full working code and you know you can you can commit the code and do have everything running um you know you can brag on twitter you can you know that would be cool but also to get a badge you simply need to go to this url i give you again the url on on the youtube chat go there uh create a new issue choose the template homework assignment and there you go so provide name email looking profile just optional provide the url of your own app running that's the best proof that the app is working then of course you can do a screenshot but hey to be honest just a working url would be you know okay for me because if you do other working uh app that means you completed all the steps so um i will come and add my own uh video and you know in your tick tock just to be even more famous but hey this is how you did and look at that um then we we just review your work and if everything is okay you do have a nice congratulation message with a link to your badge and you can brag so the latest to this date to have the tick tock badge is mr shivani and he completed the homework on october the 30th that's today that's okay oh no issue now issue issue on on on the 7th so it was it was last week but we do have a lot of badges a lot of workshops so if you like these interactivity doing workshops with us some are more code oriented some are more
