    "text": "[Music] oh hello hello hello and welcome to another data stacks devs c-sharp our for Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise today we are going to get into a few things which should be pretty interesting we're still working on the schema migrator app which I have dubbed casma CAS ma stands for Kassia schema migrator if the music's a little out let me know I always try to keep it low but not gone also I just set up a new installation of JetBrains writer to use for this so that should be interesting because I have realized late as I'm just now setting this up that I don't have it set up in OBS so bear with me just a second and I'm going to get that up and running and then we're gonna get a great perfect view of the whole screen that's here and there we go and almost done here got this here I got the screen let's no that's not the screen so good I got that screen and then always something right where did my there we go and boom tada we have code alright so now that we have that up and running we can get rolling here so quick review I believe most of the tests should be running okay we had gotten to the point though last session where so we ran ran into a little problem I tried this super genius idea that might not have been so super genius I had tried to get the whole of basically to get a docker container to run and then destroy itself on every test not not the greatest idea and it was killing the virtual machine that I was doing the development in so now this is on the local machine and I'm gonna be setting up docker so that docker starts up for the test and then it's destroyed at the end of the tests executing because it needs a space to do the migrations against that is not per test it does not need to be per test or maybe it does I don't know but let's see where we're at with the tests so far we're gonna we're gonna run this migration on this new machine so this would be a good sample of what things would be like if you had just gone and grabbed all of this stuff and then you thought alright I'm gonna pull this stuff and they actually do a get pool to just make sure I got all of them yeah and this is a great example like I'm saying you just pulled this from github and you're ready to give it a go we have a build running and as your pipelines it just does a bill doesn't run the test yet that's something else that we need to get integrated in there so all right got all the tests it's bounced over here and let's run all of these things I'm gonna run the debug she I should just write it normal and see what it do and let's see where we get there's nyan cat running like crazy getting the work done we have one failure verify correct number TAS to ride from Falls lets you verify correct number TAS to ride from files so should be nice should be mine I feel like maybe this is not reflective of let's look at all the branches some wonder what that one looks like Oh what did I do ok let's take a look at that oh where we out here let's do get it pull all hmm yeah check out as your DevOps yeah that's right that is what I want I could have sworn there were more tests so let's go take a look at our repo here that night let's see here there we go so Cassie schema migrator whoa as your DevOps is down not good not good at all saving that for later not the first time so that's kind of unsettling let's go look at the support page and see where they're at here of course everything says it's up so that doesn't that doesn't seem particularly true it says degraded no customer impact except I can't see under the database years currently okay it said resolved but it's degraded and I can't see the build that doesn't seem super transparent but let's well we'll come back to that then let's go in here though and I wanted to see the test I thought there is a lot more here yeah it looks like more so why is let's just do this let's go here and now the build status and let's get this fixed up Adrienne hostage tax oh this is this is an old set up here so let's do get remote remove as your pops don't want that one and I'm gonna try to do a pull it pull origin master I like it check out master and let's look at all these Falls as your pipelines what is my conflict here no I don't know which ones which so let's I'm going to use the cheat mode just go in here copy this basic one and that's a bunch of craziness just wants the simple ones let's do that yeah so add that back into the commit adding the merge all right I'm gonna do the whole thing I don't even know yeah I did it okay so that's good oh yeah look at there there's all those tests that's what I was expecting let's try to run all these so these are the ones darker magic okay so most of these are successes then they're very ordered for down migration for mission execution okay down migration I could have sworn I did those too that's super flaky yeah there we go I'm gonna I'm gonna actually pull up the virtual machine in which we were doing some of this previous development and we're gonna take a look and see where we're at because clearly I have matched the codebase and I don't want to redundantly work on these things you know but this is not an uncommon problem during the course of development okay I'm back I guess I was just working along there for a little bit with uh all by myself so yeah let's see here what in the world is going on it's like OBS is going nuts on me I'm gonna get this figured out yet bear with me here there we go hmm okay so I kind of got the thing running I'm wondering if the docker had crashed OBS I'm curious about that very very curious here are 23 minutes in it's ok didn't crash too long ago that's good hopefully everybody's back cuz yeah we're still doing stuff we're not done I don't know what the deal was with that but I tell you his docker crashes a bunch of stuff so I'm not surprised if docker had had eaten up and killed the thing alright let's just get back into this all right so the docker example build succeeded but got do I think I put it in the wrong OPD that's that's not what I'm trying to do actually let's do this name then that work and then disconnected like that that's how it should work so let's do that one and now keeping an eye on it see if it's crashing this time it shouldn't ok cool and then hey it's up and live this time alright so we got it going now docker yes oh yeah so we got the one we created the one that's there now let's try to add this stuff in which is the kill so actually let's let's try to add this one which is just just supposed to stop the container right so now we should have the old one running and we should have to though for the one that's running and then the new one that was exited yeah so that that creature creates us the container now if we do this we should they should start you should run one and stop it and then delete it and remove it so in the end here we should see exactly what we see here so let's run that and see what we get all right error response from daemon so ran it and then it said no that's kind of weird let's do this so we still have the one running oh we have three so it didn't delete it hmm oh you know what the remove maybe I should add a countdown to this let's see about that yeah so c-sharp pause console execution sleep or whatever it's called yeah thread dot sleep okay so let's do let's do that so let's oh yeah let's do this Gawker stop and we'll do thread dot sleep so that should be one second let's do ten seconds see what we get oh and they removed let's do thread dot sleep 1,200 so they actually execute an order appropriately okay so that's Fourier cassie 706 that one shouldn't be available because it looked like it worked that time give that one working or running and then we have four here yes and it's not there so now now it works it just needed a bit of a timeout there so it actually ran an order okay so our example works now get back into the test and where did we get to oh so I know what I was I think I was trying to yeah execute docker so let's not do this so this is yeah we're going to create a whole separate thing for this so that setups sets the migration up this is doing that okay it's just fussing about convert concatenation interpolation interpolation okay and this says what object allocation evident well yeah so what just I don't know what you're suggesting I should do so we're gonna leave that let's go see what this little that's fussing about make tear down static okay we can do that probably make this one static - yep so then make that a little leaner and this one should be what probably oh because it's just happening inside and probably make it all you want to do that really yeah so this is this is super what that no don't don't do any of that yeah just leave it alone leave it alone all right whatever that crazy mess is and this is what's this fussing about remove not access property whatever to string interpolation so how's that look oh okay so I'm just adding a dollar sign in front of it like this what's this saying oh yeah just doesn't like the spelling okay so all that stuff is in place we got that going on all right so now we have the test these integration tests and if we run no that's getting weird looking let's run these again I think this one should be working no I swear I wrote these oh no no these are the actual migrations that need to occur okay yeah okay so they're ordered and now we have up and down migration alright so now we are gonna get into the nitty-gritty of actual migrations we're gonna work on executing the actual migrations against Cassandra database so for these tests I do actually need a database so I'm gonna spin up a node so you'll call this start database we'll do destroy database and let's create the method there we go create this method alright so this I'm probably gonna want to put somewhere else but for right now okay and then we also need our standard migration path files to process and all that stuff so this destroys it's a start database let's say create migrations destroy destroy migrations okay there's that and we'll need to do do that backwards no it's just that right No go to declaration okay so here I need to do this as way what is migration path Oh actually let's do this use the little cheap shortcut here alt enter create local variable I'll actually do this and this there we go and this should be the migration path let's put this as migration path equals let's come back here okay we're going to take that and then put that in here okay Oh wait a second Oh crud did I mess that up I do beating the let's go to that declaration let's go to this decoration go to declaration yeah that's so not static they'll make them static I guess I should stop listening to the damn wrongful stuff there what does this say now your boxing application okay okay yeah so this this needs to be instantiated cuz I need to have this declared upfront and then this can be that here we go and then all those other tests now are gonna be flaked out because I did that then that okay I have to go get it fixed where am I at here I feel like I should all right we're gonna reset that are ya all right clear edits again okay let's go back in here all right so all of these all these are green now except for that bit so let's do some refactoring so I'm going to go into test helpers here and I'm not going to follow their directions this time because that messed me up so I guess I could do a new list for these things on things that need the new list and not put it in this and just make static calls which would reduce lines of code yes I could do that let's let's do that let's make this static and then we're gonna put create these here like this but it's teardown so they're not gonna have the list we're gonna get rid of this puppy go down here this is also gonna be a static set up and we'll want to do this here let's create these here we go what's it saying oh yeah make static okay and then these will be sure read only it's read only and then explicit private it's actually a let's do that actually it's constant rename okay and then this is gonna be changed to concatenation style from concatenation to interpolation this is gonna go to interpolation okay let's get that into interpolation - oh yeah let's actually get rid of that though it's gonna remove that docker what's this saying now yes please add the setter okay okay okay in this we can get rid of and we don't need that or that so we get rid of that I'm gonna put them in a different file test helpers let's do a sure whatever J something test docker helpers and add that let's add let's just make this a static class we'll call this a public static void exact docker Duker yeah okay oops again I'll do that and then that's the beginning the beginning of that bit so this is relatively cleaned up now what do you mean that's never used oh yeah that's not used in here okay that helped a bit then let's get over to docker helpers again and let's add those variables all right now let's run the unit tests again just to make sure everything's good after that refactor oh no what's this oh yeah let's do well let's see if see if it'll fix it all the inner there we go okay correct access get rid of that correct that access so basically I'm going to do that I'm just gonna replace every one of these two lines there we go okay yep let's do this and make it a do this refactor and we're gonna extract that into a method and call it get migrations to execute oh yeah extract messin get get migrations to execute you fix that again refactor extract method extract method ya get migrations yet ah get my creations to execute yes boom it's a migration path yep and then each migration in migrations executes down or up or whatever where did it put my yeah so this it's gonna go way down Oh what did I just do that is not what I wanted to do there we go area what do we got here it looks like everything stayed clean with that refactor okay so then we need to do the teardown is the teardown it's fine migration path migration path yeah okay so that does all of that well cleans it up a bit so now we need to go though and we need to get the this this happened so let's first do this refactoring cleaning up unit integration test are you kidding me come on failed to push some reps updates rejected because push branch tip is behind get branch oh get checkout oh shoot that's your brain right inch all okay let's do get merge master get checkout branch new stuff get check out new stuff okay now I get checkout master git merge new stuff there we go clear and get push origin master get branch how are we doing there all right so then get branch V noose new stuff get status get branch back on master okay everything everything should be cool now see does this reflect yep there we go so now we're updated and get and we need to start working on these repos this needs to we need to go to launch docker with this thing so we have something to test against all right so go in examples let's see where what do we got here again we want to have we want to have this function as our core executing function put that right here but this is boolean and we'll do this try give me all the bits yep okay then I can put that in here okay and if there's inception it should write it out and throw it do we even care about that let's let's not wreaths row it let's just do that and return false this is return true should right there somewhere but we're working in the console so that'll be fine let me get rid of that okay so then here running kasi so let's do this and we'll call this yeah run kasi that's good okay kasi version network and a kasi name it's gonna be oh yeah let's make that are you only and then we're gonna name to that and then we'll just do just do constant like so oh wait yeah I gotta area and then we'll change this to the way their Felicia that should work and then why is what oh yeah of course let's call this network kasi version come in yes that is what's going on okay it's gonna be public the public static boolean turn that there we go okay let's call this actually oh yeah refactor and we'll rename it to docker helper yeah docker helpers there we go then alright boom okay so now we got kasi happening here doc or helpers dot doc or destroy whoops destroy Cassie and I'm gonna just do this create the method it'll put it in here yeah and we'll add a boolean what did we call it how did we do it in here we called the exact docker just like that let's do that stop Cassie name then like docker remove Cassie name and let's do this same we're doing it everywhere else for readability there we go beautiful and here I'll say return that result if this away if this if true do that else console dot write line check error stop ran into a problem oops stopping the container ran into a problem there we go okay and then let's I guess we can flip this right oh yeah cuz it said it out otherwise this thing cuz I've returned and this may turn what oh yeah it's false this is gonna be true unless it's false then something else but okay all that and now we have a start and stop for the container actually let's put that back in or not we'll do this and then we'll take out this one all right now this is this is gonna be good it's gonna be real good okay that you okay I run off let's do that command I wonder if it gives us oh yeah that's it's not what we want it's still not done let's put these up at the top just because these are like the tests that are testing the perimeter knout pre-eminent functionality of this whole thing all right here we go got that stuff working so annoying with its like doesn't error so it passes but there's no test in it there's no assert it always kind of frustrated me anyway uh okay so then we need to VAR migration oh yeah actually we need to do this right this needs to be before the docker helper and we need to then tear down the migration path after the docker helper so what we're just going to delete the down one for now like so and then here this might break migration path actually needs to actually be used here and in here this is migration path to and we'll just do for the time being we'll say assert dot is there an exists dot verify that this river still raises superset no let's do it is tight yeah what did I do there we go just navigated to the wrong part of the file there you go so let's let's see if that test passes so that looks good let's go in here and say docker PS okay so docker stop kasi blah blah blah and docker remove kasi blah blah blah 7f this yeah yes oh what's what else I got okay let's docker remove can I do everything okay docker remove Cassie come on oh I see what the problem is okay now we got nothing running so let's run this and ensure that we get through it all okay okay looks good it's done we got a do let's do it stop right here do it debug yeah okay and this should have nine that's what I expected okay so then we'll just continue on all right so we got all that running but really what this needs to say throw knew not implemented exception this needs to to test the migration against the database all right so we did some much-needed refactoring we did not get to the main onus of today but we got a lot of refactoring done a lot of refactoring so it's cleaned up we're in kind of a better space I'm gonna go ahead and knock this out so we'll know right where we need to start next time and next time we we will we will get the migrations to execute against the database had to get that refactoring done and getting everything straightened out since machine shift and everything so you know stuff comes up when you're working on a project and that's where we are right now god let's hear yeah we got that machine shifted we got to build fixed we got the exam the docker examples up and running and that puts us in a good place so cuz now we can continue forward and work on this we can start to work on the feature additions like maybe even change where we're not just using dates to order the things but we could actually enumerate and order them that way so a lot a lot of good stuff come in on the stream thanks for listening thanks for watching hope this was useful and I'm often very curious to know what type of scheme of migrations that you're working on whether they're in Cassandra data stacks enterprise sequel server oracle Postgres whatever it is I'd love to hear about what scheming migrations you're using and how this tool as I build it out to encompass and expand on the basic rudimentary schema migration problem can help you out so let me know reach out to me on Twitter at Adrian or ping data stacks devs on Twitter whisper at me here on Twitch or however however you see to contact me feel free to do so you can check out my writing on composite code blog I'll be catching up on some of this stuff and write like a kind of summery blog entry here in the coming days for the schema migration tool I have some information out there now and I want to expand on it here in the very near future so with that have a good one thanks for watching and I will catch you next time [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
