    "text": "hey everyone uh Erin plet here from data Stacks um I am here to take you through some fairly in-depth content on um running Enterprise Cassandra on Amazon eks so yeah we're going to uh G to have some fun with this today and hopefully the demos all work that would be that would be brilliant all right let me uh let's see here try to remember how to share my screen found it all right so let's go entire screen and there we go okay um like I said here we go running Enterprise Cassandra on Amazon eks um for this session our goals are are actually pretty simple you know I'm going to quickly go through some introductory Concepts you know about um you know Amazon eks kubernetes you know clusters containers pods etc etc um we're going to use a pre-prepared um eks cluster you know I I would go ahead and and have you watch me put one together but um a it takes a while and B there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of places for things to go wrong um so it it was it's really just better if I kind of get it to a good State and then kind of show you things about it and then we'll pick up from there um anyway once we we get done talking about uh eks we'll go ahead and install uh data Stacks mission control that's our our gooey user interface that lets you um you know inter you know use kubernetes-based uh infrastructure um and then with all that in place uh we'll actually build out a uh an Enterprise Cassandra cluster um on top of all this uh just so you all can see um just how easy it is to do so all right with that I I think we can move on here all right so real quick you know little about me I work at UH at data Stacks um I've been in Devil for for quite a while um I've been a part of the Apache Cassandra Community for again a while more than more than 12 years uh so I've been using it for quite a long time I was previously the uh the engineering lead for uh no SQL at Target uh my specialty was Cassandra but I I did kind of oversee and drive all of all of no sequel um and we did a lot of distributed databases on kubernetes at at Target you know so that was um that that was something that's kind of prepared me for for this this presentation um and i' I've written some books too you know um seven nosql databases in a week mastering Pat Cassandra 3.x and then in January I I came out with code the Java 21 so yeah let's see here so hey real quick um our agenda for today pretty simple match it try to match up with our goals um we're GNA get into Amazon eks at a high level we're going to talk a little bit about the architecture and what happens when you're using um or when you're deploying Cassandra on kubernetes with uh with mission control um we're going to look at preparing your eks cluster or a pre-prepared eks cluster uh we'll install mission control and assuming everything goes well we'll uh build out a new Cassandra cluster on top of that at the end all right so diving right into it Amazon e basically it's it's pretty simple you know it's uh Amazon's um elastic kubernetes Service uh the great thing about uh about eks is it it lets you um you know integrate easily with uh other AWS Services as well like IM ec2 fargate um I've actually done quite a bit of um integrating it with ECS as well you know the elastic container services so you know you can have your Cassandra databases deployed on EK and then also run your individual applications on ECS if you if you want to um yeah and and of course you know the the biggest advantage of um you know Amazon eks is that it's it's kubernetes on easy mode um it um it it really allow the main thing is it allows teams to run kubernetes that um you know without having to run kubernetes essentially or or maintain it or operate it um or do any of that um that tedious those tedious tasks along with it um so yeah Amazon eks makes a makes a great choice for uh for using you know a kubernetes as a service and you know helping you to get your uh kubernetes apps into production faster all right quick dive into the architecture here um so our goal today we're going to start out with Amazon eks um we're going to deploy data stack mission control on top of that and that's going to allow us to use a uh a special kubernetes operator that we have um I think it's called the cassand no it's the Kate Sandra operator we actually have a version of Cassandra that we've built um specifically for kubernetes and that's called Kate Sandra um so we we've kind of like kind of you know repurposed that operator um to help out with mission control as well and and really that just um it abstracts away a lot of the um a lot of the nitty-gritty details of using kubernetes to um you know go ahead and uh and build your cassander deployments um and then once we have all that in place um I'm going to go ahead and deploy data Stacks Enterprise on top of it um you'll be able to see that with Mission Control we can really take our pick if we want to you know deploy dsse or Pache Cassandra or hcd but um I'm actually going to go with dsse uh because of reasons well anyway so when we go ahead and we have a cluster that's managed by or that's deployed on top of kubernetes um with Mission Control what does it look like well um simply put this this um slide right here kind of shows the uh the pods that are running so like you know when you when you run thing when you run workloads on kubernetes um a pod gets created and a pod runs on a node and inside a pod you can have multiple containers running um so specifically you get um you know when you deploy Cassandra you get each Cassandra node will have its own pod um you'll also get pods addition Ally for um Cassandra Reaper which which helps with repairs um you'll also get one for excuse me uh the cql or cql shell process um and you'll also get one too for the um if you ah I should say if you deploy uh DSC or hcd um you'll get the uh the data API the data Stacks data API deployed along with it um so those are the pods that you get running now if we move forward and we take a look at one of the individual like Cassandra kubernetes pods these are the containers that are that are running inside of it so you'll see you have your database container running you know which is one of either hcd for hypercon converged database or data stack Enterprise dsse um or Cassandra itself additionally you're going to have containers running uh for the system logger again to kind of help pass along um you know logging and help aggregate a lot of the um processes involved with that um as well as the you'll have Cassandra Medusa there for backups um so this is actually kind of the cool thing is that you know if you deploy with Mission Control you know a lot of times you're you're you have all this extra work involved in setting up um like Medusa and it's setting up Reaper to make sure that you have backups and repairs like like all running um but with Mission Control you just get that all like installed and and uh configured and uh and everything all set up for you so it's really pretty slick all right well let's move on to preparing your eks cluster um before before getting into that there are some things that you'll need to have installed that will really help out with um you know making making this process a lot easier uh first of all you know you'll want to have the AWS CLI um there's a lot of things that you get get with um eks control that that um you know that that kind of abstract away the need for the AWS CLI but there are some things like uh creating S3 buckets I I think we actually do want the AWS CLI for um kind of leading the into that you know eks control um is a is again a tool that um that kind of that kind of Aggregates away a lot of the details with um like building and configuring an eks cluster and um and uh the the cool thing about that is that you know if you were to do things purely through like the uh the AWS console there'd be all these different steps that you'll You' kind of have to do to get everything right well eks control will take care of a lot of those steps for you um so I highly recommend that and then of course we're going to need Cube control um anyone who's uh who's worked with kubernetes enough I'm I'm sure is familiar with with Cube control um and then of course we have we have CS cots you might not have heard of it's a uh plugin actually um for cube control that um you know kind of kind of allows you to you know run applications of the part of an installer um so it stands for kubernetes off the shelf and we're actually going to use that to install mission control so our cluster specifically that we're going to work with today um again I I have this one pre-prepared to to kind of minimize the kind of minimize the chances of of something going wrong here um but our cluster is going to be named eron's ek6 you can tell how many uh how many times I've uh I've done this now um it's deployed in the um the US West one region um it's made up of five nodes and those five nodes are all running with um on the on the Amazon type of um t3x larges um t3x large I'm pretty sure gets you I think it's 16 gigs of RAM and four virtual CPUs um you know obviously if if you're going to go with a full blown production deploy you're going to want to go with something a little beefier but um you know for building up a you know a quick demo cluster that I can deploy a a couple of small Cassandra clusters on top of p3x large is a good is a good mix of resources and um you know like price point basically um so yeah that's what uh that's what we're going to work with today um it has five nodes two of them have been designated as platform nodes and then three have been designated as database nodes and you'll see how that comes into play here too um if you want details on everything that I I did actually to build up and kind of prepare that eks cluster ahead of time um we actually have this video Enterprise Cassandra on Amazon eks um part one Mission Control installation I've actually done a step-by-step video on this and it's on our data Stacks Developers YouTube channel um but that has like um like it's like a 17st step and you know I I made sure that that it all got bookmarked too um but yeah it takes you through each step involved in getting that eks cluster configured um so I highly recommend if you're interested in the details of that in you know having look at that video all right well with that said let's go ahead and uh and jump into things um so here I am in let's see let's expand that a bit um you know you can see here we are in my uh in my uh AWS uh console guey here um I can go ahead into my ek6 cluster um you can see it's uh it's definitely definitely built up here um let's see yeah oh add-ons is is something important to look at U while you're while you're building this out and I actually do um go through these steps in that that video I just mentioned you'll want to make sure that two important add-ons are in here first of all you want this eks pod identity agent that's going to be important and um the Amazon EBS CSI driver um that one is is actually the one that um you know allows your kubernetes cluster the ability and permissions to um like provision disc resources so it's kind of super important that you uh they you have that one configured properly um almost all the problems I've run into while building these clusters up relate to you know how I've how I've interacted with and configured that EBS CSI driver um so so it's definitely something you want to pay special attention to um real quick here let's have a look at uh the command line let's see here and I'm going to jump back here and just adjust my window a little bit so I can see I can see the edges of these two if I have to jump back and forth all right let's clear up there okay so you know the first thing we can do to to have a look at the available resources um we can do a cube control um and I'll just say get nodes just like that and as you can see you know I I mentioned that you know this cluster is built up of up of five nodes uh they're all in US West one um and if I wanted to see nodes for a specific role you know I could always do something like coup control get nodes and I can say um I can check by label and say Mission Das control dat stacks.com rooll equals platform all right so these are the platform nodes these are the ones that um you know are going to have a lot of the processes around like you know um node coordination workload scheduling things like that mission control is going to use um you know the the platform nodes of course uh likewise I can backspace over this and I can say database and those are three database nodes these are the ones that our cassander nodes are going to be deployed to um you'll also see um you know pods out on these nodes for some of those other processes that we talked about earlier like you'll see pods out here for um like Medusa um you'll see pods out here for Reaper uh the data API um cql shell um these will all these will all be you know kind of running on the on the database nodes for uh for you to see there um one thing too that um that you'll kind of need in order to um you know go ahead and and build up your eks cluster is uh to make sure that you have your um your storage classes configured so if I say Cube control um get storage class um you can see down here that I have um gp2 as the default um then I also o have a storage type called gp3 um that was actually created so if I do a um I actually have this as a a yaml file on my local here so if I do a cat and just gp3 you can see a storage class yaml um and and you can see that basically this um this configures it again using that EBS CSI um add-on as the provisioner there um but it's it builds out like a like a Linux ext4 file system underneath um so yeah let's see so we've got that um you know we can I mention the add-ons you know we can also have a look at the add-ons here uh that's going to be a um eks control and we can say get add-on and I'm going to specify my cluster of erands eks 6 and that's in region Us West one this should do it yeah here we go so you can see the uh the add-ons that I have here the um you know bpc cni um crep control proxy you know we have the identity agent that I the Pod identity agent that I talked about before core DNS um and of course that AWS evbs CSI driver that like I said it's it's really important that you uh you get that one right um that about does it for you know having a look at our eks cluster before we get going um I see that uh that Alexander has a a question out there is it possible to deploy aache Pulsar oh absolutely um kind of the cool thing is that um you can actually grab the um the image out there uh for pulsar and I mean you can you can run it inside of um eks um as far as it being integrated with uh with Mission Control not yet uh but we're getting there it's uh it's on it's on the road map you know if you if you've looked at our um you know kind of our our future uh product stance around going with um you know like the hcd database or you know which is the the hyperon converge database but long term it's also a part of the um hyperon converge database platform um that we will be getting to in the future and Pulsar is going to be a part of that platform um or I I actually I to be honest I'm not sure if it's pulsar or um or Astra streaming but you know if if Mission if Mission Control has kind of showed us anything it's that you might have the option to do both you know and and you'll see this in Mission Control um it's really easy for me to pick between um whether I want to go with Apache Cassandra or dsse or hcd and I have a long list of um you know version images that I can pick from um if I had to guess and I don't know for sure um I would say that that some something similar will be possible with Pulsar all right now that's that's a good question you know I know there are a lot of folks out there who inte integrate um you know pulsar and uh things like Kafka with uh with Cassandra all the time so um yeah that's a that's a really good question all right so the first thing I'm going to do here is uh my cluster needs the um needs the uh certificate manager um kind of the cool thing again that we that we do with Mission Control is that um you know we take care of SSL certificates for you um so if you turn on inter inter node SSL um those CTS are all created and managed entirely um under the hood so you don't have to mess with it so I'm going to make sure we have that um and actually we're gonna I should have this in my prerequisites list also but um we're going to use Helm for that so if I say Helm if I can type and we say install and I want search manager and that's going to be at jet stack um search manager I'm going to want to force it to um create the name space um we're gonna want to use version um I think it's V 1.13.2 and we're going to do a set install um crds equal to crew let's try that well it's not failing so that's a plus [Music] oh here we go okay so we have CT manager all right that's been deployed successfully whe outstanding okay uh with C manager in place we can go ahead and start the mission control install um so again I mentioned before that we're going to install control by using CS um which is the the kubernetes offthe Shelf lets you build installer for or installers for like you know kubernetes projects um and we have that cots add on installed so I'm going to say coup control and invoke Cs and then you're going to say install um Mission Dash control and important here we want to make sure that we specify a nam space of cots because cots does have some pods and things that that kind of run in the background and um we don't want those pods in our like default name space so let's go ahead and try that all right so I'll pass along a little tip here while you're doing this um if if there's a problem specifically again with that with that um EBS CSI driver and the permissioning and sorry like the permissions and on the I am policy that um that need to be properly assigned to that add-on um this waiting for data store to be ready will actually Spin and kind of hang there um and eventually after a while it'll say hey issues provisioning you know cannot cannot continue um so if you go ahead and you build everything up and then you run this command and you get to where it wants you to enter a password that's really good so many times I've tried this I've gotten this far and then it just spins at waiting for data store to be ready and I'm just like anyway I digress um all right so I'll go ahead and give it a password here I'd better make it one I can remember all right it's uh going to bring up the admin console now shouldn't take too too long for this to come up um but essentially what it's going to do is um build up like a like a temporary a temporary port forward that'll allow us to go to our browser and then go into to the um to the cots install process and complete the rest from there all right there we go so now as long as this process runs uh in the foreground we can actually get to this um on our local host on 8800 right here um and then of course once you hit control C to uh to stop the process well you know then your uh your port forward to Local Host goes away but let's let's jump out here for a second and paste that in and this should take just a few seconds to come up here uh oh something is not going well with our our port forward here yeah oh hey there we go that time it worked work all right so uh now I want to uh put in that password that I just did inside the terminal all right next um in order to install Mission Control you need a license file um to to get a license file um it's it's one of those things you know that that since you know mission control and hcd is really meant for Enterprise customers um you know it the best way to get a license file is to kind of talk to your data Stacks rep um you know whoever you work with for like for like sales or your solution architect you know with with data Stacks um we can get you a license file um and we can also get you one for uh for Dev purposes as well but for a license file the best way to get one is to is to reach out to us and uh and we can help you out with that so I'm going to choose my mission control license yaml here and say okay and then I will say upload license all right hey we're in the uh Mission Control config right here outstanding okay so I do want to set this up as a control plane um let's see let's um yeah let's just leave that there um for observability we are going to want to Mark um S3 um you know because I did did mention that um you know part of getting that cluster ready was to um prepare your or to actually create our S3 bucket um let's see so for storage our S3 buckets are in US West one um I need to put in my access key okay I have to find my access key um my apologies folks I should have had this ready oh there it is all right let me put that in um and then my uh secret key and put that in all right endpoint URL um yeah let's see here so since the default points to us east1 we are going to want to want to um adjust this so we're going to say s3. us W one instead and then we'll say Amazon aws.com um yeah that's okay all right here's where we want to paste in our buckets um let's see I wonder if I have an easy way to to show this yeah all right let me go to local now let's say cat S3 ah okay I should have shown this before but but um this is the uh S3 access policy that um that I worked with before um I've gone ahead and created my buckets ahead of time but um your bucket names um for us anyway are going to be right here it's the um erens eks 6 metrics and then DS erand eks 6 logs um so that should be really easy there so um we use mimir actually for uh for metrics so let me just paste that in there um let's see yeah that's all okay observability logs uh this is where I can go ahead and just backspace over metrics and say logs uh let me just verify that in my steps here yep that's right that's right and the rest of this uh we shouldn't need to worry about too much um although this is where you'll want to um you know put it in email you know so I can say um uh Aon data.com um you'll want to put in a um a uh bcrypt hash password here and you know kind of the the way we have that is we have this command you know right here in the description that you can just copy um and you can put that in and um you know instead of your password I can say my password with a capital P like that right um and that'll go ahead and get me that hash uh which I can put in here just like that then username uh we can say Erin all right and this should all be okay so now if I say continue all right oh it couldn't find the CT manager huh well that's really strange well it did pass enough of the pre-flight checks that it will let me go ahead and deploy I wonder why the C manager I wonder why that file is not found all right I suppose if we rerun it it we'll just it'll just have the same thing again but let let's give it a shot just in case just in case yeah we we get the same thing okay no problem let's just go ahead and try deploy here anyway yep that's okay we'll deploy all right um so once we get through all of that you'll be taken to this screen where you can see mission control is indeed deploying um it usually doesn't take terribly long to uh to do oh there we go okay okay so currently deployed outstanding all right um next next we can come back to here and uh we can then contrl C out of that okay um now we have Mission Control running so I should be able to say pube control uh get pods all right um so yeah we have some things for CT manager running there um how about for the uh name space of mission Dash control hey here we go so um mission control is actually running all of this right here all right um another command that I I really should have had ready um you can see that we do have a pod running for Mission Control right here okay so let's go ahead and say um you know what I'm going to want to look at my history here let's go Mission Control du and it helps if I have a GP in there as well okay yep here we go we're going to do this um coup control exposed service Mission Control UI um we're going to do it as a type load balancer um we're going to name that with a um you know just putting an lb on the end going to do that in the mission control Nam space and we're going going to expose um port 8080 just like that all right um so now I can say something like um well let's let's clear this here and then we can say tube control get services oh yep and this is where I need Nam space mission control all right now here you can see that we do have um well first of all we have the mission control UI service but then we actually have this Mission Control UI load balancer service and the idea is that we've just created a load balancer and a way for us to actually get to the mission control UI here um so let's before trying to go here let's let's make sure that this um that this DNS entry actually actually pings oh hey look at that okay so of course you know we we block the Ping Port but um as long as you get this DNS entry resolving to an IP uh you can tell it's running so next what I'm going to do is come out here and we're going to say I think it needs to be BS and then I can paste that in and let's see if that oh you know what that's not going to work it's got to be on um 8080 there we go okay um and of course we don't have an SSL sirt on this um for production yeah you probably want to do that um but hey I can hit proceed here and Bam all right so now if I remember how I set this up um I think I just said Aaron at data.com all right and I will say accept all right we are now in data Stacks Mission Control how about that okay um as we close up here let's go ahead first thing and we're going to create a new project um that's something you're always going to want to do you know I'm just going to say um eks 6 rage uh that should work just fine okay all right um and then let's say that um I want to create a new cluster so I'm going I can either click down here or I can click up here in the corner it really doesn't matter but um so for my cluster name you know I can say um well let's see here how about fly yeah Fly by Night oh looks like I've typed that one before but that's okay all right um this is where I can pick you know whichever database I database product I want to um so if I picked pachy Cassandra you can see that version 501 is um actually at the uh at the top here but I can go all the way back down to um you know some of the versions of 311 if I want or need to um but I'm actually going to stick with um dsse and I want to stick with a 69.2 because that's the DSE version that um you know has things like uh the data API and uh Vector you know Vector is pretty important so I'm definitely going to want that um for our data center name I'm going to say Anthem let's see here uh for the rack name uh I'll just say r10 why not um I'm going to add a node Affinity label here um and you can see it kind of matches out with the uh the labels that we that we gave our our node groups um and I kind of demonstrated that like earlier in this session but if I click on that and then say affinity value of database this right here will have will cause the um the nodes created in my cluster to only be deployed to the database nodes and that's what we want um I do want to go with three nodes per rack um and you know H this is this is a small cluster we can go with four gigs of RAM that's that's fine um I showed you my storage types before of a gp3 and gp2 um I'll just go with gp3 uh we'll say stick with something small like like 20 gigs um and then I'll just go with a super user password just like that um on the off chance that there's something wrong with Ser manager I'm G to not use inter node encryption just to um just to kind of head that off there um and then let's see if we have four gig nodes let's just go with a two gig Heap that should be that should be plenty um all that is fine deploy the data API for sure and we should be okay all right so as you can see we get this message up here that says cluster created um I can actually go into my cluster here you can see that right now we don't have any nodes available or we don't have any Cassandra nodes available but um they they should be on their way up so um you know one thing that I can look at here I can say pobe control get name spaces there we go I'm gonna want to keep this um eks 6 project um Nam space you know kind of kind of stored off here because we are going to need that for some things so now if I say you know CBE control uh let's do a get [Music] pods and then I can specify my name space and then paste that in let's see what we have so far here well it hasn't found anything just yet it still might be spinning these up let's let's have a look here uh so if we say resources and pods um all right yeah yeah we actually have quite a bit here let's have a look there we go let's refresh there we go now we see our project name space up here oh ha look at that okay we have we have pods for our three nodes um that means that I should be able to see them in the command line with Cube control as well and I do see them okay okay there's still you know zero out of um zero out of two um containers running inside the pods um and you know obviously with without those two running their uh their status isn't going to be ready just yet but they're they're on the way um important to note when we we went back when we we first started today and I was talking about some of the architecture excuse me specifically with like the database node pods and I said that there were three containers that ran inside um so you had the Cy logger you had the database process and then you had Medusa um I actually did not configure backups for this cluster inside a mission control so we'll only get two containers we'll just have the CIS logger and our database processing and that'll be it um so let's rerun this again oh hey look at that we have um node number two here is starting to come up that's a good sign let me see if I um go back to Mission Control you know maybe I can uh refresh this a little bit still not showing just yet okay that's fine uh let's go here actually let's uh refresh this a little bit Yeah okay let's let's have a look at um at this pod here yep you can see here are my containers uh C the Cassandra or DSE database process um and the uh the system logger and yeah so far so good you know things are things are looking normal um not healthy yet they're still waiting for a couple of things to come up here um but but you can see that this pod does have an IP and it is running on um you know one of our one of our database nodes as well actually I could verify that by uh rerunning our our Cube control oops I missed the K Cube control get nodes um with a label of um Mission Control Data saxcom database and yeah you can see um here is um 192 168 1112 and if I go back to here you can see 192 168 1112 that is where that's where that pot is running so hey it's coming along Let's uh do a refresh let's see here on let's have a look at the pods oh hey heyy look at that we have um it looks like node zero is up let's go back to Mission Control here now those nodes should start to show up yeah we're probably not going to have a whole lot for metrics right now um yeah sometimes it takes a little bit for those um for the the nodes that get created to actually show up inside a mission control but from what I can tell here yeah we have um we have one note up here for sure you know if I if I go back and um here let's have a look at our pods and jump over to our other Nam space and have a look at node zero um yep you can see the status is running um everything looks like it's uh looks like it's up in Normal here yep system logger is running Cassandra is running yeah still don't show anything here I wonder if I can get a cql console running out there now you know what that might actually need two nodes now that I think about it yeah that's not going to work until um at least two nodes are up here let's see [Music] here yeah things have just not updated here yet oh hey we have two nodes running that's that's good yeah normally the oh ha there they are I guess it just took a few minutes for them to show up but yep you can see our three nodes are indeed here and we are waiting for uh node number two to come up still that's still in a state of starting um and yep you can see that one here has one of two one of two um containers that are that are running and Reporting back okay um so we should be just about ready to go oh there we go look at that all three are running in fact if I look here there we go so not only ha hey this is this is a good good thing to show not only do we have two out of two containers running on each node um but we also have pods out here for a cql shell for the data API and for Cassandra Reaper so uh we have a cluster up and running and in fact I should be able to go into oh look at that I get okay so if I remember right this should be Fly by Night super user one word there you go we're in our cluster all right have a look at that um obviously there's nothing out here just yet you know but I can um star from system local I can have a look at system local and see the node that we actually connected to yeah that was at um that 12209 um if I wanted to have a look at the other two nodes you know we can take a look at system. peers and yep there they are um so so yeah well that's kind of hang on a second huh all right well anyway um that's basically it that's that's how easy it is to um to spin up a Cassandra cluster once you have Mission Control in place on top of Amazon eks um so yeah that should about do it here let me uh jump back here um resources you know we have a Discord server that's uh again like our YouTube channel called Data stack developers uh it's really easy to get to it's just a discord.gg data Stacks um if you have any questions about um you know Mission Control dsse Cassandra Astra uh hcd um any of the things that we've been doing with um with Gen you know anything with langlow you know feel free to come to that Discord and and ask questions if you got them um also on here you know I I previously mentioned this as well but we have our uh data Stacks Developers YouTube channel um and that has that has a few um new playlists that that I've been putting together you know on this type of material um I referenced one video already that that kind of goes through how to build up like a like an Amazon eks cluster you know get it get it prepared a lot of the details that um that go that went behind that that went into that you know are also kind of behind the scenes in uh in this session as well um but there's all sorts of other you know good uh good material out there as well um a lot of our a lot of our earlier development was done on gcp um so if you're running on gcp you should check out some of those earlier mission control videos uh we we have a lot of good material out there on that um and yeah and of course you know check out uh data.com as well you know where you can get more information on um you know a lot of our a lot of the products mentioned in this uh session like um you know dsse hcd mission control um and that's that's basically it um I suppose I could go through and take some questions although it looks like there's just the one from Alexander and then um yeah we haven't had a whole lot of others come through yet um let's see is there no nothing nothing in the Q&A um well I guess um you know we're within uh we're within 10 minutes here so I could uh I could go ahead and call us at time but um hey thank you everyone who joined and um if you have questions on any of this you know feel free like I said to uh you know reach out on our Discord server um you know even if you you find me on LinkedIn and you got gotta ask a question you know what people do that all the time so you know feel free to ask away all right uh that's all we have thank you all so much have a great day",
