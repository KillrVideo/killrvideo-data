Denise Gosnell it's great that great to see you again David I always loved getting to do getting to do these live streams so I'm looking forward to what we're gonna get into today I I totally agree and I see some folks online I see that Frankie said I can hear both - I see some hoping that means you guys can hear everything so that is wonderful okay so with that why don't we go ahead and you know for those of you who some of you may have tuned in with us two weeks ago right we did skip over last week but we did not skip in the material right so we started off a couple weeks ago essentially going through the graph book right and I should kind of bring up on the screen by the way hopefully you guys are seeing my screen as well yes I see it on the stream wonderful so the work that we are going off of what we're based off of here is the work that denise matias have done on their graph book their new O'Reilly book the practitioners guide to graph data and if you haven't taken a look at this and you're in de Graaff database or you're just learning like how do I apply my use cases like how do I do graph this is probably one of the coolest and best ways to start on that particular journey raised down you know all sorts of ways like regularly used use cases it shows you how to like do them and that's what we're gonna do so denise is bringing me through all this material right so a couple weeks ago we started in the very beginning with chapter three and we were actually going through some of the the chapter 3 notebook that's in here but obviously now we're gonna start off where we left before right so Dennis I'm gonna stop talking and if you want to go ahead and kind of bring us in - what what's the journey today what are we gonna be looking at yeah absolutely so last time we covered your first graph data model and doing some you know your your first inserts so if you have a copy of the book a word you are looking at it online we pretty much got through about page 71 last time in chapter 13 and we're following through the example notebooks that David has pulled up right here on github so your you know you can always go back and catch up so we're we're gonna be diving in today is towards the end of the chapter three notebook so we're gonna do three things we're gonna review a very common gremlin pattern we're gonna review the where join select syntax and gremlin then we're going to take a look at the main points on when relational when it wind graph databases are better than relational databases and then we're gonna dive into the Select by pattern in grumbly so that you can essentially save data during your graph walk or your graph traversal and then select it at the end to start shaping the results of your JSON payload that you want to get back from your database so that's kind of what we have on the agenda for today and I'm following comments on multiple places over here so if you have questions ask them as you go interruptus we're watching i'm following them the YouTube stream in addition to a stream that we have up on Twitter so multiple places where we're streaming multiple places where we're getting questions coming in so keep them coming so so David I think when we want to start is kind of back in the notebook where we left off last time okay and for those of you who are just tuning in if you haven't already all the material everything we're gonna be doing is based off of the graph book repository here in github so if you go to github.com slash status ax slash graph - book and you'll find there are instructions here on how to get started with whoops how to get started with docker so I've actually started this all up sorry I've already got I've got everything running and everything it is built this is built to be extremely easy with a docker compose up to just go right it'll give you some things that you need to know here as far as like resore is you pull down the repo and you do a deck can compose up and you can kind of follow along with us if you would like to and then from there once you've done that it will start not only an instance of Deus Ex Enterprise with graph but then studio so you'll notice that I'll go to this localhost 9 0 91 that's the default port for studio I'm actually gonna step back just for a second Denise and you'll see something like this right you're gonna see a whole set of notebooks that are here this is all pre-loaded it's all already in place when you do that doctrine close up with that docker image and we are here in chapter 3 simple 360 exactly that's where we are alright so so the 31 yeah so the story we have is that most people when they're getting started with graph databases they they usually when they're thinking about what they want to build they're typically describing that they have customers and they have data connected to their customers and they want to use this graph database to go after what we commonly call like a customer 360 application and the story that we're telling in this moment is that we have that we're a banking institution or we're a global bank and we wanted to be able to answer basic questions like for this customer tell me everything that I know about that that I know in my system about that customer and so we set this up with the graph database model and you can see it if you scroll down we have our graph database schema up at the top of this chapter 3 notebook and you can see here that we have a customer as a vertex label and then we have three additional vertex labels that we've connected to that customer we have their accounts their credit cards and their loans and so these are the four vertex labels that were that we're going to be walking through during the during the examples and then we have three edges that are connecting them so a customer owes and a opens an account or a customer uses credit cards or they Alone's so we're gonna be using this data model to ask the questions so let's go ahead and oh and Frank I'm so glad to your astonishment but it worked out of the box for you that's awesome oh that's awesome so it sounds like it sounds like Frankie Witten pulled down the docker image and loaded that up asked really cool yeah awesome thanks thanks letting us know that yeah so um what we did last time is we talked about how to answer the question for this customer tell me everything that we know about them and the way I see that in in graph language I see that as the first bridge on how to understand sequel in graph traversal or graph query languages so the common pattern that everyone doesn't sequel is select select from nowhere from select oh my gosh I'm kind of forgetting and tripping on this right now David drink some water while you do that today oh I'm gonna help you up I drink some water well when we look at when we look at doing this pattern in sequel you typically do select from where right right and when I think of doing a graph traversal I see it as the exact opposite I see it as where from select and that's what we started with last time so let's go ahead and scroll down to the first query are you yeah not you not the schema stuff the actual query like yeah the actual query because that's what we left off last time yeah yep and so what you can see here is that in this query well that's the first that's the first adding vertex oh I'm sorry my bad my bad oops oops and we added a bunch of yeah that's the one that you want to see so this is where we left off exactly so here we go okay there you go so what you can see here is that this is the data we added off add it into the database last time we have some customers we have their accounts etc and so this is essentially giving you a whole picture of every piece of data we have in our graph database right now so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna get to our first set of queries which is the cell below this there we go alright so the first question that we're gonna start with is we want to start with asking for this person customer zero what credit cards do they do they use and we're gonna follow this we're join select or we're from so depending on how you want to think about it we're gonna follow this pattern to walk through the data and remember David from last time how we turned on line numbers in studio I think it's what control L that's right done there's some line numbers for you perfect perfect perfect okay so when you're doing your first graph traversal the first thing you want to think about is the reverse of that you know select from where we want to start with where so you're kind of thinking about where you're gonna start your gremlin in your graph data and on line one we're saying let's go to customer zero and we're gonna put one gremlin on that vertex maybe I shouldn't be telling you guys exactly how I think about this because you all might start thinking I'm a little nutty but that's how I see it so on line one we we said hey let's start our gremlin right there on customer zero and what we want to do is we want to go over to the credit cards because the question is which credit cards of this customer use so we start at customer zero we walk out the uses edge label and when we walk out that it's like you just walked across a bridge and now you're sitting on the credit card vertex that is connected to customer zero and we're gonna select data so it says here on line three that we're gonna select the credit card number so when I make that statement about graph traversals or these neighborhood traversals being the reverse of select from there that's exactly what I mean where do you want to start join all of your edges together and then select some data and that is the basic pattern let's start really really wrapping your mind around so you can get really good at writing graph traversal and so I just want to say this back to you right I want to make sure that I have it right and I was also following around falling along on the schema on the right hand side right so here looking at the schema I've got my customer vertex and I'm gonna find a specific customer right a specific customer vertex buy this here what the has and customer zero and then out uses so I'm actually going to traverse out over uses in the direction of the arrow and then I'm going to land on a credit card that has then related to that customer zero and then in the credit card they should have a property here not seeing my properties for some reason not seeing your properties what do you mean usually when I hover I don't know why I'm not seeing my properties in this view I can usually see so you on the on the the diagram above you see where it says columns underneath credit card yeah you want to go ahead and press that care oh that you know something you know what happened Studio has been updated and I was enough to take my steward actually hovering hovering good thing yeah there it is you can see that CC gnome right so then I I traverse over uses to go to credit card and then the property I want to get the value of is this cccc non property going back to the example you gave before from the regular cql standpoint right I would be doing the select from where I'd be saying select CC nom from you know customer where customer ID equals zero so this is this is what you mean by kind of flipping that on 10 saying where join or where from select is that right exactly okay okay I some people like this analogy I have found that people like this analogy more often than not especially if they come from a relational background mmm however if you have a journey more similar to mine where you pretty much started your development experience using those sequel databases that one might not make the bridge for you I see I guess it just kind of depends on under your personal preferences so I think I saw you'd run that and you got no data return yeah you know what I think happened I haven't left this docker container running with all of its data for last two weeks and so when I started it up brand-new I believe most of stuff is in place but I wonder if I need to add some of the date okay let's go back and add the data alright let's see I think well I'm doing it you know I should probably do this in the right order let's let me start from the beginning get you to do yeah a lot of this is already there and it has if not exists but I'm just gonna do it just to be sure I mean this is already in place yes so for those of you who are watching just to kind of summarize what David realized he needed to go back and do so last time when we set this up we had gone through all the way at the beginning and we our schema and then we inserted the data and we had ended in the middle of a traversal and when we want to start over every week we want to make sure that we have this schema set back up and then we also have all of the data inserted so what David is doing is he's going back making sure that the schema is still up-to-date inserting the data and I love that we're doing this live because this is what it was this is what it's like when you are trying to develop applications or you're trying to do something new you kind of have to pick up and drop off intermittently throughout your creation and your development experience so this is great and this actually is exactly how I just spent two years writing this book it was coming back and trying to remember where I was in the development of these examples so let's go ahead and give that it looks like you went back through and added all of the schema and the data and now we can run this query is that correct yeah that's right so we are getting the data and just to make that connection right you guys just saw me run through a bunch of rambling queries and just hit run yeah without really connecting it back there was a spot up here we had already had our schema created that's why we could see the scheme over here on the right hand side but as far as the data goes I say here you go this is the part now we're starting to add in some of the actual data right you'll see some of the gremlin traversals that I was running were not only adding so we've got the schema we've got a customer for vertex account loan credit card so on and so forth we have to actually add vertices with that data and those properties so this is what I'm doing so is that was executing these you see my add V add the you'll see that there will be some edges add edge you know here we go from Michael at sea c-17 so this is what was missing and this is what I needed to add in and now that I've done that it looks like things are operating as I would expect awesome perfect and that's and that's great I love that we got to do that live David because I I kind of have this internal conviction that if you're if you're going to if you're breaking something you're going in the right direction yeah right I I don't know I I love having that moment live to just demonstrate the fact that you tried something and it wasn't working and we just kind of figured it out because that's that's what you have to do when you're getting started and learning a new technology you just you have to go with it and and understand and and figure out how to translate your error messages into what you need to fix awesome thanks for showing that cool so what we want to do is we want to keep going in the questions and we want to build up eventually to answering the most valuable question and the most valuable question that we work with companies around the world to solve is for this individual customer tell me everything and do that with like X you know very very short amount of code and so that's what we're building to here as we go through these examples so what we just showed you was from walking from customer zero how to find their credit card information okay we're gonna do the same thing but we're gonna walk a different direction we want to go figure out what accounts that that customer owns and that is the question that we have pulled up here on the notebook and so you can see the schema on the right hand side and you can follow along so let's take the picture first in the code second so the picture on the right hand side we can see that you're gonna start at a customer and in order to get to an account you have to walk through this edge called owns so imagine in your head already the way we're gonna build this query is a star customer we're gonna walk through emmalin's and we're gonna end up on an account so for those of you who like pictures which is very much me and why I love graph technology that's when I see in my head so let's go back over to the code on the left and let's actually walk walk through the Grum one that does that statement and protip line numbers love them my bad my bad one of these days I'll get all your pro tips all at once and you'll never have to say it again until then everyone can live gets to watch me no that's okay wait for your test yeah so David actually do you want to flip this one how about you give it a go walking through the we're joined select pattern firm yeah let's do it so it looks like here trying to answer the question which accounts is this customer owned yeah we ready not aware of the fact that we have a customer vertex and it looks like we're starting from the same customers before so we're answering this we're answering other questions about the same question or the same customer we had a moment ago so here we're using our has to essentially do our where so where in my graph do I have a customer vertex with a property customer ID that is equivalent to customer zero exact we're starting there that's my where right so it's gonna start here with that particular customer then I want to traverse out my owns edge and again these are directional so I see my out my owens direct my owns edge is in the direction from customer to account making the relationship from customer to accounts then and that was on line two here and then at line three if I take a look at account and now do this part right we see that I have an account ID is a property that is in my account vertex and I want to get the value of that so very similar to what we did a moment ago right this is actually really easy so instead of going customer uses credit card I'm essentially just saying I want to find the account what accounts this customer owns customer Ellen's account and that's where I have customer owns there's my join an account we see that it's count 14 they own one account account 14 perfect that's it yeah you got it right you got it right live stream just for anyone anyone following either live or on the replay what what David just basically said it was written on page 72 in the book that we're going through so I don't know David if you had memorized that but that was pretty much verbatim no I didn't actually and I'm going to page 72 here we're gonna see if denise has her pages memorized which I have no doubt that she probably does it well I'm cheating I have a hard copy of it right oh and there it is the boom yeah okay okay cool cool cool sweet so I think on this on this next query okay we wanted to get fancier we wanted to get fancier with the JSON payload so so far on that last one you were just recurrent returning just returning the account number and yeah sir thank you so much for the question can you can you zoom in a little bit David to make your code larger oh let me see we'll look let me do it so let us know after he does this zoom here if that works for your was that it yeah let me know if that's better for you yeah by the way while we're while we're stopped for a second Anissa I do see a question here from Kamal okay in YouTube can you please highlight the main differences between graph and no sequel DBS such as Cassandra in which you in which case you pick one instead of the other Kamal that is a fantastic fantastic question the main differences between graph and no sequel to B's that's also a very heavy loaded question so come out what we do have is we have a table that we can actually go to now since we're I'm in David you still have table 3 to pulled up right I do what do you know boom oh cool all right so come on what I would like to do is kind of zoom in on this table that we have it's table 3 2 and chapter 3 maybe make that a little bit larger if you don't mind yeah I was already anticipating that request here you go awesome awesome so come on fantastic question yeah sir said the zoom is great so thanks so much David for doing all that the way I like to think about just one specific component of the question that you just asked kamal is from the relational comparison from relational to graph now there are so many different ways to take could take that question and i know we have tons of content but let's just zoom in on one of them for a moment if you if you're ok with that and i like to think about relational versus graph on these three axes i like to think about it from a data modeling perspective representing relationships and then the complexity of queries and when you go through the relational thought process and then the graph database thought process the main wins that you're gonna get across the board on relational is the fact that they've been around for decades so when it comes to experience and documentation relational databases are gonna have a lot more documentation out there so if you're having a problem with a query or trying to understand how to design a schema or optimize and index google your way through it yeah yeah so that's that's one that's one way to think about where relational is always going to win it's gonna be faster to develop with relational right now because the documentation is way better and way more expansive on the other hand the reason that practitioners like myself and our colleagues at data saxon are you know our peers around the world are using graph databases is because this the because of the simplicity that you get when you're thinking about your data in a model all the way down to how its represented on disk there's not very many steps of transformation not as many per se that you would have when you're doing relational so let's think about it from a data modeling perspective and then relationships and then query is talking about graph databases so when we are doing those questions just a few moments ago we were able to have a picture on the right hand side and then write a query that was essentially walking through your data so when i think about data modeling i like to talk about how the digital representation of your graph data it matches how humans intuitively think about their problem and the connectedness of your problem and because of that it makes it a heck of a lot easier to model relationships and your data so if if you're thinking about do I need a graph database the question I would encourage you to really think about is do you care about the relationships that exist within your data is that the most important part of your problem if that is one of the most important parts of your problem then you absolutely are gonna want to use a graph database to model it and query it it's gonna simplify that mental model that you have all the way through the technology stack and the persistence you have on disk and you're in your computer so to me that's kind of the first two points about graph databases and for the third point here about queries we were showing you how I've translated or how we commonly translate the where joint select pattern to teach gremlin or to teach graph traversal as a way to give a bridge from the land of sequel if you think about how massive those inner joins or the left joins or whatever style of joined think about how long that query becomes when you're having to write out all of those joint statements yeah yet how beautifully simple and short it is when you just type the three characters of out or in or you would you like a more expressive language that's really where you start to see some benefits now yeah I was gonna say we do have a few pages back in that book we do have the join syntax for those queries oh do you really oh okay because I would you know resource I've used before is SQL the gremlin which really illustrates exactly what Denise was just talking about really niet in a neat way like you can you can take some kind of known query patterns and you can compare what does it look like in gremlin compared to what this looks like an SQL and when you're dealing with the kind of things that Denise is just talking about where the focus is on relationships the the complexity of some SQL queries to be able to do the types of things that you can do in a much much simpler way with gremlin is you can really see it than the queries you said so if I scroll back here there's an example oh yeah head on over to page 60 and yes go back okay and you'll see the sequel for the queries that we've been doing in oh really I you know I didn't realize oh here we go much you far I'll swear okay I see what you're doing like here's an example so in chapter 3 now we jumped for these live streams we jump straight to teaching the gremlin but in chapter 3 we went ahead and implemented it in foal in Postgres so that you guys could see a comparison side-by-side that was age 58 yep you can stop right right there so there's one example so when we were doing the gremlin when we're doing the gremlin statements don't mind me I'm gonna actually you know stop moving around while you're talking here in a moment drying so you're trying to show them side by side yes perfect I love it okay gives you an idea yeah it does it start to does start to give you an idea on the left what you're looking at here on this during now is the join syntax for joining customers to owes and loans tables and selecting some data and on the right you're looking at the gremlin syntax for doing something very similar so depending on how deep you want to go in your relational versus graph comparison I highly recommend that you head on over to where data stacks is hosting these chapters for free and you can get you can get the book chapters directly from data sacks and once I have a moment I will find that link and drop it into the youtube comment section so you guys can see it but essentially that's what's happening here on the left hand side we're doing a multi a three-way join and that's the same thing we're doing on the right hand side so that you can see how to look at the gremlin syntax versus the relation seq all syntax and I would actually say this is even a simple example right you can get into some really fun fun hairy examples yeah and I know that that was someone who I had in mind actually when I was heading over to SQL the gremlin there's some really cool examples out there where they will show you you know they will compare them both I was actually looking to see if there was I haven't been in here for a while honestly left joint or something right you'll start to see examples where they will show you SQL on the nexus and gremlin and give you a feel and as you get into some of the more sophisticated and complex queries and such an SQL you'll you'll start to see this divergence of what it looks like yep yeah and then I'm Frank great question coming in on YouTube and by the way depending on where you are watching this stream most of the comments and conversations are happening on the YouTube stream so if you want to be answering or asking questions in a place that you know that we're looking that is where we're looking at that helps so Frank had a great question you seem to be implying that graph queries we much faster to execute and that is I don't know the right word for it but that technically I know is a trap because depending on all we want to go into that question it depends right there's a ton of landmines there and that response of what I can say to that Frank but here's what I will say depending on how you implement them most of the time when you're using relational system you are joining across the entire table of information and then doing a filter before you specifically walk through just one relationship to another piece of data now if you're a deep user of relational technology you know how to properly set up your join tables and indexes to avoid that however my point is that out of the box when you are using graph technology and you start with just this one customer and you walk out their edges to their respective joined pieces of data that's going to be the fastest way to query just the relationships that are important within your data so the real answer once you get down to the design and implementation of relational versus graph it really comes down to whether or not relationships between pieces of data are the most important concepts that you have and that you need to store and query for your database so it sounds like Frank may be wondering if I ever have the chance to meet you in person we could have a really fun long long debate about the implementation of each of these systems but that's how I see it hopefully Frank that was helpful and you know I provided a link to all of our thoughts on this topic that we have for free in Chapter three so thanks so much for asking questions and come all let us know if that was a it looks like Kamal said thanks so much for taking the time to explain these differences awesome if you have any more questions keep coming love them so I loved it when you guys asked questions as we're doing this okay so before we went down the kind of zooming back up we were doing some queries and then we went down a planned detour into the differences of different types of databases so we're coming back up now and we're gonna get back to learning new new query skills for working with graph data sound good sounds good to me wait so what we were doing at this point is the last query we had we started at customer zero I think we walked out to their account and then like just grabbed their account ID right all right and yeah matter of fact that's really more like this slide except getting the property of the account ID at this point because it looks like we're gonna do something little bit more here exactly and I think that that's the first three lines right guys one two and three okay there's some line numbers we're thank you yeah cuz you know I totally read your mind without you having to at all give me any you know indication you might want I'll prawns but thanks I don't know I can't get around quite like writing code unless I have line numbers so it just is very helpful for me I'm with you oh thank you okay cool so here's what's gonna do usually when you are implementing databases and you're building up api's within your internal services there's traditionally and very often there's some type of language that you end up writing and developing for your team and it essentially becomes like the jinx on you know expected guidelines of how you're going to share data between applications so it's great and useful that we know how to walk through graph data but it would be much better if we were able to build more robust payloads or to actually start to enforce the fact that you want this query to return data in a certain JSON structure and so that's what we're doing here at this example we want to do the exact same query we want to start a customer zero and get their account information but now I want to start enforcing certain structure to the JSON payload that's going to come back from this query and that's what's happening right here in order to enforce that JSON payload what we needed to do is we kind of needed just label or in my mind as I'm walking through my graph data leave and read crumbs if you like him you know Hansel and Gretel stories but you need to label or leave breadcrumbs as you move throughout your graph data that you can recall where that information was and pull it forward into your your result payload and that's that's mostly how I explain this or think about it in my mind but let's actually walk through the code okay so in line one we're doing the same thing we're starting with that reverse idea of where join select so we're telling our gremlin traverser where to start in the data start me at customer zero so all of you guys are thinking about that now your mind kind of imagine that you're standing on one vertex in your graph it's customer zero what you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead and label that or leave a breadcrumb there and you're gonna put a label down and says this is my customer that's what's happening on line two at that point you're gonna walk away you're gonna walk away from the customer and you're gonna walk through the owns edge and you're gonna stop now on an account so now we're on line four and now that you're on that account you're gonna leave a label on that vertex and you're gonna call it account at this point we have two labels that you've left in your data you've left a label on your customer vertex you walked and then left a label on your account vertex now what we want to do is we want to do a select by or we want to actually create some shape to the JSON that you're gonna return from this result and that's what's happening on line five six and seven so on line five you're gonna say I want to select the customer and the account label so now you've selected two labels line six is what you do for the first label line seven is what you do to the second label they're applied in a round robin fashion okay so select customer and then on line six you're gonna do what is written on line six to your customer label now remember we stored the customer label on the customer vertex so we it's it's valid from our data model just say we'll give me that name that's select by now essentially select the customer by their name that's what's happening between line five and six sound good David yeah yeah yeah keep going keep going I was kind of highlighting you you're doing it to see if I've got that right yeah I do have a question in a moment but I'll I'll let you finish okay cool cool so the second part of your select by is to remember that you left a label on your account vertex so you're gonna say I need to select that label and now you're gonna go to line seven and you're gonna show that label by account ID okay here's my question oh I'm sorry geez good warez yeah the thing to remember here is that when you have these select statements and then you have your by modulators which that's what they call in gremlin Nadja leaders these by modulators are applied round-robin to your elements in your select statement so the first by modulator goes to the first thing the second by modulator goes to the second thing and that keeps going until they run out or they start over at the beginning with that how you get the nice JSON structure you see at the bottom so you see that customer is then associated to the name and account is associated to your account ID and you can see so if I added a third if I add a third one in here let's say that I also wanted to get some loan information or credit card or something like that I would obviously have to traverse to that but then as long as I created this as this label this breadcrumb well then I could also add that in here I could add another by value to get it one of those properties and was essentially round-robin 1 2 3 to that third vertex I put in if I had gone through that process absolutely and and in chapter 4 we create deeper we add another layer around this data we add transactions that are like sharing data or sharing essentially passing account value to and from your credit cards and your loans or your accounts okay and then we do start getting fancy look like I need to leave multiple breadcrumbs or I need to have multiple pieces of data and make really complex JSON structures that's coming up in Chapter four but not yet for this I don't want to keep it in the keepest in the the shallow water here got it got it so something I just so here's the extra question I had I want to see can I get both Izzie on the screen at the same time kinda yeah yeah I can't okay cool so originally when we were starting at customer zero we were traversing over the owns edge going to the their account and getting their account ID okay now in this example we're starting your customer zero again and then we're setting that breadcrumb right let's just pretend for a second I didn't do that but then I'm so I go customer zero I go out over the owns edge I'm getting to the account vertex their account vertex and if I would have tried to do this select like this with customer account but I didn't set those bread crumbs that wouldn't work right I need to have that reference created so if I'm gonna use the selectors in a true statement I need to first have my ads or set those labels set those breadcrumbs so that I can then access them later with my selection exactly okay okay I just want to make sure I had that part right so this essentially means that and I think it sounds like you're alluding to in chapter 4 we're gonna get more to this but if I hang out even more complex traversal than when deeper and deeper that I could actually use as was selects to essentially get to a previous point my gremlin was standing on even though I may be in a different point my traversal later yes okay cool that's that's one way but yes okay okay me cool ready yes I just went yeah we have the data I would expect okay cool all right should I move on Wow yeah and I think this actually brings us to our last example in Chapter I know I feel like we're gonna make it to chapter 4 today I'm so excited yeah and I want to make sure I didn't lie is this the last one main oh yeah yeah yeah we're close I mean so essentially I think I think this is that's one of the main final concepts because we essentially do the exact same thing now but we just do it again with a different section of the data Oh right now we're looking at instead of customer 0 we're looking at customer 4 yeah but this time though we're trying to get their loan right okay or whatever loans they may have exactly and we've done it we've walked from the customer to their credit cards we've walked from the customer to their accounts so the last thing to really look at is how you walk from the customer to their loan and then after that how do you just start at the customer and go anywhere and tell me everything so that's kind of the direction these queries are going so we start back at the beginning and we say hey start this customer walk out the O's edge and get back go to the loans and give me the loan IDs and yet right here okay yep and not just reinforces that same pattern of where join select right right and I think to having another you know I'm just seeing this for the first time honestly having another example of a different customer doing the same thing I was like okay simple enough right I just want to pull particular customer at a particular ID there you go so now I'm studying starting at customer for not customer zero and I can I mean this is actually pretty simple to follow right I feel like these traversals I can just follow out these edges right to the other vertices and now in this case I happen to have multiple loans right it's not a single loan so you can see that now I'm actually pulling back all of those properties because there are multiple loans so that would actually mean then if I've got this right that in this case and I think this is something neat about graphing we've kind of talked about I think we talked about this last time where here I have a single customer but they actually have we're walking out all those edges correct to all instances of loan vertices that this customer hit may have so would this be private representative of two different loan vertexes that are joined customer for correct and it's not I also want to make sure that I don't need the language is hard and you know you're only walking through two O's edges not every OS edge in your entire database just two right right and is that specifically because we start with our where and there's only two O's edges from customer for to begin with exactly and back that's actually a really good point um because that that difference in thinking about your problem is one of the main areas to start to if you can see that that's one of the main areas where I start to see people commonly understanding oh that's my graph is faster because we're just going to customer for and we're only considering the two edges that are connected to customer for customer for not the entire edge list right because you're filtering first and then going from there you're not starting by walking and then filtering after the fact correct yep I see yep yep and yes so then this really brings us to like the big aha moment of graphs in my opinion for this last query what do we know about this customer this is starting at customer what zero is that yep yep yeah zero again and what this is doing is that it's starting at zero and it's walking out all edges at the same time that that are connected to customer zero and then it's getting you all of the data about everything connecting to customer zero so if you are watching this now we're on a replay think about how you would join all four of these tables of data together and sequel yeah you would need at least three separate inner join statements and that statement actually is we don't need to scroll back into the book David but if you do want to see it it's on page 60 and it shows you how you have to bring together five different left joins in order to make this work in a relational system yeah so it should be just a few pages to load this one okay oh yeah it is right yeah it's it's 60 to 61 I couldn't get it to be on one panel yeah I think we get the idea though yeah exactly okay yeah so the exact same query we're looking at right now I've shown me everything about my customer is the same relational query that splits 6261 that were that we're looking at right here I don't know I would much rather um use the shorthand version this I also do know that my brain for some reason just likes the gremlin cry language or the idea of walking walking through your data and having a very expressive style of query language for it but but that exact same thing is what's happening right here yeah yeah and honestly I feel like I feel like this is a very powerful note because I mean I most of us who are doing this to some degree right we've probably spent years in SQL you know and I've spent 20-something years right doing stuff with relational databases and so this is a very very familiar nomenclature in syntax and such and to do that I feel like though looking at the difference between having to explicitly put in my left joins and that kind of deal compared to just hang out and once you understand right like I've got these out edges and that there's this relationship between the the customer vertice or vertex and the rest of these I find this to actually be quite powerful that I can just say okay give me all of those yeah and then that's it and I can just get that data right right and I mean now any any computer scientist who's following this knows that like this worked and just disappear right instead of instead of doing the work of connecting your data together on query graph databases connect your data together on disk at the schema level so it's the combination of your graph database with an expressive traversable query language that allows for the simplicity that we're looking at here so what still exists you handle it when you set up your schema and you handle it when you write your data into the database so that your reads are much easier yeah and you know matter of fact I noticed that Frank over in YouTube mentioned the shorter version squares and rehabilitates debug easier yeah totally right I think this is a lot easier to grok this is once you understand this pattern it's a lot easier to grok than having to read many many many many lines of SQL to understand the relationships between your data absolutely and kamal a fantastic question about efficiently handling pagination and Crumlin I have a resource for you I'd love to point you towards how we do pagination using Java I believe it's the example that we had on to show you how to do that so Kamal if you want to connect with me on Twitter or send me a DM or whichever way is easiest for you I'd be happy to point you in the right direction to show you how to do that and have a discussion offline cuz yeah it's a fantastic question I think though right now we're in like you know six to twelve inches of water and you're in life meet in the defense but I love where you're going so let me come join you over there and I'd love to help you out Don some us snorkel gear ironically I think like the first themes that are connecting together where you are and your examples in this book is relates them all to learning how to Train and learning how to scuba dive and where you are in the depth of water you know what's kind of funny about that is I have a closet full of scuba gear because both my wife and I are scuba certified my wife actually is an instructor and in my mind as you were as you were saying that I was having this terrible joke you guys in chat can tell us if she really wants to do this as we get further along these chapters we just start donning more and more snorkel and scuba gear until we're like fully fully scuba doubt yeah what's really funny David is that I was a swimmer in college and so I'm pretty sure I have flippers and like awesome so that you know this actually is a good a good starting a good starting point if you want to fire up the notebook for chapter 4 we can show people we're going next week yeah do I want to do data generation or neighborhood yes dev I'm neighborhood neighborhood okay neighborhood yes so we already have the data generation part in place correct because we do in the docker image you guys already pre-loaded it we do yep and so next week we'll talk about the difference between those chapter 4 notebooks so if you kind of caught that in a going wait what's happening don't worry about it we'll cover that next week but here's what we're gonna go now so the idea of this neighborhood exploration or or customer 360 like it's the most common place that almost everyone starts when they're using graph technology and so in chapter 3 we spent a lot of time and we basically spent a few episodes now in this lab stream getting set up and walking through Chapter three so at this point we have a really good idea of when relational systems are better and versus when graph databases are going to be better hint if relationships are the most important piece of your data the answer is craft databases and we want to walk through and starting to understand how you can think about Grum line with the where join select syntax from here we're gonna add a whole nother layer of data into our data model and that's what David can kind of scroll a little bit and show us here on the screen okay I think that if that's the whole thing right yeah so this is the story that we're gonna start with next week so now we've expanded a little bit out from the idea of having your customers and just like their basic bank account information and now we want to start to model this idea of transactions and transactions that are coming from your account to your credit cards and your loans maybe you are paying off your credit card with with your your checking account or you're using your checking account to pay a loan and also your credit cards have these transactions when you went to shop at making your target or any other type of store and so we have all the data loaded into the system so that we have lots of transactions and a lot of data to start walking through and practicing different ways to shape your shape your results so that you have consistent consistent JSON payloads and other types of checks and guarantee me is kind of like thinking through like the the try accept patterns or if-then-else kind of patterns when you're writing gremlin that's where we're going next week but with the bigger data model one neighborhoods of data and a little bit more in a date in the back so cool okay so Dee Denise do you want to you want to stop there as far as like the material or you want to go on and because it seems like a good stopping point to then start up again next week yeah up here and then next week we're not gonna get into loading data yet because I do just want to keep practicing and thinking about neighborhoods of data and I want to just kind of keep going through and reiterating how you work through traversals so that's where we're getting the bigger picture or the foundation set of how to use graph data how to think and graph data and how to answer higher valued questions thinking about relationships and so we're going to keep doing that and once we get to chapter 5 is when we're gonna pull the covers back one more layered layer down and show you how to you know use partition keys and Cassandra to load your data in with DES bulk and do some of those you know more performance optimized aspects that are happening here but we're kind of skipping over those details right now is that sound good oh no David I happen to not be able to hear you anymore yeah I think they're gonna they're gonna work on getting that fixed because I can't hear David so maybe you guys are still hearing me here but it looks like once we switched we lost the audio of it I can hear you again now David oh good okay I don't know what happened there but what I'm gonna say is just as a quick follow up for those of you have been following along if again if you want to take a look at this material yourself if you go to github.com slash data stacks slash graph - book and if you follow the instructions here in this docker QuickStart it literally takes a moment and you can have the whole setup running in Decker with all the data pre-loaded and everything you can start working walking through these notebooks yourself you'll find that the notebooks even though we're going through them they do a really nice job of like explaining everything as you go so it's it's really quick and easy and it's a nice way to start exploring yeah and come all ranked you guys were asking some amazing questions today yes yes so if you are comfortable with it I have extra copies of this book here with me right next to me and me an email if you would like a free copy of this book I will send it to you if you're ok with that I would have to then know an address to reach you but you're comfortable I left my email in the YouTube the comments and you are welcome kamal or frank to send me an email and I will send you a book that's awesome me I wish you'd send me a book mine I can send you a book there David yeah and with that honestly for any of you who are listening right now whether it's myself or Denise if you have any follow-up questions anything else come reach out you know we're all over social medias knees just said we're in LinkedIn we're on Twitter we're out here if you ask pretty much anyone from Deus Ex will get you the right people so feel free to please come out and interact and and with that why don't we go ahead and close it up thank you again Denise for bringing me through this I learned all sorts of new stuff and I'm excited to get in Chapter four next week and thank everyone for tuning in for another graphing code with Dave and Denise thanks guys have a good day thanks for listening to the distributed data show please subscribe with your favorite
