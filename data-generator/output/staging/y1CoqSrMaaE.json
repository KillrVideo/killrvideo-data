  "title": "DataStax open-sources Fallout: Distributed Testing System",
  "description": "When it comes to mission-critical infrastructures like Apache Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise, ensuring the system is fault-tolerant and stable throughout operational and failure scenarios is key.\nTesting fault tolerance has largely been the domain of distributed systems experts. The intractable scope of the problem space and the complexity of repeatedly creating and exercising the functions within a distributed system has left us reliant on the intuition of these experts to guide us.\n\nLast month, DataStax open-sourced Fallout: a web service that turns complex fault tolerance testing into a declarative property driven format. In this video, Sean McCarthy and Aleks Volochnev discuss what DataStax Fallout is and invite you to join our upcoming Fallout Workshop https://youtu.be/45iTmTBjU0M  In this workshop, we will show you how to use Fallout so you can test how your system will react to the real world in a simple and methodical way.\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX DEVS\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\nDiscord: https://bit.ly/datastaxdevs\n\nABOUT DATASTAX DEVELOPERS\nOn the DataStax Developers YouTube channel, you can find tutorials, webinars and much more to help you learn and stay updated with the latest information on Apache Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise©.

    "text": "hello everyone that's Alex valium developer advocate at data stacks and today with me Sean McCarty senior software engineer from dueling and infrastructure teams at data stacks and we are going to speak about a really great thing recently data stacks open source at a testing system called add fell out and Sean was one of the guys working on this tool so we are going to ask him hey Sean what's the fallout and why should we care hi Alex yeah thanks I'm I'm pretty excited to talk about fallout it's become a pretty core service we run a data stacks for a lot of our mission-critical testing what fallout does is it's a web service that provides Jepson style distributed system testing in a declarative and property driven format velvet sounds great and you know I'm a big fan of all the open source pink I believe it's a really great way to make our world a little bit better place why it was decided to open source this project because well you know most of my companies try to hide everything and we just decided to share it to the world how it happened sure so follow it was a project which emerged out of the cassandra test world to solve the sort of last stage of testing that we didn't have really any any solution for at that time when we started developing fallout there were the Cassandra unit tests which ran in the JVM and were concerned with the correctness of a single node and the components within that note we had the D test suite which is concerned with the integration between nodes but there was that sort of last step we wanted to take when you're talking about a real system at a real scale doing real operations and facing real failures mm-hmm so this is a style of testing which is certainly very important for databases and distributed systems and we approached it in a way which enables the style of testing that's generalizable just to sort of any distributed system so you know you can take a style of testing where you look at a system perform a series of actions against it log the results and and collect artifacts Macross that system and then run checkers over those artifacts and logs this is that the Jepson style of testing which has been integral in finding linearize ability and fault tolerance errors in distributed databases of all kinds but this style of testing is fairly difficult it is there's an enormous test space or problem space to cover in terms of every conceivable configuration and data model and operation and failure scenario early on when I was working at data stacks we had defined a matrix of these configurations that we thought would cover sort of every conceivable Cassandra cluster and when we sat down and did the math we realized we had hundreds of trillions of unique tests we wanted to run which would take hundreds of millions of years and cost the GDP of a small country I mean this is really just a kind of right it's insane it really just to kind of express the the sheer insanity of the scope that you can test here and so fallout takes a lot of the intuition and difficulty and and mechanical drudgery of creating the systems and executing these actions again instead and bring it into a much more accessible and methodical sort of style of testing so fallout acts sort of as an orchestration layer on top of existing tools so you can abstract away the creation and operation of distributed systems and and just focus on exploring that problem space mmm-hmm that's that's great yeah actually it was my first question when I first heard what data stacks releases open sources fell out I was like okay that's here 2020 and to be have some testing tools why do we need one more and what makes it special to the in comparison with ours yeah it's it's exactly this thing it's in the level of convenience and enabling automation around exploring this space I can follow it doesn't quite aim to replace any specific tool we found over the years that fallouts really at its best when it's making use of existing tooling so we've taken this Jepson model of ax log and check and generalized it just enough that whatever artifact a tool or software is creating whether it's it's system logs or just some you know the output of disk free something like that whatever it is you know fallout can capture it and and run analysis against it great and what kind of tools we can use under the hood I mean if fallout is the like orchestration system for testing like what the tools it can use to orchestrate right so we really haven't come up against the limitation or we've never found a tool that we can't hook into fallout is comprised of a couple of core api's and and the one of the three big ones is a life cycle API so it offers some stages where we expect to hook into any sort of particular tool when that's if that's a provisioning installing software operating the software you know we have a very thin API layer which provides information and access to the underlying system so you can run that tool and sort of whatever way it needs to be and this lets fall out again abstract out to just an orchestration layer so you can do things in a you know declarative property driven manner bringing sort of all the different operations that you'd want to execute against the system any sort of performance you know benchmarking stressing that you'd want to execute a system and then chaos just great chaos testing air yeah it's great it's it's a really really great thing and great topic but well okay my next question would be not really a question like talk is cheap show me the code or in this case say can you show me a little bit of how it works sure so I've got here a instance of fallout running in our in our data center this is this is actually the fallout instance I've been using to test the open source Fork we released earlier this month so you can see it's it's a normal website you can do there's a user management which is sort of lonely since it's just me you know users have a profile so that you can add credentials to specific services you know the follow we open source is the components we've released were really focused on kubernetes so here you can add you know Google cloud service accounts to gain access to gke and G cloud that sort of things you know you have test management you can see I've been running a couple of things so it's really simple right I've defined this test which does a simple performance benchmark against gke and I'll show you the definition in a second right but it really just comes down to a button great that that's it this test will run we can go into this test and sort of watch the output as it's being executed it did sort of jump ahead to the boring part where it's just waiting there you go it's streaming live very exciting stuff and so this is just a gamal format you can define the different node groups you want provisioning on gke with the properties install all kinds of services and configure them in kubernetes here we are creating a deployment of no SQL bench which is another open source another tool we've recently open sourced for performance benchmarking and stressing here we are hooking into the new data stacks Cassandra operator and then we've defined what's just a very simple test where you initialize the Cassandra schema do a little JVM warm up and then run an actual benchmark mm-hmm great and how long does it take to run the test like this one with this one's fairly quick we're only running a million queries only a million queries right it takes about 25 minutes to create the system run the benchmark and tear everything down having collected the artifacts so at the end of it sorry good yeah I wanted to ask you to run this test to show to us how it works but we can't wait for 25 minutes for it to finish so maybe you can run it but show us four results of an hour test I mean like three views from previous build yeah exactly this is one of the great things about Fallout is it's it's reliable and repeatable machine it's it's doing the same steps in the same order you know given the same definition right so while I start kicked off a run just a minute and a half ago we can go look at this is this previous run and get a sense of the same output so one of the the core features of fallout is collecting artifacts from across the system interesting artifacts in this case are HDR files which characterize performance and are an output up no SQL bench we also have Cassandra system logs from the Cassandra pods yikes that formatting is a little bit terrifying and not very interesting but you know so you get the point la artifacts are collected from around the system and they can be processed and validated so one of the most common checks we do is performance checks this is a sort of simple performance chart just to get a quick sense of the characterization that performs characteristics of this test so here you can see the operations per second the throughput and we can switch this to a latency chart we could switch this to you know differently it's these charts just to get a sort of quick check from a holistic perspective you know that means including all of the clients great I mean like that's really great and of course it works not only with Cassandra or data stacks Enterprise but basically you can configure it to work with any distributed system absolutely right again you know fallouts very uh opinionated about hooking into a system it's a it's a very thin very generalizable api talking to different tools and software I can say it looks really great and well at some point of my software - my career in software development I started to work mostly live distributed systems and it was pretty rough transition because after Ramana lit existence it was level of course there are a lot of great things you know and a lot of very positive changes I would say in comparison with monoliths but when you start to try to test it when you have multiple actors over the world it gets really really really hard so I see that's great actually how long it took to develop data stacks fell out how long cause it's in the development so we development was started I think in late 2015 and it was it was seeking to serve a fairly narrow purpose of correctness testing and particularly automating correctness testing very much in a style of Jepson and and over time the scope of Foss ort of increased more and more into you know fault tolerance performance characteristics debugging streaming and compaction you know mimicking the clusters and environments of our customers and so as the the scope kept growing I think about mid 2017 we we had a team that would my team became dedicated to developing fallout and some of our other internal tooling I see so you took a while but the air it looks great my next question is like what's the tools behind that I mean which language which I don't know libraries what's what's there and what stands behind the data stacks fall out sure so father is written in Java yeah not very surprising right which makes very accessible to to I think a broad audience yeah Jepson is written enclosure so it's running in the JVM we have a wrapper around Jepsen so that we can hook into all of the other stuff yeah written in Java the web service is built on drop wizard I think we use nginx for most of the you know serving artifacts and webpages you know we have Python CLI tools we hook into CLI tools from you know internal CLI tools that we've developed see a lot of tools like cube control and g-cloud yeah it's it but it's mostly Java I see well yes so my last question for today what do you think fall out has a big future so do you expect it will be really so great and convenient for people to use so a lot of companies and projects will start to use it well I mean I hope so it's certainly been very useful to us here at data stacks like I think I said earlier you know it powers a lot of our mission-critical testing whether that's performance regression pipelines mimicking customer environments to validate their workloads and and their systems and fall out itself is generalizable to distributed systems as a whole abstractly and this kind of testing is something that really anybody running a distributed system I think wants to achieve you can understand the stability of your system you can get a better you know you can you can have confidence that your system is going to behave predictably when you go through the normal operations distributed system is going through and when you're experiencing failures that every distributed system will experience so you can take your distributed system and really push it you really stress it out really hammer on it and cause problems to make sure that you're not gonna experience those in production and you know your engineers are going to be getting paged at 11 p.m. on a Saturday night so I think the utility here is very general very very much necessary for a lot of people at this time yeah definitely world getting more and more distributed I mean IT world and that's great so now we are having something very special to everyone who watches this video or in general and the people who interested in to the testing of distributed systems you know I work as a developer advocate a developer relations team of data stocks and our job is to upgrade our users and we'll love this job so this one we are going to have very soon open free completely free workshop of what's for Fallout and how to use it with very practical exercise steps so everyone will be able to wash it attend it and do the exercise and learn how fallout works and that's really great shun you will lead with a workshop I believe yeah that that sounds right I guess well what I'm really hoping to bring to the workshop is an understanding of all the different you know people who interact with fot the users who are just interacting with the UI developers who are extending into new systems and new tools and then the people who will operate fallout and actually provide it as a service to to to users so I think going to workshop you'll come away with a really holistic perspective on how to use Fallout and how to have a really integrated into your systems great and I will be your assistant on it to help to set everything up and make this workshop shine and it's going to happen what was the date I think we're thinking May 13th May 30 rounds about correct but in general subscribe to our Channel and get all the notifications of the upcoming streams that really makes use butter stronger Thank You Shawn it was very interesting yeah thanks for having me Alex a lot of fun and see you at the workshop looking forward to it",
