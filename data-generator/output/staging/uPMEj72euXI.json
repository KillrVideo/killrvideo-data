and hello welcome to Friday's off-the-cuff c-sharp our this one specifically put together by yours truly to refocus the Kisan d'sky ma migrator or as I'm calling it the casma project and get some focus around the actual coding of the project where everything is so basically to set level or level set however you want to say it where we are with the project and how to get involved what we're doing with the project what it actually is and and kind of get it out as this this episode out as a starting point for getting involved checking out using hacking on the project itself so during this session I'm gonna break out we're gonna go through a few items of what I want to cover and then if anybody has any questions during the session I'll stop at multiple points and we can ask questions talk about it or whatever but also I'll break out notes that I will post somewhere on the repo if I'm gonna make a directory in the repo or put it on the wiki or something like that we'll figure it out in just a little bit here but I'll break out notes for each of the sections and a time point was in this video so we can look back and use it as a reference for how to get started with the project and how to get involved and of course how to use the project once we get it to a buildable useable executable point so with that let's bounce over and take a look at where the project is and let's talk about the project itself right so go out we have have it on github [Music] I'll just call it casi schema migrator and this is the repo here a pretty standard repo got to read me we have a build running over on Azure pipelines I have my Twitter accounts here so you can bounce into either one of those and ping me anytime you want to and then some good first issues right here right now want to get a logo put together set up some basic documentation for the application I'm not sure what that exactly entails I would be happy to get some assistance with it it's a pretty good first step first issue to go with and then also need to set up the outputs for Mac OS Linux and Windows that's something that can be done almost at anytime again love to get some help on that it's a good first issue to work from the build pipeline itself and then I don't have to look at that a little bit more but anyway this is making a point to keep a clean list of good first issue items to dive in with and then the overall issues are here that include a bunch of everything that needs to be done and then that contributors tag needs to eventually go to let's go to a page that will show more specific steps on how to contribute to the project and how to get involved here's our good last build of the project over on Azure DevOps I may at some point use some of these other features but right now just using it for the build we have no pool requests and I have broken out a project here to put everything that we're working on oh yeah this is of course the we want to get a table in the database or up and down migrations but let's let's talk more about exactly what this application is designed or built to do writer because we will look at some code [Music] yeah so so the idea is whenever you have a database regardless of the type of database and regardless of whether it refers to itself as a schema list or not you have some type of schema and if you have any type of structure to your data which you should high cardinality low cardinality whatever it may be graph data store time series etc you have some type of structure and from a ongoing development perspective it's nice to be able to have that structure be able to be rebuilt on whim similar to how we use docker today schema migrations are kind of that for the schema of a database with schema migrations for example you could have your database and set up to run and docker and you could start it running and have a three node Apache Cassandra cluster for example let's say five notes I don't like going three note it's a little it's another topic for another day but let's say we got a five node Cassandra cluster running in docker okay that's great from an infrastructure perspective we have the database and it's theoretically ready to go except there's nothing there and you can't just start dumping data in because you need to build some tables or some key spaces or whatever to put the data into well with a schema migration what we do there is we actually basically keep files for each change over the course of a project so like let's say we add a key space in one table that's in one file and then we add another two tables a few days into the project because we determine we need some more tables so we add those tables to our schema migration cql file list for Cassandra specifically right with other databases like postgrads for sequence server oracle you'd have your sequel files your SQL files and in those those changes you have an up change which would be the creation of whatever it is that you're building whether it's table and index a relationship or whatever and then you have a down which would remove that particular change the idea is that you can roll all of the schema up to current state or a previous state depending on which which date or which enumerated value within the index of files that you want to execute it to or you roll it down to a particular point to test to build to do whatever you need to do with the database so that's that's the basic idea of schema migration and with this project what I'm working toward the mission is to build a schema migration tool in c-sharp which we have some initial work done for it already is to build a schema migration tool for Apache Cassandra core distributed database the data stacks Enterprise is built on the Apache Cassandra element who will of course cover the open source Apache Cassandra database but then we will move past that we will work past that into the realm of where data stacks Enterprise goes which is into graph store into time series into analytics into search all these other realms of data storage data query data analytics etc when we move into that realm there's other schema elements that need to be stored in the schema migrations to bring the database up and to bring the database down ongoing agile ish development practices right because with the idea of all this just like with docker and the layered files and keeping it in a managed state where you can roll up your environment roll down your environment real quick is to keep your development and environment in same two particular versions of the distribution of your application and your application development as you move along so the database stays in sync with the actual needs of the codebase you're not out of step or out of sync with what is being done with code versus what is being done with the data store that is the entire premise of this whole thing all right with that explained we get a little bit more into the pedantic details of where we have been where I have been in development of this and where some of the audience have helped me out et cetera and we'll talk about where we need to go with the code so right now [Music] the codebase is in a state I've been using JetBrains rider on Linux to build this project and I need to open it because I just updated it right before I started the stream and let's get some note-taking going on so here's that these are the notes that I will post on the github repo I think I'm just gonna put them in the wiki here once I'm done so yeah see I have some notes here so we'll have some more notes similar to this actually let's see here I'm gonna move into this because I've already logged in with this browser all right we're gonna go over to wiki and I'm just gonna take the notes in this in this interface so let's edit this [Music] what is today today is July June 21st well that's not how you do that in here is it oh it is okay notes and then I'll come back and see if that's actually notes notes a little later so we'll save this adding notes for June 21st 2019 coding session oh that's just some junk alright we're gonna make this page by putting in the name like that for markdown it it gives us the ability to just create the page and start editing it alright first things first we are I'm always looking for the hmm it's the easiest way to get a timestamp on this thing how long 23 minutes so at 23 minutes we are getting started we go and then ten minutes in viewed what the project is from a domain and mission perspective there we go okay that's that's useful this is actually a 25 now that we're getting started on this adding points click Edit go back into that all right just have a good save point in that all right 25 minutes we're gonna dive in here get into casi schema migrator I already have it open again using JetBrains Rider now I would love if anybody wanted to contribute to this - I'd love to see what their experience is to use Visual Studio on Windows so if anybody out there using Visual Studio would like to take a dive at getting this running and in that editor I would be very curious what they what steps they have to go through based on just simple documentation this is supposed to be compatible with Visual Studio as is you should be able to open the solution file and everything opens no problem but [Music] let's do what it says here see what this is all about but as I was saying I'm not particularly sure as what other environments are like because I've only been using jetbrains writer so far I do intend to break out and use Visual Studio code and some other things use the CLI just dotnet CLI commands to do some of this but right now I've just been using jetbrains writer it gave me a good platform in which to just get started and move forward it's your asset based on the symbol naming and current solution use default rules clear oh I will just come back to that that's a whole bunch of peripheral stuff for now so right now what I have done is so far I've created a few facts using X unit test library to test my project here and in this we have three projects and yes I am kind of doing TDD kind of doing T test integration tests driven development because I want to make sure that with an example configuration that this works okay here I said show files just so we can look at some of the other things but to go through what exists so far what I have so far we have test helpers right which builds out an environment of tests we'll cover that in more depth in a little bit and then we have the core tests which works off the core the test helper build out and it goes through various things where it tests that tasks are listed that files are read or viewed or found within the file structure that we've set in the configuration to look at to get all of our cql files to do an up migration or a down migration the core library has two two classes right now one is the file selection class which basically goes through from the file system level all right so it's the OS level part of this process where it looks at a particular directory it goes through and as you can see here it gets the files file names and everything in that directory looks through all those determines by right here that there's a correct formatting of the file name so has a date time at the beginning make sure that it is a dot cql file and it makes sure that it has either an up-or-down designator for the migration itself then it builds that list and that list is ready to process and right now that's the step that I'm at is we're at the point where we're ready to start building the processor to execute these files and that's that's going to get a little tricky because how would a c-sharp project execute cql files will use the driver will we use an executable on system most likely we're gonna go with the driver because that'll be able to be pushed cross-platform to Windows or Linux or Mac OS so that's what the files selection is the migration path is finding the designator and building the schema migration path as in like the pipeline path or the road toward what we want to build our state to with our schema so that's what the migration path object is focused around right now I have an enumeration shows it's the file details the cql in the file itself whether it's an up or down migration and the order the date that the files are sequenced in and here's the enumeration with up-down or its marked invalid for whatever reason so that's that's where we are at where I have gotten to with the code and I'm ready to move forward at this point there's a fair bit of cleanup and other things that need to be done but that's that's the level set for the overall project code where it exists at the moment and where it is out here on github [Music] and then let's save this again I'm gonna go look at a few other bits out here so in issues as I was saying there's the Casman logo REE factors these things brought up by digital drummer one of our viewers we need to refactor and move this method to kind of a schema migration tasks etc so I'm gonna actually assign myself this and labels an Smith bug duplicate help one invalid we'll call it enhancement it's part of this project oh yeah we don't have a milestone right now all right [Music] let's say we're at 31 minutes and add that to our wiki actually issues and adding tasks efforts it's my store connection information locally looked at in a second so this is this is the this is some of the overall stuff that we're working on so like this one here so to be able to do user wants to be able to do an up-and-down oh that's for the table key space for use in my regions user wants to process cql files for schema migration so it's hard to determine what even is the first thing here because these are pretty high level [Music] yeah okay yeah let's get in let's get into the code [Music] how did I close a closed writer let's open that back up [Music] [Music] of the know what that the dot and I don't want that the doc okay let's run our tests and see where we get with that run unit tests [Music] we have three failures so all right get back over here let's make sure we're taking notes where we're at and we can break this stuff out after the fact [Music] [Music] all right wouldn't start back into the code with debugging some of these tests so right now verify tasks are for down migration went down migration called verify task for up by Gration went up migration called verified tasks are ordered really wanted to add for any functionality ah I think I see what the deal is here so yes these are not implemented tests because I left myself breadcrumbs to know where to start from when I returned to the project so verify tasks are order we want to make sure that we get the task back from the list of tasks and that they are in an order now as someone pointed out to me earlier implementing a test for this is kind of redundant lis implementing a verification that it is in it it is in an order based on our just reimplemented functionality now what I'm trying to do though is I'm trying to re-implement it in the fact in a very distinctive way to make sure that I'm not testing the same way that I would actually implement it in code but it would implement it based on having a real result known from the data so I'm assuming that I already know what the result would be exactly and that's what I'm trying to write the test for in this particular case we have a bunch of stuff in the test implemented in the test helpers okay so here's the here's the files that are being implemented right or being created and then here all this right all this text stuff is these three files are junk files that should be ignored so if they ever get in the list there's an error but then we have up migrations here that are written out and we have down migrations here right now all I got is select asterisks from cheese clearly not a valued up valid up or down migration but enough so we can make sure that these things are retrieved that the contents are retrieved and that we can order them so with that let's actually see where we are so with these files to take this put them in a text file real quick just do that in like icons are getting all goofed up just use code for this real quick well that's kind of messy there we go so that's one of our files and we get this one I could do this yes this place that stuff with nothing oh why is that not oh I see I'll fully honey pin them it [Music] can't really see where the cursor is here there we go want rid of this [Music] I'll shoot free it stop doing that so this fall and the sequel file and this one are not going to be processed because we have four downs and five ups okay now this one is let's here let's order this so this one would be last this one would be was it yet three [Music] so I believe that would be the appropriate order of what we'd want okay and then for the down 19:02 is definitely first sixteen is last then January for March 8th May yep okay files propria ordering save that on the desktop just right now procreate ordering of test data okay so now I get in here and we can get this figured out all right so all this stuff is added and it's just in whatever order then the content is added but over here okay first we create the test helpers which builds our content puts it there wait okay and then yeah this sets the tests up with migration path and then the migration path is where the stuff is put and then this result is that files to process so files to process and then that tears down the migration test so we're gonna get rid of this now there we go then the files to process okay we want to list see what is this files to process is a list of schema migration tasks so verified tasks are ordered okay so here's here's a thing it can be an issue so based the tasks are ordered based on up or down of the task so we need to have the up or down done first up migration are called for a fight assert for down migration with down migration called so we need to actually implement these tests first files - let's call this migrations to execute we should call it because we're actually getting back that migration Louis with the pertinent data it's not just a file anymore at this point it's the file selection item but we need to ensure it's the right thing to to process that is so let's see R all right migrations to execute oh I just put all these right at the top that's that was smart okay we're gonna do cert dot something hmm indeed it raises single super set throws ends with I could do a for each on each of the results down migration for wind down migration called okay so let's here for each migration in migrations nope migrations to execute do a thing oh how do you how do you do a for each and c-sharp again doesn't forgot how to do this oh I'll probably have to do part migration in this yeah so assert true Oh a equal equal yeah migration dot migration type is migration down I'm doing down for money yes this is saying the literal or constant value migration down should be passed as the expected argument and oh yeah of course there we go okay and then this okay the steps we want to make though after this let's talk about this for a second so in file selection I have all the files I've got back this migration thing now so we have all these tasks that are returned build the TAS and get cql to press us execute okay what caused this I think this is what actually this is what needs to exist find usages okay [Music] migrations to execute its here we should do great in migrations to execute dot migrate up down right so we should have a function like that and it'll return the things that are going to migrate down no but that's let's see or how should this be done so if we're looking at the migration path so we market ready so it's a ready path build the task and get the cql to process X and execute [Music] went over in file selection what did I do I said in schema migration tasks get falls so that puts together all the keys that I need to check against or the values I don't you check against and then I check against them and then I read reeve the sequel and I get the schema migration objects put together prospective migrations exist my creation path okay and then in migration path then I have the schema migration task I have an enumeration then I have migration path ok so this is different the task is the singular item that needs to that can be used to execute or act on this however build the task okay yeah so migration path here we'll go see enumeration migration that's recreation that'd be up or down [Music] all right so we'll call this migration path back over here actually let's yep files to process migrations to execute equals new migration path and this is where we can do this fast process will say migration down and we should get migration my creations do execute uh in migration paths so that'll create the object and then say ready that's it ready and then we'll do a public migrate now let's actually let's do this should I do it up or down at this point I don't know I noticed a couple things that I should have done actually this part shouldn't really be built until around the time to execute but ah no it does need to be done because it needs to be abstracted like the file layer stuff needs to be dealt with and then the object just gets passed as is so I do want to do this though because then I only load the things and then this will be migrated this I'm public whoops public show migration path she was just call it show path or display path oh well let's do path I just put false in there for now because if if we do try to do a migrate it's gonna fail right let's go back over here and okay migrations to execute migrations to execute migration dot down migration I I'll just do this I had path should return not string but a list of schema tasks so let's a new list of schema migration tasks boom there we go okay so that's gonna fail of course because we should get something back I believe that should fail so migration died migration type there we go now let's run this this unit test it's going to take a second to execute a build failed I have to do the whole I just want to run this one this one test I don't want to run this one test and it is a run get it just run unit tests I'll just run the 1 here we go but it's debug unit test and then run oh I'm goofing some of your okay oh I don't okay right right right my goof so I put that in the wrong place where this migration path just needs that passed into it not the up or down the up or down needs to be shown at the time of either X called either via execution or via the show to show up or show down or migrate up or migrate down so where is my go-to declaration that's what I'm looking for so this does actually need removed from here like that that should work and then should be recalled path I will do upon this path let's make this [Music] so I need a thing like that but with gets and sets hmm yeah kind of like that so let's do that I don't need this well yeah okay let's do migrations like that there we go I need to like pass those by ref instead of that way but anyway okay so we got them in there we'll fiddle with performance later so that's gonna move those in there so we have a local list to deal with now right and what that local is we don't need to make that accessible because that's accessible in this object so this object in we need to return migrations like that what okay what are you fussing about now well not new just migrations there we go [Music] let's actually go into these two tests I'm just gonna comment about just for now just so we can run the other ones for a few seconds then we're just get back to those immediately oh wait how do i dad burn it how do you comment code Oh controlled slash there we go okay [Music] so that part should be here and then in path put in migration up down there we go okay it's new and then we're gonna go through four [Music] and migrations [Music] do migration okay so this needs to be if and what are you facet about now right for out for each MDOT migration type it's equal to migration wait what is it a up down then migration path dot add M in this context this could be renamed to operation there we go so migration paths should just have the ones that are based on whatever is passed in here theoretically so let's get back over here and let's see if we get only the downs the down paths [Music] [Music] build some more gracious be come on [Music] again I have no idea what it did come on pop up there we go running [Music] instance of an object line 17 Oh so let's go look at this go to decoration we need to do this so migrations oh that's and that's why it's in the constructor because it needs to be built it needs to be instantiated in the first place since it's a list of object let's try that again you you you you how do we do there get it run my machine had a oh yeah we did we succeeded but oh boy did that wreak some havoc on the performance so we'll get back to that but we got tests working now I'm gonna actually close this down do a reboot there to shut down real quick cuz this VM is killing the perf on my machine here somewhere talk just for it here all right so the idea is we got the upper down migration going and we got the list working now so I can add and fix that other test and then by proxy that third test I can get that kind of wrapped up pretty easily too I think we can finish that here in the next like 10 minutes maybe even 20 minutes and then we'll call it a done session and then after this what I'm gonna do is break this session out and snag those key time points as separate videos to make those available on the actual github repo I'll just embed them as starting-point references waiting for the machine to restart waiting here still in the darkness there we go should just take a minute more come on but but but nothing like a reboot midstream to give one time for a coffee break there we go [Music] a routine ly feel like the virtual machine even though it gives me a clean environment for this whenever just does not quite restart appropriately and then when I launch a certain amount of Java stuff eventually just nukes the memory in a virtual machine so that also happens would docker every now and again at least with VirtualBox but then of course it's setup by default to be able to do that whereas a lot of the others you it's not even set up to do that there we go making progress we're getting there nyan cat go-go nyan cat go go go [Music] all right there we go that seems to have fixed up that famous last words as it all crashes okay so getting back in here we had this working now so now let's do the up one I like control all / right boom okay fixed it so we need these bits it's kind of a copy and paste test so this is gonna be up we're gonna check it against up to verify of course it's gonna work but both of these tests work well through refactor because if and when we have to add other criteria to pulling in this list let's say we add where you can just enumerate the the files so instead of date description up or down and then cql let's say we go by the first part of the file would be a number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 is whether whatever dot whatever the description is dot up or down then dot cql so if we change to that these tests would still Rivera Phi that we're getting the right amount of ups or downs based on the read numbering we'd have to refactor some of the other tests but right now I'm just going with the date element and I'm just gonna deal with prospectively adding the other feature to enumerate the specific ordering of the things later because right now my main use case is to put in the date and the date can even have if the date time is implemented the way I think it is you can even have like down to the minute and second so that way you can do multiple migration additions per day in your code base you don't have to do like one per day but right now the date is gonna work for the moment and we're gonna keep moving forward with that so this one see if it works in a second and then this test we can finally start working on other slash there we go and in here and got weird stuff on my screen all right so get files we actually want to do this yes I know evil copy and paste in tests it's a bad thing to make sure okay we want to make sure they're ordered now so do I need to do it for up and down I think I might need to do that hmm so let's go look at the test again or the the list creator thingy here migration path it's adding it if it's up or down and then we're gonna return and we're gonna do dot get out sort sorts the elements in the entire list using the default comparer oh yes I have to create a a compare what what the heck even is a comparer oh I know well the first thing we go back over here we know it has to come back in a particular order right per the file that we created here so for the up migrations its these so let's take these copy get back over here verify tasks are ordered for up migration we're just gonna do that for right now I'm gonna put this in as commented out stuff so we can just look at it and we'll need to say assert dot it's your collection we're gonna go buy it we're gonna go buy the manual list first so we'll say it's true not true yep okay so oh not not true evils derp I'll do migrations like migrations to execute do first one how do you get I thought that's how you got it list item path I agree up let's get this let's get this in a list so what should I call this so this is the files to process than the pass files process and to get the actual migrations to execute migrations and then I will do migrate up migrations huh what a goofy name so don't come down here missions up and now this would be index item one dot what a date task file yes dot file I don't want the whole thing I just want the file the name I think just name would be the thing I want yeah so equals what Oh equal equal yeah okay so let's get to this point this should be a sign so I should be able to look at it at this point and then run all these tests well what happened to my anyway all right what do we got here so yeah clearly not the same thing but it is okay so that one will break exactly what we want so now we need to look up how do you make an icomparer in c-sharp I don't actually know how to do that at all so we're gonna learn how to do that oh that is okay yeah this thing type compare were compared over yeah all right so how do we do this what okay this class is not demonstrated in the main method it's provided only to show how to implement the interface it is recommended to derive from confer or T instead of implementing I prefer RT so I have to implement an entire comparative thing to just sort it why do that's your sort a list type right so you take a compare you pass the type you want to sort but how do you determine crappy web pages a void main' int list list of this type int GFG GFG but mine's a complex type it's not as simple it this is the thing I just looked at right no this is totally different oh cool okay let's look at this all right so we have part classes parts minute string in blah blah blah blah okay we're going to have comparable in there to part it is used to divide the type of the part but the part name can change so we want here is okay comparable equitable so equals okay I'm going to do that but I do need a comparer to do this right let's add this one on our object here go to declaration okay migration path here's where we want to do this right yeah and then generate relational members to implement missing members delegate that crap to a new field let's do this there what okay compare migration path okay it's over here whoa what happened weird that's in not the same just go to the same browser there we go let's network for eight maybe it works references list type sort method Doc's do this ah well okay that'd be fine just put it down here oh cool put it lamp in it I didn't even think of using link crap that would be awesome so anyway going back to this real quick I mean where is compared to park compared apart compared part this is probably what I want to do and uh I'm definitely definitely what I do order wait where didn't I add I guess I didn't add that one 22:25 figuring to use icomparer type to get a sorted this does schema migration there we go okay oh of course it's it's over here leave this page there we go yeah let's let's fit it with this actually I like this idea way better so in migration path if I go down to okay I'm going to take this this contraption off where's the in it oh okay weird thought it would have added a call in here to do that thing but anyway so if we do this schema migration task sorted migration path equals migration path at this point dot order by and I'm going to do Oh lambda magic o dot crud oh I didn't oh not zero there we go order date and then close friends dot to list that's so much more beautiful then I could put far in and then actually let's return do this on the outro of this stuff boom there we go we don't even need extra declarations and stuff so we get just the ups then we order them I think that's the last step we're now ready to write the execution let's do all test again look at that beautiful beautiful all the tests pass awesome yeah okay so we got all the tests passing we have reviewed what the project is what it's about what schema migrations are what schema migrations are about what the focal point of the project is where we are on the project and we implemented some additional tests and implemented some additional functionality so all that stuff is is rocking and rolling so now let's hear let's let's do this let's have one more assert to dot equal because let's say I don't trust this whole just shish kebab one zero one two three so for the last one we'll be test file name as such and then we'll have one more here because I just feel like it really needs to have one more just for confidence of the thing I mean it's gonna it's gonna sort right it is so it's your zero one two let's go with - whoops - task file name and let's see her name name name name name so our bunch of messages popped up over to my right at the same time I'm doing this so name of this so that's zero one and then this would be two right yep okay let's do this one and oh what the heck this'll be the first one - and then let's add three there we go all right yeah now let's run all the tests one more time [Music] look at that beautiful ordered four up migration it is a success and then let's here let's add one to do do four down and then we'll do a throw new not implemented exception this test is where we've left off verify the list is sorted for down migrations and then we need to get into some serious stuff here we need to do a public whoops this needs to be [Music] act and then we need another do another fact the public void verify anyway verify tasks are ready and this will just be basically all of this we need a my creations to execute dot ready should be assert dot true but that one I'll actually do a throw new not implemented exception test method needs implemented comment this out real quick that exception will throw instead ready for migration execution and the other one the next one up that we need we we know we need fact is public void execute migration and this one's gonna be a fact to give public void execute down migration now this is where things are gonna get very integration based and very not unit based right I mean this is a unit of work but since we're doing this at a systems operational level unit tests are a little unit tests specifically are a little flaky but the up and down migrations both will need to have the actual database checked we will need to verify that somehow for this remember database will actually need to be checked ie docker magic right so there we go that's where we're leaving off we got one two three four four new tests that will be airing out that need to be implemented I'm gonna go ahead and exit out of here and I'm gonna use the regular interface go in and get that stuff pushed out there into where it needs to be so see de casi schema migrator this clear list git status adding next steps functionality to the migration process get push wait let's square my connector to just where I can get fish Georgia actually let's check the branch have my branched I'm on master git push origin master boo [Music] get poor oh yeah yeah added the badges and I haven't pulled it back down yet so get push origin master [Music] all right that's live let's go check it out here okay all that junk not needed thank goodness whoops fake no we went with a nice lambda instead her this fine [Music] go and then if we bounce back out here we should see it hasn't succeeded is it showing the last actual is that today turn I was actually fast 37 seconds oh you know what it doesn't it doesn't do the test okay so that's and that's something else urghhh branch of what that is today via justice standard all commit so ok well that's good bill the build is good it builds we know the test run locally I need to work on the build to figure out how to get the tests into the build soonish all right but that's that's for a future episode we got all that work and covered the basics there again and it's here yeah we did we did UPS save that for future reference and it looks like we've we've really covered we've covered a lot in today's session we will resume next week actually let's take a look to see when we're scheduled next that's weird area twitch.tv data stacks devs Fitz this is the place to look right here alright [Music] yes the next one will be on I've got a killer video application development come up today at 1:00 so in just a little while just about an hour put a reminder on that for myself then the next one is next Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time yep so that's that's next Wednesday we'll be back on our regular Wednesday scheduled in which would be super cool and there's so I don't think I'm going to tackle the build on the next session but we will get into code and we'll get some initial executions of a migration occurring and then start working on how to integration test that with the docker we use docker for that for sure because that's just gonna make life super way much more awesome easier for us to test that and yep that's it for today so thank you viewers for checking out the stream today I look forward to our next session and getting this code usable in production it's gonna be awesome so see you next time until then happy coding Furio [Music] [Music]",
