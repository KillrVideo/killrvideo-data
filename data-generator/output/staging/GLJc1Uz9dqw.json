    "text": "okay so as i did mention we are going to use astra data sex astra today so that is uh essentially to fully manage cassandra database in the cloud without any of the ops so for those of you i see some names that we definitely recognize you're probably already using astra and you're familiar with what it is for those of you who are new to us today um this is a really nice astros really developed with developers in mind it's a way that you can spin up a fully realized cassandra database in a couple minutes and just go and we're gonna use the free tier that's the key thing where the free tier is free forever um there's there's no you know um uh you don't you don't have any like requirements or anything like that you can just get up create a free tier that's what we're gonna use today to power cassandra and you know i guess just a couple things about astra itself you get a five gig free tier um you have multiple key spaces that you can use you if you have different domains different things that you're experimenting with your applications uh in the free tier there should be plenty of room for you again you don't have to worry about the operations this is being fully managed for you all right so with that first thing we want to do here is drop a link so let me actually put that back and this is going to be the link to the repo that we're using today and here it is let me drop this for all of you there's that there comes the difference and there's that okay so um now someone did ask a question about links and such so for one i do want to point out um the slides are here so if you go to the slide deck for the workshop and you download that then all of the embedded links and everything are in those slides in the pdf itself um you also find um the links you know for things like astra and stuff the things we'll be working with today they're provided for you here in the repo um and i'm before we get started on this part i do want to just point out this sai documentation one um this is linking to the data sex documentation on storage attach indexes i'll have to admit i'm actually really i'm really impressed with this documentation i i've been going through all of the faq in particular is extremely informational right so there's going to be some things that we don't there's a lot of detail that you can get into that we're not going to get into today like the read write path for you know sai and such it's all there so i definitely suggest taking out taking a look at the documentation on that case all right so hopefully everyone's going to that link um and then the first thing we want to do is get everybody going on their astra instances so i'm actually going to do this along with you um so if you follow the instructions here if you go to astra actually yeah i'm sorry use the link here um you just click on that link it will pop you up to a page that looks something like this now if you've not been with us before and you've not registered you're going to get a registration page right it's going to look very similar you can use your github or google or or whatever i already have an account so i'm just going to go ahead and log in it the registration should only take a moment and again this is free by the way there's no like credit card you have to put in anything like that oh look i totally typed in the wrong password free forever yes free forever sorry i will tell you what i use it for i use it all the time for just quick hits on hey i wonder what this data model looked like or want to try this thing yes it is so much more convenient than having like writing ccm on my desktop or something like that so do it okay so what i'm going to do is for those of you who are starting with us in astra for the first time i'm going to just run through this real quick and then i'm going to give you a moment a couple minutes to just do it it should only take a couple minutes to get your database going for the rest of you who have been with us before and already have an aster database if it's you just check if you haven't used it like a day it might be parked so just go and when you go to your database just unpark it that might take a couple minutes to unpark and that way we're going to be all ready to go when we get to the exercises now for everybody who's doing this for the first time um and again this is all in the repo here everything i'm gonna do is in the repo um so i'm not gonna read all that stuff like i said i'll give you a couple minutes to go through it yourself just make sure that when you're choosing a database you choose the free tier right it's free forever free tier no credit card or anything now what i think a lot of our workshop club members probably already have running instances that are yeah yeah and that's why that's why i suggested to unpark if you if you are one of those folks yeah um but we have enough people who've not been with us before so i'm just gonna go through this real fast um one thing i'd like to point out is in the free tier uh even though we do support uh cassandra clusters and all three of the major cloud providers and the free tier only google cloud lights up if if you're looking for something else then you have to go to one of the pay tiers but for free it's google cloud select a region that's near you i'm in florida so us east is probably good for me if you're in emea or apac or something europe west is probably better for you and then say configure now this part here as you scroll down in the repo and read the instructions you're going to see we've given you exactly the database name key space name and such we want you to use um so if you would just use these values from what we're doing today again if you have already created a database and you've been with us before just hang tight i'll show you what to do but this is just for those who are coming in and creating a database for the first time now outside of what we're doing today you can create whatever key space names whatever database names whatever you want right we just ask that for today you use the values that we provided here because later on if folks have questions it's much easier for us to either troubleshoot or kind of figure out where you are so again i'm just pulling these here right out of the page and then you'll see once you fill it all those up you get the create database button click that and then you'll come to a screen that looks like this where it says pending this should only take a moment um now let's see let's take a look at the chats how are we looking oh i love charlie collins on youtube gotta love astra and datasack studio i i appreciate that let's see um gorab asks which cloud provider is best among the three man is that a loaded question i answered that one with that well yeah in free tier you have to use google yeah i was like yeah you know because that is a loaded question but the free tier is always in google um they're because they're our friends and they were like here we can help you so um but yeah your what cloud you use is really there's a lot of reasons to have that choice not just because you just yeah there's lots of things you have to consider before making that choice exactly we don't care yeah that's right that's right okay so notice here that my status went from pending to the screen active right that means my database is ready to go now for those of you who had previously created databases um if you go into the database details and let's say it was killer video or the to do app depending you know because you've been with us in another workshop to be able to do this just go add key space so when you when you go to the details section for your database you'll see add key space down here click that and then start with the key space name so put in your essay index and that way you will have the same key space that we have all right so with that um i will leave all of you to that just for a couple minutes just to ensure that you're at a point uh where you have created doesn't have to be active yet it might take a couple minutes but just where you've at least created the database so if you could once you're at a point where you have a database that you've created give me a thumbs up in the chat so we know that you're good oh we're lucky because matt kennedy who's product manager for astra is answering questions i see that discord yeah so when hard questions come he has the heart yeah that's right yeah somebody asked about spark and astra and he was yeah i think he's still typing [Laughter] as a matter of fact uh skivvis there is actually one of our skivus 2000 as one of our regulars i've definitely seen skivus in multiple workshops before hi by the way all right and again if your database is good to go give us a thumbs up let us know that you're you're good sorry patrick what were you going to say i just said hello we love our club members and apparently we're going to have a club in hawaii yeah i saw that yeah all right great idea except traveling into hawaii right now is kind of a mess because you have to get quarantined for a month wait a minute this way you work out yeah they quarantine everybody wonderful okay i'm seeing some poke some folks pop in those those thumbs up let us know that you're good let's see do you just save the name as a key space hi smith how you doing do you save the name as a key space um if you're talking about if you're talking about a case where you are adding the key space like if you want to add a key space because you already had one before um you just want to grab this key space name essay index and then yes when you paste it in here you say save and it will automatically add that key space to your to your cluster yes you're right smith there are no other details you literally just hit the save button and that will then save the key space into your cluster i feel like we need to make it more complicated so people believe that it's real now let's not do that okay did you hear that matt make it more complicated all right smith i got it wonderful um all right yes go ahead uh jeganoff go ahead and create the database so go do that that and even if your status ends up pending just for a moment we're gonna move on and let you all go okay cool all right i think we have enough of those let's go ahead and move on and with that i'm going to pop over to your screen patrick you ready oh i got to do this yeah you got to do that hold on yeah let's make sure your screen's all you know yeah i gotta gotta get in my sharing mode well now that you could actually hear me yeah that would have been kind of uh sad before yeah so let me um let me go into skype and say share share the screen oh i got it i'm sharing okay here we go see that that's my other screen ah i see there you go all righty yes yeah he does have a lot of tabs all right all you patrick it's you know complicated all right all right all right so everyone we're going to talk a little bit of secondary secondary index first yeah um get you caught up and we're getting we're getting this is more background information also so let's get moving so primary indexes we all know what those are uh if you've ever worked with the database you've used a primary index and this is a when you create a table and you have a primary key then that primary key with the id inside of it that id is that's the primary index or the primary key now what that gives you is automatically that indexing is done so there's a fast lookup that's more or less what indexing does for us and that's something where you do when you do a select off the id this is that select statement is valid in both the relational database and in cassandra but when you say this id equals 100 it's an indexed lookup so you should expect a primary key lookup to always be fast always be efficient and it's just just basic information that for our database but when we go beyond the primary index when we go into non-primary key queries that's when things start to diverge quite a bit so in this case um same table but i want to query something other than the primary key and this is what gets i think this is your first stop and oh cassandra's different because when you do this with a relational database it will do the lookup now it may not be efficient because it's just doing a row query but um it's and it's scanning every single row for the column but in cassandra land you'll get an error it says no sorry i can't do that and um you get this like this is the the exact face that you will make because you're like wait a minute i thought that was a database why can't i query on a single column reasons but the reasons are uh now getting into the understanding of what a distributed database actually is and how it works so in relational systems and distributed systems especially cassandra the layout of data is very different and when we talk about relational systems um storing data it's usually a db file that's arranged in row column format and for good reasons because that's how you would normally access the data it's a single system so if i was to access that country field that column it it can look up that column very efficiently because it's in a single file and it is arranged in that manner files are arranged in a very fixed manner um yes i know that there are other ways to create database files but this is the most basic now in a distributed system like cassandra the road data is actually contained in various files so um when you access a column in that row it has to go look in all these different files for that and it could be in random places all over the place i cannot think of anything more inefficient than basically scanning every single single piece of data file on every server and oh added thing we tend to distribute these things around in multiple servers so when we deploy a cassandra database no one deploys just one they like to go out as a group so you just start adding in all these complexities that just take it away from how relational databases would work immediately when you're on a single system you get to do a lot of great things like locking and looking for columns is pretty easy and even a full table scan isn't that hard but when we start getting into distributed databases like cassandra we have all kinds of new considerations but we still have use cases that need to be served so let's look at secondary indexing cassandra it's been a bit of a history secondary indexing as we call it and this is not just a constant return this is all databases do this right um i'm not looking at questions i think people are listening to you intently honestly yeah that's great still listening to me after all these years um so we have uh when we have the secondary indexing in like early days of cassandra it was for finding column data and so it has been there since the beginning it just wasn't super efficient it wasn't efficient at all um it was there to do these arbitrary where clauses or to look up data but the big problem was that the way that it did it every time you did a write to the database it would re-index everything and so as you can imagine uh on a high right um all of a sudden you get this massive amount of right amplification because your indexes are just churning right crazy and it gets into this place where um if you're running a cassandra cluster and you're up in you know this is your job to make sure it's stable your developers can make your life really hard by adding a lot of secondary indexes to tables and eventually it gets to the point where you just you you have a limit of how many you can add because it just tips over and causes a lot of instability um instability in a database is just bad well i think we can agree that right so all right that was that was try number one then there was this day it was very exciting there was a new scheme that was introduced by a team at apple called secondary attached storage indexing or sorry storage attached secondary indexing how did i get that wrong when i'm reading it um so sassy that's that's what everyone called it and sadly was super exciting where everyone was excited and there was lots of talks and great energy because what it was doing and this is what was different it was a lesson learned type thing but it was definitely um it was definitely a thing around a specific use case um when we look at what that was for it was um it was for this tokenized text searching that was what this use case was um and it did certain types of ranges really really well like uh date ranges however uh and it instead of doing this business where it indexes and and re-indexes on disk it it introduced this in-memory indexing so in the mem table and then whenever the disk flush happened from the mem table it went with it so it wrote an immutable index with the immutable data file it was very efficient on disk um in that regard like for disk usage um but it it was like wow this is a very usable thing in that regard um however it wasn't super efficient on the index sizes and how it indexed and it just created enormous amounts of disk space use it like it just sucked up disks like crazy um that was one of the first red flags and the syntax was built for a specific use case and was really difficult for users to understand um i did a few up workshops webinars on using sassy you know and i had to be really careful about how i described to use it because it was difficult to you could get yourself in trouble really quickly by like tokenizing everything then all of a sudden you're using gigabytes of disk space for a hundred megs of data on disk so it's a great question yeah like wait now for the use case that was built for it was it was awesome but it just didn't wasn't generalizable enough so there was a lot of soul searching in the project all right this was a good shot do we preserve it or do we learn our lessons and move to the next thing which is uh we had a stop along the way which is a dsc search now if you're ever used dhx enterprise you know that we have uh we've had this search which is really it's solar it is solar is great for a lot of things um because it uses leucine and there is i don't think there's anything out there that it works as well for indexing text you know as well as lucine has over history and you know that's kind of the gold standard um this is what elasticsearch uses um this has been around for a long time i'm sure and i'm sure there's some data nerds out there well actually there's a new way to do it that's fine but uh it's kind of it's hard to throw shade at lucine because it does a really good job uh so it offered some really cool stuff in uh in a cassandra sidecar basically so it did full text searching um really efficient indexing it was good on disk did everything in memory as as that the big downer was that you're running a full solar engine along with cassandra so you double your jvm joy right and i'll have to admit i think that you know i i come from a world previous to here where i was actually using uh you know solar and lucine um along with a relational database actually and having having a solar cluster i mean that was a game changer for us right um but that was a lot of extra work to do that and even even though what's in dlc search um is uber easy to use it's a really great feature as obviously as you're saying right there's there's still a lot of stuff that actually has to happen and you know see you're kind of really relying on solar to solar in the scene to do all the work for you from that standpoint it's not really native at all yeah it's it's a potential it's a fully standalone system solar is a apache project and you know solar luxine may even have conferences so um you know it's it's a two-for-one deal you get both but you get all the power it's just um it's a brute force technique it's uh it's sometimes when you need to drive across town you don't need to take an entire bus now real quick patrick we do have a set of questions that are relevant to this section um smith has got one here um what was the issue with regular secondary indexes sorry i missed that what was the oh what was the issue uh the issue was that whenever you write to cassandra it would index the it would re-index on disk so right every single write initiated a re-index and all the fun that comes with that okay um just a second i can only type and talk at the same time yeah thank you yeah just take my time um take your time and then another one from smitha what is solar and lucine and i i see that actually bibin answered solar is a search engine yeah so the solar lucine combination it's a really powerful search engine that you can it's an indexing setup where you can add that whether it's a relational database you can actually integrate it with cassandra and such and you can let it like if you have documents you need to store if you want to search through documents you wild card faceting all sorts of things it's an open source service for that um let's see there was i saw yeah v grant had does this happen at the ss table the end table level mem table level sure whatever well you know i think i think vikrant was asked that at a certain point when you were talking but i didn't see exactly where that was about yeah i wonder if it's the sassy one yeah so so vcrint yeah because sassy was indexing it would index in the mem table so it crept it kept the data structure in the mem table that was an index along with the data in your mem table and then flush both at the same time um that made it fast and efficient uh it's just when it wrote it out to disk it was like i'm gonna eat all your disk space and that was bad okay i think that's it for the questions for the moment so please continue please continue moving on all right so uh that was then this is now and um i feel like there's a song yeah i was just about to see if i could pull it up and we'd get it for copyright don't sing it too well or or youtube will flag us forever totally copyright violation and we have no chance of that ever happening um so this is and i'm just gonna drop this on you uh storage attached indexing is makes this happen and um we're gonna go through this but this is just the very basic ddl and um what it means is you now can create just an index like you would in a relational database with easy to use options you have the cases case sensitive and normalized and we're going to go through what all that means in the exercise but this is what i would normally do in a relational database i create an index on a on a table with a column and and then i expect to be able to use that in a very efficient manner so um it's all about this um without trade-offs so storage attached indexing has similar um similar things that happen in sassy where we're attaching the index with the storage file and it's being indexed in memory but um what we're doing is we're giving it the really easy to use syntax that was in secondary indexing um and you know that was easy syntax it's just when you add a lot of indexes you just started getting into trouble so it is this is not revolutionary it's evolutionary removing the needle we're doing it advancing the pointer as we would say but so what what you get out of this is like if i had this very simple table um if you notice the select query i'm i'm doing a where clause with columns that have never been they're not a part of the primary key and not only that i'm anding them together those are that's a very powerful way to start doing uh start working with your cassandra data model and if you've been involved with cassandra before you know that a lot of this is just down to denormalization and wow i as much as i love denormalization and i do it all the time sometimes that doesn't need to be the answer every time am i right yeah i mean well we know we know from a denormalization standpoint right whether whether you're talking uh data warehousing right or if you're talking about being able to maintain you know scalable performance as in something like cassandra that's the way to go right because you're trying to optimize those read operations but i think anybody who's come from the relational world uh and you know i know if i ask for thumbs up we're gonna get plenty of folks i mean we any of us in the industry have have spent a lot of our time there first we are used to the flexibility that you get with a relational database and the way that you can flexibly query right and i think sometimes people get hung up on some of the initial constraints that you get when using cassandra in the way that you have to date a model and everything so it's i think it's like more mental work that's actually needed to denormalize and denormalize properly where if you have just a little bit more flexibility it can take some mental load off and and help you kind of decrease the amount of tables right so uh i think there's i think it's one of those things where you're optimizing denormalization we're optimizing for that performance we're optimizing for the porsche or the ferrari you know what i mean well that's it i think one of the things that is important about this is it minimizes the amount of trade-offs excuse me um if you had and we got a lot of experience i saw i was like i've been using cassandra for five years never used secondary indexes uh because you probably heard all the warnings like well we're gonna use them here's all the warnings i hate databases with warnings i would prefer to use something with a few trade-offs that has predictability to it and that's what we're trying to add here very simple feature just use it here's how to do it and it will perform the way you expect it and here's what you should expect um not well if you do this then maybe it'll blow up your cluster what kind of time bomb is that and it's a mature part of the database um so what what it does for you and if you're using cassandra and have been trying to avoid indexing for a lot of reasons this is one of those biggest selling points of doing it right and this is this is there's a lot wrapped up in this um like for instance if you look at that red line which is what sassy did like i said the more indexes you wrote the less disk space you had and it just wasn't optimized for disk space that's not what it was built for um secondary legacy secondary indexing um was pretty linear and that it was it wasn't good it wasn't bad it was linear with how many indexes you had so it was it was you know chaotic neutral um but yeah yeah but it was it just did a lot of right amplification but if you look at what sai has done um and uh kudos to the team there um that built this uh there's a lot of focus was put on like the efficiency on disk and that actually has a lot of ramifications because let's face it if it's on the disk you're gonna have to read it and if there's less then there's less to read and there's less the index and it's more efficient yes all right so we definitely have a set of questions um in the youtube chat um okay so yeah right okay so vcr and said find with select how about delete we'll delete with second secondary second index as we already denormalize it um i'm trying to understand in the context of where oh yeah it's the delete and the where clause yeah yeah it should yeah any any query with a where clause should use secondary indexing yeah and by the way he he makes an interesting point as we already denormalize it so i'm going to pause on that part of your question and well because we're going to get there in a moment oh we're going to do it in real life yeah we're doing it there in a moment okay okay so so i'm going to we'll come back to the denormalized thing in a second um ooda has some really wonderful questions here get ready patrick if bloom filters tune correctly for a table then it will help to search data fast however in this case of secondary indexes enhancement do we need to use both in the same table does it enhance performance or degrade it is the follow-up well i i the bloom filter thing threw me through my phone the blue filter definitely is going to enhance performance as far as when you're performing the search against whatever data is that you're indexing right because that's going to help cut out any any false hits so you don't have to do extra scans to get get to that data so i mean boom filter is definitely going to help there but anyway patrick what were you going to say i'm going to say no yeah no bloom filters should be completely ignored at this point because bloom filters are there when you don't know they're a probability filter right and uh so bloom filters would be if you didn't have an index on it and if you have an index you know exactly where the data is that's the point so um yeah bloom filters are not and matt's in the chat he's gonna tell me if i'm wrong or not but i don't think blue fields has anything to do with it because whenever you do an indexed query it's going to go to that tree index and say where's my data dude and it'll go directly to it um so yeah bloom filters are there really is a last ditch effort to try to be efficient with your data you know it's a probability of if you have a lot of ss tables in the system wow we are getting nerdy um no no i'm not i'm watching my should i um i'm looking at my slide called density expectations um but yeah your your bloom filters are a different problem okay so then we have another one here um where'd it go oh smitha says uh our custom indexes guaranteed not to go across partitions i thought this hampered performance if it did yeah that's a great question yes partition reads are there's uh to quote one of my favorite people on the planet do we don't there is no magic um if you're doing a multi-partition read there is you still need to read multiple partitions uh there is a however in there and secondary indexes already had this this is just going to be easier to work with um there is a there's an algorithm that tries to minimize how many servers are hit and that's beyond the scope of discussion here but um there's not a you're not going to just scan every single server in your cluster to get the data unless you get the worst possible case in this algorithm um but yes if you have multiple partitions say there are two different nodes then you will be reading two nodes worth of data yeah i would definitely say the way that sai is going about that is a lot more optimized than just kind of scattering out and saying select star from right and having it scan through every single one of your nodes yeah yeah distributed systems still have rules and the rules are oh i mean if you break the rules that's fine right because what does that mean um you're just going to get a slower query it's not going to break it um but that's yeah it's just a different set of rules okay all right i think that's it for now so feel free i was expecting harder questions feel free all right so here's the next slide though uh so this is right now you're today you're going to use it in astra and uh that's great because you can get your hands on it feel it say oh it's very nice and somebody else's infrastructure which is even better but uh we are we're actively getting this into cassandra it will be added post 4.0 um if you're keeping track of what's happening in the project 4.0 is like tipping on the edge of releasing right now it's it's in beta 2 and uh there's a total code freeze uh there's no way we're going to add something as big and gnarly as storage attach indexing in right before we deliver 4.0 so expect that after yeah funny enough the moment that you went to that slide uh trenton in uh youtube asked can secondary index be used with patrick cassandra so so if you're talking about the storage attach indexing what we're focused on today that's exactly what patrick was just talking about so it is coming for open source and patrick cassandra yeah yeah we're it'll be there uh it's it's going through the process and we will participate hop into the dub list uh lots of great conversations we even have some some um we have some youtube stuff happening on planet cassandra as well all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna end with this and this is where the whole room just goes crazy how does this change my casino data model those of you that have been using cassandra for a long time i'm sure this is going to be a big deal for you boom for your new data models index your columns of secondary indexing before you go down the denormalization path okay we just said that we just said that means yeah yeah just said that so that means starting with a single table like that user table and build the indexes on that table before denormalizing into multi like if you're doing a state lookup country look up whatever the normal thing that i tell you to do try secondary indexing first and we'll just let that sit there blow your mind for a minute what's the reaction on youtube right now people are like vlogging out silence so i'm not sure yeah i'm not sure uh if we got the point across or folks you're just thinking about what you just said patrick or what we just said there um yeah maybe they're looking like this dude right now they're just like oh my god all right so i think we should just move on from now can you please give us an example yes smitha we are just about to do that um yeah you're going to do yourself with us so that's part of where we're going to get into the hands-on and do the exercises um so this is here i expected a question like this so thank you jeffrey uh so do we still need to do denormalization with indexing so yeah so you know notice at the bottom of that uh oh you put yeah look at that little fine print normalized for slas within single digit milli millis so if you have a really really there's a couple different cases to answer this question jeffrey for one if you know that you have tight sla requirements that require your response times to be within single digit milliseconds you're still going to want to denormalize and do that right however if you don't have that kind of requirement then what we're suggesting is start with a single table and you can and you can index off of that now it doesn't mean you don't ever denormalize or you never denormalize again as a matter of fact if you think about it um we you know we limit a re we limit the amount of storage attached indexes to 10 per table you can index whatever columns you want but you get 10 per table so imagine we're not saying go create a table with 200 columns and try to index them all that is definitely not what we're saying so so if you look at those constraints right and kind of think about that will you still have cases where you might denormalize it depends on your particular requirements um but we're saying for the most cases and from what we looked at i actually was asking this question the other day um looking at like from the data that we have how many how many people how many people are using cassandra or datasacks or whatever um how many of them run it have those tight tight single digit millisecond slas and it's like maybe five percent right the vast majority of the data models don't right so that's what we're saying we're saying you can start with the single table and index from there but again look at your particular case um do you do you need to denormalize this it's gonna depend yeah i think that's good um and i will say this hey cassandra community we would love to hear about your use cases as you use this um this is your opportunity to make a splash if you want to be nerdy famous get get out there and do some stuff talk about it we will get you on a meet up whatever you want to do but this is it this is what we do as a community is we we take things that are pretty well understood and make them better and talk about them and help others so okay there you go but now yeah let's do it all right so david let's do something we're gonna do is go back over to our uh our repo now for those of you who created databases new with us today by this point you should definitely have an active status i do know from some of the comments in the youtube chat that we had some folks that were adding key spaces those if you added a key space and you added like the essay index one those should also be in place by now all of that stuff usually just takes a couple minutes let us know if you're having any problem there so here's what i'd like you to do if you go down to section two right um this is the getting started now this i saw some questions about some examples please now we're going to get into this right we're actually going to give you oh are you sharing your screens right here there you go there we go all right that's better it would help if i had my screen up yeah so yeah we're going to go down to section 2 getting started with sai i'll actually drop you the link for that because i have anchors in here for that reason so here you go let me drop the anchors for you boom and boom okay oh wonderful i saw uh the brajess unparked the old db good good and again if um if you did unpark a database that tells me you had one so all you want to do is go to here grab that key space name say add key space and pop that in and save okay so with that link you should go to this section this is going to have you use the cql's console the cqsh console here um in astra i'm just going to quickly run through it just to give you an idea of what to expect then we're going to give you some time to do it yourself all right so i'm going to click on my cql console now the cool thing is astra will auto log you in you don't have to do anything there it'll do it on its own there we go okay now again i'm not going to read through everything here i'm going to give you all time to do that on your own so i'm just going to kind of pop through some things i want to take a look at the key spaces i have i should hopefully have the essay index one that we used before i'm going to change the context to essay index so when i execute the following queries it knows that i'm doing that against my new key space and again everything i'm doing is there i'm going to grab this command now notice for those of you who are new with us and haven't done this with us before you'll see in every step right i'm going to see we have a step and we're going to show you command that means i want you to do this command and you should see some expected output here's the command and so on and so forth so i'm grabbing the command to create the table this is one of the tables that we're going to use today this clients table something key i want to point out here is notice i have one field in my primary key unique id this is my primary key it's also my partition key but just this one field right now i'm going to go ahead and insert a bunch of the data into here and again i realize that if you're trying to follow along right now you're probably like dude you're going way too fast it's because i'm going to give you a moment to do it yourself i'm just running through it so you can kind of see what you expect um yeah yeah if you can because i'm cutting pasting myself hey good for you yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly okay so so all we're doing at this point we're inserting some data into our table i've got the data i see with the select star against my table that i've got the table here data here now imagine what might happen if i tried to perform this query select star from clients that table we just created where last name equals some value if you remember if you look at the definition here unique id is the only thing in my primary key right so in a traditional cassandra sense this won't work and if i try to execute this cassandra says hey i can't do that this is where that whole discussion about allow filtering and for those of you who are new to cassandra if you ever see this message this means stop what you're doing don't put allow filtering on your query right matter of fact that question came up earlier about scanning across your cluster and such this is a really good way if you had a billion rows in your table to you know knock over a cassandra cluster by saying yeah select star from where some arbitrary column that's not in my partition uh with no limit or anything like that it's going to scan your whole your whole cluster right so don't use allow filtering if you see this message that is cassandra telling you hey you're doing something out of the range of what you should be doing now here's the point so now what i want to do is we're going to go ahead and add some indexes um notice that i'm going to add one on first name last name and birthday right by the way this is the syntax this is it the sai uh the essay indexes are really really easy to use so i'm just going to create we're going to ignore the options yeah go ahead patrick were you gonna say something did i hear patrick where'd patrick go patrick froze i lost patrick all right let me get patrick back hold on patrick just all of a sudden disappear that's what i heard i heard i heard him leaving all right give me just a second we'll get patrick back in just a moment all right all right hopefully patrick yeah patrick is sleeping yeah he got frozen didn't he all right i'll give patrick a second to come back on so oh okay so again um i'll let you all go through this on your own but we're just creating these indexes ignore the with options for now i'm going to explain that later and now if i attempt to perform that same exact query boom there now i am querying against a column that is not in my primary key right by adding in this storage attach index now for the rest of them i'm not going to go through all these i'm just going to give you time to do it i do want to point something out here notice for these fields for last name and first name where they are string based notice as we go down i kind of keep changing the case right we'll we'll explain that a little bit later okay so with that i'm going to go ahead and give all of you let's say you know i'll just give you what eight minutes maybe something like that and go ahead and do this on your own and we'll set some music there you go and give us a thumbs up let us know when you're done with just section two and go slick sir from patrick oh smith yeah i'll increase the uh the font size a tad bit more sorry about that i appreciate you pointing it out i'll just open this up a little bit so we can hopefully that helps let me know if that's better for you oh here i'll give you the site for the timer do i feel like patrick came back on okay let's see all right look he seems to be sleeping yeah no i'm not sleeping i was tired though now can you guys oh yeah he is alive yeah i guess they're seeing you now like some days yeah the joys of uh doing these things remote right seriously i like pixelated uh charlie collins says pixelated silent patrick [Laughter] i'm not the best yeah uh rajesh you said do i need to create a new database or can i use the old one you can if you've already got an astro database in place you can just add a key space so add the essay index key space if you want to create another key space you can totally use the one that you have um that's up to you right just understand um i i think for the all the commands all the um the cql none of them are qualified by the key space so you should just be able to use them but uh but it's up to you we just we just usually have you create a specific key space um for these workshops so it's very easy to kind of containerize the work but totally up to you see okay and again don't forget if you get through all the material give a thumbs up i tried not to put too many walls of text in there but oh bibin uh asks sorry if i missed where does the sa index store the data will be on each node it's actually stored along with your ss tables it's stored there on the individual nodes with the data itself that's the reason we have such an original name yeah storage attached is so the ss table that has your data there's a there's an index file right next to it so yeah yeah so juggernaut is asking is sai available in dsc or apache cassandra inversion uh i want to say dsc 683 is when uh sai was released um there is a cep for apache cassandra so if you take a look at the github repo at the very very top right here right i included that email yes i actually put that there yeah so the cep7 that you can watch that to see uh its progress and where it is so so the goal of this is to end up in open source apache cassandra right so it's currently in dse 683 and above and in astra and then coming to patrick cassandra yeah that's our that's our move is we we we don't want to have proprietary code but adding a big feature like this is a a process in a project like apache cassandra it's a very big and stable database we don't just throw things into it and hope for the best can't do that anymore okay checking some questions ah thank you cedric and alex i see that thank you thank you yes the dsc version alex is 683 plus so 683 and above ah nariana asks a great question uh which we are going to get to uh in the examples we have created an index for the where clause columns can't we have the concept of composite index not composite index actually funny enough i read that as composite partition key so not a composite index right now right you would create an index for every column that you need it you can also index in a composite partition key but like i said i misread it at first i thought you were going to say composite partition key so it is a an index per column for right now no composite okay wonder thank you srin completed step two so i see a couple of them coming in thank you i'll give everyone just a little bit more time [Music] yeah a couple of questions here they come yeah i'm waiting for smith smith always has good questions so i'm waiting what's going to happen [Laughter] okay i mean i here question number one we had to specify the partition key and clustering columns in order but now the custom index we can directly specify column correct yes yes that is exactly the truth um yeah you're right with a denormalized table you're going to have to say partition key then cluster columns in order but not anymore now a little modification if you want to use a partition key and let's say you have a really wide partition um hundreds thousands millions whatever um like time series would be a good choice um if you want to use a partition key and then a uh an index um the index read is going to be fast so or you can do range queries or inequalities that sort of things so yeah you're i'm gonna modify your question a little bit with the it would modify the answer but you're right you don't have to have the partition key in a query if you don't want yeah okay let's see i'm waiting for question number two correct uh yeah step three is not required just yet we're gonna get there we'll get there let's see all right i see more thumbs up coming in we'll give everybody just a little bit more time for that part now this is very cheery music right now i don't have any music how come i don't have any music oh you don't get to hear the music i'm sorry man what kind of a joker outfit dangerous text now skin is like sort of so skivis has a good question over in discord if i do a range query does it get sent to all nodes that contain data for that table um so now you're getting into a little bit of like you know when you when you're in the read path right um and the the answer is it's not just going to go to all nodes right off the bat it's actually going gonna go through this iteration where it's gonna it's gonna go to a set depending on the result it gets back it may go to more as a matter of fact if you remember i mentioned before in the documentation um they do a really good job of explaining this so that's why i included the links in in the github repo but in this right path and read path section um it's down here yes yes yes there's this whole section that will help you understand what's actually going on there so it really depends on the index it depends on the cardinality uh you know it depends on like what kind of results you're getting in the data are you limiting there are some variables it's all well explained here though so i really suggest here i'll just drop this to you as well um actually i'll give you the spot right to the free path yeah patrick were you going to say something there well i was going to say smith had the second question in a is a set of a couple questions how's this different from a regular secondary index uh aren't indexes also stored on disk 100 correct um indexing does happen on disk that is the way it works ever um this is something i i will make a double point on is the difference is how the indexing is accomplished yes it's on disk but in the case of sai the indexing is done in memory and then flush to disk very efficiently so it reduces the amount of operation overhead per node so whereas traditional secondary indexing put a lot of operational overhead on top of everything so um yeah it's it's it is not meant to be true drastic and you're only going to do indexing on disk okay all right so i saw another set of thumbs up come in um yes smith i am totally going to talk about normalize in a moment yeah so i'm actually going to go i stopped at one point because i wanted to get all of you in there doing this i'm going to go back through and we're going to talk about the individual pieces right and i don't believe that the the storage attached indexes are default just yet i saw alex thank you for doing that yes nariana does tombstone apply do tombstones apply for for the indexes yes tombstones do apply as a matter of fact i want to say that is also here here we go i know that there's a tombstone section with this um give me you know what i'll do is once we get uh nariana once we get to the next section here we go yeah it's a little there are some pieces in here it's in the read and write path is what it comes down to it's that same link that i dropped uh over in the other chat so let me get go ahead and give this to you as well oh wait wrong give me this link yeah this one i believe that's in the read path there you go yeah i really highly suggest by the way go take a look at these docs and step through it right there's some details that we might be glossing over today that you're going to really get in the docs okay so let's go ahead and now go over the rest of what we're doing here in our queries so if we remember [Music] by the way somebody asked why when you leave the cql console up does it seem to refresh and you have to uh uh go back to your your key space that's because the the the session token is uh expiring it's a security thing so every once while if you're not actively working in the console you'll see it you'll see uh hey david no one can hear you that was the most random thing i have a uh i have a screen in front of my mic apparently it hit the button you can hear me now right yeah yeah yeah boy this is like everyone believes now that this is a live there's no doubt this is live right i'm losing the internet you're losing your microphone oh thank you everyone for being yes we we really i appreciate the patience there that was funny so i will go back you know i will say what i was saying again that is so random that that just happened um so yeah so so here again this first one's pretty darn straightforward right where i'm just querying against a column that is not in my primary key um in this second one here this gets to something that patrick was talking about before now where i can use and right so i'm saying where last name and first name uh and again this is pretty straightforward right you can see now kind of reduce some of the results i have from the previous one because i've further constrained it going down to the next one now this is where instead of using a string field we're using a time stamp right so birthday was a time stamp so now i can do an equality against a time stamp and it looks like alice is the only person with that particular birth date so they show up in my data i can also do range i mean and again for all of you who have come from doing things with cassandra before right these unless you were talking like a clustering column or something like that this is not stuff you could have done at all so now you can just add these indexes on for those of you who are new to cassandra and you're you're coming from the relational world you're gonna be like yeah what's the big deal dude like i've been doing this for years yeah you're right so this should feel very familiar to you okay so in this case now we're just doing a range where again birthday is a time stamp so i'm gonna look um within a particular range of a year now in this data set i've only got one user uh who happens to fit that particular range but obviously if i open that up i worry that um i worry that there's a lot of people out there like this is what a database is supposed to do so pretty soon we're not going to say this yeah right we're just going to be like this is the way it works leave it alone exactly that's that's too funny yeah but the key thing the key thing is to be able to do this at scale and still maintain your your response time and your performance and things that's the trick right that's the hard part and i think that's one of the reasons why it's taking cassandra you know this time to get to this place because with the relational database it might be very flexible you might be able to perform whatever query you want really but how many people here either on the admin side or from the development side have had to sit there and wait for you know a minute 40 you know we're never dropped you know kill the database by trying to perform one of those queries charlie hit it on the head this is decreasing the cassandra learning curve yes and charlie i don't know if you saw this but uh stargate is also going down that path with api access but you may notice that stargate will rely pretty heavily on a well-indexed database go look at the document the document api blog post on the stargate website and you'll probably start seeing that okay all right yes and charlie yeah i just want to repeat that makes a dead on point decreasing the cassandra learning curve exactly right that's exactly what we're up to um okay and now in this last case and by the way uh he asked about consistency level same i mean data has to be committed on this before you achieve consistency yeah there's no change yeah and actually something really cool um really cool about the right path if you take a look at the right path charlie uh in the dock you'll find that when you have um an ssa index that that index that that flush down right that hold the right path it's actually a synchronous operation with the actual mutation itself um so it's it's not like a separate thing that has to go off and run or a separate service or anything like that so it is it is right there part of the right path yeah how does it impact so vcrint has a question how does it impact if we keep adding secondary indexes time to time um so you are limited to 10 per table right and that that's for good reason as a matter of fact if you remember what patrick was showing you on this chart here right notice 1 to 10 indexes with one billion rows so see what happens here as you increase the number of indexes on a particular table you're going to increase the density that that just makes sense right so we want to keep this within you know some parameters that that are definitely manageable and those that are going to be consistent so again this is why there is that constraint of 10 indexes per table um if that was your question um [Music] the current just i kind of think that's what you meant like if you just keep adding indexes on right so you are limited to 10. yeah it gives you that ability to um well it is meant to add a lot of indexes in it in a cluster so um with the minimal amount of operational overhead yeah there is more but a lot less and it's manageable and predictable that's really the point yeah yeah okay now on this next one here notice i saw a couple of you making comments wondering why am i using such strange case right in some of the examples so now this gets into another set of questions i saw let's talk about the options so i think case sensitivity is is probably pretty straightforward right we're saying okay are we going to pay attention to case or not now if you remember in cassandra if i am using a partition key or even clustering column and i have you know i have case different case in my values i have to know the exact case i have to do an exact match in order to get that match so the case sensitivity one is essentially just saying hey are you case sensitive or not right so what we've done is we said case sensitive false this means i can use whatever combination of letters i want matter of fact let me blow this one up a little bit so it's a little bigger hopefully it's easier to read so i can use whatever combination of values i want that's exactly why i was switching between okay let's uppercase lowercase so and so forth i was just kind of illustrating that as we were going through the examples the second one normalized is actually pretty interesting um normalization i'll admit when i first looked at this it threw me because i interpreted it as being ascii folding which it's not um so normalization is a case and i gave an example here where there are some characters um i forgot what that one's called but like if you have anything um lot or you know whatever um the um and yeah is another one where they may have multiple unicode binary representations in code right some of these have like like a handful of different unicode representations for the same character what this allows when you say normalize true it means you don't need to care anymore right the index will automatically handle that for you so in your code if say you know one one iteration of your code passes this value for this and another passes this value it will be normalized for you you don't have to translate that yourself it is not though ascii folding which is what i originally got trapped up on and which is by the way exactly why i put this comment in here um where let's say that you store an accent on a letter it doesn't mean i can just select with the the base you know the base letter like an e or something like that that would be ascii folding that is something that's coming right but there's a distinct difference one is the unicode binary representation and difference is there the other one is the case where if i had a name like this being able to essentially search against it without any of the um uh diacritics yeah all right let's see how are we doing on questions cedric is answering them full he's doing a good job huh yeah he's all over it there was a question about gremlin but that was a a good typed out one oh i see um can we use gremlins yeah gremlin is its own beast yeah a lot of ways but it will benefit eventually from secondary uh proper secondary index now of course for those of you who are in the graph world you're you're potentially going to shudder when i say what i'm just about to say um if you are interested in gremlin and you're used to working with graph there is another option for you now this is not the same thing because this always gets confused but in astra if you go to connect and you go to the graphql driver um you know i've worked a lot with gremlin i i love uh tinker pop and all that and and we have a lot of fun there um but that is something that we are usually doing in the back end part of our apps with the drivers and such right and astro does not currently have gremlin uh and tinker pop available however with graphql if you've not done that before um then you can actually it's not gremlin but it is a graph it is a graph structure that a graph query language that you can execute in javascript and it gives you some very gremliny like capabilities um it might be something to explore right so take a look at the graphql documentation again they are not the same thing i want to be very clear about that um but it is it is kind of a cool feature okay let's see oh good question from vikrant can we do something like something like where this last name like no sai uh does not yet uh support like or wild carding or or yeah wild card that's a full text that's a full text search yeah so not yet not yet all right let's see i didn't quite understand it does do prefixes though so if you do prefix you can do prefix search oh okay good to know yeah thank you cedric yeah full text is not there yet um smitha has a question i did not didn't quite understand what the slide where the gif of a guy blowing his head up was trying to apply um here's here's what it comes down to smitha um traditionally in cassandra you will hear us shout from the rooftops and we have been for years denormalize denormalize denormalize right when you're creating your data model and cassandra you deem normalize it's you don't treat it the same way that you might in the relational world and that is again to maintain that that performance at scale what that slide was and why his mind was being blown and stuff um i'm sorry it's gonna make me laugh every time was because now with storage attached indexing what we are saying is you can actually start with a single table and index from there as compared to denormalizing first from a cassandra standpoint that that's kind of a bold statement is is what that whole slide was about i don't know patrick if you want to say any more to that yeah it's just it's just a different way of starting your data modeling experience um if it doesn't make any sense to you yeah uh yeah that means you're you have never been you never had to go down that path yeah so yeah great start with the table add some indexes see how that works right it's great uh so um uh bivin john asks contain is the same as like right not exactly the same contain is going to be something that you're going to use within a collection so uh matter of fact in the uh in the next set that we're going to go to here in a moment you'll see some examples of contains and the documentation as well you'll see more of that but that is for you to be able to search within um within collections like maps and such but it's not for a wild card search like a like okay okay i think oh can we have our own unique ids instead of cistern generated ids hater you can use whatever ids you want um the the key thing about the types of ids that we use in cassandra like uuids is that they are safe like if you don't wanna you can use your own system generated ones but in a distributed system you really want to ensure that they're unique right and they're unique across nodes here's what it comes down to if i've got two nodes right and let's say that i have a request to create a new user and i'm going to generate some some user id what happens if there's a network partition right then and those nodes can't talk to each other what i want to prevent against is having a case where both of those users somehow get the same id right because then when that network partition is recovered and they talk again oh now i have a collision so that's why we use uuids um and that's why because it's you're going to get a more of a guarantee on that uniqueness with the ids so yeah you can use your own generated ones just fine i'm just recommending that you ensure that they're going to be something that's going to be supported in a distributed system not a like an int or something hey i want to add in there too by the way thank you for the big shout out on linkedin that was awesome um yeah it was like oh wait we know bibin you you gave us a really nice uh endorsement on linkedin so i really just wanted to personally thank you yeah it was very nice um smitha has more questions yeah i see that uh well here i'm gonna answer that in a moment let's get to the next section um because we've got a half hour left we still have to do our quiz i want to give everybody enough time to do this next piece um okay so last last thing here just to finish the section 2 up this example here was just one of those where i was talking about the normalize feature honestly it's kind of a contrived example it's hard to do here in markdown this is better in code where you can actually have those different unicode unicode binary representations but again this is really more one of those cases where if you inserted with one unicode binary representation then you could select for the same character and a different unicode binary representation and normalize will will essentially handle that and you'll you'll get the character back okay so the last piece here is you know with with storage attach indexes it really does increase the flexibility of what you can do with your data model um the point of this whole section was okay great you created your initial indexes but what happens if at a later time you you need to extend that so boom we can just go ahead and create another index uh because boom right exactly and oops i need to use essay index there we go more like a pop it should be that big and that's it i mean now i can i can select again something that i did not have available before um where i am using the next appointment column you know so it's just kind of showing the flexibility okay so smith's question um in general well yeah also is sai cassandra specific yes oh no oh you mean oh okay you mean what it's doing okay i i was getting already sorry answered this one let me hey let's argue about yeah no sai is an implementation yes that is consumer specific but secondary indexing is available on almost every database right yeah so and that was one of the points i was making is a secondary indexing is a common technique of indexing data that is not a part of the primary key in the database so i misread that question sai is an implementation uh but yeah it every database has a secondary indexing scheme and then nariana um has another great question for a large table only 10 indexes can be created i think to address the other queries we may end up denormalizing is that true yeah you very well may end up doing that i mean at the end of the day um you know again if you have those really really tight slas single digit millisecond response time like requirement yes you're going to denormalize then anyway but yeah there's no harm there's no harm in denormalizing some and and again um you know constraining the amount of indexes to that 10. uh so the answer is yes right you're going to have to mix and match so if you have some huge table but you need more than those 10 indexes then you're going to have to figure out a schema how to kind of break it up amongst multiple tables okay all right so with that let's go in to the next section this is going to be section three i'll drop you the anchor anchor time boom boom now this section is going to be just a little different reason being here you go is there are some new features that have not been released yet to astra which are coming this week actually or really soon um so if you were to try to execute some of the queries uh that are in this section in the console they would not have worked so what we're doing is we're actually going to use studio for this next section um so here's what we do again i'm going to walk you through this real fast just so you understand kind of what to expect and then the instructions are here first thing notice this link this studio notebook link i'm going to copy the link address right that's actually just bringing me to a link that's in the repo i'm going to then hit studio that's going to launch and that studios in my tab up here that's going to launch studio now this username and password are the username and password if you started with us today and you created astra today you're going to use that index user index password one right that we we did that we created together let's see if i do that right and then hit test if you had a previously existing database and you had whatever username and password you used there that's what you're going to pass in right so if you had like one of the killer video databases or something like that you just pass those credentials in so it's all it's all dependent on the credentials you used when you created the database then you should come up to an interface that looks like this let me go ahead and blow this up a little bit just hit plus go to import from url i both sections two and three are in here it'll use the same exact numbering and everything like that so if you just go down to section 3 iot sensor then you'll be in the right place okay so for this one this one now kind of explores some of the other cool options that you have in particular you can actually add an index to a partition key column in the case of a composite index now imagine for a moment i only had a single value like ignore day hour pretend it didn't exist if i only had a single value in my partition key and i try to create an sa index on it cassandra is going to say no you can't do that it's already a partition key column why would you do that right in that case it doesn't make sense but if you have a composite partition like we do here you can actually index on your partition key column so we're going to do that here also notice that we have payload as a map and i mentioned that with with sai you can index on collections so you're going to also explore that as well where now the example below is only going to index on key um but you can ex you could index on key value you can index on the map itself like again the the details of that are all in the documentation but this is a really really cool feature because now this gets into a question that somebody was asking about contains where now i can actually start searching within a collection with the storage attach index it starts to get really really cool with what you can do so anyway i'm just going to go ahead and create my table oh and by the way i should mention that this example actually comes from a real world iot example um we're not going to obviously talk about where it comes from and such but this is actually something that someone really did right and then i'll create my indexes notice here in this case that my day hour remember that's one of my partition key columns but it's because it's composite and then i'm going to also index on the keys of my payload map and then we'll insert a set of data and then now in this case i just want to point this out this is a little different in the notebook this is actually kind of showing a cool feature of the notebook if i highlight a section and hit run it'll only run that particular one right so as you want to run individual ones just highlight them and run so you'll see in here in a case now i'm looking against device name outside of my primary key but here now i can also look at one of the columns but one of the partition key columns as well so that gets kind of neat and since day hour is in fact a time stamp right then there's a question here for you then now boom here are some examples of now querying or you know within a map right this is actually really cool because if you take a look at payload remember payload was a map i'm saying contains key we indexed the key keys of payload and we're looking for speed and you can see in this example i'm actually i can return values directly out of my map that's i find that to be really awesome so anyway so i'm going to give everybody like can you tell it is awesome i this is like and i just quick plug i mean these are the kind of things that i would love to see people doing and talking about in our community yeah you know like wow there's a neat use case and this is how it made it easier and better especially for people who are just starting with cassandra seeing the right way to do something is great yes yes so do this as a community all right so with that i'll give you eight minutes again because we need to leave enough time 18 seconds 18 seconds uh we need to leave enough time for the quiz go and again just go ahead and follow the instructions um for those i dropped the link i saw some questions for the uh the notebook link it is right here in the github repo in section three if you just hover over this right click and say copy leak address that'll give you that link but i did drop it oh charlie nailed it he's like the best teachers are excited i cannot believe they appreciate me to do this i love i would do this normally without even oh wait a minute i said that on camera oh happy they do uh but yeah um but yes i really i mean i'm a database nerd i wrote i've been writing databases since the 1990s so i i'm kind of sick in the head really but it's cool shrine's already done he's like complete step three done done thank you for for telling us that's great let's see hey no one likes to flex what's up um you need to go around and help everyone else now yeah jeopardy is asking so we can index on clustering columns on partition key columns of composite and any other column limit 10 yes yeah you're good yeah yeah it significantly opens up the possibilities of what you can do okay i see prep gave us a thumbs up awesome yeah it shouldn't take too long to get through now i'll admit you know these are set up in such a way where you can kind of just press the buttons and go it in and it might be a little much for what we're doing today but i really encourage all of you to take a look at the like get if when you get a moment to kind of read through um some of the information here right um this i want this to kind of set in that in this particular case for this iot use case right that it's going to create a partition for every hour of every day for each location and they have between 1 000 and 10 000 locations and potentially dozens of ice devices per location i want you to think about how much data that could be you know how much interaction you have in the system and and then the thing that storage attach indexing does for you is to give you a nice consistent response time at scale which is kind of the key thing and it's one of the things that you know for some of the other indexing and such in the past they weren't always very consistent in that way right so this is it's just it's it's hard to kind of sometimes grok what that means but i just encourage you at some point to take a read and kind of look at the examples and the implications if that makes any sense okay so i see some thumbs up oh smith oh and good feedback about the workshop yeah wonderful um i'd love to hear a thumbs up but also we like to hear like hey this didn't work for us because you know these are good links they get to get changed you know it's just a pr away from going different directions and since they're public githubs if you ever just like have a moment you're like this is wrong and i don't get it send us a pr yeah yeah i know it's it's always so hard like pr is accepted all right that means i gotta make one but yeah it's it's not like we won't say no okay all right i see some thumbs up let's see there's this question on the query engine collation oh where's that it's in the youtube chat all right so uh i will cover yeah thank ariana she asks wonderful questions hi again yeah go ahead patrick so uh it's actually not the career engine it's the it's the um the query engine is the one who is the first step on your of course on the query where it parses it and then figures out the token and everything else it is the coordinators in your in your system now um how it does that is just like any other like quorum query that sort of thing is that whenever the query hits the coordinator the coordinator then makes all the radiates out all of the the requests now in secondary indexing um like i said beyond probably the scope of the two hours we have here but there is a there's an algorithm that is tries to efficiently pick which replicas and things are going to have that data and then it fans out from there so it's um there is a method to this but um once those that data is collected it's just like any other query where we have to collect all the data from the different nodes it merges sorts and returns that's what it does and it's all done in memory so read performance yes there is a hit on read performance when you use secondary indexing you multiply the same thing as if you do a primary query uh just like any other index but um you know your mileage may vary based on the complexity of the index and that sort of thing like everything that we do put it together you have an sla in mind like what is your application what's your budget for database queries um throw some data yeah we have nosql bench which is awesome um you know it does a really good job of making sure that um you have a sane data model and you know what to expect so yeah use it yeah i'm glad i'm glad you pointed that out right you know obviously if if you want the absolute absolute performance that cassandra can give you denormalize right that there's always that core denormalization is always going to be the fastest path um any index that you add on is is going to add you know some overhead write it in assembly and do normal yeah yeah totally that's great let's see oh uh smith is asking what are the other ways to deal with the shortcomings of secondary indexes apart from sai use sai uh i i guess i would say what are the shortcomings um because that's a that's a multi-pronged answer because if the shortcut if the shortcoming of secondary index is a is a distributed system then that's where we use consistent hashing and partitions to to get faster data um so that that's one answer uh other answers are just using complete in-memory indexing which we are not going to do but that could happen i mean there's other than that i would say get more specific and we can go into that all right so i'm seeing um oh bibin says this is the best in market now for search without partition key is that yeah copy i didn't see a question mark on there so i'm glad yeah yeah that's going it's funny um okay uh-oh round time out of time all right so i'm going to yeah let's see all right are we yeah we're gonna we're gonna do that's right is asking how to drop index and recreate with a different map and payload so i can just show you that real fast um if you're in studio if you go to the schema button up in the top right hand corner pick i gotta refresh there we go go to my table my sensor data secondary indexes here are the here are the indexes right so if i want to drop one of those i can just say real simply drop index give it the name boom and that's it it'll drop it and then i can reload now here's the thing though if you have a different map and payload right i wouldn't if if you have an existing if you have an existing field and you're changing data you don't need to drop the index and reload it as you you take data that index is going to be automatically updated right so i don't i want to make sure i got your question right home um if you had a different map i would just update the map right i would just and and your index would be updated there's no need to drop and rebuild it not like you're doing um yeah no so if you want to remove the index for some reason drop it but if you're just updating mutating data you don't need to drop it okay so just to wrap things up um so we have all sorts of other resources for you datasacks.comdev is a really nice place to go um if you have if you're on the admin path or a developer path but if you're just looking for like what do i want to learn with cassandra right go to datasacks.com and that'll bring you down different paths depending on what you need and what's also really cool is that there are embedded exercises right there using catacota again it's all free um so there's there's nothing you have to pay or anything there is a matter of fact this link down here this catacota.com datasacks explores a lot more than just sai that we looked at today if you want to get into the fundamentals of cassandra you want to get a data modeling um you'll find there's kafka stuff in there there's all sorts of scenarios that are available they're all free right and of course don't forget datasacks academy um and then as usual if there are questions we didn't get to today go to community.datastacks.com any questions that you might have about any of the stuff or cassandra in general you can always go there i think at this point you all have the link to the github repository and oh and you guys beat me to it um yes i was going to ask in the mentee what yeah oh yeah totally if if i were to nitpick checking audio video sync you know what's really funny about that we do that every single time and the patrick audio hiccup earlier i have no idea how that setting got changed um so that's something i'm gonna make sure that in the future i have locked down um yeah so that was kind of funny but yes totally um my first session awesome and i didn't find any issue as such at this one thank you so much wonderful good let's see let's see what else we have and by the way you can be you don't i love the good stuff right um i love the good ones but if you have any any you know any um constructive criticism feel free to put it in here as well already well and if this is your first one don't be a stranger we would love to see you back as you know we have great friends we have millions and millions of friends worldwide and you're one of them okay so the question that so many folks are always uh waiting for is how do you get the voucher right so jack jack can you drop the voucher link please he did did he oh he did oh yeah there you go oh he didn't put it on youtube though i'm gonna beat him here i'm gonna he did it twice he did it three times like yeah because don't miss it here you go boom here is i'm gonna drop the voucher links in youtube so there's the voucher link so go ahead and just click on that form the form will eventually expire so um you do need to get in and fill it out all you need to do is uh put in the email that you use to register uh for the event and you'll get a voucher there is another path to get the voucher i mentioned at the beginning i'll mention it now um i'll actually just show you real fast because we have well we're over by one minute but i'll have you done here in literally two um so if you go to um academy and within academy am i already authenticated oh okay let me do the let me do it this way here we go all right ah no i can't type academy i keep doing ca academy there we go all right if you go to academy.datasex this is the other way to do it right and i do this yeah that one shameless plug i just put my uh i just put a link in um discord um if you're i've been talking to a lot of users about your use case um and if you would love to just spend 30 minutes and tell me about yours i would love to talk to you um it's i've been doing about five of these a week and you know what do we do with them i mean sometimes i just get to know you but you know sometimes we find good places for uh meetups and we find places for um you know maybe you want to be involved in one of our workshops i i don't know but uh blog posts or just you know maybe you can help out with somebody consider me like the router yeah and patrick can you drop that in the youtube as well i will do that right if you don't have it i can do it but um i got it and here's here's my calendar or it's not countley um it is uh x.a.i but same thing but yeah just find a time and let's talk about your use case and um i would love to this is a shameless plug of course but yeah okay and then so for the academy piece once you log in to academy you'll see this admin path and a developer path if you click on either one of these you'll be presented with a set of courses complete all of them once you have completed one path then you can email academy at datastax.com let them know which one you've completed right and you can get a voucher for that and the cool thing about it these vouchers between what the form does and what these do will give you two attempts to actually take the real certification by the way that real certification is right here so if you click on this this will actually give you uh the information that you need matter of fact i guess i should drop the certification um here i will also give you a repo another repo is another workshop by the way we're doing it next week i believe the cassandra certification one for those of you who are interested in cassandra certification here boom we'll talk about all this next week um but this will bring you through all the information that you need really what i want you to know though is that if you complete either one of those paths the full paths and complete all the courses within them you can get yourself a free voucher as well and somebody asked if you're new to cassandra and you don't know like which certification to pick it depends if you want to administrate and operate cassandra databases the admin path is for you if you're a developer who is you know or an analyst or somebody who is using cassandra for its data and you're going to be working with applications the developer path is for you right so it really depends on what your goals are all right with that i think that's it i'm just looking for questions awesome thank you everybody we really appreciate you being here today uh for all those who've been joining us over time thank you so much for continuing to join us we really appreciate it and by the way when we get that feedback in uh the mentee and stuff we've been taking out to evolve uh our workshops and hopefully making them better for those of you who are new with us today yeah friend right and also don't forget to subscribe right if you go to the youtube channel we need subscribers go to the youtube channel where you uh view the video and you hit subscribe oh wait i'm in a different mode you won't see it you're going to see it in an outro in a second but if you yeah you hit subscribe uh and you click the bell then you get notifications every time we're doing a new workshop and with that thank you everybody we will exit out we'll see you next time and take care have fun with your new indexing and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
