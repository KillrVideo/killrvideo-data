    "text": "cool thanks for fighting me it's gonna be here everyone how's everyone doing tonight good filled up with pizza and beer soon so it Adrian Adrian told me that most of you are sort of at the intersection of like data science infrastructure DevOps software engineering is that roughly correct I'm seeing lots of heads not yeah unless I was a completely inaccurate representation so it's really cool to be here I'm I'm from San Francisco in the Bay Area I don't do too many talks but thought it would be really cool to start to talk publicly about some of the things were working on these days and I guess maybe just as a quick intro on myself I've spent sort of the last four years around the kubernetes project I was fortunate enough to be working at mesosphere when kubernetes was released and got to know a lot of people kind of in the in the project in the very early days started the sort of the first company around kubernetes company called Kees Matic we were sort of kind of hefty of 0.1 I think hello references maybe relevant since we're in Seattle here I think they're just up the street services support training kind of for kubernetes helped a lot of people learn about kubernetes and I also started the conference around kubernetes coop con which is now run by the Linux Foundation CN CF the group that Luke's a part of yeah that's right yeah right around the corner could the third North American coop con is going to be here again in Seattle I think the second the second one was here in Seattle last year as well except this one's gonna be a lot bigger I think something around 6000 or so people six seven thousand people yeah so kubernetes is kind of taken over the world CN CF s-- done an amazing job kind of running the event they have an incredible world-class support staff events team kind of kubernetes has been really central to my life I guess over the last several years the most recent two things that I've been working on are my current startups the second startup I've been working on which is called al-jabbar and we're working on data pipeline infrastructure built on kubernetes and sort of rethinking the way you can unify streaming and batch processing applied to machine learning data pipelines and just general-purpose data processing infrastructure and very recently a couple months ago I started a new type of venture firm kind of accidentally unintentionally didn't wake up one day a year ago and say I'm gonna do this but 2018 in particular has been sort of the most profound year for this kind of category I'm calling sort of commercial open source software companies sort of every month or so this year we've seen a pretty large commercial open source company outcome of some kind whether it's an IPO or a merger and acquisition event or private equity event of some kind and obviously you know Red Hat announced they're joining IBM over the weekend so pretty amazing year for open source so I guess as far as the AMA thing I'm happy to talk about kubernetes and nobody talked about open source funding in general it's a topic I'm pretty passionate about have been for probably close to ten years kubernetes is kind of eating the infrastructure world and in a big way there's another really exciting company here in Seattle focused on kind of multi cloud kubernetes infrastructure the upbound folks and bassam back there from upbound i think up bounds just up the street so lots of really awesome others paluma here in in Seattle area there's lots of really cool obviously help do kubernetes startups infrastructure companies I I'm happy to take any questions if anyone has any sort of thing that that you're sort of thinking about as far as how does kubernetes like impact what you're doing on a day to day to day basis how does it affect the sort of future of different projects might be working on as one dimension so if I can talk pretty extensively about kubernetes on the other side of things that I'm working on open source funding I think is a pretty polarizing complex topic and there's lots of different opinions all right what's the leadership what's the product what are you doing what's the outlook in the future you know yep what's different especially technically yeah this is a really big question so I've kind of been repeating this conviction over the last several months probably but I think it's something that I've always felt which is that commercial open source software companies are fundamentally different in almost every way functionally so by function and in those companies as compared to proprietary closed source software companies and I think you can make a distinction kind of in both areas where commercial open source software companies can be defined as fundamentally depending on an open source project to justify their existence so like github wouldn't exist without get Cloudera wouldn't exist without Hadoop elastic wouldn't exist without elastic search data stacks wouldn't exist without Cassandra and so on and so on and then proprietary software closer software companies sort of have like a top to bottom proprietary closed source intellectual property stack of some kind and they go to mark and they kind of commercialize that product in sort of fundamentally different ways than a commercial open source software company would go to market or distribute their project product web product actually has a different meaning even in commercial open source software companies so I just have I'm just of the belief that kind of everything is fundamentally different and so you could sort of like segment out those companies to be sort of fundamentally distinct on a technical level how are they different I think starts with their very developer centric so a traditional proprietary software company even if it has a free version of a product and it's like completely free use and like developers might use it with a commercial open source software company you almost don't start with the company you start with the project and the project then gradually like bleeds into the company whereas with a closed proprietary software company you really do start with a product and you have to like spend all this energy in fact from sort of like energy Joule point zero zero one onward to get anyone to use your product whereas with an open source project you can literally flip the switch on a repository and have someone in Zimbabwe using your thing when you wake up without spending any energy other than flipping the switch on the on the repo and that has an exponential effect so I think they're just two fundamentally different types of companies and then the sort of dynamics on both sides manifest in the different functional areas fundamentally differently as well in terms of you know business model and product and engineering and culture strategy marketing product sales everything functionally finance even they face question is what what what am i working on in the sort of data pipeline area as it relates to kubernetes how is it different from Kafka so I guess I'll start with the question how many of you have heard of Apache the apache software project Apache beam patchy beam wow that's impressive this is the most most hands I've ever seen go up I was at least five hands very cool okay how many people heard of Kafka Patchi Kafka more hands almost everyone oh the phone knows the phone is sort of cuff what about tensorflow who sort of tensorflow okay so I'll sort of give you a high-level answer and then it can get maybe a deeper answer and feel free to reach out to me I'm happy to go a lot deeper so today people are building different data pipelines based on different types of patterns and and sort of workflows so some some data pipelines are very real-time centric and streaming centric so you're taking in data from like clique streams or log data or some fast moving source that is sort of funneling the these sort of changes to the data into some kind of real time online pipeline and you might be using some publish/subscribe mechanism or some streaming queue or some message bus or something to process all that information and do transformations and and manipulations against the data whereas other types of pipelines are very batch offline centric so you're taking in some files or you're taking in some chunks of data from some data warehouse or something and then you're running batch operations bash pipeline so there's two different types of fundamentally different types of data processing workload with Apache beam the reason I asked about Apache beam is battery beam has an interesting model where it sort of fuses and combines the two types of paradigms in one architecture and this architecture is called the data flow model or data flow architectures it's a it's a sort of semantics or an approach to data processing as a paradigm that Google wrote about a few years ago and they had a paper published on that patchy beam is an open-source software implementation of the data flow model and data flow basically says that you can take as input to a pipeline real-time or batch sources of data but you really treat everything as a stream of data but in order to do batch processing on it you just kind of window or you have what's called a bounded snapshot or a context bounded sort of snapshot of that data and then you run transformations against sort of a window in time of a stream of events coming into a pipeline but data flow or the beam model basically says that everything is a data stream everything is a real-time kind of event stream coming into something like the data flow the data flow pipeline what the beam project then does is after you have your data coming into the data pipeline you construct a directed graph of the pipeline itself and all the steps in the pipeline and what you want what you want to do in terms of transformation and all the different processing logic in that pipeline but what beam allows you to do is in each step of the data pipeline you can actually activate or you can invoke a different data processing back-end or a different data processing technology so in one step of a beam dag pipeline you could be doing some processing in Kafka and then the output from that data in Kafka using some type of transformation function in Kafka or some publish/subscribe transformation could then go into another step in the beam model which could be doing something in maybe meet maybe tension flow and then the output from that after running some machine learning inferencing on that that data could be you know running into another step in the die which could be something in Apache spark for example so each of these data processing backends have different ways of manipulating real-time or batch data and being sort of lets you mix and match those different backends well what we've been working on is is a way to sort of simplify that general architecture that general paradigm on more modern extensible primitives like kubernetes so we're sort of taking some inspiration from this dataflow paper the state of flow model as well as the Apache beam project and looking at improving and simplifying that for for many more different types of data pipelines basically commercial open source projects so your question was the the the different commercial open source projects that we've seen which ones succeed which one spill and why do they succeed why do they fail that's interesting yeah I mean I think that there are so I guess the question was what was your name Dylan so Dylan's question was what are some patterns of success or failure in commercial open source software projects but also companies yes more companies both interesting so I'll focus on companies then so I think that there are some interesting patterns so I I've been kind of maintaining this little spreadsheet which has grown into a bigger spreadsheet it's called the commercial open source software company index it's kind of like an S&P 500 index but specifically for commercial open source software companies and I have like a criteria of you know like a revenue criteria for that index kind of like how S&P 500 is like the big higher chip index of large companies there's definitely a lot of data around what makes a very successful commercial open source software company where the definition of success is you know multi-billion dollar company with hundreds of people and it's growing and you can go public or can have a large outcome and so on compared to less successful or companies that aren't able to reach that size or scale this is this is a really complex topic and I have tons of opinions here I could probably talk for several hours I'll give you the super short I think that it's important for it's important for a software project the open source project the company is based on to be very well-positioned in an area that companies are accustomed to or conditioned to paying for commercial sort of features or sort of enterprise-e features if you will so if you're selling into an enterprise and you have a wildly successful JavaScript library and that JavaScript library has has bless you has millions of users but you go into IT corporate IT the CI o--'s office and you say hey here's my enterprise Java Script library plus plus I think there's a very low probability you'll be able to sell you know product based on your enterprise Java Script library plus plus product however if you sell enterprise version of elasticsearch this is actually sort of a database where you like to store and index your data and you query it's actually like a source of truth and it's mission-critical and so on companies are gonna be like writing and reading really important sensitive valuable data from this database and they also happen to be conditions to pay for production database oriented software like Cassandra for example and data stacks enterprise has sort of a hardened production version of Cassandra I think you'll have a higher likelihood of being able to build a business in a commercial company around something like something closer to a database I have a more abstract philosophy and way of looking at this which is that if you have an open source project that is close to to sort of like abstract layers in in sort of a technology stack like one where you're doing reading and writing of data sort of the persistence to your data path and then another tier where you're doing sort of proxying of data like the network tier or the proxy tier data path sort of like think-think Cisco switches and then think Oracle database kind of style layers if your open source project sort of sits on top of either of those layers or close to them you know that's a very abstract way of looking at it but it's just at least a high level initial framework you're you're more likely to potentially be able to build business around your your project that that could potentially be like a large-scale business yeah but that's a pretty nuanced complex area of conversation interesting well that's fascinating so your question was so there are two to two types of like product market fit stage companies that are formed around open source projects that have quite a lot of adoption and maybe validation in the usage and then companies that are formed around open source projects that are much earlier on in their adoption where you don't really see a project market fit as opposed to product market fit yeah so I think I would call it project market fit I think that's a really interesting question there's probably examples on both sides where you could build very successful companies I think the the very large and and successful well III think there's actually examples on both sides there's examples of companies that have succeeded and built large billion-dollar businesses where the company I would actually look at it abstractly like the company was started when the project was started and then they're you know there's a few examples that I can think of just off the top of my head where those companies actually were built long enough to become large businesses and then there's also many examples of or a company was formed around a project that had already been in existence for several years getting lots of adoption the company was formed and then you know also was able to build a large business so I'm not dogmatic about either either approach I think both approaches are probably valid it's certainly tempting to like sort of only support and you know say from the perspective of like OS s capital invest in companies that are formed after projects have gotten a lot of validation from end-users developers and so on I I think that some of the best companies though that are early stage but also large were actually formed when the projects were like very nascent maybe months old weeks old maybe even created as the company was created like me for which category for either category or yeah that's a huge question I mean I think so the question was what is the investing analysis or the sort of decision calculus look like on either side like early-stage open source founding team starting the company with the project that's very very earlier is just starting to be created or a project that has lots of adoption and validation and signal and then a company I think that every team is kind of considered evaluated a little bit differently traditionally I think in the sort of current venture capital approach because our our approach is pretty differentiated and different we sort of take a very pure and focused way of looking at open source commercial open source companies but I would I would say I would comment cuz I've started to companies I've raised money for both and they're both open source kind of companies traditional kind of investors and there are quite a lot of smart knowledgeable open source experienced investors commercial open source experienced investors but I think traditionally venture capitalists very very frequently optimized for mitigating risk and reducing risk around the team as a really really important factor the market opportunity what they can see here and now as things to be sort of disrupted or disintermediated or spaces to create and then finally the technology and the implementation of things what we're as you know for us all those things are also important but we just exclusively focus on the world and a spectrum of things that could be commercial open source businesses Marshall open source software businesses and we don't really have this sort of I guess distraction of also trying to generalize a decisioning model across many spaces so we just go very very deep on commercial open source and there's a way of looking at in evaluating teams that have a project that's a week-old as opposed to teams that have a project that is a year and a half old with you know 50 thousand stars and 20 million users and you know 20 20 20 25 enterprise the customers going through POCs and so on obviously you would evaluate and value those things a little bit differently it doesn't necessarily mean the risk profile is different so it's kind of case-by-case still but I would I would just say generally our belief is if you can have a really high degree of focus and just do one thing really well you can you can probably be more successful ah it's a really really good question so the question was are we using stateful sets or kubernetes primitives like in the API like the default controllers maybe when we're building our data pipeline project and infrastructure we're actually using a lot of extensibility primitives in the kubernetes api so things like custom resource definitions and custom controllers so these kind of things called operators custom kubernetes operators which are like application-specific controllers to sort of automate the way you would run so for example is something like a Sandra the way you would package and run Cassandra as a native kubernetes workload or service and where that Cassandra service has its own custom api's in the kubernetes api server and then you sort of like manage the lifecycle of those ApS through a custom controller binary as well and in that the logic and that custom controller would basically codify the way cassandra should be operated and run on a kubernetes cluster we take that pattern and we use that pattern for a different data processing dependencies that we we rely on for our data data pipeline engine so we're really big believers in custom kubernetes api so all the data are stored on correct yeah both the data processing so the question of a question Clara kind question was the data itself is stored in kubernetes that's true we also run those services natively on kubernetes so they're not running outside of kubernetes they're running directly on the kubernetes cluster and of course like Cassandra persisting storage directly on the kubernetes cluster as well as all the data pipeline infrastructures running running there as well primarily they're not super easy to get started with you have a good clean developer workflow you guys got it get them and then just beat on them and pry them and hip hack at them and figure all this stuff out do you see many companies especially in the OSS realm and that are working to make the developer flow easier yeah I think there's a lot of so the question was are there companies working on improving the developer workflow for kubernetes and sort of all the different tools and systems you need to integrate to actually build a production service like you know you've got to pull in your tracing library and your data processing layer and your monitoring and logging stack and your container runtime in your networking stack and it's like sixteen different components you've got to like compile up I think this is a really exciting active area of development in the kubernetes project itself as well as broader brought brought more broadly speaking in the kubernetes ecosystem and start in terms of startups and vendors if you take a take a look at the cloud native computing landscape there's a big maze of projects and companies that are working on simplifying the way you can push code from source repository and materialize it as a service on kubernetes through to compiling up application stacks and deploying them as helm charts or operators simplifying the way you can kind of integrate different services it's companies like weave works that have more of an opinionated git push sort of workflow with sort of a a streamlined way of pushing out your software through to production in different different sort of kind of templatized packaged khuskhus customized ways but with sort of opinionated primitives and things that that that sort of are handled for you and pre pre pre pre configured there's obviously I mean that's maybe a generous way of putting it I think the the software delivery lifecycle is so snow flakey every company does it differently it's really hard to reproduce and it's sort of like a star schema if you look in yeah I mean I think I think this is I think this is an interesting area it's just I personally I don't think anyone will agree on a common software delivery model I think we can agree on packaging which is why docker is really powerful I think we can agree on like a distributed systems API which is what Cooper Nettie's is starting to become really successful I do not think this is just my own opinion I could be wrong and maybe that's a little contrarian I do not think we'll ever agree as an industry on what an sdlc software delivery kind of opinionated captured sort of standard model will look like cuz every company wants to push out their software differently and it's for that reason that I think companies like Hoshi Corp and get labs are really successful because get lab gives you kind of a custom-tailored configurable extensible way to push your software out across a sort of automated delivery pipeline but where you can choose your own defaults and sort of customize that that pipeline hashey Corp lets you heterogeneous lis configure and and sort of modernize your infrastructure in a composable way as opposed to saying I've got a full stack rethink of something and then I've got to move to some platform as a service cloud providers also interestingly let you do that by letting you pick and choose which services you want to use so they do that with sort of like a subliminal approach sort of like take what you want just use s3 and then all the sudden you get sucked into using nine other services without really knowing it but that's really what works because infrastructure is very complex and heterogeneous and I think infrastructure is inherently Sno flaky don't think that's gonna change but lots of lots of innovation around standardizing the way you can package and configure different services on kubernetes and there's the service broker offer there's helm charts there's operators the team over at upbound in in town here are working on some really awesome things around being able to abstract away the idea of a cloud provider into the experience that you get from kubernetes which is which i think is a powerful way of looking things so lots of innovation there for sure it's a complex area kubernetes is a pretty low-level API it's kind of like almost like the Linux kernel sort of as far as the primitives that that expose its but I think over time we're gonna have more agreement on what it means to deploy an application on kubernetes and what the dependencies of an application are and that sort of thing conversations across presentations and keynote the developer doesn't need to fiddle around with right click man is gone right you know they they need to be able to build business use case right get something to the customer right so I'm very curious myself having been for a long time the person trying to build something for the customer I love all the backend stuff all sorts of big systems but at the end of the day I mean somebody and I think that's I think that's the journey everyone's on so gonna be really exciting to see coop con this year in Seattle's gonna be enormous I think there's gonna be lots of really cool announcements and I wouldn't expect anything conclusive or a binary I think it's just gonna be more innovation more tooling more more awesome approaches to things and definitely more end-user so it's gonna be just like huge huge companies you're gonna hear about some of the biggest technology internet companies in the world standardizing everything on kubernetes and its really incredible to see how fast that's happened for such a young piece of technology it's only four years old with old companies yeah that's very true yeah I saw her comments on your table oh okay okay I've reloaded like in terms of hobbies he was a bad face question was what am I take what's my take with my extended elaborate elaborated take on the IBM takeover a red hat in the context of kubernetes an open shift and so I think so first I think the first thought that came to me about like after filtering through hundreds of the comments and stuff about like the initial response of like oh this is bad for red hat it's bad for open-source and they're just gonna get extinguished or you know IBM's trying to compete with Amazon more effectively and this whole hybrid cloud thing personally I think this whole acquisition is about IBM becoming an open-source company full stop like that's what it's about the biggest technology companies in the world are trying to become open-source software companies because open-source software is the future developers are increasingly defining what the future looks like and the number one tool that developers use is open source software and so I think that's kind of the way I look at it so that my tweet was sort of like oh I BM is not buying Red Hat to dominate the cloud it's really about IBM becoming an open-source software company and to become an open-source software company acquiring Red Hat moves them much further along in that direction whether or not they realized that I think is actually an interesting question but I think that that's probably the best way of leveraging that acquisition which they're having to increase a huge amount of debt to pull off and so I think it's also a positive thing for kubernetes and for openshift and for the kubernetes ecosystem Red Hat has poured probably a few hundred million dollars into kubernetes development from the beginning they were the second biggest corporate sponsor contributor to kubernetes when kubernetes was released Brian Stevens the CTO of Red Hat ven and Clayton Coleman who was like staff engineer principal architect at Red Hat had been from the very beginning very deeply involved in the Cabrini's project so I think it's positive I think it's positive overall I think it's a huge sign that open source software is transforming the largest technology and technology companies on earth so we saw you know Microsoft is is really communicating like it's been critical and important for them to be the world's number one biggest open-source software company like that is really shocking like let's move past Microsoft embracing Linux like Microsoft saying that they're the biggest open-source software company is like five years ago oxymoronic I mean they're they're the world's largest proprietary software company that's what they really are and yet they're saying they want to be fully open source they're actually demonstrating some huge things that they open-source all of their patents a couple of weeks ago they announced that that's really earth-shatteringly huge news acquiring github is also a big commitment in that direction and the fact that they're embracing linux and embracing kubernetes microsoft's a huge kubernetes contributor that's a really big deal I think IBM's really smart to have made that acquisition I think Cisco alphabet Google Microsoft as well would have been really smart to buy Red Hat but IBM made it happen so those are my thoughts and I think open-source software is eating the world it's eating everything really beyond the world Marc Andreessen likes to say software's eat in the world I really think that open-source software is eating software seeing the world and it's eating everything else so thinks that's kind of great great future great time to be alive so developers keep writing open-source software and let's keep cheering for open-source thanks guys for having me",
