  "description": "Dave Bechberger returns to the show to discuss what you should be thinking about when adding graph databases to legacy applications, and to take us to school on being production ready.\n\n0:15 - Patrick and Dave talk about legacy applications, technical debt and the importance of continued learning\n1:42 - modernizing an application for a new use case involves assessment of which parts of the application are the best fit for graph. Different database technologies may be appropriate for different parts of the application\n3:40 - Graph is a good choice for cases like navigating relationships or a bill of materials. Plus a sidebar on \n6:05 - Sometimes there’s a temptation to use graph to solve a search problem.\n7:09 - Dave takes Patrick to school on productionizing graph applications\n8:00 - wrapping up \n\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large scale distributed systems everybody in couch mcfadden a distributed data show and we are a graph day and I'm here talking to Dave Beck Berger hey Dave hey how's it going Patrick so what are we going to talk about well today we're gonna talk about using graph databases and legacy applications all right so that could be about anything yes I think of legacy applications probably the worst thing I could think of when I think of legacy applications is like a mainframe but maybe you should help us out what's the definition you're working with well in my mind was pretty much any application you're gonna build against as a legacy application because they all have some legacy component to them you either bring your importing legacy data you're using legacy infrastructure you have to use legacy patterns your team is only used to the patterns that they're used to working with so there's always some sort of legacy part to any application building even if it's you know new I like to call legacy applications what they really are technical dead technical that well that's that's part of the legacy applications there's always lots of technical day yeah and I mean but I mean this is the industry we live in because nothing stays around for very long everything is new next year and that's why you're always have to be learning I say that all the time always be learning because things change all the time okay so here's your problem it's been three years ten years maybe since you've touched this application and you need to I would imagine this is to modernize it for anatomy at a new feature something new in this case ok where do I start well I think the first thing you start about is really sitting down and figuring out what problem you're trying to solve and what the right technology to actually you solve that problem is you know a lot of times you'll find out ways you're more going through and you're working through your thing just because it looks like a graph problem on the top on the surface doesn't mean it's a graph problem under the covers the old graph hammer and the old graph a more what I find even more common is you end up figuring out that this part of this problem is a graph problem but this part is better served and you know some other type of data story to be at a search server or Cassandra or document data store or your relational database because let's be honest relational databases they still work yeah they still work for a lot of things yeah okay so you get to that point where you're like oh I may understand the requirements hopefully and one of those I assume is some sort of a graph problem yeah okay so what about to mix though I mean is there a good case for a mixture of use cases yeah I mean my experience basically I'm a big proponent of using polygon or multi model persistence because as I said there's a lot of you know graphs are great for certain things you can do most anything in it that doesn't mean it's the right tool for that problem you know I always kind of think back that you know there's the old adage whenever eat when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail yeah you know make sure you use the right tool for the right job the relational database it's been around for a long time so you know you know use the right tools for the right parts of your problem because you know for example let's say you have an application that's very you know as a natural graph maybe you're traversing through a social network a very common thing but at some point you also want to be able to create a business bi dashboard for executives you can probably write that in a graph but you know that data is probably already being stored in a relational database as well it's probably better to use that for what it's good for and use the graph or the part it's good for and figure out a way to keep the data in sync between the two all right so walking through some of this where what are some of the ways you know that this is a better fit for say a graph database or not really sure that means because I mean this is I think a common pitfall with when looking at relational versus graph is that graph is far more normalizable than a relational database it's beyond the normalization you can get formulation so you have lots of lots of choices with graph but what makes it a good choice I think it comes down to the type of questions that you're really trying to answer you know if you're truly trying to answer how things are related more than if your questions are more about how things are related to one another then of the things themselves you know let's take the social network example you know in a social network example you want to find friends of friends of friends of friends that's really not about who the individual people are that you're working on it's about how they're interconnected to one of them so that kind of right there you know screams to me that this is a graph maybe a good solution for this problem whereas a relational database isn't so great you know for that sort of thing you know in one of the applications I've worked on was a family tree application so you were building out a family tree which is a natural graph you can think about it say it's extremely hierarchical well trying to figure out how one person is related to another person in a relational database is a really difficult problem to do because you have you're traversing an unknown number of relations in an unknown direction yeah and then you start writing recursive SQL yes which if you've ever written recursive SQL I'm sorry it's actually one of the doorways to help yeah well it's a great way to burn down a machine because this is what things get a little Tanjung here recursion is awesome until it never stops which is the first 50 or 60 times you try to run it yeah you can you can melt a machine I mean you have to have a bottom out case right yes how do you know when the bottom out cases no you don't necessarily match the problem especially if you could they take the family tree examples you have no idea how big that family tree is or how far separate people are until there are no more relatives yes exhausted the entirety of the application there's no tape oh yeah exactly so okay well that's sure that makes sense I guess I'm like Bill of Materials another one of those titles yeah problems yeah you don't know how many pieces make up that one piece that you're looking at it's another another very recursive sort of question where you're really caring about how things are related okay all right well all right on the opposite side what's a common problem that you hear people say well that's totally a graph problem but it is not a graph problem at all um like well similar example is I don't know if it's not a graph problem but it may not be the best solution for it is a search problem you know a lot of times people will do what will say oh I want to be able to search my graph to find this thing when really what they wanted in the end is some sort of search server something that's optimized to do you know fuzzy search matching right can you do it in the graph yes is it probably the best place to do it not normally if they're just they're not optimized to answer that sort of question where is if it's you know you put it into like DC search which is a you know basically is optimized to do search sort of queries and tokenization it tends to answer a better you know it tends to get a better answer faster yeah and you're gonna be doing a lot of string comparisons along the way and it's just not where you're not you know using a graph for the power of the graph at that point right you're using a graph to get an answer well if that's really what you try to do there may be a better option out there got it okay so I'm building my graph and I think this is you know we talked about this mmm you and I haven't talked about it on camera but we can now but we talked about this whole leg you know taking a graph problem to production I think that's a last mile problem that's a it's really difficult for engineers is how do you production alized that say okay I guess I would make the the argument that it's not really a last mile problem because she should be thinking about production when you start the project I stand corrected of because to me one of the biggest things I've seen is you get to the end and then you start worrying about scale or how am I actually gonna run this against you know how am I gonna run this this traversal against not the you know 200 thousand nodes in my in my graph my two billion nodes that exist in my graph something like that you know you want to think about those sorts of things earlier on in the process to basically try and minimize the risk of those becoming a bigger issue later on alright wow this is a lot to think about is there anything else I need to know well the problem and daylight and electricity age of the universe well thanks Dave this has been really helpful and interesting glad you can do it and let's do it again sometime sounds great alright everyone will remember if you love this content and you want to see Dave again remember to subscribe and that little bill buttons get that you get notified next time something comes up so we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think you can also find us on
