that the people people have a little bit time to to join this webinar but uh but yeah like uh welcome all to this webinar where we will be discussing the beautiful release of uh cassendra 5 and what opportunities that brings to you and uh and yeah let's uh let's actually do a quick introduction of the host today so my name is samic oen I would be one of the hosts for this webinar today and I'm working at the data stacks and leading the uh Solutions engineering team here in nemia and um with me I have Mick who has a profound uh background in history with Cassandra so please could you go and introduce yourself thank you s um hi everyone Thanks for turning up uh yeah Mick here so I've been with working with Cassandra going back to 2011 uh now and uh I am a committer on the project and a PMC member I have been a past chair of the project as well as well as a chair of other Apache projects uh because I am passionate about open source uh which is why we're here today I've also debled around with uh different things at work so I have been an engineer I have done Consulting and I've worked in product um I I've worked with Sami uh Sami is one of the best that we have have uh I'd say that Consulting is one of the things yeah no absolutely um and and working with customers and helping people out it's one of the best things we do isn't it Sami I think absolutely yeah and we I'm so excited about this Cassandra fire obviously we've been using already some features of this already but I think this is really a game changer for the whole Cassandra community and it's just like unlocking so many new new uh use cases for uh the Cassandra Community as well so uh before we start a couple of uh uh Health full tips rules and so forth so throughout the webinar well this is a new platform that uh we are using so hopefully I'm able to share a couple of polls here and there which I obviously hope that you're participating in then we have a bunch of uh additional assets that we're going to share and there will be a small call to action where you can actually then uh find more information about the web uh in the web about the topics that we have discussed so and no worries This Record uh this session will be recorded everything that you see and all the asset that we share during the presentation will be will be shared with you afterwards then as well so if you w if you miss a call to action here and there it's not the end of the world we do have also a QA session so how to handle questions so there's specific part in the platform where you can post and park your questions we have section at the end where we will be answering those questions and uh in addition we do have like a chat opened as well so feel free to come chat uh give your observations over there but be mindful and of course respect the other attendees as well we you we might if we are able we can uh pick up some questions and answer those quickly if there are some but the the bigger question questions and so forth um we will answer at the end of the event did I miss something Mick that was everything that was everything okay so then without further Ado I think it's time to dive into the into the actual agenda of today so we're going to start obviously then the majority of the webinar will be talking about the cassander 5 features not just features Mick is going to share some of the recommendations as well what's good to take into the account when you're uh when you're configuring and installing this one and just that we have that mind-blowing features also coming in the 5.1 we don't want to leave uh leave this webinar without touching on top that topic as well then we are briefly touching also about the upgrade upgrade Parts um and talk a little bit how to not just survive but actually how to try with Cassandra and the future releases and the questions so that's the structure for today and uh let's go to the next slide which would be the introduction to the main feature of 5.0 and before that there's a little bit context how we got here so Mick what do you think yeah so uh there's a lot of details on this slide but I think uh it's a great slide to begin with because uh it lets us talk about the journey that we've been on since 4 Z which uh it it helps us give a lot of credibility to uh it's not just the features coming in five that's a big deal that this this train has probably left the station and is moving uh and things are happening so Cassandra kind of uh came back in a big way with 4 Z but for the most part it was about uh different uh companies and and the contributors and the committers being more diverse today coming together from different places and kind of reestablishing uh a working relationship but also uh the ground rules so to speak and one of the most important things with that was QA uh and so our QA system in Cassandra is is really extensive today and a lot of stability stuff went into 40 you know the testing in the QA stuff that can be hard work and that's one of the reasons it took so long to get 40 out but then on the back of that we came out with 4.1 it was still focused on operational stuff and stability issues but we were also starting to do some foundational improvements and refactorings there uh with you know looking forward to what was coming later 5 it is the release where we're really starting to see all of that past work pay off and all of these big features are now coming out a number of these big features have been in production in DSC or other solutions for many years already so 5 is already a very uh uh strengthened and stable release because these features are being upstreamed from other places which is what we're seeing now as Cassandra becomes a more mature and more diverse product and then going into 51 we see that that momentum isn't a oneoff it's continuing to roll out and the features coming out in 51 are even bigger we have asset transactions we have transactional cluster metad dat uh we have a whole lot of other stuff coming too which is super exciting back to you Samy yeah okay so let's let's try let's try our first poll here so people are still joining I see that people are still joining in but let let's give it a try so now let's see if this works so I I made the poll visible now hopefully you can see that and you can choose so just curious about what is your existing like the main cassendra cluster version that you're using today and let's see if we can get any answers like I'm equally interested in understanding whether I can operate these PS and what are the actual results here but let's let's just use this I believe in you Samy yeah at least there's one vote so technically I think it should be working so okay now now there's couple of more so let's just like give it a few seconds then again and again it's it's not like intention that we need to wait here for minutes in order to get the full full blown full-blown view on here so let's see we have few of those uh okay okay let's uh let's just uh move forward so we have a we have U we have a 25% on cassander 3 25% on cassendra 4 and 50% of none of the above so maybe hopefully we have also some people in the C that is looking into start using Cassandra all right um let's move forward so let's uh let's talk a little bit about the main features in Cassandra 5 so story indexes is a great significant Improvement in the indexing so could you walk us through this yeah so storage attach indexes uh um has been under development uh for a long time so the secondary indexes in Cassandra have always been a bit of a s point we have the Legacy uh secondary indexes uh in Cassandra um which they write to different um tables internally and come with their own set of problemss and write amplifications then we have uh the sazzy which came along later there okay but they also had a number of problems what SII does is it's uh able to add a lot more it's a lot more efficient and it's able to add a lot more indexes on the one table and scale efficiently um this is this has been a big win um the performance of it is solid uh and it also allows us to build other things on top of it so some if you want to go to the next slide yeah and I believe this is also reducing the storage needs that you need for the indexing as well so it's one of the benefits so let's go yeah so one of the kind of a use cases for SII is similarity search yeah so this is a big one and it came in the development cycle for five quite late uh the the whole gen AI hit us uh like a thunderstorm um uh so but uh from a usability point of view Vector searching Cassandra super simple uh this one of the really beautiful things about it so you can just take an existing table in the uh as we've got in the first step and just add this embedding column and the type is a vector of a float and then you just add the array Dimension according to the wedings that you're going to use uh for these vectors then after that once that's there and you've got data uh and you want to put data into you can put data into it you add a vector index on that column this is step two uh and that index you just say that you're using the the S index type under the hood it's actually going to use the J Vector Library um and allow you to do searches there but the J Vector Library works with this and index so very simple uh next slide we can see how to query it so the different ways to to to query these vectors uh since they're not restrictions the syntax is in the order by Clause so the first example where we want to do a a vector search uh anywhere in the table we're just selecting from the demo table and we're just saying uh uh select your Resorts by your proximity uh appr proximus nearest neighbor proximity uh to the embedding column um and you provide your own uh embedding there and I'm just interested in the top 10 results of course we can also do this within a petition this is a very common pattern in Cassandra it's a very high performant um uh approach if you've got petitions with thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of rows in them um you can do VOR search within each of these petitions and of course as you saw with this example we've got the original data and the embeddings in the same table uh you can do and you could have lots of other columns uh in each row as well so you can combine your indexes here this is one form of hybrid search and it's all within the single SQ statement uh so it's very powerful yeah I think that is cool that you can combine these two thing in one run trip and you can kind of basically filter and do the hybrid search based based on this syntax excellent so uh yeah next slide yeah so before we jumped on to the the next fibo feature uh I talked about this and and we kind of wanted just to kind of briefly touch on why this is such a big deal this Vector search feature is such a big deal for Cassandra and if you look at what Cassandra is and if you look at what gen is doing uh to systems designs and to people's platforms you see that the vector search is just the the perfect feature for us so Cassandra's platform we know it's strength it's it's it's highly available you know it's it's um the dour of availability systems for databases you can knock out whole racks you can knock out data centers and your your application doesn't notice you no business impact whatsoever uh it's linear scalable um you know and up until you know like hundreds and thousands of notes this is like like there's a lot of prestigious engineering into this more importantly for the user linear scalability it's not just about this is a technology that you can invest in and at some point in in the future uh when you're successful not have to rewrite it it also means predictable costs over your success path um which is incredibly important for for for for businesses it's a low latency database uh you're getting all your results in milliseconds it's a database that sits in the transactional space uh and it uh uh replicates around the world and that can be for the sake of uh uh availability um and resilience but it can also be uh just bringing the data closer to client applications that are deployed in different regions why is that important for Gen well we see that uh if you're using uh if you're using J then you're using Rag and if you're using rag then you're using vector and what it means is is that there's going to be an explosion of data in your database and you need it to be low lat um you know and and what we're seeing is that as people are uh are doing more with their Vector search and as people are um introducing more and AI agents and not just AI agents which are uh the humans are directly interacting with but AI agents that are kind of using each other they see that the the traffic load and the traffic shape on the database traditional is is significantly changing from your your traditional uh transactional database and this is really where Cassandra and all of its uh variants are coming in strong yeah next slide s yeah and this this is why we've been investing so heavily in this space because we feel that it's our home turf and here are some of the numbers to speak to that uh Sami do you want to do you want to take one of these uh uh which one this you can choose uh is is do you have a favorite on this yeah well well let's start from the left left to right then so so maybe we can start from there so we just recently have a a forest survey report that was evaluating and doing research on the various different Vector databases in the market today and basically because of the characteristics and the capabilities that the mick was mentioning just earlier on Cassandra and ASB has been put there as a leader ER in this category and actually the number one in the hybrid search Vector store uh category so I think that is the giveaway and I think we have here we have a call to action as well so if you want to take a little bit deeper look in the report I mean it's fairly like extensive so you can find all the details how the comparison was done what's good and bad on various different vectors vector options in in in this research and uh yeah so maybe the right hand side is then just basically giving out the kind of advantage that we have with cassendra based Vector stores you get higher true puts uh the Ingus is uh faster and also the relevance and recall that you can get is much much higher as well and I guess this is a good place to remember or remind the people that actually data stacks and and J Ellies have made a massive massive amount of work with J Vector that is basically now the core core of the vector search capabilities in Cassandra yeah yeah so that J Vector library that that Ellis has been uh absolutely momentum uh momental on on um as it's it's shown here so this was a on the right hand side we've got a results from a gig report where we're just blowing pine cone out of the water on every front um and we're seeing this across the board with comparisons against all the different Vector databases and uh you know to to note out on this one of the things that they did the J Vector team was you know they looked at the they started off kind of at the Lucine Vector search and they kind of were trying to work with that and then they quickly fored off that and then they looked at the the hnsw W algorithm that was typical for an and Best in Class at the time and then they went off and looked at the research and they looked at Microsoft's research on dis and they went implemented that um and they actually went once they kind of implemented it and had it running they went back to the that Microsoft team of researchers and kind of got to speak to them about this is how your paper actually works you know so we were first to marker with with implementing that research paper and there's been a number of other research papers that we've been first on to so you know way out front when it comes to to to that right okay maybe moving forward to the next feature another one of my favorites uh from our fellow colleague brir so we have now M tables which are based on Tri trees and SS tables which also use TR trees uh this is you know to n out again this is the first time time tries have been used in database in the industry uh and we've uh people didn't think it was possible or really feasible uh but what Bren did was uh he did a few novel things uh in how the the tri implemented especially uh for example some of the information that's that's in the nodes uh of each in the tree and here we have a benchmark so you can see here the previous uh format is been benchmarked in the red and with tries we're getting at least a doubling of throughput uh so this is huge I mean it's it's it's more effective on dis and uh a smaller uh size that has a number of overheads uh but we also don't need the the key index file anymore um so that's one less file to look up in the process there a number of uh knock on effects for this to take advantage of this you need to uh switch your SS table format to uh to bti so by default in five you know all the settings will be kind of uh conservative you know keeping in mind uh your upgrading um take advantage of this you need to switch your assess table format yeah definitely like the the gains here are really really impressive so so definitely take advantage of this feature uh and another big Improvement unified competion strategy I like this one actually yeah yeah I think I think personally this is my favorite feature that came out in 5 um and I think it's because you know users having to pick a compaction strategy has always been exposing Cassandra as a a newer and andar database that that to pick the right compaction strategy you kind of have to understand the databases that Cassandra is a log structured merge tree design uh and that have some idea of how your data in your schema is actually going to land in the SS table format on disk um and all these kind of internals UCS is the first step away from that so UCS is a single compaction strategy that has uh ergonomics in it so that you can tune it uh with tuning you can get it to replace how other compaction strategies behave today the the primary uh tuning uh option it presents is this this option called Static scaling factors It Is by default set of two and the value of two it will behave like size teed compaction strategy does today as you scale it uh you scale it uh uh down and negative uh it will start behaving more more like the leveled compaction strategy if you want it to behave exactly like leveled compaction strategy you would set that to a setting of minus8 there are a number of other options here too um the basic way of of of uh explaining them is is uh how they result in less compaction um that's kind of more like size Ted compaction so the idea that data can kind just set in in older SS tables once it's compacted um you know then you don't have to do be as aggressive with compactions one of the other and probably more important wins with compaction strategy for for you as the user for all the users is its ability to work with much bigger data sets so using UCS in combination with tries and the other performance and throughput improvements in 5 Z we're seeing that no density now can be doubled so we've kind of gone from that soft limit of of one terab per node to two terab per node with the the the harder upper limit of 4 terab per node going up to 8 tab per node some small tips here if you're using it and especially if you're increasing your node density uh you'd probably want to increase the current compactors uh to match the number of calls cor CPU calls you've got and you'll most likely want to increase your Java Heap up to 31 gig so m is is it like a like UniFi comass is that kind of replacing all the other ones or is there a reason why you shouldn't be using this one instead of some some other yeah no there's really there's really not um you will need to go in and manually switch over tables uh if you're upgrading from previous version to use this so the exception may be time window compaction strategy so when time window compaction strategy works it's perfect um but it has a lot of caveat so you know the rights have to come in in chronological order the rows have to be written soorry excuse me in chronological order and it's very easy for those things to break and then time compaction Falls away so in many ways unified compaction strategy is the safer option that replaces everything uh with very very little loss um in the tww Cs now these tuning options now if if you go to the docs for Cassandra it looks a little bit like a research paper the tuning options can be a little bit intense uh it's going to take some time to learn them and get good at them that's what Luna support is uh lunar support could help you with that straight away uh down the road we may uh uh introduce the the automated ergonomics around this so um unified compaction strategy it just it just uh self- Tunes itself into the right sweet spot for the data model as it's keeping its hero sticks um on that we have that in Astra uh that's a picture for Astra it know it does that for you uh if we Upstream that that's just a matter uh of time and resources available for us if that happens no promises there good I think yeah that I think that that feature is well covered right now and then maybe like uh obviously there's a lot of other features as well so it's not just C Fire release is not limited to these but I think those were uh one of the most important ones and then maybe can you work us through a little bit like recommendations for the think yeah so I've actually ripped this slide off our support team um who who are very very talented um and I saw this and I'm just like great I'm taking it uh I'm all for stealing stuff um that's the Australian in me uh I'm a true convict in that sense um but going with those recommendations uh which which are completely sound so uh lwts a lot of people have problems with lwts they there's contention problems with lwts they're not very performant Cassandra 4.1 came out with a version two of paxis a lot of people don't realize this uh you've got to go in and enable it and that will reduce the network round trips of each uh pxas or light went transaction call from two down to one so that's a doubling of through Port so that can have quite a significant Improvement and it's an important step uh that we got out uh and validate in people's production around the world uh in preparation for a c that's coming at - Z comes to repairs uh so since Cassandra 4 the default has been incremental repairs incremental repairs uh generally work much better uh and cause lot less load they can require different tuning uh if you're still running on 256 V noes that can be a problem um and when it comes to scheduling and other things we recommend that you use Reaper and also pay attention that uh incremental repairs will only uh keep at rest consistency for uh issues with your your rights and the Cassandra when the Cassandra system itself or the operations of that is at fault you can still have problems like dis rot um and that's why uh it can be wise to still run a full repair quarterly for example guard rails guardrails is one of the features that we came out in uh came out with in 40 and since then the community has just gone wild on them Apple Netflix uh net app um Aven they've all jumped on this and added stuff it's super popular so there's heaps and heaps to choose from and there a quick few to highlight uh that we think are really important and will certainly make your your operators of Cassandra much much happier you can disallow the use of simple strategy uh in production you can disallow anyone doing a drop key space uh you can also kind of set like a base uh up a limit default time to live on tables where they're using time andaction strategies or where you know the D model is supposed to always being uh putting time to lives on the RO request but sometimes Dev teams you know bug comes out and all of a sudden you got like a couple hours or a couple of days until they get the fix out of rights in the system that didn't have TTL on them um we have in Cassandra 5 now a configuration file called Cassandra latest yaml so if you're doing a a new cluster if you are doing a a proofer concept or if you're doing benchmarking this is the configuration file to use it has all of the latest and greatest stuff in it not just experimental it can just be uh stuff that's that's new and stable the reason that a lot of those optimal settings are not in the Cassandra yamamo file is the Cassandra yo file has to stay conservative because it's primary primarily keeping in mind that people are upgrading from previous versions so you're supposed to do an upgrade first and once you're confident with the upgrade and or the postoperational activities then you can start turning on the news features but of course now that applies if you got a new cluster uh jump moving on don't use the the the Legacy secondary indexes or sazzy move straightway to SII they are just so much better and more stable and there's a few more features there too never use materialized views so materialized views are problematic especially over time uh and if you're setting up a new cluster use 16 V nodes and take advantage of the allocate tokens for local replication Factor um and if you're setting up your your your your cluster topology for the first time use uh one Rack in HDC or RF number of racks in HDC and RF most people is usually three so that's a three RX for DC recommendation okay yeah so so yeah so if you using materialized views no need to wait so start looking at how you can convert those to SII SAA use cases right s did normalize it try to find something else for materialized views there will be some uh a lot more possibilities for you in 51 with a cord but you know um that may be too far away for you if you're having production issues already with them so the next two slides uh I've taken from my Summit talk uh and there was a coure to Action Link um for the YouTube video for that presentation and that present ation uh I go through uh all of the different recommendations or typical problems and fixes that 25 years of Consulting have accumulated uh at the last pickle and data Stacks now you can't assume that any of these are actually problems for you they are just things for you to go check and validate and potentially fix the other nice thing with these slides you know I think there's like 15 or 20 of these slides in that talk is next to the items where there is a Improvement or fix coming in a newer version of Cassandra there's a little eye with the version number next to it uh to encourage people to get on to you do an upgrade rather than waste time uh fixing these things that the hard laborious way yeah so this webinar is way too short and and not focusing going into really really details of these but like like Mick said there's a lot of wisdom and insight so for anyone who wants to di please take a look at the YouTube video it's it's going to be awesome all right I think we are we are uh we are done with the 5 features or the overview of that one and then one juicy part from the upcoming 5.1 version as well which is not that actually that far away but what we think is going to be again like unlocking a whole new world for Cassandra and supporting the assd transactions so so yeah Sammy this one is Big this one is really big um should we pause for a minute just to let it sink in before yeah yeah no yeah I think I think just this this this the more you dive into this one the more the more it takes the breath away um so yeah so first of all uh this has taken a long time but that's no surprise for for for what's at hand uh so in 5.1 trunk um transactional cluster metadata and everything else has already been committed and this is the last remaining feature I believe to be committed and we're very very close um this has gone through trillions of tests uh iterations uh at Apple so this is the the the amount of testing that's going on here to get this the acid guarantees you know in all situations uh is is incredible Bea and you know it's it's it's it's it's huge because it means you know this are called um consensus protocol that that that the folks from uh think Michigan University and from Apple have come up with it's kind of you know looking at it's taking Pax paxis and rft and Janus and Caesar and all these other consensus protocols that we've had and moving them a step forward for Cassandra it's important that it's a leaderless uh solution um like paxis was but it works on commodity Hardware so just your existing Hardware um but it's able to do cross table cross partition transactions with single Network around trips it makes Cassandra an asset compliant database more importantly than that it really in the industry raises our definition in practice of of what those asset guarantees are isolation levels we're going to strict serializability here that is more than any of the relational databases can do today at least with any any reasonable realistic performance in production so the only other database that I know of that can do this is spanner and spanner is very very expensive you need specialized hardware for the clocks to do that and it's quite slow it's in 100 milliseconds this will still be at Cassandra performance speeds um on the slide there's a quick example of what a transaction would look like you can see once you can do this you know cross tables too you then have referential integrity so you not just like you have getting cons consistency uh over all your different uh failure modes in Cassandra not just isolation this this ability to work uh transactions across table cross petitions it opens up a lot of possibilities for you and and what what's also fascinating about this is there is no roll back mechanism for the user so the way that the Accord asset transactions work is that if the coordinator accepts the transaction it's done it's accepted it's in the system um you don't the user never has to kind of go oh transaction uh now is rejected I've got a roll back it doesn't happen so very very sweet uh technology coming at us here yeah and it's so cool I had so many conversation yeah but you know C it doesn't support the assd transactions and and now it does and not just does it support but goes to the highest maturity level of of assd transactions so that's really cool there's a call to action there if you want to deep diver there's this uh Cassandra enhancement proposal where you can go into the details again if you want a deep diver on this one absolutely I think I think this one's going to be a bit of a cognitive dissonance uh for a few people especially the traditional database rdms Engineers um so you know but uh it it goes back to you know what we really meant with the nosql Monica that that we weren't dissing on SQL we weren't kind of you know really worrying about or that focused about uh the interface of the API the database we this is about distributed computing this is about the challenge of taking a database ideally as powerful and flexible as the imms systems are and just taking it from a monolith to a microservices um solution so you get the added capabilities of scalability um and this this this is certainly leading the way on that front so thank you all the engineers yeah a awesome job so uh really really inspirational work uh there so that will conclude now the Cassandra features like 50 and 51 and then spend a little bit I'm here with the with the uh kind of upgrading parts and what we think is really kind of when we are work with our Enterprises to see how they are just whether they're just trying to survive in the in the game or whether they actually doing something more now and moving into the drive drive uh Camp so let me let me is there check there's no questions uh well maybe take one question over here in the mid since related to the asset transaction so do we have any prelim or any Benchmark results for asset transaction me would you know um so I'm not too sure which tools out of the box will handle uh give you like like be able to support that new kind of transaction syntax SQL synex um as far as going about benchmarking it uh so the the uh Accord Branch it's in the Cassandra repository already so if you go to the GitHub cassand repository uh today you can Benchmark it already um it's about when it gets as soon as it gets merged uh you can just um you know grab a build you can grab one of the nightly de builds as well night. p.org uh you take it for spin if if you want to um so as far as what we have seen um I I don't I don't have the numbers but I remember um um you know as soon as things hit 100 milliseconds uh that was like like a bug like people were going to fix it and of course it has been espcially like the the the way that the um uh proposes the sorry I don't have the correct terminology off the top of my head but there's a number of flexibilities or configuration options in the Accord um uh you can tune um so it's quite a a flexible uh solution that can be deployed in a number of different ways and so there has been kind of a few edge cases with some of the different configuration sets which which would be non-normal for nearly everybody out there um where performance has tanked and uh that has been part of the journey over the last year fixing all of those different cases it is expected to be low latency it is expected to be on par with Cassandra's performance uh otherwise uh and single network round trip so talking 10 20 milliseconds all right thank you Mick and and you and any followup questions please put those in the QA section as well so we'll we'll handle then uh the rest of them uh later on yeah so let's just quickly go through this part of the section as well so how how to get into kind of a how to leverage the 5 and all the good features that you just uh seen in it and although this is now focused on the Cassandra uh it's the Gen wave is like too too big to be kind of uh not not taken into account and we like obviously all the benefits that we have in the Cassandra 5 yes they can you can use less resources than to run and support the same workloads that you have today for your uh supporting your use cases in your Enterprise but the Gen is really setting a new demand for what needs to be done and how there's a totally new way of of u u gen supporting applications that requires Enterprises to modernize the data layer as well so it's just new new capabilities so you can there's a lot of companies that are they're they're free to choose like there some of them are going to stay in the self-managed categories and uh you know maybe moving to more kubernetes environment and building like a Readiness to be Cloud native driving down down the TCO Coast because because the the amount of the data that they needs to be storing and serving for the application will be exponentially growing going to the Future so now is the good time to modernize your data layer in order to get ready for that one and then some of the companies already are looking into a kind of a how to modernize their data layer and also maybe how to use take advantage of cloud cloud services for that one but really in the era of AI this is just more or less like just moving from the C four to five and having that Vector store capability is typically not enough in order to thrive and stay ahead of the competition so that's where you really need to have something more and we what we think that you will need is to have a AI platform and uh that is something that like uh anything that we do in the data stack we rely on open source components right and that is true also for the components that we are using for the data tax AI pass so you have a you need to have a rapid orchestration layer so no code low code layer where you can rapidly pilot an experiment and create your gen applications and uh so I'm going to what we actually mean with the platform so you need to have an orchestration layer serving your developers being super productive in creating new gen application that needs to those application needs to be fueled with the vector vector engine Vector so capabilities and obviously that would be Cassandra powered and in this case it will be Astra and a platform cannot survive unless it's very well uh integrated into the ecosystem so you need since this like a echo since this chain AI landscape is moving so fast you need to be able to uh maintain that agility and choose what is the best for your use cases so that's why you need to have like uh a a platform that is agnostic to which llms you are using supporting agent Frameworks various agent Frameworks providing help with the ingestion whether it's embedding services or pulling in unstructured data in your data platform so all of these and in addition that you want to run that in any environment that you you uh you want to so all this is something that we think is pretty much mandatory in order to stay ahead of the competition nowadays and obviously now Cassandra like Mick Shon and we' seen in the Fester reports is the perfect engine to fuel the geni and AI era Thunder with those earlier slides didn't I Sammy a little bit a little bit yeah yeah you wrapped it up perfect you wrapped it up yeah but again this is not the topic so probably we're going to have a less separate topic on gen and and platform then and uh Vector capabilities but just wanted to go quickly to what's happening in the market and then when we when we are supporting our Enterprises uh whatever is the path to the to the kind of a utilizing the center 5 features then we are there to help M already mentioned this Luna support so if you want to keep uh like if you really um want to keep uh following the open source 100% open source mode that's perfectly fine we can help you with whatever you want to achieve with that you have access to our amazing support team and could us for the support team for the recommendations so they really know their stuff so that's something that can help you but one thing that I want to remind here in this slide is that the we've seen many of customers now going into Cassandra 5 using the vector store and doing Benchmark then with with another vendors about the performance and recall so since the since the the landscape is moving so fast we are actually moved already into next gener or next versions of this uh J vector and for example moved away from the h nsv like uh you sto my thunder again but you mentioned this already that we are done some technical significant changes in the vector then uh that leads to a much better performance and better recall as well and those features are actually the one that put us into the leader category in the forest report so now this upgraded Vector store capabilities you can run in your bare metal with data SE Enterprise if you are ready to move into more kubernetes environment all over your TCO you can go with the a hyperon converge database option or then if you really want to focus on Innovation and building value for your business then and not spend time with maintaining the infrastructure then there's always the fully managed Astro DB which we we host for you so those are probably couple of the different four different options and rules that you can take in getting your existing Cassandra workloads to a new uh better State and and again if you would uh just one one more one more thing here is that even though you will be going and following your open- Source uh kind of policies with your Enterprise the Lang flow and the orchestration layers are also like compatible with open source cassendra as well so and Lang flow orchestration is open source component as well so feel free to use that combination as well it's up to you really to choose what is best for you I think a really good thing to add on to that Sami is is that um you know we certain the last couple years I think all of us we've seen this explosion in what we have to do and the tech stack with Gen and all of a sudden it's kind of like like we've all in in some ways got a broader TCH stack but also moved up the TCH stack and we're needing to solve like like new things very quickly kind of higher up in the tech stack so it's still important that we're working on on on a tech stack which is completely open source so if you want to Deep dive or do it yourself you can but a lot of people are finding that uh it's even more than ever it's too much they're on top um and and where there to to look after the the whole stack the whole platform for you yeah and there's actually l now if you want to take a look at the AI plus platform so there's a call to action there as well uh one of the last slides here is also when you are doing your migration uh migration upgrading there's a good again open source tooling that is available something called zero downtime migration which allows you to take your existing clusters and move that to a new Target uh cluster without any downtime and again there's a call to action here uh let's see if we can find that one I think yeah it's over there so there's actually like a awesome asset online and there's even a handsone lab where you can experiment kind of this process so the process as such is fairly simple and straightforward so you have a this CDM proy that you're enabling and putting that between your application cental cluster that enables you to do dual writing then and then you can choose to in various different we have various different tools then where you can actually then do the history iCal data migration while while while the real time events is is uh dual written in your in your new clusters in this picture we are using side loader for Astra that's something that you could do for example take your backup and then just like upload this Stables to asdb but if you're moving from the open source to open source for example there's Center data migration and even for smaller worklow DS bulk that can be used and move move over the historical data again the link is shared over there and please take a look if if that is something that you are now figuring out what is the tooling for the migration so although this migration tooling is helpful and soon seems uh really easy to use devil is in the details right so if you especially if you're coming from a older Cassandra version then you cannot just like a move directly into from two to five for example so maybe Mick you want to give a little bit like a heads up what to take into account yeah so this is one of the real pain points for people and and and you know just to say quickly we are going a little bit over time um but this I think we only got two more slides to go or one more slide after this before we jump in the Q&A so so said in the chat hang in there people um so we want to talk about major upgrades because it's such a pain point and it's becoming more of a pain point because the wonderful thing about Cassandra now having uh annual releases and uh building up this momentum is uh unfortunately the communities also said you know because it is uh we uh people can be using their volunteer time as well in the open source world the community that we've got can only commit to maintaining the last three versions uh otherwise it just becomes too much for us so that we're supporting only uh uh last three majors at any one time that means with the Five O release the the three 0 and 31 versions already out a day um that means that people are going to have to uh upgrade uh roughly every 18 months uh so that's a lot of bit of work and why every 18 months well because uh We've also said um the community can only only has the resources to test upgrades uh between adjacent major uh versions so you can upgrade from any three version to any four version uh with uplate with with with you know without downtime um and from any four version to any five version so we've kept those version numbers uh kind of operational operation Centric uh so you know um other than that we do recommend that you also upgrade on the major version that you're on to the latest patch version of it before doing the major version jump um and that's because there are there can be bugs uh related to upgrades they can only be fixed in the The Source version what you're upgrading from other than that um you know we have a quick uh process outline here uh there is a number of steps to go through with prerequisites and homework um understanding all the different steps understanding uh roll back uh um possibilities um then uh there's you know and also understanding what all the different uh changes that are going to hit you are kind of getting your expectations in place um than doing it um we tell people you know upgrade one turn repairs off uh make sure you're not going to have to add or remove nodes uh or replace nodes during the upgrade then then um once you've upgraded one node let it sit for like six hours or a day and just watch how it behaves and make sure that there's no characteristic differences uh in in the performance it may have a broad impact once the whole cluster has changed um and then afterwards you know you've got to restore repairs and their backup procedure you've got to then go into upgrade uh your SS tables and only after you've done all of that uh do we recommend taking advantage of new feat es it's a lot this is another reason to reach out to to Luna support um and get help we do have a call to action we do have a brief guide book uh there Sammy can you put that link in because I didn't actually learn how to put the C AC which one the Luna it's in the notes on slide 25 so the Luna Cassandra guides upgrade did you get that [Music] I'll just put it in I'll just put it in the chat yeah yeah so I missed that one but all right so but actually there's a um something that we can help as well just to understand what are the prerequisite where you are today with your Cassandra cluster so this is uh yeah there's another call to action as well so I mean this is something that we want to do and and for you as well so we can run a diagnostic collector uh checking your existing cluster and with the then producing a report where you would see like uh insides of your existing cluster it will be also help helpful for you to understand what things would you need to uh change before you would be able to move for example to the cloud so we talking about the guard rails and so for so this is just like a good practice whether you are actually migrating away or not uh this is good good um good like uh good service that we would be happy to help out with you so please fill in the form and our um uh our solution Engineers will be then reaching out and instruction you have you can actually run and collect this information from your from your clusters so thanks for sticking out so hopefully this is a this is helpful and with that Insight then we talked about the different migration Parts what are your options after uh analyzing this one then hopefully those discussions would also be easier for you to do internally and decide what is the route that you want to take Mick I've done we we should have been talking a little bit faster so we have a little bit late but let's dive in directly into ask us anything in the Q&A session over there yeah let's jump to the first question um and and folks if you did ask a question in the chat and we missed it um feel free to rewrite it in the the questions uh section since we're looking at that now um so first one uh do you plan to publish performance tests with comparing four 4.1 to five uh so um yeah there there been a number of benchmarks uh uh and tests that have run um so you know you saw with with UCS and with tries sometimes we could double through reput um we see uh with tries you know often uh 20 30% um perform latency reduction we've seen just a switch to jk1 um often giving 20% uh performance Improvement performance Improvement very vague um yeah you'd have to jump into those those reports to get more details uh on them um you know it's it's it's one of those things that those sometimes those individual benchmarks that can be particularly focused on one particular domain and so you know you may have a table that hits that switch spot and you'll get all of those benefits a doubling of through put is is pretty sweet um otherwise that just might not be your bottleneck in your system and so you don't see those uh improvements um but but it's the jdk stuff which which the JK stuff and the tries which which are are really big um uh and and do kind of impact everything um and again you know there can be small edge cases one particular uh SQL statement might run uh 2% or 5% slower um uh just because of you know that's how code Works um that's why we kind of make sure that you kind of let a node that's upgraded uh sit for a while because um yeah you never know but hopefully with the with with with with the Improvement overall uh any such things come out with the wash next question thank you so hopefully that y answered your question and like if if there's something that you still want to reach out after the after the webinar please do reach out to me or Mick and we can help with that one but let's move to the next question does UCS work better with incremental repairs compared to size te compaction strategy uh this depends on how you tune the UCS um uh but yes we are aware of the problem with anti- compaction and a high number of tokens so 256 V nodes uh is a problem with streaming events with antic compaction um especially any comption back of repairs for example um uh if you can lift and shift your data center to a new data center with lower V noes uh it's bit of work there uh hopefully there' be more possibilities to address that with 5.1 um only thing I can say this and it's not it's not a silver bullet but but uh in those situations um token range incremental repairs may not work either um so what a lot of people were doing with the full repairs is to get them through and to kind of add some resiliency to the repair repair schedule they were um doing toen ranges of repairs uh the problem with incremental repair in token ranges is there's an application of of the antic Confections uh happening that that you may not have that spare capacity in the cluster for it's a good question not a great answer sorry all right then um then let's move to the next one and think the next one is the the about materialized views yeah hiana hi it's good to hear from you again uh it's been a couple of years now um so materialized views yes we expect them to be um not deprecated but uh we expect there to be a replacement for them built on top of a cord and TCM um so the cord will be able to do materialized views with the asset guarantees um and uh importantly given mv's materialized use weaknesses uh be able to handle petition tolerance and and and and Reconciliation of data um after petitioning of data between the base table and the the materialized view which is the the big challenge today and the one that you don't hit until further down the road so yes hold hold in um and if you're keeping materialized views running for the moment maybe just keep an eye out for 5.1 next question do you see you click the button next one yeah there's a bit of a lag like getting the previous one down so maybe you can read out the see inspiration from Sila uh yeah as as what not to do um tongue and cheick um well in the community side yes because they they haven't been involved in the community um they've kind of been a satellite and while comp competition especially open source competition is fantastic so there's a definite yes there um the they're still stuck on 3x features uh so their their code is diverg was always diverged but they're pulled apart so far now they just can't keep up um otherwise um uh if I'm looking to give compliments to Sila um I'm in the very talented Engineers there's no doubt about that um but I think one of the things that um uh has been fantastic is the engagement with the drivers on some of the newer languages so like with the rust and with the go and you know all of the drivers are now coming uh into the Cassandra Community they're being donated um so we're actually kind of on the driver front uh seeing a whole new group of people coming into the community and we started to see some Silla people uh come in there too and they are absolutely and heartfelt warmly welcome into our into the community um so that's quite positive all right moving to the next one now actually the tool caught up as well so um next one is about the switch to tries yeah so when you switch to tries uh yeah you need to rewrite the tables um you can let compaction just do that by itself um uh or you can do a upgrade as his tables which is the same operation that you do after an upgrade um you know that's something you're going to need to monitor that can take many days to to complete um but there's no damn time involved so that was a easy question that's perfect and the next one incremental repairs incremental repairs 256 V nodes and six replicas um okay so whether it's recommended or not um I mean You' you highlighted some pain points here with the V noes and the RF um but I would say more to do with the size of the table because if it's a small table full repairs are going to happen so fast um so you know so that that read application of doing F repairs um it's a very little overhead so so four pairs is is is is the way to go but you know as soon as the tables get bigger you know this this is this uh trade-off between when is the read application of of the full read repairs more costly than uh the anti- compaction that the incremental repairs uh introduce um that that's something that you've got to to figure out yourself um and of course you need to look at what your you need to look at why you're running repairs so there are different reasons to run repair uh if you've got a strong consistency model um then repairs are more about consistency uh at rest and that's more because your under the read path uh consistencies will be reconciled um uh but you know like inconsistencies on the dis can still be a problem because you may uh need to replace a node or you there may be like nodes added or decommissioning and then those inconsistencies can actually um uh spread so to speak um and then break that strong consistency guarantee um right yeah y I'm I'm keep going good yeah so let's I think we have a couple of more like if you're really brief we can do that it seems like we have sticky audience so that that's good news so yeah let's move to the next one so where there's couple of more left so jdk 21 Demitri fantastic question question yes jdk 21 is on the books we're hoping to see it in 5.1 no promises um but we're working pretty actively on it the generational zgc is the thing um so we recommend everyone to use G1 for the moment uh there is nothing really better than G1 uh until uh the garbage collectors become generational and with that it's the zg GC the other big one there is the virtual threads which will be huge for Cassandra small transition to the next one delivery of 5 on1 um okay fingers crossed we see an alpha of 5.1 this year short and sweet um given the testing that's happening uh and given that a cord will all of the features if I want will be marked as uh um as new and not enabled by default they're features that you'll have to go in and say Hey I want to use this um that will actually help us to get 5.1 out the door faster um but I don't see the the US getting through the betas and all so the question here was like end of 2025 so we're saying the alpha is out end of 24 right yeah yeah yeah so I'm I'm being a lot more optimistic than than indeed all right you know it's it's it's it's this is uh Cassandra's livelihood of many companies uh we just can't afford to let bugs out so you know I know it's frustrating that releases can take time um but the reason they take time is because we're treating your production uh with the utmost seriousness and final one training programs um so we're got uh if if you go look at the summit uh videos the Cassandra Summit videos from last December there will be a lot of cont content there that you can pick up um I think data STX has some material doesn't it semi oh have we just yeah so so maybe this is something that we can then follow up and and share with what will be good assets to kind of start learning 5.0 and the new features yeah all right I think we are done with the so thank you for everyone who stick this long so we went Way Beyond but then again hopefully you found found this webinar useful and like I said hoping to continue the discussions with many of you then after this webinar and maybe talk about how we could do those health checks for your Cassandra cluster so make anything you want to add no but you know if if if you've ever seen those health checks before they are uh super in-depth and Rich and there's a lot there so yeah let's let let Sammy look after you all right that's it the show is over everything has been said that we had in mind so hopefully again thanks for joining and hopefully you will be visiting our webinars in the future as well thank you and have a good day saveone bye-bye",
