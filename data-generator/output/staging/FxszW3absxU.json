yep welcome everyone um this is a uh this is kind of a special Workshop that we're doing this is one where um you know we're partnering with um uh that dot uh so we have Michael on as a guest who will will introduce momentarily but you know Michael you can say hello to the folks at home hello how you doing good morning hmm all right um so yeah so for this one we're actually going to talk about um uh that dots uh streaming graph product um known as Quine and uh we're gonna go ahead with a a real-time um exercise on it but first let's go through and um you know again just to remind everyone you know rags and I and Michael today are the are the face of the workshop but real folks who go that that go into uh the complete building and presentation of all of this so um you know again just a shout out to everyone who's behind us on this so um so yay there you all are all right otherwise for those who don't know me uh I'm Aaron fletz uh developer Advocate at data Stacks um I'm also the host of the Apache Cassandra Corner podcast so if you have an interesting Cassandra use case I'd love to talk to you feel free to reach out um otherwise I was a uh you know software engineer engineering lead over at um Granger and Target so I run some large-scale Cassandra clusters um and I've authored a couple of books on a distributed databases mostly focusing on on Cassandra all right Michael sure my name is Mike million um I've been running developer relations programs for the last 15 years um my background is in data driven um analytics as well as Solutions architecture and systems engineering I spent 16 years developing large voice over IP networks and the Telecom industry before I I left and went and focused on building applications using mostly Macs so micro architecture for you know online systems using like laravel or October CMS PHP based applications they're generally focused on helping developers understand how to develop with products that that are are either new or emerging and my role right now at Quine is the developer relations person so I do advocation I do a lot of documentation I do trainings as well as I speak whenever there's opportunities like this so thank you very much seriously I love your uh your South Park Avatar there that's that's pretty seriously cool all right Rags all right that's me um my name is raghavan srinivas uh and and just to confirm uh we have three voices no Echoes everything good uh you know if you want to put a thumbs up in the chat that'll be great uh but my undergrad was in mechanical engineering um I'd like to see things move and that's why I like these uh workshops Anton Labs um where you learn by doing uh and today you're gonna write some Cipher queries uh um and and you'll you'll again learn by doing I I myself learn by doing on most of these workshops uh but this is all not work you know we're gonna have a little bit of play we're gonna do some mentee and stuff like that um so we're gonna get to that in a moment um what I'm focused on the most and this is kind of my mission in life is to make inner loop a lot easier and what I mean by Inner Loop is kind of the lightweight CI CD um where you kind of um you know develop compile profile debug and all that and then finally push you to the outer loop uh if the inner loop is faster it leads to a lot of developer productivity uh and and that's kind of what you know my mission in life is all right so hey um we actually are going to offer a um a workshop badge for this session um so if you you go ahead and and work your way through the session and uh do the homework at the end um you can actually get the Quine and Cassandra badge which is uh you know which would be pretty cool that you can show on LinkedIn I know folks love to do that um so that so that is available for this one um yeah we've done our introduction all right so of course as we uh as we usually do you know we uh live stream over on here on YouTube and uh you know also over on uh on Twitch as a backup we have our Discord server which you can uh jump on if you have any specific questions that uh that we may need to dive down into um and of course we have uh menti that um you know we're probably gonna start here in a in a little bit all right and of course you know as for the uh the workshop itself you know we're uh we're building out on uh Astor DB today um running everything uh you know out in our our virtual development environment out on out on gitpod and of course that'll pull in a GitHub repo and uh and in addition to that we're also going to be using Quine today um to pull in or to use as like a real-time um you know graph that uh that kind of ingests data as it comes in and kind of builds out um you know your graph like like live for you so it's going to be pretty cool to see um so yeah all right so I Rags I don't know if we have a slide that cues uses to go to mentee but I think we should go to menti sounds good all right we are ready to go to mentee just give me a second while I make sure everything is good here um I'm gonna get rid of our heads because you know we want to focus on mentee here right all right thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] I can certainly uh talk us through this um well we got we have 17 people in mentee so I think that's all right we can we can spin ahead for now all right yep so I hear me so uh yeah yeah I think we can go ahead right well that's good all right so um where are you from go ahead and um you know kind of uh tag the the spot where you're you're broadcasting in from on the map and then submit that there we go oh wow is that someone from Quebec that's pretty cool if my uh if that that map is shown up correctly there some from Europe some from India [Music] oh hey oh Adriano outstanding outstanding all right so which of these closely Match Your Role just kind of pick that out there there we go all right oh we have a couple data Engineers uh good share of uh developers engineers dbas and devops Specialists that's a plus two Tech Executives hey all right oh and a data scientist there we go security specialist well we've got a uh and a student we've got a nice a nice range of folks in this one for sure for sure all right outstanding Rags why don't you jump to the next one yeah there we go so is this your first data Stacks devs Workshop well I'm seeing a bunch of no's so that's good and you know what I'm also gonna say no [Laughter] oh hey we've got a couple of new people all right that's good oh several excellent it's good to see some new folks out here all right I think that's everyone okay so the big question for today how familiar are you with these Cipher query language um so is this your first time with it done some tutorials you know have you you've done a prop project with it um do you feel confident or be used in other graph query language like uh Gremlin for instance hey several first timers on site all right all right yeah some people have used other uh you know uh like graph query languages um I'd be curious to know what those are if you could put those in the chat that would be good to hear or good good to read I guess lots of first folks with uh all right all right okay what are you most excited about changing in your data pipeline and of course you know there's a lot of these things I'm not going to read through them but the last one if you're new to data pipelines here to learn feel free to uh to tick that one [Music] all right lots of people looking for unique patterns um going after further insights yup and some new folks this is a yeah this is a good um a good range of um of attendees in terms of uh yeah both both like you know roll and you know kind of what they're looking for and what their experience is so we have their easy [Music] all right well I think this means that we can flip back to the workshop oh there we go that looks good that looks good all right back to uh Quine and Cassandra um so of course you know the uh you know one of the main points of our of our agenda for today is to kind of talk about what coin is and uh and even what a streaming graph is for those of you who have not uh not used one before um so Michael I'll turn it over to you sure thank you so Quine is designed from the ground up to be a real-time streaming graph so what that means is that it will listen for events in event stream um it'll shape those events into a graph shape using Cipher and then it'll create relationships that can then be queried or gain insights from um in real time and we're tuned to do that in a way that allows for really quick ingestion as well as the detection of and Reporting on events as they occur so we eliminate the need for batch processing we bring together multiple streams into one single graph and then we are able to move on categorical data rather than having to do you know the traditional data Transformations that you have to do to categorical data to be able to run insights on them as well as we really deal well with really high cardinality data sets so of things that have a lot of different variants inside the same inside of the same cell say inside of a spreadsheet so that we do and we've tuned everything to be done at real time and then on top of the graph or inside of the graph we also have a query engine called standing queries that allow us to contest constantly match patterns in graph style so relationship based matches that will report as soon as a match happens so the order of data isn't as important any the data can come in in any order because we're looking for a pattern we're not looking for a temporal stream of events even though they may come in in a specific sequence where we may need them in a specific sequence we wait until all of the components of an event occurs and then we match on that and we'll talk about how fast we pull apart the um the recipe that we're going to go through to look for password spraying so pass spring we're going to talk about today as well as we're going to talk about streams and how graphs shape streams into a into knowledge graphs right so architecturally if you're thinking about where to put Quine Quine fits into your data pipeline in between a source and async so what we do is we will connect to say like a Kafka topic and we will read that topic and we'll take all of the information inside of that topic and we can take multiple topics and that's a really high volume of typically you know low value or interesting data but not really insightful data so we'll we'll bring all of that information together in a graph shape and then we will run insights that take that high volume of of data and turn it into a high value stream of insights and those can be alerts those can be interesting or novel activities that we see inside of the data or they could just be a specific stream of data that's coming from them from the main the main trunk of the data so we can carve out say I want to watch you know Sally's activities for one day and we can put a filter in it says anything that's done by Sally across our entire you know data surface we want to tap out and move to its own stream or something like that and that's really where the value of having graph in a in a data pipeline really comes to fruition because looking for something called Sally especially if you have a specific name like their first last you know first and last name rather than a specific ID which may be different in different parts of your of your your systems makes it difficult for non-graph shaped caps to be able to pull out an aggregate of information I think this slide is a is a really good um visual of you know like kind of what goes on and kind of what needs to happen because so many places out there have just all kinds of disparate data and they're not quite sure how to like match up relationships between them or or really how to like mine in or or use it um and I I think this is cool in that it just you know it kind of shows how Quine like streamlines that and is able to make that that data worthwhile you know help it help it drive value um so so yeah for sure all right so let's talk a little bit about use cases um you know so you let let's say you pull down coin well what would you use it for and here we go right so like I said Quine is really good whenever you're looking for categorical types of data um it's also really good whenever your insights or the data that produces an insight has a very small shelf life say within the span of a transaction so seconds to minutes um the information that is going to be streaming in if you're going to take an action on it that's where quine's going to be able to very expediently give you an Insight on a bunch of data and we've seen several use cases where this is really important log analysis where we're doing aggregate Aggregates of logs when we're looking for a specific event or if we're looking for a specific failure event that means a very rapid response um streaming ETL where you're taking and reshaping a pipeline into a different form or you're building new new insights or you're making judgments on different events that are coming in and those judgments have a framework or a time frame that they're valid for and it's not something that you can do say in batch overnight or something like that or even bat micro batching like once every 15 minutes or an hour that that information that information may be too old at that point in time um real time uh very distributed applications like video distribution or you know whenever you're having a streaming event and you're streaming something across the world to a bunch of a bunch of viewers being able to observe how those streams are are behaving being able to Route around being able to fix or understand why some streams may be caching in some streams may not be caching while you're trying to put out a terms of service based experience to your customers is something that has a very very short shelf life for those those observations and not something that can be done say overnight or even even after an event has completed and you know anything that is dealing with fraud is is always interesting to have very rapid insights many fraud analysis take a very very long time like the span of you know months to sometimes even years where if you have the right pattern matching at the right point in time you can cut an event that maybe was detected and then resolved six months later you can cut back to where you detect an event and act on it in this in the span of the transaction so while that event is occurring or very shortly after that event is occurring you know before more damage or more risk to whatever the Enterprise or the or the customer is is lost all right well let's uh move on here so hey let's talk about password spraying because that's kind of the focus for today sure so password spraying is a really unique um type of fraud um it's becoming more and more prevalent where we're seeing you know large um lists of usernames being spread around inside of the internet and whenever a group that is interested in a specific Target could say list of usernames they basically try almost like a dictionary or a well-known passwords attempt um there's a list of the top 10 000 passwords that are freely available on the internet they will take that list of known usernames usually they'll they'll Farm them out of emails or they'll Farm them out of you know different marketing types of campaigns they'll then just basically try walking at a very low persistent rate so nothing that would cause you know the traditional oh you you haven't signed in or you've you've forgotten your password type of lockdowns where you know a human you know trying to gain access to and event might try their password two or three times in the span of five minutes and the system will say oh obviously you've forgotten your password so I'm going to lock this I'm going to make it you know I'm going to send you a new password update you know those types of things um password spraying is is more of a low a low occurrence persistent type of effect where they may try walking a the list and send a password to everybody in the list you know once a week you know once a day but never never where it would be you know compromising or tripping the traditional types of password problems and their goal is to gain access and then once they've gained access to the network and they can get three or four different accounts they can start to triangulate and go after very high value assets inside of the network and what our goal is today is to be able to detect that low kind of Persistence of attempts where there's a series of failures and then a series of um and we'll we'll show you how that's done inside of inside of Quine using graph and Cipher to check these products I just got to know whose password is Cubs win 2016. I mean come on [Laughter] it has a dollar signs at the end so they must have won a bet there too no I'm sorry lifelong the Milwaukee Brewers fan here so I had I had to chime in on that one so all right so hey we've uh We've introduced uh Quine and talked about our use cases and and a little more detail and password spring Let's uh let's talk about some of the architecture that that goes into Quine and some of the components are going to be using today right so like I said Quine is designed to be in a pipeline so what we're going to use is we're going to use a file of Json objects and we're going to stream that file into Quine and there's a component inside of Quine called an ingest stream which is going to connect that file stream and build a graph out of it so the graph is our primary structure inside of our architecture that graph is going to be backed with a persistence layer because not everything can fit into memory all the time we'd love for it to but not everything fits into memory all the time so the graph is going to have a persistence layer that is calling out via the API to Cassandra which in this case is going to be astrodb so that is where all of the nodes and we have we have several States for nodes so nodes can be awake and active all of the nodes that are interesting or that that have patterns associated with them are going to have an actor based model behind them so their their state aware they understand what's going on and they understand the question that we've asked them to look for so any any nodes that are not part of answering an active question are free to move to what we call a sleeping state or a persisted State and they're going to live still indexed into the graph but they're going to be outside of the memory Shard they're going to be inside of a persistence layer and then we have two special structures where we have a special structure called a standing query which does two major things it can reshape or take actions on top of the graph and we're going to show you how a standing query can change or make relationships inside of the graph or they can look for patterns and they can emit new events out of the graph and what we're going to do is search for in our case the pattern of the password spraying intact and we're going to emit an alert that says we found a a password spraying attack and that alert can go Downstream to another sync and we can become a source inside of the data pipeline it can go out as a web hook and show up on somebody's operational dashboard or it it in our case is going to show up in on time in the console and you know in real time we're going to act on that event and we're going to go into the graph and see what's going on so that in the in the highest level is the functional architecture of how Quine works and what we're going to do inside of the workshop today um so of course you know Quine has some different persistence options available right yes so we have two local um persistence operations which is either roxdb or Maps DB mapdb um rocksdb doesn't always you know play well with all systems uh there was a little bit of period of time where there they were lagging behind the new M1 architectures for the Apple um architectures so we also support mapdb both of those are really great for prototyping or doing very small data sets something that you're not going to be looking for an event that happens over the span of a week or two weeks or something like that um our production data sets um our persistence layer is is predominantly Astra um we have some people that have tried to do it with roxdb but they rapidly grow out of rocks to be and end up using um Apache Cassandra and in some cases excellent excellent so of course you know a little bit about uh Apache Cassandra um most folks on here you know probably know at least a little bit about it but um you know essentially with with Cassandra what you're getting is that distributed um data architecture spread out over over many different um compute instances you know um Cassandra works with um you know like like a gossip protocol because um you know all of the nodes are um uh they're all peers you know so there's no like primary note or secondary node um so they don't have like individual rules or anything um but they all kind of work together in sort of like a like a token ring architecture um at least for now until we get to Cassandra five we'll talk about that some other day though but um you know so so typically you know with with Cassandra you know you have a um you know a database architecture that can scale in nearly you know so once you figure out what your what Your throughput is and then maybe what your desired throughput is it really gives you insights and not just how big you need to uh you need to build that cluster and um you know just how much you can you can get from it now Astra of course is Cassandra as a service essentially run by data Stacks um the great thing about it is that there's no operational overhead um so you get that that no touch scalability um and it's it's not bound to a single Cloud vendor either you know you can run it on AWS or gcp or Azure um and of course you get that Cassandra like Best in Class um Geographic awareness that it comes with as well you know so if you have um applications or other systems that are running um like on the west coast and you know maybe you have that that same data set needs to also be on the East Coast but you want those data sets to be the same you want them to be in sync um again that's something that Cassandra and Astor do very very well do you see that one Michael I don't um unfortunately I only have one one window um today can we execute multiple graphs at the same time in Quine um Quine is gonna have one graph structure inside of it at any point in time it's it it you can have sub graphs inside of that structure um but it is always going to have one one graph inside of this inside of an instance of crime right that's a good question okay so one of the important things of inside of the point and this is this actually kind of goes to the the ability to have subgraphs or disconnected graphs inside of one is the the concept of indexing and like I said Quine is designed for streaming data it's it wants to act on data while it's still in motion uh before it becomes restful and to be able to do that we have to we had to rethink the way that we approach indexing inside of the graph itself and traditional indexing where you will have like a continuous index or you know basically every node gets like a sequential next or something like that means you have to kind of go look for the node and then get the index for the node you can't just know where the where the node is going to go to be indexed inside of a graph um with Quine we introduced a function called ID from which basically takes any number of of inputs and generally it's going to be something that that is a namespace type of value and then something unique from the from the the data to deterministically calculate what the node ID is going to be and what that allows us to do is to as we ingest data in that ingest stream we can place it into the graph indexed in the way that the rest of the graph is going to be so we never have to know where the sequence counter is we never have to look up where the relationships are we can basically point a node into the graph by calculating what its index is going to be and that becomes really powerful for whenever we're also creating relationships between nodes that may or may not exist at the point in time where we need to create the relationship we can create we can calculate what a node ID is going to be place it inside of the graph and then put it into the structure of the graph at the same time and that is truly the what allows Quine to run at a million events per second which is what we just accomplished um as well as keep up with event streams that are coming from any number of data sources multiple Kafka topics it can be coming from files mixing all of that information together and taking insights all at the same time and everything's indexed very deterministically we can take the information from any event and tell you what the node identity from them all right so for us in this workshop and we're going to pull this apart a little bit more whenever we go into the interactive component we're going to take an event and we have a strip of events and those events are Json objects and out of that event we're going to create several nodes and we're going to use that ID from concept to separate this event into all of its component parts so we're going to have an ASN we're going to have an asset a user a client and we're going to have an attempt a login attempt and all of that is going to be built that that graph structure is going to be built in real time as the events are streaming in from the event data or the the components inside of the Json object that is the event and we'll materialize all of these nodes inside of the graph and create the relationships in them so that we can basically create an event an event graph that we can watch or a specific type of events and if you go forward yep so it said we're we're looking for kind of like an advanced persistent like slow type of an attack so what we're looking for is a single a single um user in this case you know a contractor that has made a series of failed attempts to log in and we chose four um five typically will lock in accounts but four won't lock an account and three if you do them quickly will trigger typically the oh you've forgotten your password type of activity so we're going to look for four failed attempts in a row without a without a successful attempt in between them and then we're inside of Cypher so four failures and one or more we'll show you that there's more after this one successful attempt we're gonna trigger that for analysis so basically we're going to raise that to an alert dashboard or we're going to send it to the security security Ops Team and say we believe there's something suspicious going on with this count and we're going to play the role of the analysts today we're going to get that and we're gonna go take a look at what's going on when they count I think the cool thing too is is that when you when you look at this slide you can see that those attempts um are a couple of days apart and in some cases several days apart um but still it's it's it's those attempts that kind of generate that pattern that um that that we can look for so so yeah I just I want to point that out because I think that's pretty cool that it that it finds it slowly over time foreign so just kind of get foreshadowing what we're going to take a look at inside of our inside of our recipe the um middle of the screen there where it says query and starts with the word match that is what the cipher looks like for matching the event that we just had up and that we had modeled on our screen so we're gonna match it and then we're going to take action on it so the first match that's under the sub query for for four consecutive fills is gonna be what is running inside of the notes the actor component of the notes they're going to be looking for matching that complete that complete set of events that complete pattern and once it does the node that matches is going to trigger this alert that is going to create an output that'll show basically a URL on our console will command click on that URL and we will go into the graph and we will take a look at what's going on side of that event all right Michael we have a question inside the chat um is pattern matching done over the graph in memory and then a two-parter can it also be done over persistive data in Cassandra or astridi so any any node that is associated with a pattern match is going to have an actor behind it and one or more actor models behind it and depending on how old the the node becomes and basically the tuning of how might how many nodes will allow to stay in memory that node may be persisted and maybe out of memory or maybe in memory but the node that is paying attention to the last piece of the of the match so we we deal with these things called half edges so the node that is keeping track of the overall pattern match will always be in memory but the nodes that are part of the match May either be in memory or they may uh actually be living inside of the persistent age store at that point in time okay okay well thank you you know I I suppose we should point out too that you know that a lot of times with Cassandra you know we'll talk about nodes and we'll be referring to like a physical or logical like compute instance but in graph that means something different right in graph you can think of a node almost like a row in a tabular data in a tabulator form um so the node is going to have properties which is usually what are the fields inside of a a tabular type of a data or you can think of a node as a an object in like a document store or something like that either one of those you know mental models works for what a node is inside of our graph gotcha gotcha all right well um I guess we can we can move along to the the Hands-On portion here um so for those of you following along at home you could jump to the readme uh we're gonna go through steps four and five uh for this one particularly so let me escape out of here and all right so can you maximize [Music] browser please yeah I I will I I will let me and today it might be one of those rare days where we may get done uh earlier right yeah so far so good right I I know we're Rags we're so used to running over all right so um for those of you who haven't done it uh you can go ahead and um click this button here of create Astor DB and I'll go ahead and open this up in in another tab um so essentially we want to create a new database called workshops and we want it to have a key space named Quine and just you know for reference the the ones that come up that um you don't need to put payment info up for are in gcp and specifically it's the US East One In A Monks Corner and I think that's South Carolina if I'm if I'm not mistaken all right so I get to hear and I say create actually I'll I can zoom in on this a little bit to make it easier for those of you um watching at home and click into create database so I'll call this workshops plural that's important and for my key space name oh I will spell Quine correctly then I can scroll down a little bit here um make sure we're on Google Cloud I am in North America and Mark's Corner South Carolina there we are and I can say create database all right so this will spin for a little bit and then it should drop me back to the dashboard oh right um I get my token details um so important you can either download or you can actually hit the uh the copy button here I'm going to do that just make sure that all gets pasted somewhere off screen all right so let's uh let's go to database here now for those of you who have been through a workshop or two with us before and maybe you already have workshops database you can go ahead and click on that database and if you haven't had it in a while it might have been I haven't used it in a while it might have been hibernated you have this there's this resume database button you can go ahead and click and again give or take you know two or three minutes It'll uh it'll work its way back all right so we've done that um yep and we we've shown how to get the token um okay so the next part is really about setting up Quine and uh of course for those of you who have uh been with us on some of these before we're going to open this up in gitpod so I'm going to right click here and open that in a new tab and gitpod is going to start spinning its way up yeah and one thing I'm noticing is um you know maybe I'm noticing it late is you're a little bit dark there any chance uh you can add a light or something oh yeah well here get pods up now and I I use non-dark mode for a forget pod um that's like the only thing that I don't use in dark mode to be honest but uh yep no that's a good point rags all right so good pod should come up it's like this you don't need a whole lot of the um you know the extra windows open up top um sometimes it's helpful to keep the readme up there just to be able to get a quick reference to the instructions um one thing we're going to have you do today that's a little bit different um is all of you at home can help us help us try out a new tool that um you know our our own uh Cedric London has uh has kind of driven a lot is this asterisk shell um so this is a cool way that we can interact with our Astra instance um without having to leave gitpod so I I did some you know automation Foo behind the scenes to uh to try and make this as seamless as possible but um if you if you can make sure you have your uh your token ready that you just uh just copied um I'll zoom in just a little bit here but um you'll notice this last message you get here is open a new terminal and run Aster setup oh and you can close this terminal window so let's let's let's go ahead and hit the plus here and that'll open up a new bash terminal window and I'm just going to say Astra setup all right so you'll notice what it asks down here is to enter your token and as strange as it may seem it's copying the zip file was such a pain all right so I'm gonna go grab my token I'm going to paste it in now you notice that um you know it's asking me if I want to allow pasting into this uh this this window and I'll say yes I do all right okay so now it's saved the configuration um the the cool thing is that um you can actually interact with Astra via the Astro shell um so I'll do an Astra DB list all right and you'll notice that I have uh have a few databases back here I have one hibernated one active um and one's one's initializing um so let's have a look back at um oh sorry I'm going dark again sorry back at our um get repo and we'll take a look through okay so if we've done everything right so far um this start.shell will actually bring up Quine and connect it to astrodb now I'm going to run this and it's all and I know it I know it's going to fail and that's going to be on purpose so let me go ahead and just start that so this will start to come up here oh and it didn't like ah okay so what happened here is that um the download of the secure bundle failed and that's going to be taken care of automatically assuming it can find your database now my token however does not point to my workshop's database so if you are using a database in Astra that is not named workshops you want to go and modify it inside of this dot EnV file here that is where you can go ahead and um and make that change so again if you you need the name of your database you can do a quick Astra DB list and I'm going to connect to my stacko gcp one there we go okay and as long as I'm here I'm also going to um because I know that I've run Quine before and there are some some nuances that happen if you if you've already run it as far as getting it to pick up the the ingest appropriately I'm going to run this truncate table shell just to kind of clear out oh it didn't like that at all well folks remember from last week this is you know and we do this live let me have a look at this quick oh and yeah yeah yeah don't save it might you might again be related to workshops you know maybe you need to like there we go let me just force that in there for now and then we'll say truncate there we go now it should connect okay there we go so that shell completes now let's go ahead and re-run our start.shell okay so now that we have the Astro secure bundle and everything we have our our tables cleared out we should have a brand new um Quine table structure underneath okay and okay if you get to this point where it says the Quine web servers available and you notice you're standing one count starting to tick up uh you're in good shape should we should we wait for some couple of thumbs up that's a that's a great idea yeah yeah you know I I will mention that while this is running one thing that um that Michael Riggs and I have run into a little bit um there's this section I have in here on troubleshooting all right it's this section right here it'll describe a lot of the common errors that that we've seen during this process um one in particular relates to this snapshots table so if you see this error around you know like clustering key columns not matching exactly there there might be a um a table you'll need to uh to add back in with it's with its cql um so we'll let this go for a little bit okay I see one setting up still yep oh somebody somebody's really excited in the in the chat about the the Astra shell Astra CLI um Cedric I'm sure he'll be happy he was really stoked um you know to uh to get this project out the door um if anyone has any questions or has any issues you know again feel free um put them in the chat here or um actually you know I should really have Discord running um although I'm sure like our team and uh some of the other folks are keeping an eye on it for us so now um Michael if I remember right this standing one count is going to increase kind of simulating those those uh password or authentication attempts coming in um and then sometime around like the 20 000 Mark that's when it's going to find the anomaly right oh Michael you're muted yep yes sorry I was typing I have a loud keyboard so um so we're using a set of data that that the event happens completes in around twenty four thousand type of of um events and then what we'll see is that standing query uh create uh the emission of the event if you will um so what we can do while we're waiting for that uh um I can walk through kind of what the recipe is share your screen yeah it would probably be best to share my screen no problem so a recipe in Quine is everything that's needed to basically do a particular set of analysis so we have all of the configuration for this event set up in something called a recipe and basically a recipe contains all of the API calls if you will to be able to configure Quine as well as it also has API calls that allow us to change the way information is displayed inside of the exploration UI so that's that's really what is inside of a recipe and it's just a flat yaml file we can we can walk through that so Rags whenever you're ready for me I I can share my screen okay is that the one that you have oh there we go okay so I did run into that issue um so I ended up having to go inside of my inside so anybody that I could do that so anybody that has structures and basically so what you can see is so what you can see is I started coins running um this other thing called a standing so inside and I also wanted to point out in the dashboard for dashboard for my workshops this has been running for a little while you've been running for a little while [Music] the loads right now all of them were persistent that's what folks are saying in the chat regs can you confirm that Rags are you hearing it next are you hearing at Naco foreign [Music] foreign sure so what I did was I opened up the password spraying yaml file which is our resi um hopefully there's no Echo now so the recipe has a description in it and you can go and pull down a version of this recipe from the quan.e website in our recipe section um so here's this ingest stream which I talked about you know in the architecture we're ingesting a file um and we're matching a bunch of nodes off of the file so this is where we're building that structure that we talked about um inside of the inside of the the graph and actually right here just to point it out um I've run through my 24 000 and there's actually 75 000 events inside of this inside of this data set and here's the here's the output of what I'm going to get to which is standing two and this is the actual detection of a password spring attack and we'll talk about how to deal with that in a second so the cipher query that is the ingest query is doing several things for us it's reading from the Json file so Cipher and then processing that file with Cipher and it's creating the graph structure with all of these basically new nodes and parameters that we're taking from the original event and populating into the nodes so it creates a client node a user node an attempt node and then an ASN and an asset node and it populates all of those with the pertinent information from the original event and then it creates the relationships if you will between all of those nodes so basically one event ends up like a little sub graph inside of inside of the graph um and that is that is kind of like our extract translate and load components so we've translated that or transformed that data and we've loaded it into a graph now inside of the graph we have these two actor-based standing queries the first one is going to look for a specific pattern that is an attempt originated by a user originative with another attempt and basically what it's going to do is it's going to find and connect all of the attempted logins inside of the graph you're using a couple pieces of Cipher and then have a sequence number that's put inside of there so that is what this standing one count is so every single time a sub graph is creating with created with our our ingest standing one connects that to the rest of the graph so we have a continuous or contiguously connected set of graph data and then our second pattern is going to look for what I showed on the screen earlier it's going to match those four consecutive failed attempts and then it's gonna base it's gonna write to standard output all of the information associated with that event and that of that looks like this whenever it occurs inside of your console so what's nice about this is because we've built a a fully connected graph this has all of the information for me to hold down I'm on a Mac I can hold down my command key and I can click on this um one interesting behavior that I'm getting inside of the terminal for vs code I'm using vs code on a Mac as you see how this is pulling the last double quotes we don't need that last double quotes so you can command and click on this it'll open up but it's going to get mad it's going to tell you it's not not a well a well-formed cipher query so if we go to the end of it we take off the double quote and we hit enter it's going to go and it's going to query the graph and it's a little slow there we go it's going to query the graph and this is our event right here so here's our successful event here's the previous event I'm just it's easier for me to form it going backwards here's the event before that here's the event before that and here's the event before that so this we can take and we can right click on this name this node and we can get all the local properties and we can see all of the information that was populated into this user node and we can see that that Tanya shoffel who was a contractor we also kind of know that the last time that we actually saw her successfully log in was on 5 11 22 which is you know kind of before uh months before these oh actually that's that's because that those those credentials were used so we can see everything about who this is we may know that Tanya was you know her contract ended maybe before some of these events and she shouldn't be logging in at all so this could be an interesting analysis to go and say why is this account even still being used did we forget to deactivate it or something like that um another interesting thing that we can continue doing is we can follow more of this structure we can right click on a note and these are all queries that we've written inside of that recipe so that we can explore and we can analyze what's going on inside of the graph you know using the information using the data that's here we can look at the next attempt and one great thing about graphs is they like to reformat themselves every time and we can follow this and you can see there's a bunch of attempts that are going to happen in here but we also have a query since this is curated data we can come up with the entire stream of events that have happened for this user and this little swirly thing says that the graph is still querying and I can show you that you know we're still ingesting inside of inside of here so we still haven't hit the end of the data stream but I can do basically a full audit on any user and we can see that Tanya was logging in primarily and every now and then she you know missed hyper her password or something like that but she was primarily coming in through a VPN right and we all of a sudden start seeing here's our pattern you know failure failure failure failure success and then a stream of successes so this account's been being used quite a bit after it's been compromised and these are all coming from off net so this is definitely something that the security team would want to take a look at inside of inside of a threat analysis or a threat Behavior type of thing and this alert happened as soon as we saw all this event right here and you can see like Aaron pointed out these were weeks sometimes even multiple weeks apart inside of our logs but as soon as that event happened the success the security analyst gets an alert on their console and they can go taking a look at it this didn't have to wait for a batch run that may only happen once a week it didn't have to wait for a bunch of events that you know there might be some false positives in there but this is a real live password spraying attack that can be dealt with immediately and this could you know could have gone on and we can already see that this has gone on out and multiply after the original effect Michael we have a question actually from um from the chat on how do we get the link again do you think you could just kind of show where you found that so the link so this is the terminal that I started running quiet so here's why I launched the start script so wherever you launch the start script for Quine and when you see Quine running once you get to about 24 almost 25 000 events that have been ingested you will get this link that shows up basically right above the the counters for the standing queries and it's an event that is alert in a match event and if you hover your your cursor over the URL component of that it'll highlight and you can hold the command key which you know turns my my cursor into a pointer and you can click on that and again it's pulling inside of vs code for some reason for me it's pulling this extra double quote I did that for me too yep yep so I have to pull that off so that's the that's the exploration and again we can take a look at you know the the database and here's the you know here's the activity that this this recipe ingesting all of this files is putting work onto astrodb and you can see you know basically I'm I'm done pretty much ingesting it looks like or pretty close to being done ingesting um most of the nodes once the event is found most of the nodes because we're looking for a pattern um are no longer part of that pattern so the actors have had put a lot of the nodes to sleep and push them off into the database and there's not as much recalling and looking for different parts of a pattern match if you will you should see something similar and this is in my workshops database in the health tab for the console so if you go from a review to help foreign I can pass it back to you that's great I suppose that and maybe we can also get some indication of you know are people seeing the event the event um have people um completed ingesting all of the all of the the events yet um unfortunately because I'm using one one screen I can't I don't have I don't have the um the YouTube up at the same time okay okay yeah um you know just getting some questions around um you know like an exception that someone ran across or we're trying to see if you know maybe they they have the um you know the the extra double quote on there if there's something else that uh you know that that could be going on um as you can see mine is still uh ticking along here I think but um yeah I I actually um here I can demo that that part too where if if I hover over here um and hold down command and I hit that it'll open up a new tab and of course it'll it'll totally blow up but um up here in the uh query window kind of like Michael was was demonstrating I can get rid of that tailing quote and then if I hit query this should all fall right into place and it's spinning there we go all right all right so we have that user and then kind of like you were doing I can arrange that um you know with um with events in order as to how it makes the most sense here um but yeah again you see those those different attempts that have uh um resulted in um you know that that actual good attempt and what is that is that April 14th it looks like yeah yeah all right and Aaron I I forgot to to show but if you can click on the thing that looks like a speedometer on the left now oh left nav right no yeah on the left that does look like a speedometer I got you yeah so if you click on so this is what the equine system dashboard looks like so this is where you can see the amount of work that's being done um from the Quine dashboard point of view um and you can see how many nodes there are how many of them are awake in memory um how many shards the the system's running um some information about the you know some meta information about the types of nodes that are inside of the graph how many properties they have how many edges you know distributed across the graph there are as well as you can see some of the persistent the persistor stats you know for for basically the performance stats you know latency as well as calls and stuff like that so we have instrumentation instrumentation so now the um the node Edge counts over here are are separated into two different um like bar graphs so is the is the smaller one more related to like the the match that that we noticed the anomaly so if you if you look the way that we we do the node Edge counts is we basically are looking for something called super nodes generally inside of there so any bars that farther to the right they have more edges than to the left and an edge is a relationship between two nodes so it's it's that relationship so what we're looking for is a good distribution of notes with with edges and where we get concerned like that bar to the right there's you know somewhere between 128 and 20 and 2000 edges right where we get up to say 100 000 edges then there might be something we want to look at optimizing inside of our query um we would call those types of nodes that are related to a very large amount of other nodes in a graph a super node and that can cause you know performance problems when we're including that node in say you know some type of a edge watch or a short path type of object so we have we have a question from the chat um also in the chat um artem from our team said a great demo so he thinks this is a this is this is pretty good you know so um and coming from artem you know he he is a you know his PhD in computer science so he's a pretty bright guy so if you've impressed him I think that's uh you can count that as a win that's awesome but um also you know somebody said um you know that they're running into that clustering key exactly match columns error now that's the one that you can fix by recreating or by rerunning the create of that snapshots table is that right yes rerunning the created that snapshots table yep and that is in the so if you go back to your window your um and it's it's under this so it's right I have linked called uh troubleshooting right here you'll uh you'll notice that if you scroll down you'll find that clustering key columns match exactly error and then um using uh asterisk shell um you can just use that to connect and you can rerun that um that table ddl which should um which should fix that yep all right well I suppose we can uh we can pop back over to our slides oh sure we could do that so another thing that if you go back to the Fine dashboard I just killed it so did you close the window I can um oh come on come back I wonder if I have to do a stop to to make sure it stops clean I killed it killed yeah oh you killed it killed it it should well now that you stopped it it's gonna okay I'm done I can share real quick let me just share so kind of wine this left nav so not only do we have the system dashboard which is going to show you what's going on we have the data exploration window which right now has a query running in it so you can do different types of queries like get different notes and stuff like that but this one that looks like documentation we have live API documentation inside of here so you can go and take a look at the ingest streams so you want to look at list all the the running ingest streams you can actually we make my window a little bit bigger you can launch these API calls directly from the documentation so here's our ingest stream it's running here's the query it's all it's all been serialized into one line but it can show you you know basically throughputs and stuff like that and this can get really powerful if you want to say in new Cipher queries and you can at any point in time craft a cipher query inside of the documentation basically send it in and get all the information back out and that's a really powerful piece this is also where if you're creating a recipe and you want to create like say a new ingest stream you can look at the documentation on quine.io box.coin.io and inside of here there's a rest API reference which is the exact same representation as the live documentation inside of inside of Quine but if you want to create your own recipe and you're going to to do that you can start and all of the recipe components we go through and we just describe what the the API version of this of it is inside and the API version comes directly from our API documentation and then the yaml version or the converted yaml version and use yaml inside of your recipes and that's kind of a foreshadowing of how you're gonna gonna do some of the homework components this is where you're going to find me the format for if you want to create your own recipe if you want to modify recipes and you want to understand all the parameters that you have available to you oh excellent security so I can pass that back to you Aaron like me oh not that one there we go okay so um we've gotten through the Hands-On let's take a look at what's next well oh look at that mentee is next I I was thinking that that maybe we had uh we had a touch in there touch point in there about the homework but I I guess we can get to that once we uh once we get through menti how's that sound or eggs all right Greg do you want to share and uh fire up menti hey I hear you let me ask in a check and for those of you who still have that um on your phone or in another tab you should just be able to pop right back over there and uh and be able to join oh Allen says that we can't hear rags yeah okay can you can you guys hear me now that's all right I can talk yep speak up if you can hear rags oh artem says yes I think we're good good all right let me start the music let's get some music going and we should be ready uh three one six one three what's the code again for those of you if the music is too loud let me know please yep so far so good foreign [Music] so going right to the first question and some fast but most importantly answer correctly what is a benefit of using Cassandra with Quine see how uh how everyone comes through on this one there's also a test for the speakers Did we set up the questions properly oh hey well we got we had nine people get it right that's good yeah yeah better performance and scalability um you know unfortunately it's not easier indexing and it's definitely not faster joins so how did everyone fare on that one slash Fosters [Music] sash in the lead all right next question what is astridy being you mean I always love the answer it's an album by Radiohead laughs all right because Sandra has a service in the cloud all right everybody got that one excellent that's good to see that was an easy one yeah that that's a softball that we threw everyone [Music] sash still the fastest sash coming up but it's still early it's still anyone's game all right next what does an India stream do in all right let's see how this one came out oh hey everyone got that one too all right connectsa connects a data source decline outstanding the good good right see how our leaderboard looks looks like somebody else's Festus DS the top three does not change all right question four which is a valid ingest stream Source required oh this is the good one can we talk about this we covered some of it yeah all are valid you know I I suppose we could have covered that one a little bit better you know because we really were using the CSV file for the for the exercise um we we did specifically mention Kafka but it does also work with Pulsar or even a websocket connection so I think sash is now going to be happy all right oh we had some shake up on that one [Music] foreign number five how is data indexed incline and this I know we covered [Music] all right let's see how we did into across the board most people got it that's good that's good yep deterministically calculated node ID using that ID from method [Music] all right let's see how the leaderboard shapes up [Music] lots of changes oh yeah looks like DS is still going strong yeah but a definite shake-up that's for sure going into the last one all right what is the standing query is that a sitting buddy laughs yeah this is a this is a tough one curious to see how this one pans out yeah yeah this was the this was this this was the deal breaker queer that matches a graph structure incrementally so congratulations Mars um for those of you who are in the top three years that's Mars yes and Homer um do not take a screenshot of um what you see on YouTube but take a screenshot from your phone and yeah we'll tell you momentarily how to send it yep actually uh regs I have that I have that slide up if you wanna oh I suppose I can yeah oh I'm sharing yeah you can flip back to me and uh and they should see that oh and then a follow-up to the quiz you should be at just though not just heat but that was my typo [Music] oh yeah that's great everybody thinks this is the right level so it wasn't very too easy it wasn't very too difficult perfect that's kind of how we like to see and yeah quick survey to help us um what do you like most what what do you think we should improve or leave it there for a few minutes just a little bit [Music] and if you like it just put it in oh and Alan really wants to know what the soundtrack is for the quiz all right I would like to see something more than the music I think hey someone said them music is good all right I think Michael is great right and Zone was great yep yep thank you more streaming examples more streaming examples yeah I know I've been thinking that for a while too I'm gonna do it for your time trying to think right yeah all right [Music] let's try to wrap this up give me a second before all right I think you are on Aaron uh let's take us home excellent what what I don't understand what or something or okay okay um anyway uh just a reg's point from before um make sure you're taking the uh you know for those of you who won in um in the quiz make sure you take that picture from your phone um or in your browser so it says like you finished third or you're the winner um yeah that'll be that'll be good and you can fill it out at uh DS dtsx.io Workshop Dash swag um and you can submit that so easy easy all right so hey homework for those of you who are so inclined um and you really want to get that badge you can go ahead um you know and Michael and I went back and forth on this a little bit you know we kind of thought oh hey you know be great to have a new recipe but we don't want you to spend like because you can spend like a good week or two building up a new recipe and getting it right so take an existing recipe and modify it to do something new um in terms of like finding those um and and Mike I'm going to need some of your guidance here a little bit but I'm on quine's website they have a so that yeah you go to Quine website that's the dot website right right right so yeah all right yeah so Quine is an open source um project that is you know maintained and and curated by the company that dot which is where we where I work um there is an Enterprise version of Quine um Quine is the product and the open source core runs as a Singleton and if you want to go and learn more about how to run clustering or how to do some of the the more advanced things um we have a shallow learning AI called novelty detector um you can go to the that dot website and learn about those there but for everything that we've done this time this time it's incline um so if you go to the recipes page there absolutely that's what I was looking for yep and there's the password spring one that we just did yep exactly the Apache log analysis one is is very interesting the ethereum tag propagation one is is an interesting one there's a um Wikipedia recipe that I'm not seeing right now on that list but there is it yeah there it is the Wikipedia um recipe which takes from the Wikipedia stream um that that is only taking page UPS right now there's multiple um streams that are in the Wikipedia servers that you could join information together and and get interesting insights um the Wikipedia recipe is also what we use as part of our getting started guys I love this pie recipe that one sounds awesome you know just for me yep so for Pi Day this year um when senior developers put together a recipe to calculate um pi and it streams Pi's values for quite a while actually that that's awesome all right I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to check that one out for sure right okay um otherwise just to um you know finish some things up here um we have we have some Cassandra days that that we're hosting um for those of you um you know who are who want to learn a little bit more about Cassandra um and listen to some great talks from some folks in the area we are running three simultaneous Cassandra days um on November 10th and there's going to be one in Santa Clara at uh I think it's Intel's headquarters and then one in Seattle and Houston those are both on the Microsoft campuses in uh in those cities respectively and actually uh Michael I think you're speaking at one of these aren't you yes um our CEO Ryan Wright's going to be speaking in the Seattle um Cassandra days and I'm going to be speaking at the Houston Cassandra day so if you'd like to in person um I'll be in in the Houston Casino excellent and then of course you know we we also have um oh kubecon yeah rigs why don't you take this one yeah so this is kubecon clone nativecon uh which is happening next week in Detroit so you're welcome to you know if you're there just stop by your booth and say hi to me but also one more thing about Cassandra day that you probably forgot uh uh Aaron was that you can see the movie wakanda forever right so and we can see it one day before the rest of the world has an opportunity to see it yep that's a good call up this you know going to going to the Cassandra day gets you into the a preview of wakanda forever the day before so that that's a huge deal right there all right and then of course we have our Cassandra Summit coming up in March um we we used to do these but back in the days um okay yeah back in the days like six or seven years ago um so I'm so excited we're getting back to do these again um so so yeah we're talking about like you know training days um and then having having talks from uh folks all around the world um and actually our cfp is out there um so if you um you know check out our site and you want to submit a Cassandra talk um you you definitely can by uh by going there yep and um Ryan let me know that he will be speaking at the cube conference as well so if you want to meet him yeah he'll be in Detroit as well um and you can look for him just probably out either go to his speaking session or um find him yeah yeah well excellent okay and of course you know we have this promotion going right now um that uh that if your company books a meeting with us you can be entered in an entry to win a Tesla um so yeah uh highly recommend that you know in fact I wish I could do that all right well hey folks uh thanks everyone who uh who stuck with us through the end um and and thank you Michael for coming on as a as kind of a guest host here um just yeah this is such a cool Tech you know I I really I really feel that like graph Tech is one of those things that's kind of ahead of its time it's like the rest of the industry hasn't caught up to it yet and it's so awesome to see implementations of it like this and just some of the cool things you can do with it that you know other databases or other streaming ingests you you'd um you know you'd have to do a lot of work in order to get those same results for sure yes yeah we're really proud of it and we're really excited about the future of of streaming in all the data the data Sciences so like data scientists data Engineers data modelers all of those um specific disciplines can take a a advantage of streaming data that they couldn't do using you know tabular or or document based um databases for sure all right I think that's all we've got hey thanks everyone uh have a great day and we'll see you all next week and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops gifted with powers from the goddess of Cassandra grew those Powers until she can multiply it will move with Limitless speed and unmasked hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
