meetup with a special guest from anken and nana's i'm doing my best nana to pronounce your last name not sure still if i'm doing that right so nice effort okay yeah you know people also always have problems with my uh last name so i believe i say i know like how it feels so michelle would you say a word so i will know you are good with the sound hey everybody yeah doing okay so we are good from the sound hi uh hi eon hi tim faye and i see people are joining the talk already that's amazing so that's a special day today because cassandra global meetup doesn't happen daily and that makes me smiling because i love those meetups it's not the same like it was before kavit so we were meeting in person with pizza and beers and live slides and live communication those were much better but you know what whatever happens on the planet we have to keep smiling keep fighting and doing our job well so first of all i will ask our guests to introduce themselves nana would you please yes thank you hi my name is nonna enos i am a vp of engineering at a company called ankeri and what's this company about what do you do we design solutions for the shipping industry mainly to make easy all communication and information giving between two parties called the ship owner and a charterer and i'll i'll tell you more about it okay that sounds great and that sounds very interesting your talk today developers perspective on apache cassandra you see i believe what people making talks because they want to share some experience what's the main experience you want to share with us today um well it's it's the journey coming from a small team i'm going to say unfamiliar to the non-relational worlds um it's a bit of do's and don'ts which i've learned along the way that i wish that i would have known beforehand okay that's great and our second guest today is a colleague of mine michelle deru would you please introduce yourself sure sure thanks alex hi nana thanks for being here also really look forward to your talk um hey everybody my name is michial deru i'm a data architect here at datastax which means that i'm the technical lead for the region in my case region means the netherlands and scandinavia and that's also how i got to know nana and i'm really excited that she's willing to to share her experiences with us on a more personal note i live in the netherlands close to amsterdam so i would love really love to have a physical meet up again in amsterdam like alex said with a beer and some pizza slice in your hand and as soon as it's possible you can be sure that i will organize one again yeah amsterdam is beautiful and you can definitely count on me attending or maybe even talking at the meet up yes that's that's already agreed yeah that's absolutely have to go and of course nana we will be really happy to see you there but you know what uh enough talking let's start sharing knowledge and we will be talking answering questions and have some fun in the end so give me a second to prepare nana could you please share your screen and give me a moment to switch everything for us and that's going to be screenshot how's that give me a moment okay so okay you are good to go and your screen is live great so like i mentioned my company's name is ankit and i'm going to tell you why we chose apache cassandra for our latest products and how our journey has been into the non-religion world it's maybe uh maybe not your typical expert talk but it's a very real story and a useful one nonetheless so a little background about me i'm an electrical engineer and i graduated from the technical university of denmark in 2013 and i've been working and enjoying myself in the software development world for ever since i started out at a company called madoka where i was the lead developer um it's also a company in the maritime industry i took a slight shift into sleep diagnostics in knox medical before i came back to the shipping industry by joining ankit in 2019 um and on ankit we are a startup software company we launched our first product in 2018 and a little need to know about the industry where we work is that a company's shipping fleet usually consists of a combination of companies owned ships and ships that are chartered in that is rented from other shipowners and currently we have a variety of products out all with the object objective of providing a platform for the ship owner and charterer to communicate better and stay on top of fleet performance and potential chartering prospects which leads me on to our latest product and what this talk is about um it is our data connections hub so we came across a certain problem um [Music] of our customers um like i say their fleet uh consists of their own unchartered chips um real-time data is recorded on board each ship using varied internal systems from different vendors then this data is made available onshore by a number of different apis and each providing the data in a different format and then you have the problem of shifting coming and going from your fleet so this can be very difficult to consolidate um both for monitoring and analytical purposes so the solution is this data connections hub which is an api which serves the company's real-time data for their whole feed it is onboard system agnostic it is data storage in the cloud so the user won't have to collect any data on premise and it's served by a single endpoint in a single configurable format and along with it comes in an administrative format where you can add and remove ships and users in a easy way we developed this we started started developing this last year and the status now is that we've launched a pilot phase with our first customer and real time data has been streaming in smoothly as of may so um to give you our perspective at the takeoff um our resources were um for people coding a small company still we have all the required business logic for the project and we have good general software development skills and we have a vast experience managing databases but only in the relational world when it comes to the requirements of the product um due to the size of the team we knew that it needed to be low maintenance um we needed good performance because the data is not only meant for analytics but also monitoring and also for providing data to our existing products but we didn't only need performance we needed performance that's scaled this solution should work as well for a hundred ships as it should ten thousand um these three points just shout out serverless to me the last two points there um this is a new product it's not a rewrite and that we needed a fast deployment of our minimum viable product to test the market that's more to say that you know every book tells you to know all your access patterns before you dive into big data um [Music] but in some cases it's impossible to know everything for beforehand so we needed some sort of agility in our solution um so we knew we wanted serverless uh and the first answer you see when you start googling is of course um amazon web services so we chose lambda and api gateway to implement the ap itself and the back-end infrastructure and this led to the very logical choice of amazon dynamodb as our database as a service we rolled up all the access patterns that we anticipated at that point and came up with a decent design for a dynamo db single table i i won't go into details on that but the point here to make is that best practices for dynamodb design is to keep all your data in a single table no matter what type of data you have and just like that we hit our first challenge our access patterns weren't set in stone so as the product changed and as we found out some implementation details uh we needed to modify and add new access patterns and this meant a revisit to a whole dynamodb table design so this was limiting and slowing us down and even though it was already october last year and pretty close to our or closer than we would have liked to our internal deadline we decided to twitch databases so we looked into elasticsearch mongodb and cassandra and we decided to go with cassandra because of cql and its familiarity its similarity to sql the table structure with defined column names and types resonated well with our data structure and then coming from this challenge it was the ability to add new table for new access patterns more it's an easier step than to revolutionize your whole design then we chose data text as our service provider that was due to high support level we received from the beginning and that is also an important um part of the criteria to me because we knew that we couldn't know everything about this going in and it would have actually been a complete waste of time to try to know everything so you know what you need to know and then you make sure you have good friends to help you with the rest once we had chosen data stacks and astra for a serverless solution we found out about an additional get out of jail free card or it felt like that and that's the storage attached index um this can be an a very comfortable solution if you already have a table out there it has all the data you need um but you need to query by a column that isn't in your initial primary key or it isn't your whole primary key so um for this table shapes um it's just a list of ships and all the available source apis uh belonging to that ship and we created this custom index you see in the bottom there which enable us to also query the table by sources so just to give you an overview this is our all parts assembled solution it's full stack serverless um and at this point once we decided on cassandra the solution already looked like this then this is our final design even though we weren't done with hitting challenges we had completed the initial setup our second challenge was that uh we assumed an unlimited number of columns per table you know you hear the term white columnar stories and you stop listening but maybe that time i should have listened a little bit further um so this is our main table um storing all the time series data from the ships you can see our primary key containing the metadata for the for each each state or row and then we have 25 data columns and each measurement has its own column one for latitude another for longitude etc and this currently works great for our main access patterns you can select all the data columns or you can choose a handful but the wrong assumption here is that we expected that we were able to add columns indefinitely as the product would grow and we would maybe move on to different market segments um but the fact is that in cassandra even though you um select only by a couple of columns the whole row gets read into memory so if you have a couple hundred columns all of them get read into memory and this can slow the system down and we probably wouldn't have found out about this anti-pattern that we had designed if it wasn't for astra serverless guardrails which is a set of uh rules or limitations depending on how you look at it um and one of them is that there is a hard limit on of 75 columns per table um so this was a very valuable lesson for us to learn you know first i thought this is silly let's find a database provider that doesn't have this limit but after uh some research i found out that this was more a limit for my safety not the databases or or maybe both of us so our third challenge this is more of a lookout warning so we designed the partition key for our biggest table this ship data table very carefully we made sure each ship had its own partition and furthermore more we added a year um as a bucketing feature um to our partition key so that the time series data would be bound to include only a single year for each partition and what we didn't think about however was that was the throughput that smaller tables might have so as an example um each time we write data to the large table shift data um an attribute in the table shown below shift by source gets added gets updated we update last data timestamp each time we write the large table and this means that even though it's much smaller a much smaller table it gets a similar traffic as the other one but for the table below we didn't think to add shift by d to the partition key and our backend system behaves the way that data is retrieved simultaneously for all ships for a particular source so each time we updated the table for a single source this small table got bombarded um so this was uh hard to spot we had to put real load on the on the table before we found this out but um very easily fixed we just need to add ship id to to the partition key our uh fourth challenge was um that we were leaning too hard on the in operator so this is our primary select statement um this is a the select statement that's executed when the user makes a request data request on the api and what i want you to notice here that is that we have three in operators two of them the one applying to year and source those will never be the items in in these lists will only be a few due to the nature of the attributes but shape id uh a company can have a a few hundred ships so uh there's a possibility that a user might ask for data for all their ships and in that case the inaugurator who i now know is an inefficient one would slow the query down we found out about this one when we hit the 25 item hard limit of astro guardrails which was also a good thing to learn um this is also easy to implement in another way um not exactly by changing or not necessarily by changing the select statement more but more how the back end interprets the request from the user or even by placing some limitations on the amount of shapes the user can request etc uh but the point is that um i'm not sure how we would have learned about this um if it wasn't for the guardrails um we would probably just see random slow q queries um would have been it might have been hard to spot um this was the biggest challenge um it's an internal one it's shifting your own mindset [Music] um it's a pretty hard thing to get used to creating a data model um from your access pattern instead of the nature of the data like you do in the relational world because the task is pretty laid out in front of you when you just create the data model model from the behavior of the data you usually have access to data before you even need to design every every parts of your product but having to focus on your access pattern first requires you to answer questions that you don't even know yet of course when i look back on it now it's more of homework that's also healthy to do when you're designing data modeling for the relational world but yeah it can be it can be um difficult to get to use too um i felt the thought of denormalizing data was a bit uncomfortable um [Music] duplicating data like throughout your developer life you may have had one rule which is eliminate duplication eliminate maintenance of data and code so this is new but if i think about it um from another perspective [Music] of clean coat it's that it kind of takes weight away from complex queries that you see every everywhere in in code and instead you have yes you have duplicate data but you have tables named in a very descriptive way and you have more maintenance related code but that you can unit test so it can't be a comfort zone also um another thing is that it is difficult to get used to prioritizing and limiting access pattern when it comes to your users um i don't know how many times i had the conversation with my product spacing team i guess this access pattern really necessary and the answer i got was always it's better to have it and that's usually that way it's better to have all the options open but um in the non-relational world you probably have to find the some compromise um you can approach that compromise by getting used to denormalizing saying more yes than none no to your product facing team and then you can educate educate them about the sacrifices you have to make instead of all the possibilities that a powerful database like that gives you instead so to summarize um for a small table a small team of people um designing a new product and putting it out there with primarily knowledge in the relation world sql um i would go for cassandra because of the familiar table structure and cql it says yes know your access pattern beforehand but adding an saa can be your answer or at least it can be a short stop before you need to duplicate your data and adding a new access pattern in the form of a table doesn't require uh revisit to the whole design it's an easy step um it's available as a service and um with a pay for what you use model um i say get your seatbelt on with asterisk skull drills it's definitely a comfort zone for me of course uh read up on how cassandra works or whichever database you were using but it is a certain comfort zone to know that you can't um you can't do whatever um someone will stop you at some point and it's learning possibilities and then as a final note make sure you have access to support and use it so thank you for your time and do you have any questions okay now you all can hear me not only people in zoom first of all i'm very sorry for people in zoom uh my bad meeting and zoom started later when it was expected to be and then heads up maybe i'll throw the ball over to you michelle if uh sorry oh there aren't any just a second well i think that probably there are there aren't but um i think alex is now i have to be fine hello hey there we have you again econ okay that's amazing give me a second then alex do we have visibility on the chat windows are there any questions over there so i don't see any questions on uh on zoom at least nothing seen to me and on youtube i see no particular questions okay first question where is ryan you will see uh surya you will see ryan on wednesday and today is tuesday so don't be in harim now ah so uh thank you so much for your great talk it was very interesting to me especially the one of the last slides about what the main challenge is to change the mindset i do understand what you mean with some bloody tears in my eyes it's always about changing mind shift in the end like that's really really really really understandable to all of us um i thought that might be the case okay what i want to do now is i want to switch screen to the next talk done by michelle and michelle what are you going to talk about today so today i'm going to share a bit of information on cool new modern ways to connect to cassandra know we've i think most developers on cassandra they are used to working with a driver-based approach writing some cql in your client application but you know we saw i think the whole world has seen a rise of modern development stacks you know where you like to integrate with rest apis and talk to a rest api to your persistence back end so that is available on cassandra now also and that's something that i'll go and show you today and if time permits um i might even throw in uh some bonus points and show some sai indexing that nana has been talking about because i think that that the ici indexes they really provide um relational scale index type of use cases for cassandra so it makes life very easy for developers okay sounds great sounds very interesting to me and uh if you would start sharing your screen in [Music] or do you already i have too many screens at once oh yeah you are sharing already amazing thank you then give me a moment to prepare us to see your screen i'm all right almost ready to switch to it one now just tell me when yeah just a second boom okay so uh you are live your screen is live and you can start now for your nice presentation and the pitfalls that you you fell into but were able to get out of so that was really nice to see um so yeah let's uh let's go into some different ways of connecting to cassandra i know that nana is using a driver-based connection with this which is perfectly fine it's a trusted way of connecting to cassandra but some organizations they prefer uh an api-based approach using rest and graphql and uh i will also share some information about using cassandra as a document database yes you're right a document database so you know we've we all know all these these organizations what i always tell people when they ask me at a birthday party hey what is it that you do i also tell them that i work with the company that they interact with all day every day you know because essentially when you wake up and you listen to some music to spotify you interact with the cassandra backhand when you send out a parcel through dhl or fedex you interact with a cassandra backend you know when you send send money to somebody else you interact with cassandra when you watch watching movie at night you know you uh interact with the cassandra back end so i think that that you know cassandra has been accepted as as one of the best scalable fastest and most reliable databases in the world but like i said it used to have a driver-based connection always and that is something that now has been changed because you know if you look here at the middle picture you see that there is a way to interact with the database in any api and also in any data model so what does that mean any api means that the rest api is available graphql api is available and any data model means that also document data is now a first-class citizen for cassandra databases so let's let's have a quick look here at this this data architectural picture you know probably a lot of people will recognize something like this on the top of the picture you can see that it's all about developers you know because the developer in the end they they they create the business value and it's important to be for developers to work with the stacks the development stacks that they they like to use so some of them have been are shown here on this picture and then on the bottom uh you see uh the the infrastructures where people like their workloads to to land right so um here with within data stacks we we really focus hard on kubernetes because we think that kubernetes gives a freedom of choice to you as an organization to run your data on aws on gcp on azure even a mixture of those three but also to run it on premises you know because kubernetes is a standard that makes it possible to have a situation where you can migrate from one to the other so of course in the middle this is what we're we will focus on today nana already talked quite a bit about the data store itself and i'm going to focus on the level above it which is the stargate gateway because the stargate gateway that's the thing that allows you to work with all these modern apis in cassandra so the way that it looks like it's like this you have your cassandra cluster it's in this picture it's a token ring of uh of some nodes and um the cluster can be anything it can be data stacks enterprise but it can also be open source cassandra and it can also be astra our managed version of cassandra which nana is using and on top of that we have the the gateway and actually the gateway doesn't really sit on top of it but it really becomes part of the token ring so that the gateway is aware of the topology of cassandra and is also aware of the token ranges and that means that it's not really a layer on top of it but it's really uh integrated and that's why the the apis are also quite fast you know we we see we see performance metrics latencies in in terms of two-digit millisecond latencies on on the lower level so that's that's quite fast and the stargate api the stargate gateway provides a lot of functionality first of all it's your connectivity gateway but it also decouples the application from the database because now the database nodes they are responsible for storing the data and the stargate nodes they're responsively responsible for handling the query traffic the query load that also allows you to to scale them separately so it's really easy to to separately scale out your database notes and to scale out your stargate nodes stargate does a lot more it provides security and it provides a familiar playground for for developers using different types of [Music] apis so let's have a look at how it works i'll quickly switch over to my astra account because that's the easiest way to to demo the functionality to you and i will just use my serverless database over here [Music] just to show you that i'm not cheating i'm going to login into the cql console i'm going to use my serverless key space and i'm going to describe my tables so that you can see that there is no there's no table available that i'm going to use now there is something available here movies and tv but i'm only going to use that if there is still time to show you some sai indexes so this is this is it this is you know so far for cql i'm not going to touch eql anymore instead i'm going to connect in a different way to the database and the way that i'm going to connect to the database is using the rest api integrated in the astra dashboard is a swagger ui so the swagger ui is probably the easiest way to work with the rest endpoints it's broken up into three sections there's the documents section which we're going to look at later on the schema section and the data section for now i'm just going to run a very simple query on the database which returns all the key spaces so this this endpoint the key spaces endpoint i'm going to call and try it out here right from the user interface and this is uh where i need to provide a token the token is provides the security to to the database and the application token is something i can create in my dashboard so for essentially every application that i want to create i create i can create a token so for now i'm just going to create a generator an admin token that's the easiest way to get this done i'm going to paste the token here then i'm going to execute call and as you can see this is these are the responses in the in adjacent format uh just make my screen a bit bigger um about the the key spaces that i have in my database and as you can see this is the key space that i'm currently using so the swagger ui is very easy to to try try out some things and play around with for the rest of the examples i'm going to use postman so postman is um it's also a rest endpoint uh tool that you can just download and uh and use to to to call endpoints and first of all i'm going to show you the rest api the rest api is really tied to the wide row modeling capabilities of cassandra and as i said the main advantage of it is you don't need your developers to really understand your cql languages anymore you know so also for developers that are less [Music] familiar to cassandra it opens up the power of cassandra for them and this example i'm going to create a table and essentially the only thing i have to do to create a table is to provide column definitions where i define every column and in this case i define a column with a name of id and a type is integer the second part is a second column so it's a column called first name with the type of text so i'm going to call that i'm going to send this information to the endpoint this payload this body payload is going to be sent to the database and it provides me returns and success is true to show you that it works i can go back to my database login into the cql console and describe my tables again and you will see that my second table is now also a fable available there we go my table has been created let's describe table we go you can see that it has been created there is an id a first name and a last name so that resembles my structure over here the id the first name and the last name and the additional columns so very easy very simple no cql just some json data sent to the endpoint now let's insert some data and again without using cql i only have to provide a payload where i say i have some columns and the columns they are defined as such the id field has to be filled with the value of 3 and the name field the first name field has to be filled with the value of joe etc etc so let's call this towards the end point and now again on the cql console if i select star from my table cyclist semi-pro you can see that my data has nicely been inserted because i have an id of three my first name of joe and the last name of harvard so it's very straightforward of course i can also retrieve all the rows through the endpoint through the api endpoint for that i'm going to call the rows endpoint and here we go i've got my data back nicely structured in a json format i can also run queries on top of the api endpoint and in this case i'm going to call the rows endpoint and add the query part to that and the only thing i have to do is define a filter so no real knowledge of cql anymore but just a filter definition where i say hey give me everything back where the id equals the value of 3 and then i'm only interested in these column names so not the whole table but just these column names so let's see what happens i nicely get back my json structure with the information from the database so this is information this is a bit of insight into the rest api now for the document api the document api is a whole different thing right i mean the big advantage of a document api is that you don't have to provide a schema up front you can just store any type of data any arbitrarily complex json structure into a document database and that is important for developers because it allows for more agility faster time to market and still with cassandra you have the option to optimize your data model for the queries that you want to run right so of course space a defined read optimize table will of course always be faster than a schema less document api right so with cassandra you get the best of both worlds you read optimize table to provide low latency queries and the document api to provide agility in your project let's assume this this document right it's just it's just a document just an arbitrarily complex json document and i want to store it in cassandra normally i would have to first create a table structure for it but i'm not going to do that i'm just going to send it to the endpoint and while i send it it is being stored in the cassandra database and it comes back with a document id so this is the document id that is tied to this document i can also create a document with a specific id right so here is here is the same document but let's let's add something in here so that i can show you that you know it's really fully schemeless and this is created when well during the meetup oh meetup here we go there you go now let's send it to the database and you will see oh uh sorry it's the wrong uh the wrong namespace there we go it is stored as with the document id of 100. now if i want to retrieve my data i can fetch all the documents in my collection i'm going to call the collection endpoint and i'm going to provide a page size of 5 because i don't want more than 5 results and here we go this is a nice json structure of the the json data the json document that i just stored this is the first one with an id of 100 and here we should see that it is indeed stored when during the meetup and this is the original where i didn't store that information about the meetup now the nice thing about the document database is the fact that you can run our queries on the date on the data right so i i i should be able to to to search on all of these fields regardless of the type regardless of the name and regardless of the hierarchy so that's what i'm going to do here with my query because i'm going to search across the entire collection and the only thing i have to do is i call the collections endpoint with a where clause that says game code equates i'm interested in hog and there we go there are two documents and those are my original documents now let's see yeah here we go yeah okay oh there's uh there's just one document okay that's interesting let's see then what did i create for the first document game code equals hockey oh wait let's let's search on the meetup uh here we go when equals meetup and there we go now we have nicely we have one document based on the data that i just just loaded into the database so here are two examples the rest api allows you to easily integrate with cassandra based on based on rest api without prior knowledge of sql the document api allows you to use cassandra as a document database with ad hoc querying that's it for my part unless alex we have some additional time to show the sai indexes but i'm not sure for that let me know um so i think actually this one should be over at what time i'm bit lost in time in eight minutes in eight minutes we have to play a game we have a place to run we have a quest to run more important yeah this is more important sarim i mean we promised it we have to do it within the time but thank you so much for your talk we have actually i believe but not the last one i was i had a great conversation with guys from yelp you know yelp i believe and it was actually a very cool experience uh what they share it how do they use how do we use stargate because they were using this approach for a long time yelp is big they have a lot of developers but they um didn't want you they wanted to have all the benefits of cassandra but they didn't want to train every developer to use cassandra query language and also they didn't want to maintain multiple databases but we wanted to have a single one or at least uh not so many of them and that's why they started to use this approach even before when stargate happened to be and it was very interesting experience uh how they share it uh how they use stargate a recording is still available on our data stacks developers youtube channel you can look for a yelp and you will find it's a very interesting talk i definitely recommend you if you are interesting in optimization of a development process especially for big companies those have multiple developer teams or for advice quite opposite small teams what want to use rest or graphql or document api but don't want to lose the benefits of cassandra those are great obviously so let me check something first of all let me check for the questions and if we have any i will read them aloud i see a question which i can't open somehow zoom works quite weird to me today oh no this one is answered okay and one is open um oh great question from uh vera van montfrance i'm sorry if i read your last name wrong again it's a day for me to pronounce things wrong how viable would it be to have a graph query language graphql api be user frontend facing when it comes to document tenant user level authentication [Music] perhaps through some manner of api gateways or is this really designed just as a different way to access the database from a back end i can send you this question if you give me a moment so you will be able to read that on your own and give me just one second chat here we go question goes to your chat yeah yes sir okay yeah that's interesting so [Music] i guess i guess the the the the question here is how do we do uh user identity and access management um to make sure that the right user is able to connect to graphql and then run queries on the right data tables it is possible so there are ways to automate this automate this process there is a devops api that is available for astra for instance but you can also integrate with with stargate to make sure that the right users are being created so that you can decide which user has access to which data so that's possible i'm just not sure if you want all your users to be able to run all the queries that they that they want because it could also be the case that the user runs a query that is potentially harmful for a database you know so in that sense it might make sense to put something in front that checks for those kind of calls because the assumption here is that of course a user developer kind of kind of know know what they're doing so yeah it should be possible not sure if you want it also would have to know a bit more about the use case okay that's great so i think we are about to start psp i'm switching my your screen to mines to my screen that looks good to me and now we maybe will need a little bit of music never hurts and let me check the sound we have sound issues so i won't double check what we all would be good in zoom and we good on youtube yep sweet so we can proceed amazing yeah even will hate you well yes document api make you able to work with documents without installing or working with that's quite correct yep okay so now i believe we have some people today who never joined our visas before and okay we welcome to see you you need to know some rules we ask you questions you have to give the right answers and you have to answer as fast as possible because if you answer fast you get more points and you have higher chances to win if you ever won at one of our quizzes before you are not you are allowed to participate but you are not allowed to win the price so you are good to go but if you take one of the first places you have to move and how to say reallocate your price to the next one in the list first three places win now how do you join the game very easy with the help of mendy.com a job is very simple go to maintai.com easiest way to do it is to use your mobile phone just open menti.com and use the code one nine seven nine two 4 5 or scan that qr code next to me it should be somewhere here good i give you a moment to join and we will start this short quiz there won't be too many questions but still some nice prizes so go to mentee.com code 1979245 or use the qr code i give you few more seconds to join i see we have a couple of those and some people on youtube today and some more people on zoom so i want everyone to be able to join what's important if you want to win not just participate watch your phone and watch your browser with mentee open not by youtube or not zoom because uh them especially zoom oh sorry especially youtube will have a little bit of a streaming delay a second maybe two in the question of a competition that's an uh long long long time so better watch your mobile phone questions will appear where uh immediately at the moment i push the button okay so let me see how many people join us okay uh if you joining please set these thumbs up or set the heart so we will see what you join it okay i see some people join it already and we are about to start don't forget watch your phone or watch your browser um not the youtube stream i see 11 people there i believe we can have more so where are my participants don't make that easy win okay i have a bit more already almost 20 okay one more person and we start okay we have to go anyway now final check on the sound okay youtube looks good zoom looks good and it means what we have to start and let the battle commence first question and you have to answer fast to get more points how many master notes cassandra needs at least three per cluster at least three per data center not a single one has sunrise masterless enough to maintain consistency it was a short one you have to be quick time is up and most of you answer it correctly not a single one cassandra is decentralized masterless database there is no idea of a master or right replica in cassandra therefore first answer at least three and last answer enough to maintain consistency ah wrong there is no master notes in cassandra okay so who gave the right answer in the fastest way oh shiva guru natan nice to see him that was a faster sounds were with 931 point that's a very good result i see some familiar names hi vera i believe it was very who asked it for question i have missed it occasionally i'm sorry hi prasanna hi france very well so a lot of things will change we have more questions coming in answer fast to get more points how data is distributed over nodes with partitions bulk or paper node using address locators by mail so how it goes what's the right answer do you need to have experience with cassandra oh yeah that's cassandra global meetup so time is up partitions that was easy for you partitions yes not a full copy per nodes take a look company like companies like apple handles hundreds petabytes of data with cassandra can you imagine making a full copy per node with hundreds petabytes of data it would be sub-optimal solution at minimum not to say worse how it goes then who was the fastest most of you gave the right answer but who was the fastest tt was the fastest getting to the second place with 1000 861 point and marcel b overcomes it the second place with three points difference it's like one microsecond incredible competition and that all brings silva to the third place okay and mikhail is very close getting ready to jump in into the top three let's move on question three answer fast to get more points how to scale up a cassandra cluster how to scale up cassandra cluster vertical scaling upgrade server increasing scaling factor horizontal scaling add more nodes we don't scale with cassandra so how it goes how it goes what do you think how it works hey horizontal scaling add more notes we prefer horizontal scaling over vertical scaling it's more optimal for cassandra we don't increase scale factor because scale factor does not exist in cassandra and we don't scale is obviously from cancer cassandra is ready for any scale and yes we scale a lot we love scaling so who was the fastest today and who made a mistake like quite a competition derby was the fastest one jumping into that top ten that is a good result marcel b gets the first place and tt is still on the second with constantine overtaking siva guru natan and getting to the top three michel is on the fifth place very very well and prasanna gets higher and higher slowly but smoothly very well so it's going to be question number four and you have to answer fast what is recommended replication factor could it be one and a half maybe three 15 or mostly probably 42. what do you think what's the recommended replication factor per data center if it matters time is up and most of you gave the right answer recommended replication factor is free not one not 15 not 42 it would be quite interesting and definitely not one and a half that's why that's for sure but let me see that who made the mistake and who jumped in into the list okay so there are some changes dmitry was the fastest one fmw jumped into the top ten i see pacman i see prasanna is already on the sixth place which is great and marcel btt and constantine are holding top three now many people wait you to make a mistake guys and that's a question number five answer fast to get more points cassandra can be deployed on aws only any combination of cloud providers and on-premise only one cloud provider simultaneously sega mega drive so what do you think you have to think fast and time is up correct answer is cassandra can be simultaneously deployed on any combination of cloud providers and on-premise and it will be exactly the same cluster every node collaborating with every node not on one cloud provider simultaneously not only one you can have many of them you can be truly multi-cloud hybrid cloud at the same time okay so looks like this one was easy but who was fast and who was wrong so looks like q was a little bit slow this time but still holding 8th place and take a look constantine and dimitri get into the real competition giving the answer in exactly the same millisecond but constantine was faster in the previous questions holding the third place and dmitry follows him with approximately 70 points of a difference that's not a lot that's really not a lot so tough fight goals and anyone can be in their top three so let's go let's go and that's a question six we are getting closer to vent answer fast cassandra cluster can have multiple data centers yes odc active yes part dc passive read-only yes but not more than three data data centers to see no one cluster can only have one data center so your time is over and most of you gave the right answer yes you can have cassandra cluster consisting of multiple data centers all active that's a native behavior the idea of the passive data center doesn't exist in cassandra so no mistakes again it looks like dmitry was faster a little bit but tt was fastest getting to the first place nice job hey marcel there is someone who just overtake you so you have to focus on but the difference ladies and gentlemen is just four points so that's again like really millisecond to millisecond i can imagine how focused are you right now and dmitry is still on the fourth one but really close and prasanna is on the sixth and hey vera nice to see you again in the leaderboard that's good so let's move on and that's a question number seven so answer fast to get more points cap theorem claims what in the case of emergency in a distributed system consistency availability and partition tolerance all are reachable only availability is guaranteed only two of the free capabilities are reachable at the same time or maybe we will need a new cat we definitely will need a new one but maybe later and the right answer is only two or three capabilities are reachable and yes you need to have some knowledge of the distributed systems to be successful with cassandra or astra well with astra we will take care of it particularly for you but you still need to understand how distributed system works so yes only two of predictabilities are reachable sorry it's a real world so there were some mistakes and it looks like we say goodbye to france which i doubt will catch oh no no no he holds on the ninth place but he's still on the leaderboard dmitry gives the fastest answer this time jumping into the top three but there is no guarantees he will be able to hold on till the end and constantine is on the fifth this time and prasanna is steady on the sixth very good job very well so that's the question number eight and we have to answer fast to get more points what is required in a cassandra table data columns clustering columns partition keys nothing is required everything is allowed what is required in a cassandra table data columns clustering columns partition keys time is up and yeah there is a distribution i believe some of you liked the last option but the correct answer is partition keys clustering columns are optional and data columns are optional as well but partition keys are required for sure so are there any mistakes anyone losing his oh my god no the leader just lost this question getting to the sixth place and like that's changed a lot tt gets to the first place dimitri to the second and sivaguranathan to the third with constantine really really really close to them on fourth and brassanover for on fifth that was a surprise and pac-man gives the fastest answer getting to the top ten okay that's getting interesting yeah marcel was too quick i believe it was just too much in a hurry question number nine answer fast to get more points cassandra tables hold partitions only rows and columns replication factors endless sea of dreams what halt cassandra what holds cassandra table what's inside that may be a complex question if you don't have practical experience for sure and the correct answer is partitions not only rows and columns and that's a principal mind shift you have to do to be successful with cassandra that's very important to understand what table partition then columns and partition is the base unit of access in cassandra if you think of a table as just rows and columns your data model will be wrong and you cannot succeed there will be problems in your database big problems never forget about partitions and i see 14 people made a mistake now please we have introduction to apache cassandra workshop uh twice per month or at least once per month you must sign up for our next intro to cassandra or maybe advanced data modeling for cassandra which hopefully comes soon and we will explain why it's so important to remember about partitions and those eight people who answer it partitions you are the best so i expect a lot of changes what will happen okay that was quite a surprise of a leaderboard only three people gave the pass and gave the right answer which brings dmitri to the first place with 8 303 points tt still was on the second that was good overall performance and siva is on the third okay and some new names on the leaderboard as well that's a question 10 two questions left let's start answer fast to get more points how cassandra executes joints joints need special joint table exactly like an sql it doesn't execute joins executes but kinda lazy what do you think what's right answer how cassandra execute joins i'm very curious okay most of you gave the right answer cassandra does not execute joins with or without joint table it doesn't execute joins cassandra is no sql database there are no joints in cassandra and definitely not exactly like an sql pads for sure so what's going on in my leaderboard okay no mistakes in the leaderboard but definitely some differences in the answer time siva was the fastest this time that's a very good marcel overtakes prasanna bringing her to the sixth place back again but there are no big changes on the top three so what's going to happen now that's a mystery for me i know the question but i know how you will make your answers now breathe out breath in warm up your fingers prepare is going to be last question last question defines everything here we go answer fast to get more points plaster has 8 servers in a single data center how many servers you have to add to double performance 4 8 12 impossible to double performance within a single data center 8 servers in a single dc how many servers you have to up to double performance ok and that's a very interesting outcome correct answer is eight considering your data model done right by adding the same amount of servers you have right now you are doubling your performance because decentralize it and distribute it cassandra maintains linear scalability and basically if you need to double your performance you have to double your server count of course we speak about perfect conditions when your data model is optimal if you have any problems that will not help but i speak about the conditions when you follow it our best rules for the best partition from the workshops we do for apache cassandra answer 4 is would be amazing it's amazing to double your performance by adding less servers than you have i would love to have it but again in the real world if no unicorns it's not possible and answer is impossible to double performance within a single dc is not right yes it is possible it's perfectly confirmed by netflix so that was it maybe we are done oh no we aren't done you want to see the leaderboard right okay here is it so oh my god prasanna franz i'm so sorry that was a mistake and that's how leaderboard looks in the end dmitry first place with 10 182 points incredible result tt 9917 points also that's that's a very good performance and constantine got to the third place overtaking siva by some minor counts of points like 200 only difference and marcel was a leader for a long time but it's fifth place only and the three first places are getting prizes now dmitry konstantin and tt you did really well please contact me because usually i ask you to contact jack fryer but he is on vacation this week so please contact me on i will publish my email alexander.com at theytaskducks.com yes it's on youtube and i will publish it to zoom as well first three places please make a screenshot of your prize position and to analyze and attend these finalists and attendees good alexander volsnev looks like no typos send me an email with the screenshot of your first second or third position and we will be good what was the price uh price is some swag from data stocks that's usually an apache cassandra t-shirt um and um i believe it was a glass or something actually i'm sorry uh usually jack is responsible for prizes but he's uh on vacation this week and frankly speaking i don't remember what's there besides the t-shirt so yeah uh yeah vera come again next week we run workshops weekly sometimes even multiple times per week and you will definitely get your chances and actually i see there is a couple of questions on uh zoom but i don't know what's going on with the zoom it can't open questions for me i'm sorry give me a moment to check something i believe okay there is a question this absolutely fun great options and the answers thank you yeah i enjoyed it also as well okay answer it done all questions are answered it was a great day together with you a great meet up thank you all for coming don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel or our workshop events at datastax.com workshops we are done for today it was incredible david fume and uh thanks a lot uh to our dearest uh oh nana i see you joined us back i didn't notice you enabled your camera i'm sorry so then give me a second to bring all the speakers uh back to screen because it would be really great to have you all well well well well and we are almost there oh the magic of 21st century technology yeah that's actually really cool uh can you imagine uh you are located next to amsterdam no no i don't remember where are you located sorry i'm in reykjavik iceland yeah and um [Music] me in germany we used to have talks also from people in the united states so that's where how world works in the 21st century indeed people from everywhere and that's amazing let me check one more time for any questions and i believe we are done for today right now working oh okay right now working on the academy courses planning to take up my death certification this week or the next one agently looking forward not exactly a question but thank you for saying that first of all i wish you all the best at your exam and second of all maybe you don't know cassandra is great cassandra is used in many of the biggest companies in the world what world needs more qualified engineers and that means what we need more certified experts now data stacks sponsors your education and certification and you can pass your education you can prepare at the academy.datastax.com and get certified absolutely for free and that's a normal uh proctored verifiable globally recognized certification on apache cassandra done by datastax so contact me on discord youtube and so on i will help you with that and thank you for this uh message and i wish you all the best at the exam shivan now i see john pal having issues with the smug i'm sorry we indeed have problems with logistics company who was sending it for us so we will handle that later now um now there is a question for you timothy asks any performance statistics from nana's project please um we don't have any uh performance statistics as of yet but we're receiving on on the broad spectrum we're receiving data from uh around 250 ships currently um and we'll we're hoping to be around maybe a thousand next year and that's uh we get a data package every 15 minutes from each year it's not exactly internet of things every second data but it is really a lot when it comes all comes together and it's being handled quite well by cassandra currently you know what actually i really like this uh question it's uh right to the point whatever numbers good engineers care about the numbers and what i think it's a actually great idea to have next meet up uh well uh to have one more meet up not next meet up necessarily uh with you in half a year in six months let's say and you will share like how this project advances and what's your new experience of that that would be very interesting and i believe a lot of people would be interested to see how it grows and by the way thank you for sharing um yeah not so many companies as open as yours so that's amazing to see these kind of data yes thanks a lot nana really really appreciate it so things like thanks for the platform and this second talk you mentioned sounds really good i'll i'll gear up to it looking forward to it okay so i think we are done i don't see more questions in zoom i don't see more questions on youtube it means what we are done for today so thank you so much for joining sorry thanks a lot alex for organizing and being a great mc for meetup yeah so uh thank you so much and we are done so uh this week workshop is intro to nosql databases and it will happen tomorrow and on thursday two runs for different time zones and we will be happy to see you there and for the next cassandra global meetup state unit we will publish the announcements very soon we have a lot of interesting things coming on so thank you a little bit of music in the end and see you later bye everyone goodbye more formats to change [Music] yes [Music] perfect",
