    "text": "[Music] hi i am artem chibatko and this is graph traversal steps grammar and traversal steps and step modulators are defined by interface graph traversal there are around 100 methods with distinct names in this interface the majority of them are graph traversal steps this is a rich interface with a lot of functionality we will be scratching the surface to get you started lambda steps are the foundational constructs in the grammar language they are the most general steps that can be used to implement most other steps however they are not the easiest traversal steps to use or understand and they lack efficiency as a result lambda steps are disabled by default in datastax enterprise graph we'll still take a closer look at these steps but mostly for educational purposes derive steps on the other hand are very useful in practice most reversals will typically rely on around 10 most commonly used steps so learning all of them is not necessary to start using gremlin there are a few steps that do not fall under the lambda derived classification also there are modulators that are used to manipulate or pass additional parameters to a traversal step finally there are predicates that are used to relate values and objects is unlikely that you will need to use lambda steps for any of your real life traversals but we will still look at them for educational purposes and see why derived steps are so much better the first lambda steps we'll look at is called map it maps the traverser from the current object of type s to some other object of type e according to some function passed as a parameter in other words map takes one object from a stream and turns it into some other object of the same type or different type let's look at an example and see how simple it is we're going to use map to find a title of a movie we begin by getting to a vertex that has movie id m267 then we use a maps tab and pass a lambda or anonymous function to it as a parameter to understand this groovy syntax it refers to the traverser and get returns the current object of type s in our case this is a vertex the lambda returns the title which is another object of type e basically we did not do anything complex here we mapped a movie vertex to the value of its title property the result is alice in wonderland while map is a one-to-one mapping flat map is a one-to-many mapping in this example we want to retrieve actors associated with a particular movie so we are going to map one movie to many actors as before we begin by getting to a vertex that has movie id m267 we then use flat map to hop from the movie vertex to all aj's and vertices reachable via outgoing actor edges we further map vertices to values of their name properties because we want to see actor names in the output rather than just vertices themselves and we get johnnydepp and hassaway and some others lambda's step filter can be used to decide whether to pass a traversal to the next step in a traversal or not based on some predicate in this example we are still looking for names of actors associated with a particular movie but we are using filter to eliminate all vertices except one with label movie and movie id m267 which is specified in somewhat complex logical expression for the filter step and we still get the same result as in the previous traversal with actors being johnnydepp and hassaway and a few others now this next step called side effect does not affect a traverser itself instead it does something external it creates a side effect like maybe printing a line of text to the screen or sending a message to an external system so in this example we do some printing of text the actors of alice in wonderland as a side effect that literal does not actually appear in the output stream of the traversal where we find actor names an example of more useful side effects would be traversing a graph and extracting its subgraph as a separate data structure we will see such an example when we study subgraph traversals the last time the step is branch it splits and sends the traverser onto multiple branches to perform alternative traversals this simple example demonstrates how to use branch to return johnnydepp's id while returning names of all other actors as before we start by getting one specific movie vertex and traversing outgoing actor edges to get to person vertices and then we do something different rather than simply getting names of all the actors we go on a branch the branch step defines that for those vertices which have property called name whose value is equal to johnny depp map them onto their person ids otherwise map them to their names so if you visit the johnny depp actor vertex you will output id if you visit any other vertex you will output name and you can observe that result in the sample output we do have a separate presentation about branching traversals where we will explore many useful and practical examples okay i get it lambda steps are pretty hard the good news is you will never need to use them in practice the mover's theoretical foundation for gremlin it's good to know about them but even if you feel comfortable using lambda steps please don't the optimizer in dc graph will not be able to analyze and interpret the code inside of lambdas that you write which will limit possible execution plan optimization and will result in bad performance what you will need to know and what you will use are the derived steps take a look at how our traversal with lambda steps is rewritten using derived steps it is so much simpler to write and understand and more efficient as well filter was replaced with has flat map was replaced without and branch was replaced with choose the result is the same however for more information about individual graph reversal steps you can always refer to the tinker pop documentation but this is not always the best way to learn the approach that we take in this training is studying different types of traversals and their respective commonly used steps in this training we are going to learn by example",
