  "title": "DataStax Presents - How Do *You* Graph? - Minimizing Developer Impedance with Ben Krug",
  "description": "We're often told that graph databases are entirely different from relational and other databases. Graph traversal tools, like Gremlin, often look and feel imperative, whereas tools like SQL are basically declarative. But are they really completely different?\nUpon examination, the real issue is - which approaches will help a developer obtain the results they need most quickly and efficiently.\nWe will contrast different views of, and access methods to, graph data, focusing on examples from Tinkerpop's Gremlin (does traversals, feels imperative, and graphy) and Apache's Spark SQL (does queries, feels declarative, RDBMSy). Gremlin can be leveraged from a variety of programming languages, thanks in part to Gremlin Language Variants, or from a gremlin console. Spark SQL makes use of Spark architecture and concepts, and allows you to build on existing relational experience.\nThere are many ways to look at and use any data, including graph data. This talk will consider some different graph approaches, their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate the use of each to accomplish \"graphy\" tasks.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "gonna be possibly a little bit more high-level than the last one it's it's we'll get into it but it's just a little bit about how do you think about crafts and how do I think about graphs and see if we can get some ideas out of that the usual way of thinking about it and and how I think about it so you can tell that the last Johnathan and zoom and I all use the same template for our slides and you notice it says confidential at the bottom but that's just for this one slide so please don't share mind my name or the tip the title of the talk but the rest you can talk about Who I am is a technical support engineer data sects and previously I worked at doing the same kind of thing for MySQL and then for Sundin for Oracle before that I was a DBA and assist administrator at banks utilities and startups and medical insurance companies and I worked with all kinds of databases starting out with that my with that I Sam and then hierarchical the mumps database and then relational and then no ice QL and now graph so I kind of have an interest in the theory of data models and comparing them and that's a bit where this talk came out of I have a couple of blogs that talk about some of these these things on other things which I just put up there for reference and as a disclaimer this is not a the opinions that I'm giving or not data stacks opinions they're my own opinions as far as data modeling and what graphs are and anything else the topic is kind of how do we look at grass and how do we think about grass and what's the best way to look at them and is there a best way and like I said it's an opinionated discussion it's it's how I I think about it whether there is a best way or not and I don't know about the people here but I came from a background of other databases including a lot of relational and I want to know what that helped me out in my my usage of graphs and how it apply and whether it would apply so the goals of the talk are to talk a little bit about graph theory and the model theory for graphs compare and contrast it with relational and and hopefully just this Elson Fudd that I see out there a lot about craft databases and then to talk about some of the tools that are out there including some of the tools that we datasets used to access our graphs and in the context of this talk how they can be used and how you can use them so just to back up and go first because you know I didn't know the audience that would have wanted to talk about what's a property graph and I will be thinking most about property graphs because that's what I've worked with and what we work with and it's a collection of labeled notes and and in my case directed edges you can have a formal definition for to sort of a mathematical definition which I like to look at that kind of things because I like to try to be precise when I can and it just says that I'm one example of a definition would be that it's a class of vertices edges and a mapping function where V is a set of vertices edges is a subset of the Cartesian product of the vertices and the mapping function maps to labels any vertex and edges will have some labels on it this is taken from a paper that Marco rode Marco from now works with data stacks it's a nice paper if you're interested in in gremlin and graph theory and it just gives a real overview of what gremlin is and and how it works and the theory behind it and then by contrast you know what is a relational database and it's a little harder to say there because I'm in a general sense we all know and we think about its collection of rows and columns organized into tables but can you really pin it down as clearly or as precisely as you can with the the graph database I'm not sure what I was trying to look for definitions Wikipedia just said it's a digital database based on the relational model of data as proposed by you have Cod in 1970 Google dictionary had maybe the worst definition that you could have which is a database structure to recognize relations among stored items of information with you know that gives you know and that could be national database I couldn't find a formal mathematical definition there there may be one out there if anyone knows the one I would like to hear it but maybe one could be based on the relational algebra but it seems hard to pin it down really precisely and concisely you could say that it's one that adheres to Cod's ideas maybe has 12 rules but if you're interested in the history and theory of databases in relational databases that's a really difficult thing to go by for example his sixth rule is called the View updating rule which says that any view that is theoretically updatable is updatable and that is problematic in itself which is theoretically updatable mean and it actually leads to real issues if you try to pin it down mathematically you get some some problems with that so what I want to do is just be a little imprecise about it and do user kind of how we normally use it which is just to say it's it's a database where you think of it as tables of rows and columns maybe normalized to some degree I'm not going to say it has to be in a particular normal form probably have contained integrity constraints and an important thing about it is that it separates the logical view of the data from the physical storage behind it so for that the purpose of the talk when I say relational on I'm mainly going to mean that we're looking at as tables of rows and columns now I want to talk a little bit about the fund that I was talking about earlier just to clear it out of the way and clear the air this is a lot of things that I saw when I started getting into graph databases and just went out and looked around to read about it I did a super quick google search like the first thing I searched on and picked something out of the first page of results and this is just an example it's not the worst of the best of the things that are out there but says the hoary old our DBMS still rules and we need something new and there's this idea that graph is completely new it's nothing like relational and relational it's just old and out of the way and we need to get rid of it and move forward another view that here's a relation was better prostatic view of your data and not for relations which is a little ironic since the relational database but I understand that relational relations mean different things in those two different contexts I'll share my slides later but I have a post that I wrote some years ago when I still worked for Oracle about about that that idea and it kind of against it with some links to papers that that had some further arguments against that view another thing that here is a native graph databases must be better than non-native they're built from the ground up to support graph they they have to do it better and I think I haven't the next slide we'll talk about this a little bit more but you know it native versus non-native to me doesn't make too much sense and I'll talk about why and it also doesn't mean it's better and there's a really good post of the guy who wrote it was in the lab was sitting here for the last talk that oh I'm sorry I'm thinking of another link that will come to you this one was written by Marko as well and it's about the idea that native storage is kind of meaningless and even if you had an idea for it it wouldn't guarantee better performance so I want to get that out of the way the next one that you hear a lot is that joins are slow and you have multiple joins it's just going to bog you down you're not going to get anywhere graphed reversals are fast and I have a slide for that because it takes there's a lot that you could say against that and one of the examples that people will often use they'll say friends or friends say you have in nodes each node has an average of K edges or friends they say that in a relational you're gonna have order of log in at least to look that up and in a graph database it can be a constant speed to look it up so they say well that must be faster right but you know Big O notation can be misleading just because something has a better big grading doesn't mean that's gonna be faster when you actually implement it and this is kind of a silly example but there's a point behind it where I have a constant order algorithm for reading me an entry from a list of length n the constant speed algorithm is read the whole disk and then give me the entry I asked for that's gonna operate in a constant speed the log in one is use an index defied the entry and returned it so it seems like I see how the example but it's not as silly as it seems because some databases may have something they say is a constant speed but it may not be a fast constant speed it depends on what for a graph for example what you have to read into memory what you have to process in that constant speed versus might have something optimized to read a very small amount and do it in an order of login for example if you're reading vertices and it takes a lot to deserialize and process each one there might be a slow process if you had a join table that was very concise and normalized it might be very quick did you wouldn't login and there's an interesting paper that I linked to about that which which has actual numbers for that and it's four years ago so I'm not trying to bash any particular databases but he compares some things he did with neo4j was something to do with an unnamed relational database system and a lot of the results were a lot faster with the relational so it's not a entirely prestigious example there and it's something to clear out of the way as well the last thing that I'll do for this and then I'll move on is just take some things that came from another graph company site I did a Google search again and the first search I did and some of the first links I came to and this is all from one page so it just shows you how much is out there how much fun you know way one of the things I said the game was native graph storage a bare-metal up which if you read some of those papers you'll see it doesn't make too much sense really it's going to be faster and we've talked about that not necessarily so another one is about index free adjacency what you which you'll probably read about if we read about graph databases and I'm not bashing that particular idea we use that ourselves in data stacks but the idea that necessarily makes something faster and then if you're thinking of it as as point physical pointers that won't make sense in a distributed environment so a lot of the real issues that come as far as performances when you scale out and are not on a single node and you're scaling out into multiple nodes then pointers don't mean too much and you just optimize the best you can using whatever method works best this first point here is what I was talking about when people will say that if you're doing joins it's going to come to a grinding halt and that may be true when you get to huge numbers of joins but and the scale a lot of people are using it may also not be true and I wrote a post about this myself as well with some numbers that again because I was looking at some posts about neo4j I compared some with MySQL of this doing a relational and implementation and it was pretty quick but my numbers came out better than the this person's numbers it wasn't official numbers that they used was just someone out there and then there's ideas about its schema-less and I think that sometimes people overemphasize the impact of a schema change at a production system and also they may under estimate the need for some kind of schema in a graph system so all of these things again I just want to clear out of the way and then talk about what really is the best way to look at graph databases the last thing here is people talking about you don't have to infer data connections using foreign keys or out-of-band processing and in my opinion foreign keys are not so different from edges so to me that that doesn't make sense in itself either but let's pass from that and go on to kind of how I look at things and then we can look at the tools that are out there and how we can use them so for a lot of data models that are out there including the ones that were used in examples for the talks I've seen today there's kind of a natural mapping between graph databases and relational databases and and this is not just kind of an observation it some of this will be helpful too when we talk about the ways that we use our graph databases but it's hard to formalize precise like an isomorphism or a mapping mapping or anything like that because relational like I was saying before is it's hard to formalize but it's not too hard to picture again with killer video like Jim had in his talk we have users videos and comments I have a different version of killer video than he was using but you can easily see that the user type of node could be mapped to user table the labels can be mapped to columns same with video and comments and the edges can be mapped to join tables so it's not hard to see and then the question is how do they they perform relative to each other more than one's good one is bad as I mentioned for integrity constraints people might say you don't have that in a graph database but really to me that's what in edges I mean and schema if you have kind of a schema graph than attributes of the labels I mean of the nodes and edges have to be of the type specified in the schema so that's an integrity integrity constraint as well so I guess what I came to is there's a lot of ways to view a graph and I like to look at things in a lot of different ways so I mean this isn't even obviously all the ways you could look at it as an adjacency matrix - as well if you're looking at a mathematical ease there's a million ways to look at it ones that we work with are with data stacks and with tinker pop there's the graph view which gremlin pretty much is to access your graph kind of in a graph weighing with the graph view the relational view can come into your hand when you're using something like spark SQL DSE graph frames using JDBC and ODBC when you use all at Mon like Jim was saying he likes to think of things terms in terms of tables sometimes and he's used to kind of relational looking queries so that can be helpful for him of course there's also a graphical view which is nice which which he showed you which you can do in studio as well and and sometimes this would be this is kind of a no-no in relational or another graph models the whole idea was to separate storage from the the logic but you can look at the underlying storage view in GQ out all right that's only for elite hackers you wouldn't really use that and you know any of your applications and and so how does that relate to the ways that you access your your graph a little bit of this is going to talk about imperative versus declarative because some people talk about the differences and what's better to use and normally people will say that SQL and seek you all are declarative people might think of gremlin is imperative and in case people don't know what that means to clarity of means I'm gonna tell you what I want you to find you find the best way to get that and you give it back to me imperative means I'm gonna tell you what steps to take like Ana traversal start here go here go here go here tell me what you get so some people would say that declarative is more of a relational thing and imperative is more for graphs but definitely not that way with I would tinker popping with a lot of the crap implementations out there as a matter of fact it's not that way for relational either a lot of SQL is declarative that's true but SQL 99 offers common table expressions which have an imperative element a lot of people will use UDF's or embed their their code into other code which can be imperative most SQL vendors offer extensions I spelled that wrong with a like pl/sql or transactional SQL and they have imperative elements so imperative declarative really it has very little to do with whether you're using relational or graph even pure old style SQL can kind of have an imperative element I mean say that you look up you tell it I want to look at a particular user by their ID and then find me some child records and then from there if I'm with some more child records it's only going to do that in one way you're pretty much telling it how to do it I mean I know that you're not really telling it how to do it but you know that it's going to do it in one particular way and then what about the graph side well gremlin which is the tinker pop access method for a graph databases is both declarative and imperative and and these I have some examples from the tinkerer pop site these two things do the same thing we want to find collaborators for gremlin who worked on some code for projects and they both basically say go to gremlin look at the things he created then look at the things that other the other people who worked on those projects and find me their managers but one of them is stated in a declarative way in one's in imperative ways so both of these methods are useful for graph and they both apply to the graph world there's a really nice sight if you're new to gremlin at all and you're more used to relational sequel to gremlin comm it has a whole lot of things a lot of sequel queries and tells you how you might do them in gremlin like for exhibit I just pasted a few examples a select distinct a let's see doing some filtering doing some joins and it shows you how and gremlin you do the same thing so my point here is that when you're coming to graph and if you're coming to gremlin it doesn't mean throw everything away it just means you might write something in a new way you might even write it in a similar way but you don't have to throw out the baby with the bathwater the things that you know can be used to help you learn what you're going to do with graph spark SQL is also declarative and imperative the data model that's currently exposed is maybe a little ownerís right now it's like a completely unorganized data model I think like Jim was saying you have a a node table and an edge table and Freema graph everything goes in there when I started out and I had that slide about graph database and relational database have an obvious matching when I first was writing this I was thinking well for a knowledge graph or a semantic graph that might not work very well because you would just have for example words and then you would have thousands of kinds of edges between them and so you might have a whole bunch of little edge tables you know nose cones whatever so I thought it might not be too practical but then I realized that that's pretty much what you get with spark SQL you just get nodes edges there two tables and it turns out it is pretty helpful once you get some practice with it so for example and I used studio to do this when Kim was showing you I just have an example of doing something to get something out of a graph that looks very relational it looks like you might be doing with a relational database but I'm doing it on a graph and it's a declarative looking query but spark SQL is also imperative because you have all the spark functionality and you can have steps and you can have you know you can have the program tell you do this step do this step now to something declarative now do this step with it DSE graph frames sort of the same thing it's an extension of spark graph frames and graph frames are built on data frames the data frames add a little bit of relational ease and a way to spark and I have another slide talking about cql and development of cql coming up with with Cassandra but a lot of these things I think of a of al pacino sometimes you get out of the SQL world again to know SQL and you're doing Cassandra or you start doing graph rooms and you might think I'm leaving behind the relational things and I think about Pacino saying just when I thought I was out they pull me back in because people want to have you know these things are very useful on there they're they're helpful to use is their easy way to think and people want to have them so these relational things keep creeping back into these other kinds of databases we had no SQL and then cql came in and Cassandra started looking more relational again and we have DSC graph frames and graphs start looking more relational I pull just some very simple examples from our from our Docs and the data bricks Docs to show some things that you could do with with data frames I mean graph frames I'm sorry in Jim's talk gave given one many more examples but you can do a group count you can do filtering on conditions you can do something that could goes over the whole graph like this last one as a matter of fact if you want to drop thousands of nodes or millions of nodes or whatever the only way that we really recommend our support doing it right now is through DSC graph frames because you can just say everything has a label person drop it if you tried to do that traversing to grab somehow and you might be working on that forever a nice thing about DSC Graff frames to as Jim also mentioned is that it supports the graphics library a bunch of other libraries and so you have things like PageRank connected components shortest paths just built right in and Jim demonstrated the the shortest path but those are really awesome things that you can do with the graph frames in a way that feels kind of relational that if you tried to do it in a in a imperative way by traversing the graph somehow again you could be taking forever to try to just walk through everything and do it one at a time so the declarative myth isn't that kind of relational methods using relational in that fuzzy way are very useful and helpful in graph and I'd like I mentioned before you can use CQ all the to peek under the hood and look at the the tables that we use to store our graphs this is not something you would probably do an application but if you're curious like I'm you you might want to look under the hood to see that we do store things as tql tables they they're not super easy to read or use or anything but for example I just did a well what happens is every kind of node you have so every node label will get a a P table and a table meaning the data for the node and its properties and the data for the edges and in the killer video database I just looked up one person Daniel day-lewis where his name was Daniel day-lewis and got his community ID and member ID those are the things that we have some a community ID belongs to the node label and the member ID is that particular node and then you can look at edges that that link to that unfortunately from there it would be pretty hard to link it to other known because you'd have to use that adjacent vertex ID and it may be simple but I'm not sure how to decode that into a community idea to member ID but we wouldn't recommend doing it using that method anyway it's just kind of out of curiosity so my vision and I think that the industry is going this way is that everything would kind of come into using all these things in one place and into a graph and you would conceptualize and access to graphing in many ways whether it's declarative or imperative and graphic queries or relational queries and use the best tools for the job I picked these two because about a week ago in the same day I was trying to adjust something on my son's bicycle had been a while to do it so actually I was going at the wrong part but I had to try to get this one that all bolt loosen and the only way to do it was to use one of the ranges on the left because that was the only way we could get at it and then the same day I was trying to disconnect the battery on my car it's a long story but the check engine light went on and I want to see if I would stay on it so I wanted to use one of those instead of using the other kind they're both wrenches but pretending depending on what you're doing you want to pick the best tool for and I think that should be the same thing for it for graph databases so how do we help you do this with with data stacks and how does some of the tools out there help you do this tse graph is built on a lot of components we we include the tinker pop standards we include gremlin we have DSC graph frames which you may have heard about in Jim's talk and I didn't talk about it much but we have solar integration which also can help with the different kinds of queries because you can filter on things that you index gremlin gives you a very powerful imperative and declarative methods for traversals and graph analyses we have the OLTP queries no OLAP queries and again as was mentioned you can separate things in Cassandra to different data centers and have one that handles your OLTP and you're all AB even there the distinction of the dividing line is not always super clear or precise I mean in a way it's just a matter of different latencies OLTP just means little bit less latency OLAP is more but how much is no where's the dividing line um I think in our Docs with the examples they have an example of a an OLAP query that you might want to do an OLTP situation because it would perform better but there's a general distinction that that is useful and then is is worth separating and using we also support something called gremlin language variants which means that gremlin can be embedded in two different languages whether it's Python or Scala or others and if you're comfortable with one of those languages you're not doing something like coding some strings and then passing the strings and then there d you know processed over there and in part over there you're doing your gremlin right inside of your Scala or your Python code which makes it easier and also performs better as I mentioned solar is it's integrated and you can use that to help you narrow your queries down to start at the the right places you want to start filter gremlin all that mood mode uses I believe uses graph SQL under the I mean spark SQL under the hood to speed up complex queries it doesn't use the DSC graph frame so like Jim was mentioning when you using graphs frames things might perform better than when you're just using all that mode and you can test and see what works best for your situation and we have a very nice development tool Daz studio which gives you the graphical views you can do gremlin you can do spark SQL there's a a scheme of your and you can when you go to the schema view or you can say how do you want to look at it and you can say I want to look at it using SQL and then it'll give you the spark SQL view and you'll see your know it's table on your edges table for each graph that you have if you say I want to look at it through the gremlin view it'll show you your your know ones in your edges and you can use gremlin if you say you want to use a cql view for your schema it'll hide your graph tables from you because like I said we don't really why are you looking at your graphs through Tiki well that's sort of a implementation thing that's like using X dollar signs on Oracle it's it's not documented it's subjective subject to change wouldn't use a for an application but it's interesting to look at on your own - the sequel shell or something else like that so that's the gist of what I want to say we said there's a lot of I think a lot of fun out there about graphs are completely different from relational and forget everything new about relational and I feel like that's throwing the baby out with the bathwater and I think that from what we can see here what we saw in James talking other talks there's really the best of both worlds and you want to use the tools that that work best in your situation do benchmarking see what what works best for you pick the best tools and don't think that this is graph I have to only do traversals or this is relational over here I can do that kind of thing mix it up and see what works in reality and I put my email up address up here too because if anybody would like to contact me with any questions or has any ideas on this it's kind of an interesting area for me that I'm want to look more into in terms of formal details and numbers as to some of the differences the distinctions and also just kind of the logic of it or the way that you think of it if anybody would like to ask questions are stimulate any thought on my side I'd appreciate it very much so this Ataka I don't know if there any questions with our questions I'm happy to answer them if not thank you for coming thank you",
