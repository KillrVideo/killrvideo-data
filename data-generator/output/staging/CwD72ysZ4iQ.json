    "text": "hey everybody I'm Denise and I'm Dave and we grab the mic from the Deverell team here at the inaugural global graph summit at day to day Texas in Austin Texas as a part of the graph practice here at data stacks to talk with you all about application development with graph data from data staff this is the distributed data show context we have been talking about this so far and focusing a whole series on application development with challenges and best best practices and so we brought Dave here to get this kicked off and I'm curious to get us started in this discussion for graph data what are some of the application and developer challenges that you have faced and what do you see when you're out there working with development teams I mean I think the most common most common challenges I see with development teams is really a couple couple there's two kind of ways there's really one is about really understanding what how graphs work and and having issues with querying the query patterns that they're using and the data modelling patterns that they're using and the other one just kind of loops back into that as far as like the team skills that they'd have because it's it's a different set of skills to work with graph data than it is with what they're probably used to in a more relational manner yeah yeah so you we see that a lot and you mentioned querying so what what specific performance issues do you commonly see a dev team run into when they're working with a query and maybe before you get into that what do you mean by a graph query well not when I'm talking about a graph query I'm talking about essentially what they use to actually retrieve the data back out of the system or put data in so basically the relational or the graph version of sequel okay and usually what I see people have a problem with is they're not um they don't completely understand what their their query is doing they're running it in ways that they're not filtering out data per freely or at the right time so it ends up taking a very long time to return data because graph data when you're running graph query is they kind of they have this called branching factor where they tend to go out and walk through different parts of the graph and if you don't control that as you're going through your performance of your of your query suffers so yeah that's actually very important and you just mentioned branching factor yeah can you kind of give us a little bit more of a definition of what that means and kind of the computational overhead that comes into play yeah so branching factor is really all about the number of successors that a node has to work with so for example if in uh you know if you came to a street and there was three different ways to go that's basically a branching factor of three and if you do that many different times in a row all of a sudden you know you can quickly and easily get 256 thousand different choices and that is going to cause a tremendous amount of computational overload on your system and basically really slow down the performance of your query in your servers oh yeah that definitely can be a that can be a big problem when you were talking about this just a bit ago though you also kind of implied a little bit about the performance issues that can come into play when you're translating your data from a relational world into a graph worlds can you talk to us about some of the may be like the top three recommendations that you would have for data modelling in a graph yeah absolutely I mean most most development teams most application development teams are very fluent and how to work with a relational data most of them aren't necessarily fluent and how you work with graph data so there's certain tricks and techniques you want to definitely think about first one is really what kind of question you want to answer you know what what are you trying to what kind of questions that your application trying to answer and that really flows into how you build your data model to optimize those okay then the second kind of being able being open to a lot of the the techniques around denormalizing your data down from having the ideal graph model where everything is a separate notes like practically in order to do this I want to copy this field multiple times into different into different nodes so I can not have to walk extra steps each time on trying to query and lastly I'd say it's probably around just really understanding the constraints of the systems you're working on you know if you you know you don't want to have too many different you know vertex labels and nodes because if you do in your application because now if you do that your queries get much more difficult to actually write and retrieve the data that you're trying to get yeah that's that's a good point and you just mentioned something specifically about data modelling and trying to understand when things are vertices and things can be edges do you run into that that debate with the dev team where you can just tell that they've been arguing about if it should be a property or if it should be a vertex all the time and the answer is it's it's not it's not as clear-cut you have to really kind of look at what the use case you're trying to work on and frequently I actually find it ends up being both because you have to use cases which want to hit the same data in different ways so you need to denormalize it into both to optimize to try and make it look the optimal in the optimal query pattern for both that's a really good point how did dev teams react if you don't mind digging into that when you tell them for to walk them through denormalization denormalization you know dev teams it really depends they kind of run everywhere from like okay to why would I want to do that it's a graph I should be able to kind of do it this way what I tend to kind of walk back to is even in the relational world third everyone loves third normal form until it doesn't work yeah and this is no different than that this is basically you know in order to fix query performance problems when working in a relational database it's really common to copy data into multiple different places multiple different tables graphs no different you know it's the the problems are the same the technology is a little different I think that brings us back to one of the very first things you mentioned that's vital with understanding and guiding developers through their process and building a graph implication and that was that they need to have the right skill set in order to develop an application and when we're thinking about relational technology we've got tons of resources so how would you advise a new dev team wanting to get into graph application building on gaining those skills and where do they start yeah well I mean as far as gaining those skills I'm a big proponent of getting hands on and trying it out okay you know getting our hands on and trying out but try it out on something that's bite-sized don't try don't try to boil the ocean don't try to solve the whole problem try to start with a very small piece of the problem figure out how to meet how to make it work then move on to the next part of the problem don't don't try and solve the big gigantic ball when you can start with a little corner it's not you get the idea but you know and as far as like the skills out that you need to do this it really depends you know ones like you know graph data modeling you know crafting a model of query performance query patterns there's a lot of good resources out there online data stacks Academy for example is a great one for it has a lot of great content on it and as I said a lot of it really comes down to making sure that you think about your problem completely yeah before you actually start working on it okay so I really like how you've started to put these into two categories they're skills you put their skills in a category of data modeling and you put their skills and tools and actually a third you've mentioned query languages I'm so let's talk tools what kind of query language is or what kind of resources you would you recommend for people getting used to query languages like are you getting use to the gremlin query language I mean I think some of the best content is actually there's a book out there by Kelvin Lawrence which is the fantastic book it's probably the best best written guide to gremlin that I found they take up op documentation it does a very good job of walking through achieve each of the steps and then actually the the data stacks Academy video on gremlin does a good job of showing you real live examples so it kind of depends on which type of lawyer you are whether you're better at learning from a book or whether you're really better better if learning from watching alright but those are the places I would recommend starting and if I'm hearing you correctly it's also to then build and break something because that's also really how you're gonna learn oh absolutely because you're never gonna learn something just by reading a book until you actually go to or you never know that you know something until you actually go and try and build it cuz you'll learn so many things that you thought you knew but don't really didn't really grasp until you get to them hitting you in the face yeah and now kind of thinking about this a little bit more you mentioned specifically about kinda getting into some resources around data modeling and I hear you're writing a book on that I don't tell us about that that book and where are our listeners and Watchers can go find it yep absolutely yeah I'm actually in the process of writing a book called graph databases in action by many publications you can actually go get it right now it was just released this week in an early access preview no it's a huge a lot gonna work but I like to think of it is basically it's the relational developer's guide to building a graph based backed applications so the whole premise behind the book is to basically take someone with relational database skills walk them through the process of data modeling and query writing actually building an application and then actually performance tuning that application once you've started build something which is really it's kind of to model the flow of how you actually go about building an application there's lots of really good resources out there online currently about parts and pieces of that but there's not really anything that kind of tied it ties them all together in one kind of continuous flow okay that's fantastic now we want to get into it now because we could get into the topic of taking that app that you're building and putting into production do you have any quick advice that you would give for the dev team trying to make that happen sure we might as well get into it now I think that probably the best advice is get your operations and DevOps teams involved early and get them involved off and don't try and build something then all of a sudden throw it over the wall to them because operations on this is different than what they're used to you know they're very familiar with a sequel database and things like that they're not gonna be necessarily be familiar with graph databases and the different unique challenges those present so getting them involved early getting them involved often will really help them bring them up to speed as your development teams getting up to speed because you can't expect them to go from 0 to 100 much like you can't develop expect your application teams to go through are you sure I mean that seems so reasonable when you're saying yeah so thank you Dave so much for joining us here at data stacks and being on our global graph practice team and thank you all very much for watching this episode on the distributed data show live from Austin Texas at day to day of the inaugural global graphs of it",
