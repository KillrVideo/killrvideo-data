hello everyone so if you can hear us if you can see us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so we will know we can start and meanwhile hi patrick hi app hi michelle glad to see you all we have some people in the youtube chat already saying it's all good and that means that means what our meetup is starting right now i'm very happy to have you all here and i'm glad to introduce you to the attendees of this special meeting to us first patrick mcfadden hi patrick hey ellie yeah that's morning it's money uh yeah yeah you know normally i would travel for this this is what i was just sadly thinking about like i miss amsterdam yeah yeah i mean i did some really cool meetups in amsterdam we did one at a customs house it was like from like the 1600s and somebody had a a really cool it was a startup uh incubator and we did a meet-up there i mean i i love your skype it's really cool but you're just not even close not even close yeah definitely i mean skype is better than nothing but that's not even close and my talk in amsterdam last year it was a great time absolutely great time and a lot of friends in amsterdam uh but why we are speaking about amsterdam actually today what would you say people yeah uh what is that uh answer is simple today we have a special meet up because well we're talking about speak about cassandra exactly but uh not only about cassandra today we have a two great topics first of all or i would say like in the second part of the meetup patrick will uh say us a lot of interesting things about cassandra version 4 because it's in beta in beta 4 state and it's going to be released hopefully very soon but that's not the only topic we have today because in general finally data stocks is growing a lot specifically in netherlands and today we will we will ask our gentlemen in netherlands about how it goes for them and what are the plans and what are they going to do in the next few months and very interesting why did they decide to join data stocks to enforce our netherlands team so that's cassandra global meetup dedicated for netherlands that's a bit funny how world works in 21st century yeah indeed 2021 yeah exactly yeah so uh and so let me check it looks like everything is good golden meat duck good good and i think it's that's how how do you speak that golden meda good chance to learn uh dutch right on the cassandra global meetup but anyway we have to start and we start i want to ask some questions to our team today we have here i'm sorry app i have no idea how to pronounce your last name app well you give it a try why not well okay i would i would i would try to say it like hating yeah that's this girl coming close it's not too bad actually you know it's hiding you know you're doing a great job with that absolutely great and michelle the room and um oh that was an easy one yeah yeah well well you see i have some friends in netherlands so it wasn't so hard uh so first of all uh welcome to the team app hiding and michelle deru and prince jaspal we have today out of the screen sadly but anyway now we have a lot more people in this team and my first question is michelle you join it uh us recently and i've heard you are the most techie most into the technical questions from all the three gentlemen joining us recently what do you say about that and how is your background regarding these technology things yeah well you know it's very very simple i i've worked for in in data management distributed data management for about 15 years now i've worked with a lot of nosql technologies but unfortunately i up until three four months ago i never really worked with cassandra so you know i had a chat with somebody from from datastax he said to me yeah you know you should have a look at it and so finally i did and at i started working with it um i i did some investigation in terms of of the architecture you know and and it got me i just fell in love with the elegant architecture of cassandra you know it's the the the the architecture and it's well it's essentially it's in simplicity um it offers you so many so many good things um that are difficult to get with with a lot of other nosql technologies so yeah i started working with it i fell in love with it and here i am yeah yeah i understand you a lot as an engineer for me it's very important what technologies i work with of course and so i just can double what you say regarding this story it because it was well my story as well and um then i want to uh introduce app and app could you please tell us a little bit of words about what are you doing and what's your background and what are you going to do for at least a row yeah it's a good question so hello everybody you know i joined the datastax three weeks ago i am going to be uh working in the in the sales department focusing on what we call here cloud sales so where we are going to we have some exciting products cloud for products but we're going to launch even more interesting things in the future um so that's my role um and when you look at my background i've always been active in the in the microservice api management space and what really attracted me to to data stacks is the is the fact that uh you know with new products like stargate and also being able to run it on kubernetes make it very easy for developers to work with with cassandra seeing the company pivoting and pivoting that way it was for me a big trigger to join the company so that's that's insured me yeah great and uh from our side we can say what we are very happy to have you here all of you is great and i hope these bad times of everything's closed will uh end at some moment and we will meet finally again somewhere in the netherlands and maybe maybe in amsterdam maybe not there are a lot of great cities i would love to visit again and that's great so for all the people working in netherlands companies or nearby you now have some more people to contact and chat about different possibilities and options everything regarding apache cassandra and data stacks enterprise and especially data stacks astra our beloved from one of the most beloved projects we have at this moment so whatever you might find important for you you may get some people to chat with and hey patrick you you looks like oh he is not sleeping what's time at your place it should be pretty early oh it's seven o'clock in the morning it's not that bad yeah i mean no sun is starting to come up so whatever you're seeing right now i'm just getting a little bit up so but it happens every day so we're okay so i set my clock by it i i'm a night bird so for me like 7 00 a.m sounds pretty bad but i glad you liked it at our i can't work with people in europe and and sleep in it's just impossible my day usually starts at 7am just so i can talk to somebody in central european time you know what as we are speaking about people joining data stocks at the first day when i decided to accept the offer a good offer from datastax it was like two years and something to go uh maybe two and a half i say i told to my wife what uh the moment you start to work for an american company original american now international it's just a question of time when you will get a phone call in 3 a.m and that happened the very next night it's gonna happen yeah exactly but this is how it works and then later today at like five o'clock my time i'll be on the phone with people in australia and new zealand so i mean it's just living in a global community oh that's right yeah our database doesn't go down and neither do we available all the time so uh patrick patrick uh you know what um we have been waiting for cassandra version 4 for how many years about a hundred i think i no 2015 was when we released 3.0 and yeah it was a freaking long time ago but um the it's worth the wait i think that um it was interesting because i was talking to some folks last night about the pending release and if you look at what's been done in cassandra 4.0 and this hasn't been part of the presentation but um it's it's a mature database now and this is really a this is a grown-up moment for a database that's 10 years old when you're trusting a database that is your your database of record that i would say almost every bank in the world uses you have to think about a database in a different way and you can't release a database um no no it's not like nothing's happened in the project i mean we're up to 3.11 in uh in the main branch and you know it's pretty stable as it is and very and somewhat bug free but 4.0 is a significant shift and i'm going to show you um because it's you think of like the companies that use it this it runs their business apple huawei netflix ing has a big presence there too i mean i'm just thinking of all the people that i've worked with over time walmart in the u.s target in the u.s it's just this is what it is and you can't release a database based on a marketing schedule like well we should have a release because we're having a user conference next month no we're not doing that um and this is a bit of a preview but the reason the reason it will be released is when all of the largest contributors agree that it is ready for production and they're running it in production and who do you think was the biggest contributor to the version 4 i've heard different versions i've heard what apple did really a lot of work to release version 4. i've seen some noticeable changes and interesting proposals from instagram and also i know what netflix as usual netflix did a haystack of work and did a lot of improvements so who do you think made the biggest impact to a version four uh the contributors to consent yeah yeah i mean but no you can't say it was a single company because um i mean over that many years um you know and and the contributor core of database uh cassandra database um you know there's 30 plus contributors that come from all sorts of companies including the wikimedia foundation and apple and data stacks and insta cluster and um but here's the thing that's funny is like these contributors have moved around like some of these people were working at data stacks now they're working at apple you know some worked at you know different companies and so to say like which company contributed the most that's it's not a company this is not a company's product this isn't a project and it's a bunch of very dedicated individuals who have found companies that align with their worldview which is i want to work on this really freaking amazing database can you pay me to do that and we have really great companies that are willing to do that like facebook like netflix you know that and that's really cool that's what makes this project really yeah i agree exactly i'm very happy to see it not as a competition but more of a teamwork even across the companies but pretty often compete at some points uh some parts of a market but still developing something together that's great yeah no i talk to people that are quote unquote competitors all the time and we just take that hat off when we talk about cassandra um it's just not that's that's not important it's if if cassandra is the most useful popular uh well-used database in the world then we'll all be okay you know we're not going to lock it down and say it's oh no it's only data stacks as a database leave us alone that didn't work out for some companies oh yeah yeah yeah such a story uh one more question i know what there is at least one a production use case for cassandra version 4 already and you know whom i mean uh their story we discussed it recently yeah yeah i've been talking to a lot of folks that are running 4.00 yeah okay so i know only one success story maybe you share with us something about that so there are people using cassandra version 4 which is in beta 4 state already in production so what would you say about that uh well the the the last remaining uh critical bug is this is what i i mean it's an open source project so you can go see what's broke um the the last remaining bug out there that is critical that needs to get fixed before we go into rc is the group by clause can return deleted data so if you're not using group by then you shouldn't be running into any nasty bugs the rest of the tickets that are in 4.0 are around uh testing that isn't completing properly this is one of the the goals of the project management committee is that all of the tests will pass with green lights or at least work um no more flaky tests in the project so that's been it doesn't show that the database is broken it shows that the tests aren't right and they want to make sure they're correct before we ship 4.0 but uh so if you're if you're interested in running 4.0 in production um you know it's a beta just be aware but i'd say you're pretty safe right now um and if anything try it in staging to see how it works against your production workload the companies i'm talking to now uh they are pleasantly surprised how easy it was to upgrade that's also been one of the things in the project but also just a performance increase that's happened over the simplification of the code path and um you'll see i i'll i'll cover a lot of things that you'll be interested in but uh it's been pretty smooth okay so uh now we are about to start cassandra version 4 presentation done by patrick mcfadden and afterwards we are going to have some time uh to answer questions if we will have any in the youtube chat i hope we will so uh don't hesitate to ask your questions that's a rare chance you may get them answered but by best of the best experts and for cassandra we always have something to say regarding the team there are not only four people at the screen as you see but much more people answering questions in the youtube chat and i think uh patrick we are ready to start i feel like yeah yeah i mean i'm going to switch to yours if you are ready let's let's really start no no start start like start start start okay so i'm switching all right let me start sharing let's do the awkward this is like you know changing out your laptop whenever you do a live presentation so awkward there you go yeah there you go so looks good it looks better when i get into it all right so uh i think this this seems like the right deck you never know but cassandra 4.0 yeah um reliable elastic fastest why not um so we we know that cassandra if you're new to cassandra this is the one slide that says you should get to know it better um it's not a new database by any stretch but uh it's been around for a while for good reason it started in an era that data was the biggest problem in scaling and that's actually when i got involved and when we were trying to make uh applications work on a fast growing population of people using applications on the internet such as mobile applications and web applications the thing that kept failing was our database and take it from me i ran oracle for so many years but oracle ran right up until you ran out of money and uh that was a problem so we we as a large group of technical people who can't sit still decided that we needed new databases to to address the problem that we had created and cassandra was a part of that so um this is this is how i i this is my origin story for cassandra's it was it was born of need it wasn't uh an interesting project that somebody came up with because they it would just seem like a good idea no this was really like it started at facebook the two guys that did it uh avinash prakash were trying to solve a problem at facebook and the message inbox and they did and they graduated in the apache foundation and was picked up by a lot of companies along the way and um it's because it wasn't because they were board engineers it was because those companies had scale problems and those early adopters have paved the way for everybody to have to be able to use a database that will take the largest scale loads in the world and i'm very confident when i say there is no database that has this much of an importance now in 2021 it's we're running the world's largest workloads period um so this is this is the awkward slide like yeah 2015 we did 3.0 and um this path to 4.0 as i mentioned earlier is it has been a um an interesting one and really important for the it's a mature part of this project um the arguments the debates the the a lot of what's happened in the project are really good for seeing this this go to the next 10 years you know we got to the 10-year mark and it's like the database isn't kind of an adolescent phase and we're moving on but we're firming up what it means to have a release and this is the first one that's really about stability first only and then features second and um so when you look at the path to 4.0 alex turn off your mic this is what happens when you do stuff live and plus you get the clickiest keyboard what is that like a razor yeah very clicky yeah my son has that razor keyboard and when he's playing games i can hear him like so far away um but so we're all the features are frozen and cassandra right now so you should not expect any changes at all other than stability and uh we're at beta 4 right now we will be on rc pretty quickly i think and release candidate it means that this is what we think is going to be the final unless we find something horrible and how do we find something horrible testing people trying it out in in their environments and giving feedback to the project this is a this is my first appeal to you as a contributor do you want to contribute to cassandra this is a great way to contribute right now um we need people looking at it um so what's going on three versus four it wasn't like it just it was just slow because no one was working on it i mean the amount of work that's gone into 4.0 is pretty substantial just in bug fixes um and they aren't just all devastating data loss bugs they're just little tiny things here and there and it's because of the amount of testing that has happened with 4.0 i i can't reiterate this more there are i think three separate sub projects now in the cassandra project that do with different kinds of testing fuzz testing destruction testing load testing and like destruction and fuzz testing are very difficult there's a project called harry which is now in the in the project which just does these ridiculous things to data but it it finds little weird problems that you never would think of until it hit you in production one day and distributed test databases are tough they're hard to work with sometimes and um getting the right kind of tool to give us the the assurance that it's going to store your data and not lose it that's a that is almost as important as the database itself because we need to have the confidence to use it and like i said if the world is running on cassandra we should make sure that it's doing that so what's new um mostly this is an update uh this release has been focused on the people that are running cassandra the operators and um you know i've heard a few developers say well there's not a lot of sexy stuff for developers not a lot really uh except for it's not gonna fail you and that's really cool but you know it's it's like security is so uncool right until you get a breach and then that's the coolest thing you've ever heard right um but what i'm gonna go walk through some of the things and if you have run a cassandra cluster before you know some of these problems so uh first and foremost and i think this is the one that everyone loves to hear about is repair process and repair of course is if you're new to cassandra that is the process it's not like fixing it it is it's the anti-entropy repair which is basically going through the entire cluster to make sure that this distributed data set is consistent and which is tough in a large scale system if you're running across multiple data centers and thousands of nodes it's potentially gonna you're gonna lose some data somewhere for whatever reason maybe you know a bit gets dropped somewhere um this is what makes sure that your data across all of that is is solid however that process has always been very tricky for operators and so now what we have is where instead of you know this has been the thing it's like people say oh i want to run repair but it just it's like the worst possible thing you can do it just it it hurts because there's all these little things you have to think about and sometimes there was these weird failure modes and it's just just been a perpetual issue with cassandra we finally had some a group uh at a couple of companies that decided to just figure this out and have have redone so much in repair um you know it's wrapped in this transaction now so if there is a failure at any point it could it can re restart where it left off so incremental repairs are better all that control is there and then the same defaults when this was the thing about repair for that i think bothered a lot of uh cassandra dbas was that when you run repair it you have to make adjustments immediately the same defaults were not probably going to work for you now i think out of the box it should work just fine and if you're interested in out of process and having better control over it we also have cassandra reaper which is a part of the project as well uh virtual tables um this is my personal i finally got this in i've been trying to get virtual tables i i've done a talk at the next generation cassandra conference which is a committer conference um i probably did like three years in a row about adding virtual tables um one of the things i really missed from the or my oracle days was being able to use sql to query the state of the database to get to the data tables or to any kind of data around the meta information about the database you had to use this thing called gmx and if you've ever used gmx i'm sorry you probably spit on the ground just now i apologize it's horrible right it's java management expansion extensions um no one wants to run it anymore it's just it's just an arcane way of getting to your uh metadata but um what what virtual tables do is they expose the metrics inside of your database as a as a table just that and it seems like such a simple thing but it took a lot of reworking on how to how cassandra works i'm really happy that it's here finally um so whenever like for instance uh in the systems uh in the systems key space now you can say like what uh what key spaces do i have and then what like what kind of information can i get from them and so i i think this is this is going to open up the door for a lot of really cool integrations and for sure it's going to make it a lot easier for people who are running cassandra clusters to just get some information without having to install configure secure jmx you can just get a cql shell and ask the system what's going on um what's coming in like the system views that are out there these are read-only for now um this is what's here for 4.0 there's already issues and jira is in there for doing updates as well so if you want to change what cassandra is doing you can use virtual table so that would be an insert or update into a virtual table to change the way that a runtime cassandra works um that is an obvious next step and i think it's the reason we didn't add it to 4.0 is just because all right when we did the feature freeze we're like look let's just start with a read that's a good start um and writing to the database will change some things um for security we now have this and this is again one of the things that came out of a lot of users needing the same thing which is full query logging and audit logging the full query logging the fql it finds itself right in the middle of the query manager so it is right there it can pull those queries right out of the stream um it's the same mechanism for both systems it's very lightweight so one of the things that i anytime i see any kind of an issue or jira that's raised around the right path for the database um or even the read path the right path i'm very i'm very uh protective of i get nervous because the one of the things i really love about cassandra is the simplicity of how it works you can it fits and it doesn't take phd in computer science to figure out um when we start adding things into the right path it starts adding weird latencies and contingencies oh you have to do this or that i don't like that this does a really good job of lightly touching what happens it creates a sidecar for that data but it gives you access into everything that was sent to the database and so if you want to do for full query logging um you get the exact query strings for everything and that that can be helpful whenever you're doing troubleshooting or you want to replay uh you want to store workloads and then replay them that's actually one of the things that's being done quite a bit in the 4.0 testing that's happening now is all right let's run a workload against it and then continue to run that workload against it using the fql of full query logging it's it's not just a text file and there's a tool that comes with this this fql tool which you can export out the data the audit logging it takes a little more on the security side of that so instead of just dumping all of the queries into a into a binary file um you can you can do like auditing on different like i want to make sure that i know who's doing what and when this is probably this is very entry level for anyone that's involved in security in databases um if you work at a financial services company you know that audit logging is an absolute must you have to have it and what it allows you to do is is be more selective on all of the options that you want um so you can look at just a little bit or you can look a lot and this is a big part of i think it will be a big part of security for cassandra going forward um so you can you can look at the different like if you just want to see uh audits say for instance on dml like um the all the update delete batch or sql update delete batch operations great no problem or if you want to just see the changes of key spaces and tables um you can do that as well um there there's just a lot of these um if like i think the probably one that's going to be used a lot is like error like logging a cqs cql request failure so um if your developers are sending bad queries into the system you can have it log those which is probably going to be pretty handy for folks that are working with developer teams and um you know you get that email your database is broken and you go into the error log and find out that they just keep doing the wrong query over and over again yeah i see i was a dba i know you get that moment of being superior it's like you just don't know how to use my database that's the problem um so new and improved features that not beyond that but some of the things that will affect not just operators but developers as well the change data capture uh this is another one that i've been really not happy with for a long time i there was two camps on change data capture in the cassandra project and i was on the losing camp for a long time but but i'm not bitter i'm not bitter um but change data capture is another critical feature for modern databases in a nutshell what that means is when you commit changes to the database it it emits that change in some sort of a stream and think about those moments like you want to send an alert this is one of my uh nest the thermostat company was one of the originators of the change data capture feature in cassandra and what they wanted was when a a temperature event went to the database say like a high temperature event like i want to trigger on a certain temperature well instead of having it go into a streaming system that would then send an alert and not get committed to the database and the reason was they had this just-in-time problem they wanted to make sure if someone pulled up their application their nest application that if they got an alert and then they go look at the temperature on their app that the temperature on in the database was what got alerted on so database commit to the database then emit it and send an alert that was the order they wanted it in and it i think it makes sense if you think about how uh events work in databases like this and so change data capture um has had the initial implementation had some really weird um i'm not gonna say weird um had some problematic uh features that had to be dealt with like dealing with um with duplicate data and what happens if you have a repair process running this is going to be a lot better and there's more improvements coming and it's just because this is i think this is just a a very basic feature for a modern database to have and so this is a lot of focus on this feature um what do you uh and things that you can do with it like we already have a like a kafka source connector that will emit it into a kafka topic um there are things out we have data sex labs we have some some test code around it that you could try out and then there's even a project out there that shows an example but um it's i think it's also gonna you're gonna see it just become a part of a lot of other projects like kate sandra the faster bootstrap in streaming has there's a lot of reasons this is the case and primarily so just kind of quick review to bootstrap to add new nodes to an existing cassandra cluster is an online operation so when you add a node to the system you don't have to take it down which was actually one of the first features i really loved about cassandra because i was tired of getting up at 3am to mess with my database i wanted to do it during the day this is one of the key cool features about cassandra is you can take away and add nodes in the middle of the day no problem but that operation requires moving data at a significant amount sometimes and when we look at node sizes like how big a node can be this is one of the big considerations is like how long does it take to bootstrap it and if you look at the larger operators out there like the apples and huawei's and netflix they they optimize around how fast we can recover if we lose an entire data center or an entire rack of equipment you know this is what the database is built to do it will hold up to that you can lose infrastructure but eventually you're going to have to replace it or move it to something else and then there's just the the load the elastic part of building a database the elastic meaning you can grow it and shrink it quickly critical right there are plenty of use cases where you want to have load ready for you you know if there's like some sort of a surge like a black friday event cyber monday boxing day there's all these different events in the world where basically we want people to buy a lot of stuff and that generates a ton of load well during that moment you want a lot more services online and after you want to spin them down so what makes all that work really well well it's moving data and how how efficient that is one of the things that are really important is the zero copy streaming and what it is is it allows for faster bootstrapping through some really cool tricks and it um it just moves data faster basically at wire speed um so it's moving entire files instead of like here's one piece of data and another one and another that's just ridiculous um the thing about cassandra which really is interesting from a architecture standpoint is the data files are all immutable they should be able to be moved and you can so it just takes advantage of that fact inside of the database there are just in easy testing that we've done in growing clusters it's like five times faster on bootstrap and bootstrap is when you add a new node to the system and the better mean time to recovery better elasticity all those things are there because we've and zero copy streaming is just one of them there's a lot of things around that um another one that is this idea of client back pressure uh a wonderful feature and horrible thing about data cassandra the database is that you can you can kill it with a client and it will take it will do everything it can to stay online except tell the client to knock it off it will just keep going and it's it's great i mean uh it's it's you know for some cases i've seen i've seen cassandra databases just absolutely destroyed and still running and it's because of the client you know there was not enough nodes to run the load that they put against it but the database did its best but um i think as dbas wake up to that feature they're like can we not allow this thing to drive off a cliff so client back pressure huge this is a big win for dbas everywhere um have a have a coffee or have a beer on me this is a good one because what this allows and it's intelligent about the way that it does this is as as the data is being pushed into the database the database and the clients start talking to each other and it's when the database is like look i can't do if you want me to do this you're gonna have to slow down that's basically what's happening um and it's not just a hard stop there's a lot going on there and there's a really good blog post about how this works um you know i think the easy way would be like oh you know rate limit chopped off and then all these clients get cut off and then you start getting these timeouts on your client no this isn't how this works but um you get you start getting exceptions that actually mean something when you get too many inbound messages this is going to be i think a big win for operators because it's going to give you more control over the terrible things your developers will do to you it does have a pretty important impact on performance and this is this is what we know just as large scale operators out there is that when you when you're queuing and being efficient it it actually makes the database more performant because it's not trying to fight fires the whole time we we've done a lot of testing with this and it does a really good job i mean the the uh if you look at like the difference between like overall read operations for instance and you can see that there's a blue line up there and then the latency uh uh is also much better it's just because it's allowing the database to stay healthy and communicate with the client and that's that's a good thing we want the database to be healthy because that's the most important part of your whole infrastructure trust me um the workload capture um this is uh i mentioned earlier about the fql the full query logging um guess what we we figured out a use for it already so um this is really helpful i think this will be a big deal for especially for um more cloud native uh operations like if you're using kubernetes and declarative infrastructure you think about your ci cd pipeline and how you build out your infrastructure and your continuing you use your continuous integration well you're probably going to want to run that against workloads that are real as you as you change your code as you add new features um workload capture is a big deal and it allows you to capture real-time stuff like what's going on in your production workload um and let you replay it and i think this is like i said stay tuned because um as dbas everywhere wake up to like oh i can do this and it's important i think you're gonna see some really cool uh discussion point like maybe meetups and if it and if you do it we would love to have you on a meetup um and talks at the cassandra summit or at the uh yeah the sanders summit at the apache apache conference about hey here's how i continuously test my database in production it's really cool um and then of course this is what everybody wants to know about well it's new is it faster well yes it is but it's not just the database performance as much as everything that is a part of cassandra operations and i'll start out with compaction uh again for those of you that are new compaction is a really critical process in cassandra um it's what uh when we pour data into the database uh the way that it the the architecture works is that it stores it into a mem table first and flushes that mem table to disk in a single file called an ss table which then has to be it's immutable so as you build out more of those there's a process called compaction and compaction reads multiple multiple files those immutable files into memory merge sorts and then rewrites that file back out to the file system that compaction process is heavy but it's also very predictable huge improvements in how it works and it's one of the things that if compaction is super efficient and better then it's going to make your whole cluster healthier and this is what we've got um we we've we've seen some really important um i think some great improvements there and i think everyone's going to be who's run cassandra in the past is going to be pretty pleasantly surprised and if you're new to cassandra you won't you won't get the compaction jokes anymore they just won't exist anymore um java 11 um it's uh java 11 i know that's not exactly new but uh the the standard for cassandra had been jdk8 and of course jdk8 is dead now and it was long gone it'll go back into the the annals of java history but um what we're looking you know for four is running on java 11. now i know everyone's already talking about java 17 because it has some really cool stuff in it but java 11 is is going to be the baseline before uh until further notice and so we looked at how to optimize for some of the features that are built into job 11. and of course when you talk about java you're talking about the one thing that everybody wants to talk about that nobody really wants to talk about which is garbage collection and um the standard the concurrent market sweep the cms that you know if you're using cms still um you should think differently but uh g1 gc was a you know a newer option as of several years ago but now we have these new things zgc and shenandoah and so we did some testing and um so alex he did this great blog post um it's on the last piccolo website um it it really just out of the box java 11 brings about 25 improvement throughput and latency latency is a key one um the the and then i'm going to put a big asterisk on this is if you're going to use some of the newer garbage collection schemes like zgc and shenandoah be really really careful about your workloads and the reason being is these are new and we saw some really cool stuff so i'm gonna show the here's the big slide that everyone's gonna like lean into their screen on like a picture with numbers um the the thing about jdka is thank god it's gone because it just didn't perform very well in this case but um and java is already a very performant language i i have to remind everyone you know you see like oh well if it was written in rust or in c plus plus it's got to be faster not really um java is just as performing as either those languages in a lot of workloads and especially in the type of workloads that we use in a distributed system so that's really not as big of a problem and i also want to reiterate um cassandra not fast enough is probably not going to be your problem just going to put that out there it's going to be fast enough for most people these are these are numbers that make nerds excited because it's better but i think that when you when you look at the incremental changes um cassandra is still a pretty awesome database even if you're using jdk8 so i'm just going to make sure i put out that disclaimer so anyhow back to you what this is about um there were some pretty significant improvements in how jdk 11 with shenandoah and zgc work um i and this is just uh how many you know the throughput operations um there are some caveats though so if you look at like wow you know if you get into p99 latency shenandoah looks amazing um and it it it has a lot of promise but there are certain workloads that it just doesn't seem to want to work with very well and we're still as a as a project as a community we're going to figure out what those mean and what's happening in in jdk 17 may actually solve a lot of those problems as well um you know there's this is turning into the problem that the java project or is that a project the the java community wants to solve once and for all but i mean these latency numbers are pretty compelling uh shenandoah is very cool in a lot of ways but you know i'm gonna just pause right here remember test it in your own production environment it may not work for you the way that you think um we the if you look at the blog post we go into extreme detail or alex went into stream detail about how the test was run and what the test criteria were you want to make sure that you look at those compare it against your workload and if it's different then test test test and then most important thing about cassandra community share share your information we all benefit when you do that so what's next all right so now that we're pretty much wrapping up 4.0 what's after that um well 4.1 obviously and 5.0 there's already a lot of things starting to pile up for what's after 4.0 and it's really cool um one of the things in the project that has been discussed quite a bit is the this opportunity once we get to a certain baseline with 4.0 think of it as like a long-term support uh release it's a stable we know it's a known good stable you know baseline for increasing the amount of features and the changes that need to happen to cassandra especially around cloud native workloads um i think you're gonna see some really cool stuff there there's a process we have it's called cassandra enhancement proposal cep and they're already some really cool ceps out there um right now we have uh just like on kubernetes side um that's a big one we we've been talking about this thing called the storage attach index that's a donation from data stacks it's essentially a replacement for uh what is in um it's a replacement for uh secondary indexing and it is very efficient and works very well um as a matter of fact we all already have uh it's already running in data stacks astra right now so if you want to use it today you can um so but we're donating to the project that'll be a big one i think and that'll move quickly some of the other ones that are in draft right now and yeah you can see it in here joins yep that's probably going to happen and uh explain plans we can have a query planner and then guard rails which i think uh takes that that you know the the client back pressure to the next level which is uh guardrails are things like being able to restrict certain operations on the database like you can only add so many indexes to a table or you can do so many operations per second or it's just this is giving operators an opportunity to restrict certain things that they know their developers are going to kill them on so it's it's just more of a thing for operators to help you do your job better so we have we really want to get into this better cadence and this is actually why we got this testing thing in such a really weird place like like why is this such a big deal and it's because of this um we want to get into a regular cadence um kubernetes is a big part of the project now if you're not if you haven't seen anything with kate sandra i invite you to do that today um it's gaining traction and speed very quickly um i do a uh once every two weeks i do a uh we do a sig a special interest group meeting um it rotates the time rotates but if you if you're interested in that just you could there's a cassandra kubernetes slack channel on the asf slack just come meet us over there and you can join in um we have a lot of really cool stuff happening on the front end with the stargate project it's usability usability usability on a stable database so um again cassandra keith sandra dot io i invite you to go check it out if you're trying to run casino kubernetes we want to make sure this is the way to do this and it's uh it's a project that is gathering knowledge as code and it's you know for dbas to sre this is really an important thing to gather that information so that when someone comes along and wants to run cassandra kubernetes they just have an easy way of doing it um it adds some really cool stuff like being able to automatically gather metrics and dump them into prometheus and uh grafana dashboards and with stargate we're starting to add these really useful apis to cassandra which is graphql rest a document api others are coming so i think this is what i did the future of usability is going to be about building services with cassandra so if you're an operator you're probably going to provide these services to your developers and this is what we have i the the whole the whole idea of stargate is it really it's it's in addition to cassandra so it's why it's i think this is a really important project for the pro a project for the cassandra project is that it's adding ecosystem to already a really great running database without having to massively change cassandra um so that is it hopefully i got through everything i needed to alex oh yeah am i still online no no no have i been talking to nobody for a while it's so hard without an audience yeah it's so much easier when you do it on site with a live audience and yeah this that's very different with skype but anyway has said better than nothing patrick thank you so much it was great and very informative as cassandra version 4 gets closer and closer to the general availability and more and more people are interested i see so many materials dedicated to version 4 actually i did my own talk regarding cassandra version for new things and improved things and that's very interesting to see how people see the same topic but from the very different points of views that's incredible that's how community works so we have something special before michelle will proceed with some interesting points from his side we want to run our favorite game meant a quiz to have you answering questions but not for nothing but to win some swag so there is a competition and we kindly invite you to join us and it's going to be mendy.com and you can use code 6839010 to enter the competition and win some swag from data stocks if you answer fast enough if you give right answers you will win some prizes and jack jack fryer could you please tell us in youtube comments what do we have now for the winners so while you are joining you can simply use this qr code and you can use this code on the left side next to me and patrick 6839010 jump into the quiz and win prizes before we will proceed oh yeah best cassandra t-shirts swag box with stickers t-shirts and so on and you know what we have few dozens of people today so it's going to be a rough competition but some people still will be able to win some prizes and today we have three top places getting the prizes and we are about to start so i hope you jumped in already and to warm up and make you familiar with mandy before we start uh let's answer some questions before we quiz so now no hurry just tell us some things where are you joining us from today that's very interesting uh glasgow interest curious india to know more about cassandra seattle bangalore east coast netherlands samson hofdorp nice new jersey youtube that's pretty great and i'm happy to see people around the world personally i'm located in uh west part of germany uh patrick i never can remember the name of a place you are located in uh what was that california i've heard something that's a tiny uh quiet place nothing happens uh very cold yeah something like that yeah it's it's nothing happened here no i live in a little town called windsor which is just like where the queen lives in england so she's your neighbor but from the other side of the ocean yeah it's yeah exactly just like okay an app michelle uh you live in netherlands or yeah correct to live in the netherlands and live in a small town called elsia between arnhem and neymar if oh yeah i know this area not so bad uh actually uh very many years ago with a great uh strategic game uh call it market garden and oh yeah so i know geography of your area are almost as good as their my uh homeland yeah okay nice yeah and michelle yeah i love live close nearby amsterdam okay great i i you you were talking just before about uh getting some drinks and beers when it's possible again um you know i i'd love to do that in amsterdam with you guys looking forward to that great great okay so next question how much experience do you have with apache cassandra that's a big question well less than one year one to three years three five years never used it okay anyone two people more than five years that's already getting better for those who never used cassandra our quiz may be a little bit too hard but i have a special offer exactly for you we have an upcoming introduction to cassandra workshop happening actually fix me if i'm wrong tomorrow yes tomorrow at all one hour later from now on tomorrow we have introduction to cassandra workshop where we will speak a basics about this extremely powerful distributed decentralized database so jump in and opt-in for tomorrow as a result you will get not only priceless knowledge but also something very special data stacks sponsored free certification for as an apache cassandra developer or administrator usually it costs like around 150 dollars i believe or something like that but data stock sponsors your voucher for this certification so you can learn and get the certificate get certified for free which is amazing and that's pretty nice distribution thank you for joining next question are you attending for personal development or business projects reasons okay i i know i find this question hard to answer because i'm here basically for both okay so that's mostly more often personal than business but whatever your reason is that's good enough already to join our workshops and meanwhile you see these uh gentlemen on the right part of your screen of those gentlemens michelle and app and directly under them there is a subscribe button and as you stayed with us for so long that's definitely a good moment to push this subscribe button right now and we are switching to the quiz now i get one thing youtube has a little bit delay so if you uh watch youtube first and then answer a question you are going to be in the lan end of the list and no way you will win something but i want you to win so what you better focus to is open this mendy.com with this code at your mobile phone and answer questions watching your mobile phone screen this will eliminate the youtube latency okay are you ready warm up your fingers warm up your head and let's start because we are getting some quiz competition and swag and my first question is and you have to answer fast to get more points how many masternodes does cassandra require at least three enough to maintain consistency known cassandra is a masterless system seriously why are you making me think so how many master nodes does cassandra require and time is up and i can't wait to see results oh my god so take a look we have people at least 10 people or even i would say 12 people who gave the wrong answer that man that means you absolutely must attend our tomorrow's workshop so correct answer is cassandra decentralized master-led system no single point of failure no master nodes required because there are no master nodes at all and let me see the leaderboard who was the fastest a lot of quick answers a very minor delay like couple of points in some questions and dr centipede was the fastest one with vroom on the second place and sheriff on the third but you know what that's only first question so everything goes going to change very soon when question number second question number two and answer fast to get more points is cassandra 4-0 ready for production yes no testing testing testing testing there is no simple answer to this question because well some people are you people are using that on production and they are pretty happy and time is up and some people answer it yes and some people answer it no but the correct answer is testing testing testing it means what cassandra is in beta 4 state it's going to be in general availability soon but not yet so it was surprisingly hard question [Music] cedric like t-shirts got the first place this time again fastest answer hey who is that yeah i know cedric likes teacher like t-shirts vroom holds the second place and eddie beth get to the third and that's very good and we proceed question three and i hope we will see a lot of more more correct answers this time how do you scale a cassandra database how complicated this project process is increase the scale factor stack nodes until we reach the desired have add more nodes add faster hardware so that's a tricky one at least for the beginners if you attended one of our workshops you will make it easy oh wow how come yeah last question was easier but now almost everyone answer it correctly there is a pants person answer it faster hardware no no no no no cassandra scales horizontally it means you add more commodity hardware over than vertical scaling with more and more expensive hardware we prefer horizontal scaling it's more efficient for distributed systems so correct answer is add more notes and let me see who was the fastest hey cedric how could you [Laughter] okay vroom was the fastest getting to the first place replacing the cedric well cedric will not get any t-shirt anyway don't worry uh vroom mark and eddie bet on the third place so and we are getting to the fourth question we are getting closer to the end answer fast to get more points how do you define a proper cassandra data model okay this one will be hard with both application workflow and entities you create entities and association tables create entities and indexes what is a data model if you don't know what's the data model then you definitely when we had definitely have something for you we have data model and advanced data model but i see what most of you attended our data modeling workshops already and the correct answer is with both application workflow and entities that's right and with entities and indexes its name and go not going to be a proper cassandra data model so i suggest you to watch our data modeling and advanced data modeling workshops they are available at these data stacks devs channel and finally leaderboard before well oh my god vroom and markup both made a mistake such a cheese okay flores gets to the first place flores that was a thin chance but you got it so and tony on the second and eddie bed holds the third place okay and rakesh uh follows them with a pretty small difference of around 70 points that's not a lot good so now we see five people who made no mistake flores tony eddie rakesh and prakash but only free person will get the prizes and that's a final question ladies and gentlemen question number five answer fast a cassandra database can be deployed on aws only any combination of on-premise and cloud providers only one of the following on-premise cloud life raft in the case of emergency now i'm curious okay so most of you answer it correctly cassandra can be deployed on the any combination of on-premise and cloud providers at the same time working together that's how cassandra cluster works it's completely platform agnostic and you can run it everywhere combine united and working together and that was the final question and now we see the final leaderboard and flores made the mistake oh my god i haven't seen such such a show such a competition for for a long time actually so rakesh moria i hope i pronounced it right made it to the first place the 4462 points and tony gets it to the second place and at the bet still holds the third one such a precise work with difference only with one point that's like one microsecond to the second place so that's incredible we congratulate rakesh tony and eddie uh we have jack fryer our great guy community manager in the youtube chat and i guess he's typing his email right now please contact him and we will agree how we send you swag boxes with our gray t-shirts and some of the other things and just few more questions before we proceed this year is going to be great for us we have a lot of plans but before we execute for them we want to ask you something about that what do you want to hear about next we have some great projects you already know cassandra workshop series we are doing regularly everything what relates to cassandra mostly for beginners and intermediate we have cassandra global meetup regarding more advanced technologies and talks done from people all around the world best cassandra uh experts from different companies we have data stacks mandel learning speaking about ava and other hot technologies clouds containerization serverless and so on so basically you are very free in the decision on what do you want to hear next more about cassandra what is astra lightweight transactions in cassandra version 4 does psi replacement for data duplication interesting real real deep dive cassandra internals oh i'm with you on that definitely astra yeah that makes sense cassandra on azure well best cassandra on azure is astra i think but um i know not everyone will agree with me stargate data model on time series data model on time series i see this question we have a special data model on time series story we on the advanced data models scenarios on uh what was the name in our data stocks dot com slash dev we have a special story on data model on time series data so you definitely want to check this out it will help you on how do you develop time series data and how do you maintain time series data okay complex data models it's easy to think about text block examples but hearing about real big models would be cool especially the learning paths that's partially relates to the advanced data model we were speaking recently patrick singing hey patrick there are some people who want to hear you singing next time do you think we can run a special event on that uh we might be able to do that yeah do some distributed systems singing like you know it's like hey everybody welcome to the distributed data show now i'm not gonna do that so something with the dars something yeah i know it it just seems like really a bad idea and whoever said it should be banned from this channel okay so uh great and thank you for answers i will store them and we will discuss that next hour planning meeting so we will see what we can do to answer them and i have one more question so now we are happy to ask uh michelle to proceed so i would like to ask you to share your screen please so we can switch to your story yeah so alex actually maybe just an idea here um you know i i i've been living all my life in the netherlands and i know the dutchies bit uh quite well actually i think um you know they like to get their supper around five okay evening so you know what i would like to propose is um you know maybe we should uh postpone my part of the presentation uh do that next time uh you know one of my goals here as one of the newbies data stacks here in the netherlands is i want to really reach out to the community you know there are so much that from each other there are so many experiences that we can share with each other yeah and this is the first uh this is our first um yeah meet up since a while and i'm really really happy with all the help that we got from from the organization from you guys from patrick and you know we will be doing this more often so what i propose is let's plan a new meetup um and let's uh let's do my part of the presentation then um because i think it is uh it's it's uh it's interesting uh there are interesting topics in there uh patrick talked a lot about uh about cassandra itself cassandra fordow and i think that there are three pillars to success when using technology and that is of course the technology it has to be trusted technology but also in terms of operations it has to be easy and in terms of developer use it has to be easy and those are the topics that i would like to talk about in my next presentation so yeah what do you think yeah great that sounds great to me we are out of time already anyway yeah plan yeah looking forward to it yeah okay that was my promise it's my promise to the community um we'll plan a new meetup and there will be a lot more after that also so i really hope to be able to engage with all of you guys yeah great okay then so thank you patrick thank you app thank you michelle and that was a great time together i'm happy to have so many people and most of all thank you to all the attendees of today's meetup we will have more and more of that and we invite you to join us for all the upcoming events join and subscribe our channel on youtube catch us at discord and see you next time tomorrow that's incredible i love to say it i want to say it again see you again tomorrow thank you everyone see you again soon bye-bye thanks all have bye-bye room no more formats to [Music] change [Music] oh [Music] foreign",
