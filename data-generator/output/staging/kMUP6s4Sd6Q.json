We call this the application workflow. This is necessary so we know which queries to perform against our Apache Cassandra database. Learn more about the application workflow in this unit.\n\nLEARN FOR FREE at https://academy.datastax.com -- access all the FREE complete courses, tutorials, and hands-on exercises.\n\nASK QUESTIONS at https://community.datastax.com -- where experts from DataStax & the Apache Cassandra community share their expertise everyday.",
