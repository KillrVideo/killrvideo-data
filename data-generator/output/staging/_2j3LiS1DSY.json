    "text": "[Applause] [Music] hello my name is tomaszlek and i will guide you through the java frameworks compare project in the data stacks examples repository let's see what we will learn in this video first we will set up the project that is available under the provided github link next we'll connect various java frameworks such as spring micronaut quarkus and helidone to datastax astra cloud finally when everything is up and running we'll make a performance comparison of the compile time startup time and memory usage of these frameworks let's start by cloning the project using git clone at the data stacks examples java framework compare once we downloaded the project please open it in the ide we will be using the data stacks astra cloud so please make sure you have the instance up and running i have the free marks compare instance already up and running this instance should have created key space with the name key space 1. the username and password should be data stacks to make things easy if you don't have the instance running yet just open the dashboard tab and click the add database you should be able to start one free instance the freeworx compare project will use issue table we need to create this table before running measurements we can use the astra studio to achieve it let's open the studio view and create a new notebook in the notebook we can create an issue table using create table if not exist issue id uid primary key name text description text once it's ready just click run and we can see that query succeeded our data stacks examples will be using astra as a database to be able to connect to it please click on the connect button it will open a new view in this new view please check the connection method to the driver it will allow you to download the secure connect bundle we'll use this bundle to connect to astra from various java frameworks please copy the full path where the secure bind bundle is downloaded we will use this information in the next step the frameworks compare project is using astra to allow those frameworks to see the secure bundle we need to set the astra db bundle environment variable to a location where we downloaded it i'm setting it in my command line export astra db bundle and the absolute path to the secure connect bundle this project has a couple more prerequisites if you want to run all examples firstly you need to have j-meter installed j-meter is a java tool used for performance testing we'll use j-meter to simulate a load to test memory consumption of frameworks if you are on mac os you can just do brew install j-meter otherwise please visit the geometer website and follow the installation steps all frameworks examples are written in java programming language so i assume that you have jdk installed it should be in at least version 1.8 to allow proper isolation of tests we are using docker to run every example frameworks are packaged into a docker container next the measure.sh script is starting those containers one after another i assume that you have docker installed one of the examples is using growl vm growl vm is a high performance environment that should have the best performance if you want to run this example please install the grail vm following those steps let's take a brief look at one of remork's code we'll look at a spring code because it is one of the most commonly used in the java ecosystem in the application those properties you will find the keyspace configuration that should match the config from astra ui the username and password should also match the values from the astra database the secureconnect bundle points to the var directory that is available within the docker container the docker composiam script that prepares the docker environment uses the astradb bundle that we set a couple of steps back it picks the bundle and put it in a docker image using volumes thanks to that the astra secure bundle is available within a container every application has its own docker image it is exposing the rest api on the port 8080 let's take a look at the issue controller it exposes a variety of rest endpoints for interacting with the issues database we have the read method for getting the resource there is also a create method that posts a new issue there are also put post and delete rest api methods if you look at other frameworks you will notice that each of them exposes the same rest api this is essential because it allows the measure.sh script to run the same performance test for all frameworks finally we can run the measure.sh script to build docker images for each framework next it will start testing of startup and compile times for all frameworks please note that every step is running 5 times to have more repeatable results if you want to have faster feedback you may reduce it to one run the whole procedure takes a long time but i have some calculations already i collected them before this presentation to not lose time waiting for them let's start with compile time results please note that you may observe different compile times depending on your environment but the overall trend should be similar the compile times are very similar between three marks only the quarkus growl is 30 times longer than any other framework this is expected because gral is compiling everything upfront using ahead of time compilation on the other hand other examples are using standard jit compiler that will kick in at the runtime therefore the compilation is postponed to later times growl tries to compile everything up front to reduce this overhead at the runtime the startup times are reflecting that the quarkus girl startup time is almost three times faster than spring data other frameworks look similar the micro node is a bit faster than spring helidone and quarkus without growl let's switch now to memory usage firstly the measure.sh script is examining the memory usage at the startup the quarkus is very optimized regarding memory usage the memory consumption of quarkus growl is three times less than the spring data surprisingly quarkus without ground is also very memory efficient finally the measure script is using jmx to simulate the load it uses 50 concurrent users and interacts with the rest api of all frameworks those results seem most important because they are showing the real resources consumption during load quarkus on groud vm and also quarkus shines here the memory consumption while serving the same traffic is substantially lower compared to other frameworks if after performance testing you want to try quarkus on your application that uses cassandra you may check out our cassandra quarkus extension that simplifies building a quarkus application with cassandra this is all from my site thank you for watching this presentation if you have any feedback regarding this presentation or project feel free to share it with us",
