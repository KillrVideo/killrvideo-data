    "text": "[Music] hello and welcome to ds2 20 data modeling with Apache Cassandra brought to you by data stacks if this was a live course we'd have everybody introduce themselves but this is a one-way video and so the only person that can really introduce themselves is myself my name is Jaime King and I am based in Salt Lake City Utah I obviously work for data stacks but my goals for using Cassandra are to help you become awesome chances are you've come to Cassandra because you have a need you've heard about this Big Data thing and you need to handle a lot of data coming in and out some reliability something is not working with your current solution and so you want to explore and learn more about Apache Cassandra and that's my job we're going to go through this course and learn some awesome stuff my prior experience is that I've built several websites using relational databases personal trivia we generally do two truths and a lie but I think here I'll just tell you something about myself I love software development computer science anything related to that I am thoroughly addicted I've been going to the support groups to try to overcome that but it really hasn't done me any good so we have some sweet learning objectives for this course we've essentially brought you on to killer video which is a video sharing website and you're hired as our database administrator if you go to the website killer video com you'll see that we've built an entire application on top of Apache Cassandra anyway you've been hired on as a killer video database administrator when you're giving you some hands-on experience in this course we have some wonderful exercises coming up we've all done it we're tasked to build an application we do a little research a few questions but then hey you know what programming is actually type in computer so let's sit down and just start building without much forethought and eventually that application will turn into some chicken wire and duct tape and this unmaintainable mess a pile of Jenga sticks where if you change one thing that it breaks something somewhere else we've all been through that not ideal however learning a new platform or spiking as we call it in the agile world it's nice to get our hands dirty with the technology and that's essentially what we're going to do here build our application using some quick design techniques to get you familiar with Apache Cassandra after we've done that we need to improve our model using these three steps that I want you to tattoo on your forehead actually you can just tattoo them into the neurons in your brain but we're going to step through this several times these three steps should become second nature to you conceptual logical physical just a little highlight of what's to come here once we've built our model we need to step back and say okay well where are the places we can improve most likely one of the big reasons you're coming to Apache Cassandra is to avoid some latency if somebody makes a query on the database we want the database to return that result set extremely fast and so we can help the database long just like any applications of ailment by stepping back and saying okay well what can we tune what can we improve where can we optimize one of my teammates steps back and snapped this photo of me and my coworkers as we were working on the killer video comet website the general algorithm for building any application is the analyze requirements what problem do we need to solve hopefully we're not in left field working on something that's not core what we're trying to actually accomplish so it's important to analyze requirements we also need to identify the entities in relationships those are conceptual modeling terms remember conceptual is one of the words I asked you to tattoo into neurons in your brain and entity are objects in our system for example in color video we have videos have users we have comments we have several things like that those are entities and then we have relationships between those entities so such as a user will make a comment on the video so we need to examine all those things using conceptual data modeling we'll talk about that in more detail soon now unlike relational databases we actually look at what queries we're going to make on our database at the very beginning generally in a relational database we shoot for third normal form we want all the users in one table we want all the videos in another table and if we need to kind of tie them together we're going to use some joins but unfortunately joins are expensive and Cassandra does not support joins natively you have to step back and say I'm actually building a model to satisfy any queries for my application patience so that my users are happy and so one of the first things we consider are the queries once we've done all that work we actually build a schema very similar to a relational schema but in the Kassandra way and again optimize optimize optimize we actually create our tables using cql it's Cassandra query language it looks very much like sequel or SQL we're going to see this diagram throughout the entire course we'll keep referencing it and this is essentially the steps we go through to build our data model you can see we have the conceptual data model we also worry about the queries that's the application workflow how are people going to navigate the app what does the database need to respond to we combine both of those to build our logical data model do our optimizations and that makes our physical data model or whether the rubber meets the road again so we can actually build tables and put data into tables it's nice to do all this kind of high level stuff but in the end we need to build an application so all this is an algorithm and as long as you follow that algorithm you can map any domain into tables for Apache Cassandra it's tested it works well it gives us nice defined results we like to know that there's an algorithm or pattern of steps we can throw at a domain and out pops a database however just like with any application there's also a little artistic sign there this is where you can get creative and clever however your unique solution to this particular problem may not be reproducible in other domains but it's fun when you see something difficult you know I got this clever idea and boom you're awesome as we're going to do through this courses helped you become awesome note the last bullet on the slide different data models do have different costs with Cassandra we're extremely concerned with how our data is laid out on disk because that determines how fast Cassandra will return a result set the goal is to build a schema that returns result sets quickly we don't want to mess with execution plans we don't want to do any joins hey I just want my data give it to me right now lightning-fast queries this entire course focuses on building the proper schema to make that happen if you have data you can put an Enka sender a lot of people kind of say I got this domain I got this to me I got this if you have data you can put it in Cassandra now if your data is not changing a lot and have a very static website a small website I don't think I'd actually spend the time throwing Cassandra at it but other than that if you need high availability scale you got data Cassandra is an excellent choice I remember the first time I heard the term big data I just thought oh that must mean you got gigabytes and gigabytes of data if you have several users causing inserts and selects to come from a database at once then you have some high velocity and Cassandra is awesome in this area now we actually have a hidden goal or a hidden agenda and that is to make you be awesome I love being an application developer because every time I do something and other people don't understand it like oh Jamie you're so magical I'm stroking my ego thinking yeah yeah I'm cool so our goal here is to make you that way as far as Cassandra is concerned so your co-workers your boss your customers it Oh mmm that's so cool you salting like yeah I just threw up some Cassandra nodes and it solved the problem but don't tell them that or else they won't think you're so cool or if you want to feel like you're standing on one hand like this epic breakdancer that could be you as well at least that's maybe how you'll feel that's how I feel after I've been so awesome but when it really comes down to it we have step back and say you know what we're still geeks all right we're nerds I admit as much cosplay as I put on as many superhero costumes I'll try to pretend I mean however nerdy or geeky you want to get we're still just us so there's still some realities there but you know what you could stand on one hand whatever whatever you want to do now I've done all the talking and the more I talk the less you learn so we've built several exercises for you to get your hands on so this is a good point to stop open up the first exercise and go through it you [Music]",
