    "text": "[Music] hi i'm tanya gallagher and welcome to ds210 data sex enterprise operations with apache cassandra we are glad you could join us in this course we are going to take a look at the following things we start by showing you the basics of configuration starting with the cassandra yaml file from here we will discuss cluster sizing and then move into stress testing the cluster using a tool called cassandra stress after that we will show you a variety of linux tools to measure the health and performance of your cluster we will also introduce nodetool as a cluster monitoring tool then we will move on to an overview of the system and output logs when we finish configuring and monitoring your cluster we will take a look at adding bootstrapping removing and replacing nodes when you've got your head around that we will move into the care and feeding of your cluster including compaction strategies repair nodesync and ss table split after that we will get into the ins and outs of a multi-data center scenario after that we move on to backing up restoring and moving data in your cluster okay we're nearly done next a discussion on jvm tuning followed by an overview of security in apache cassandra and then we will end our course by taking you through op center functionality and provisioning a cluster using the op center lifecycle manager hold on tight we will be covering a lot of content over the next several modules let's get ready to rumble",
