    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hey everyone Patrick McFadden you're a developer de Paris and with me today yes separate event they prepared locate here in EMEA so distributed data show today we are here and this here is the last developer day we're doing in this current run of six we've done six already six city so we did well actually it was March 7 we started in San Francisco you were in New York Washington DC and then we did two weeks ago we did Dallas and then a couple days ago we were in London yes and then today we're in Paris yeah the best for last somehow we just danced around and came right back to you good yeah so I think it's time to talk about some of the the interesting parts of this which are you know after looking over this much time what do we learn so maybe give me your impression what do you think yes first we got a lot of people there there are a lot of people oh yeah huge crowd and people were very motivated they stay there up to the end of the day each time add a lot of pretty deep conversations mm-hmm very pretty interesting use cases if you came with their own use cases they're working on have a bunch of questions it was not all about training and explaining what they did dived in the all-news case I thought well that was a big part of when I did my little opening talk in the morning you know there's the the key was that we were asking hey this is a two-way conversation sure you may want to learn something and do some in the hands-on which is really I think that's great but we're also here if you don't want that you want to just talk about your use case because I think that's that's a really needed part of if you're a developer you understand the technology to a certain extent talking to an expert someone who's done this a few times is really validating and I think it's really interesting how now the use cases are people bring to me and what they're doing that they're doing the right I mean it used to be that people were doing a really bad things with the standard but it was hard at the new tech cookies case the good guy data model it's right still about data model now it's pretty hard question how do i scale properly do I help speaking of scaling do i scale still on-premise as I used to be go food in the cloud do an ivory cloud so alright that's a good point so what were some of the big things whatever what's the what's on the minds of developers in late 2018 oh wow I'm so there everybody's focused on the cloud now they know that AWS services as you're just pop up some service once a once a week once a day each time or events you get 20 new stuff that they have a lot to learn and so they know they will have to use that cloud but they would like to use multi cloud and not bit locking in a simple cloud because some of other service from Asia on GCP are pretty nice-looking specially young ji and maybe they start using AWS for the infrastructure layer and now they need to expand the data you have to move to cloud so not only about scaling and availability is very the way to be distributed and available in all the kind of application they can build well in this and it I'd say that plus make it simple because it's really difficult to run in more than one environment it's the we've all done development in this release in the stack Orca tech chure where we have a single server maybe a second server connected to it via HTTP or acid driver old times good old time it was a very simple architecture you could just say it's the old three layer architecture the web suite logic and then they'd a way yeah so yeah you went the other direction you started yeah you wanna start with beta wave services anyway okay better I went the other direction but it's but it's yeah that the that those methods still apply I mean that three stack architecture is more or less still out there it's not like but it's just distributed in ways that each we haven't distributed and even you know micro-service because everybody is micro now right instead of splitting into layer it's right now they're splitting into colors but in every single column you will again from the UI service and still - sure it still there there's a lot of it - so we had a really interesting as well we had two demos we added one in Chicago and then the you it was David and Alex this morning did that demo as well maybe explain a little bit of there and seeing it yeah sure it was amazing so we starting with a bunch of data center one on premise and one of any most famous public cloud DCP Azure and a WS yeah and they're what adds a nice application running telling that amaura and writing and reading in real time into those multiple data centers and try to put some I priority on the on premise data center so we can show through the log that we are to the pointing on the on-premise data center and boom the stuff to do some pretty bad things with the cluster that's my favorite part - not everything relative it's not this carefully shut down the taking a hammer to this whole thing and and as we got the up center just showing what happened it just noticed blue yeah just deepening and you know what the application was still online of course available and you can tell through the log that is twitch fun one to Elizabeth weather each time you need to so and then we push back the node and they came part again part of the cluster and Richard we confer streaming the data we can show that through Ince charts and then their application go back to improve on premise because it's it is prior to you it's nice it is and you know it's a very simple it's a simple demo but it shows a powerful thing that you are not and this has it's been so hard with data is distributing your data in a way that you can accomplish this and you know I said this a few times this morning was well what can you do with this if this is something you can do and it's pretty easy to do you're now you're at the application layer what can you do with that boy you get some I think that's where you get the real excited look so yeah what can I do with that yeah I'm pretty sure those folks already do some kind of hybrid cloud or at least duplicate the data using some middleware right now the data you have provided for you synchronization in both directions right yeah if you lose the networks it's not that a big case if you lose a disk is that a big case and in the cloud it's all community are web-based you will lose any kind of resource and yes it's still there so another thing that we were doing we set up separate tracks we had a Cassandra learning track which I think it's really critical there's still a lot of folks on yeah a lot of don't know about Cassandra but we had a date of sex enterprise track and you you helped teach some of that expanding on basic Cassandra so beyond Cassandra some of the stuff that you were you're going over yeah I used to be part of the search track assisting people just to figure it out what you can do with solar full size full search index and actually people already knew the solar stuff and we go pretty deep in some endzone trying to figure it out if index should be case sensitive or not how could share that with Cassandra so multiple level of papers of very advanced like that and for very new but in the end everybody go to ends of the endzone as you expect and get with the main ID when I eat some limitation because I need to clearly not only on my primary key enable surah ahzaab : useful text create index should then put it in the where clause oh yes so simple it's simple yeah and it's all secure base no yes eql based and it makes for a lot better experience for developers because you're not having to go through multiple protocols multiple layers ETL moving data from one point to the other transport layers all those are the things no just 90 port 1942 issue a query get a result set simple as that boom yeah the second session second track actually I'm the teacher of that that track is a castle development application on top of of casados this is my stuff and I was very happy I got a lot of thoughts there as well but I saw the session pretty well in the morning anyway so people were there and I'll read you new Java of course and also quite intense question about or now are using the OSS driver was changing what cane can i what can I do within the enterprise driver can you bring more about the different strategy recognition strategy supplies that I think with the driver I think that that's one of those things that I feel like a very basic level most people know how to use it well but they don't understand the the really cool and interesting advanced features that come with it yeah yeah the track efficient is organized that way you probably know how to connect to casa la puta got a point maybe the port user password connect you're good to go right and then you start Oh what about the reconnection policy what about the load balancing policy you have seen this morning and this afternoon some multiple data center cluster maybe you would like only to point on the data set up close from you right and you start to add those line of code in just the initialization of the driver who the driver can do all that for me yeah yes it can it just the collection URL you know it's not that bad right it's really pretty deep dive and gossiping with nodes and know what happened discover stuff by itself and the end zone is actually developing real applications right with Java and at the end it's it's working so we do a lot of the Java driver in these developer days but have you heard people ask for other other driver content yeah doing yeah six dates is a lot of course I had a multiple of questions I had a question for no GS driver hmm those guys are actually looking at the code of our drivers and say oh this is a way you're doing some mapping between objects and the tables and this is a correct way to do it I was like okay I think it's a pretty common come on mapping firm rocks and in the end we were friends and also quite a lot of question on pattern definitely people using Python I I wonder how much how much Python is actually used in production versus prototyping application development probably prototype things yeah notebooks netbooks sure and building a quick proof of concept with something like flask I remember I used to use flask to get a quick rest service going that's easy plastic is great for that you can make it now you can make a rest go really fast with flask and you know pythons easy to work with yeah it's 2007 forever can't say that it's more and more popular now we will actually work on Python pretty close so I've worked on I start working I just decided I'm not gonna do to 2 dot X anymore I'm gonna do three the first thing I feel like I'm like part of this mass I Coast this that doesn't want to use 3.0 but it's perfectly fine I was like oh why did I even make this deal and our drivers are it's getting better a little actually yeah they were quite the the code is very close from the Java while you figure it out pretty easily how to set up the same options yeah would you go and someday that someone's gonna make a book about the transition from 2.23 Don Python I like this one yeah how to use the Python driver in action in prediction how to use a fightin driver in prediction yeah exactly all right so we've drivers things like that I you know that and I think the final part that I enjoy the most is the end but we have these great networking events at the end yeah that's you know and it's a we pass out truth serum yes we finished and the pretty late again yeah huge questions and now that we finish for the season they look at my inbox and I have an answer email because I give my car to everyone now it just I have a thousand questions once were on to closing I have definitely seen my LinkedIn explode and my Twitter and explode and that's great so we're coming down to right so we were diddly six and we wanted to do or seven really but there was this sprint of events that we wanted to do is one after the other we're tired ready to get some sleep but we need to do more of these and I think this is where and we did a lot of great surveys people did a lot of surveys but I think we want to I think we want to hear more about what people want yeah I know so if you have any suggestion please use the comment sections you guys get city yeah true and if yeah if you want your city please put it on the under comment below and we'll be happy to to ones for you yeah and you know of course we want to hear from you about what kind of content you think is useful if you're doing certain type of development you're like hey can you can you do this and another thing I don't think a lot of people know is we also do these type of events inside large companies we have done several of these because what we find is that you can large company can bring a hundred people really easily and that's an yeah yeah and I went into a thousand you did a bunch of those event as well you know I write a company and each time I'm sure you'll do more oh yeah EMU oh I'm sure about it yeah it's for sure all right well hey thanks a lot for doing these this is great and so for those of you out there don't forget comments below put in muley what do you want to see what cities you'd like us to be in interact with us we want to hear from you and we'll talk to you soon thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your
