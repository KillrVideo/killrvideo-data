welcome that's alex volchniv developer advocate of data stacks and maybe you've seen me already at other workshops we do a lot but today our special guest is uh raul singh hi raul hey how are you doing alex good to see you again i'm happy uh because it's tuesday we do a stream and most of all i'm happy to work with you again it's been a while since last time cassandra day india yeah yeah right right okay so uh could you please introduce yourself there are maybe many people or some people who don't know you yet sure thank you well thanks for having me um hey everybody uh my name is rahul singh i'm a platform architect with anant and uh i've been working with cassandra and datastax for a long time and [Music] just love building designing platforms that run on top of data stacks and other technologies basically global platforms and if you're making a global platform these days you basically have to use cassandra so that's why i'm here right there are not so many uh options but great and what is it that's going to be a series so it's not a single workshop but like a little tv series and what it's all about yeah so uh this is a you know first of a three-part uh series um we're going to talk about the general planning of you know migrating to a serverless platform um just not just the data aspect of it but the holistic platform if you're trying to take what you have even if it's on the cloud quote-unquote um how do we think about it as a as a serverless platform where um you don't necessarily have to manage infrastructure the second talk is going to be about migrating the data the ins and outs of how do we plan that and do it and there will be a few tools we're going to go and talk about especially if you're moving tons of data right if you're using cassandra or if you're moving to uh to to cassandra uh on a system like astro how do we get that information there and then finally what does true transformation look like and we're going to touch a little bit of that today uh in terms of the future of computing and digital platforms where basically nobody's managing any servers at all all we do is write write functions and design data that robots take care of the rest of it yeah that is great well that's a very interesting topic we know how many companies now are moving to the cloud more and more companies doing that and some of them claiming lacking quite exciting results much bigger flexibility a lot of savings sometimes but you have to be careful with your cloud infrastructure or savings maybe not really savings we've seen that also so we are here to help you to plan to success with the cloud because if you not plan at all it's going to be a plan to fail that's true so let's start awesome well um good morning good afternoon and good evening from wherever you are um it's actually evening for me here i'm actually i'm in greece uh today working working from greece and uh so hi to all the folks in europe and in india and the us uh as i mentioned we're gonna talk about the the planning uh and the migration of an application where has a lot of different components and we're not gonna have actually any hands-on uh for this session so don't worry about it you don't need to pull up your browser and open up uh any any shelves right now i've just i just just talked a little bit about myself but um you know i'm also a ceo of of an ant corporation uh although i do a lot of technical work um one of my passions is to organize knowledge and uh we started this little experiment a long time ago um called awesome cassandra which somebody was maintaining and that became center.link and uh we actually run consider not link on some of the stuff we're going to talk about um i also uh co-organize several meetups in the washington dc region um on cassandra and on data engineering uh we actually have a weekly monday data engineers lunch at 12 eastern uh roughly 6 p.m uh uh or 5 p.m central eastern uh central uh european time um and then on wednesdays you can sit at lunch uh so tomorrow uh at 12 eastern uh you can check us out sounds interesting i have to join yeah no that'd be great um do you want to talk a little bit about sure so a little bit of housekeeping before we start uh the primary thing of this is the live stream so you can attend it and ask questions we stream and youtube as a primary platform at data stacks developers channels by the way it's an awesome channel so if you didn't sign it yet do it there is a button right under the roll then we have a backup platform we just twitch but we don't watch the comments in twitch so we prefer to stay on youtube as long as everything is fine with youtube and you can switch to twitch if anything goes wrong then for questions best place to ask questions you can ask questions write on youtube comments but best place is to do it is our discord community fellowship of the cassandra rings and that's you can find it using the link which is right on the screen right now next uh for today we won't do a mentee and uh practical parts but it's all coming on the next steps so say stage unit and yes i think we are good excellent thank you yeah we're gonna come up with some exciting questions for next time so if you're here next week there may be some good questions from today's session and good prices absolutely all right so uh just a quick rundown of the the series um today we're going to focus on the platform right how do you plan a migration next week we're going to talk about data migration and then finally the week after that we're going to talk about just true transformation in general how to how to achieve it with today's technologies and how to look forward to the future what do i hope for you today um well i hope that you understand the uh well what is the serverless architecture right people talk about it and to get there well what we'll do is we'll if you don't know about how we got to serverless architecture we'll tell i'll show you how technology has changed and the reason i'm going to do that is because that should show you how potentially technology will change in the future um why do we want to transform to serverless architecture what are some patterns uh to to steal from other people there's lots of best practices out there so yeah what are some best best practices that we can use um and just a little bit of you know managing a migration you know what are the steps to take um and you know the the actual takeaways are really to just compare what is out there in the world that can complement astra if you're gonna be using astra uh astra provides an amazing data layer and an api layer but you have to have other tools and technologies to really make great use of it to maximize that potential and in different clouds those are different components we'll talk a little bit about different clouds like google and azure and and amazon and how astr fits into that architecture uh as well as some you know anti-patterns and and brexit practices uh for generally each layer of the migration cloud can be very profitable uh for your business for your project uh even it doesn't matter if you are a manager or an engineer you still can't benefit from cloud flexibility and power and that's for sure but there are many places to make a strong solid mistake and harm yourself so listen for really to raul because that will be a very important point to avoid yeah hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes yeah it's much cheaper that's much cheaper exactly exactly um just want to thank the the sponsors uh so today we're not going to use git pod uh next session we'll we'll take a look at it uh git pod is uh our kind of preferred tool for showing people how to use technology um if you haven't used git pod um it's like visual studio on on the cloud um datastax obviously for helping us put this together and and my company and not that's been very supportive of me doing these type of things so um without further ado what is art architect i'm wearing a t-shirt as an architect um i want everybody that's watching this uh too to ask you know what do you want to do with your careers right well at our company we build architects we build the builders we build the chief builder so our company is a platform architecture firm we create uh systems we create platforms that's the verb but we also create architects we transform engineers coders into consultants and architects if you're interested in becoming an architect join our company love to have more smart people yeah always hiring we love scalable fast data stuff that uh we work without data stacks which is harder and with data sets when it's easier um basically the the fast data world in you know encompasses cassandra spark and kafka we work with all of those technologies and then we have to know a lot of other stuff so what you'll see in the series is actually what we have to help our clients think about outside of the data platform in order to make the data platform successful uh because it's not it's everything's connected right let's go back in time a little bit yeah sure i have a time machine right behind me so i can easily bring us back let's let's go back in time maybe 30 or 40 years ago when the internet was starting off right and and we're gonna see how the evolution of the internet has also brought us to the cloud today so shift 1.0 right the first shift uh was going from physical servers to virtual machines now most you know technologists today they take the cloud for granted right oh i need a virtual machine just make it oh destroy it well yeah before amazon made it a commodity um very few people had access to vm technologies that was that good uh and on top of that uh servers were physical servers right there were physical machines um and so when we went from physical to virtual i was so glad because i used to run a hosting company and i would cut my servers yes exactly i can imagine i would add one point what there are actually were two great uh changes uh physical machines to virtual servers and the second one hardware networks to software defined networks yes also very important absolutely i mean the ability to do routing and subnets and and vpns all through software now it's we take that for granted too absolutely it's an amazing technology today which we'll cover when we talk a little bit about infrastructure as code because now everything is code right everything is code um now when when things went from physical to virtual the software did not have to change that much because the software was just literally lifted and shipped it from a you know an operating system running on the physical device to the virtual device right no major work was involved um the next shift was basically right before we got to containers which is auto scaled vm based services now this included things like uh actually kubernetes uh also uh when initially kubernetes was coming out you could subscribe to certain services that scaled your infrastructure for you and it would scale it down if you weren't using it but it was still the architecture of the software was about the same right you had to make sure that your software was stateless meaning it didn't have any data in in your deployment of the code um and you had to make sure your database itself was scalable but your application layer could scale um you know out and scale that back in elastic beanstalk which i think is still around was one of the first services um and then heroku started to come around with their own services which actually led to the container revolution i'll get to that in a second but this shift got people to see the value of the cloud which is you can scale out when you need to and then scale back in when you don't need it and i was just speaking to somebody earlier who worked in the financial industry they would have to manage a transaction for for petabytes of data but that process only took like four hours on a big cluster and they could just turn off the cluster or destroy the cluster after that and they save millions of dollars a month by doing that yes yes exactly huge huge you know but that's not only about the direct losses or direct costs those we can calculate and those are more or less obvious but there are so much more losses what are hidden from people for example a research and development team of a friend of mine needed to have some virtual servers to make some experiments try to find better solution for their business and they were not in the they were not able to get some virtual machines for vamps just uh directly they have to request for them and it was a huge and slow corporation like you know many monsters can be very slow as they are getting huge they wait for the group of uh machines to make an experiment for eight months wow what were the costs of these um slow advance i don't know no one can calculate maybe it work it could have been billions of dollars yeah no one knows and no one can calculate uh speaking yeah yeah please no no no i what what you're talking about is lack of knowledge sometimes causes that too right it's the mistakes yeah yeah yeah and exactly for how to scale it virtual machine based services that i remember the first moment i've seen it it was like a really magic i mean the coming of virtual machines uh switch at the moment when you can wait for your for new machine for your disposal from really for a year because you could have been waiting for a new server physical server for a year or maybe more and now it was normally much faster time but you still have to think ahead plan ahead um make some uh things to make this happen and without a scale at virtual machines it just appears when you need it disappears when you don't need it and it works like amazing and that i was so excited first the first time it was eight uh how to scaling at aws ec2 it was just amazing yeah and and and before we go to the next one one of the pitfalls for auto scaling was people did not have any guard rails yeah so sometimes they would have a really big bill oh yeah yeah yeah especially when you configure scaling out don't configure scaling in and one more one morning you just wake up to get a bill of dozens of thousands of dollars for a training environment exactly exactly so next shift next shift is we're kind of in the middle of this right now kind of in the middle of this and the next shift that we'll talk about but going from a virtual machine to the containerized world um has been i would say the last five five to ten years i would say probably more closer to five where everybody knows well i don't know if everybody docker is kind of used everywhere now kubernetes is used everywhere now but as late as i don't know three four years ago we were still debating is it kubernetes or is it mesos what container orchestra or is it swarm well now kubernetes has one right everybody uses kubernetes um but containers they've been around for a long time and um you know google's technology with docker uh you know combined is what we now use most most platforms are built on top of kubernetes and you know where did docker come from docker came from some people that wanted to build a heroku clone that could run any uh technology that does because hosting initially uh would only allow you to run like ruby and like python i believe python yeah maybe maybe php i don't remember exactly um and i remember they had a very limited selection but uh now they can actually run a docker container for you basically anybody can run another container for you um but uh docker came out as a goal the goal was to make a standard way to deploy software and wow what a powerful concept everybody uh can get their mind around this where you used to have to run an operating system just for your app on a virtual machine just for one component of that app and that would be so much bloat versus now with the container when you containerize it properly right you can have a container that's bloated that's like a gigabyte or you can have a container that's like 20 megabytes and the same thing applies when you're writing serverless code too but ultimately the container allows you to make software that runs side by side other containers and it leverages the same operating system and that's huge that's huge because maybe some of your application needs to come into being and then do its work and then go away and you don't necessarily want to build up a virtual machine to do that right you just want to run that thing and have it done and and go away and you can use the same hardware to run thousands of processes right so that's huge containerization allowed people to really maximize their hardware yep and meanwhile meanwhile doing many things much faster i remember first time i joined my first project in germany uh just setting and deploying a project in the development environment for every new developer joining the project it was almost two days just to set up a workplace and after our migration to docker it normally took 15 minutes 15 minutes yep 15 minutes that's amazing and you know git pod runs on on containers so now i would say when we have to show somebody like a new team member how to do something um we even have some of our actual environments on gitpod where literally it's like we send them a url and we say here we go right and so that's all powered by docker yeah you don't even have to have docker running on your computer i and i think a lot of the katakota is all running on containers right so um huge tech i mean i would say it's like a a stepping onto the moon type of shift right going from virtual to container was a huge transition um and it's still it's still we're still here people are still trying to containerize their applications now now the next shift is is serverless architecture and uh before i do that i'm gonna i'm gonna turn on the lights because it's getting a little dark in here in one second okay meanwhile i can say what just a little disclaimer for many many many years i was an opponent to the serverless approach now it's changed and you will see it soon but in general for many years i was very against serverless architecture for real and i know many people who was with me [Laughter] i i was also against it uh you're not alone alex um i i fought it a little bit until i found the jam stack yeah once i found the jam stack i was sold so we'll talk about the jam stack in a little bit but um i totally get it and i'll even explain why did i not like service architecture um well serverless architecture requires you to think in a different way in which you don't think about the hardware at all right you just you just focus on your data model your data processes and your your business logic and your presentation there you don't care about the infrastructure at all and being a hardware geek having run up you know hosting company i felt like i wanted to control these things and so i realized that the reason i didn't like serverless architecture is because i was losing some control and the reality was i was but i was also gaining a lot more in the same way that physical to virtual we lost some control but we gained a lot of freedoms the same thing from uh you know virtual machines to containers when we went from cont when we're going from containers to serverless it's a similar type of shift now just like going from physical to virtual virtual to containers and containers to serve this each of these transitions require us to make a slight change in our architecture in this case a big change and we also have to think about a few other things because everything is running on other people's hardware when it comes to security when it comes to logging when it comes to monitoring um you know we have to think about those things unless the provider of the platform gives that to us right um but truth be told going from a um microservices environment where you are running your software on containers to a completely serverless platform uh go that transition requires you to to do a heck of a lot of work yeah in order for you to be able to test test that software let alone scale that software without it breaking um and uh we'll cover a little bit of that as we go into you know what to avoid but um serverless has a lot of potential because because what i mentioned earlier you don't have to worry about hardware yup you don't think about it you focus on your business basically right um and a lot of clouds offer serverless so you know amazon has its version of serverless uh azure has its version of serverless google has its version of servers and when we say serverless it's the concept of functions running in the ethereal cloud meaning instead of making a piece of software and saying go run this for me and scale it for me you focus on the function itself maybe it's an api endpoint right and you say what does this api endpoint need to do and you just write that code and you deploy it and then it scales automatically magically and there's a lot of other things behind the scenes that it does for you but um but that's not it serverless is more than service functions serverless also includes serverless databases right right serverless apis serverless streams uh serverless storage serverless you you name it anything that you could be using to build your application now you don't have to think about the infrastructure there is to be there still are services where you you say you want some service but you have to pre-commit to some hardware right so like the difference between elastic kubernetes service on azure versus fargate right eks you're running on you're spending money on machinery right but fargate you just you spend you you deploy your your kubernetes application and it scales it for you and you don't worry about the hardware because fargate is serverless so serverless is a loaded work and we're going to talk about serverless data and we're talking about service applications and uh we're going to talk about how astr makes it easier for you so shift 4.0 it's coming and it's here so it's like it's like that movie tenant right both of these are coincidentally happening right now right the shift to containers and the shifter service is happening right now and they're not mutually exclusive right you can do both you can do serverless containers too i would bet what most of the companies now are on the hybrid [Music] deployments yeah yeah and that's what we're going to talk about is what does that look like right what does that transition look like because it's very few companies can be 100 service right now right yeah that's not you you see there are many different businesses with very different requirements i know people uh uh one online arts uh project very big we they drop it even darker because they have such a huge pressure and they need such a high performance they want to go on bare metal very bare metal because we require highest of highest possible performance but i believe in our case in most of the company's case it's better to maybe buy a couple of more servers but to think on a little bit different approach indeed with maybe serverless or at least getting close to it because the flexibility what it gives to engineers and to businesses that's incredible yeah and and you know when we're talking about serverless functions you know there is a use case for that right there is maybe you want to have an api that wraps another api um maybe you want to have an asynchronous process that maybe you know sends a message to let's say a million people right like emails uh or notifications those things are great for that serverless functions are not great for long-running processes right that's what containers are for containers can do that for you serverless functions are not for data processing i would say there are two big limitations to consider about serverless functions well there are more limitations but those are very important uh first of all if you still uh i'm not i don't think what using serverless functions like aws lambda is a best practice to use them as something answering direct calls blockings and chronos calls of your clients if you want to have a perfect response time as low as possible than serverless functions maybe not the best scenarios uh second if you go with serverless functions and there are functions which require like databases connection especially if you are for example going to connect the cassandra cassandra driver is extremely smart but it takes time to start because it has to receive information about the cluster state um all of this so there are a lot of considerations to consider rick and figure switch something of switch something on so if you don't know what you are doing you can definitely run into troubles so learn first exactly and and the you know what i'm trying to get you guys to see here is thinking about the serverless architecture in these different layers and understanding what they're good at will help you decide what to use right so we're going to talk a little bit later about you know what does a good processing engine look like on amazon versus azure right and what does that have to do with the serverless architecture on those clouds uh but basically there's i would categorize them there's more categories but i look at them in the following ways functions containers slash microservices um and i put them in the same kind of clump because like you can write a java microservice in spring boot and technically it's a virtual machine you know so anyways containers and i would say containers and microservices uh in the same area nowadays because you can deploy it with services like app service on azure or heroku or versailles where you are writing code and it's wrapping it in a container for you and then it's scaling it for you uh processing engines processing engines are different um in terms of the serverless world um than let's say if you were to run your own hadoop cluster versus using amazon emr right or to make your own data sorry a spark cluster versus using azure data bricks or or amazon data bricks right uh and i've seen data breaks is also on google as well um then there's serverless content or endpoint delivery now this technology actually has been around for a while as as far as i can remember there's uh akamai i don't know if they're still around but akamai was there in the beginning of the dot-com boom content delivery network well you know what they're still around and um and they're very important in terms of scaling applications um especially when we're talking about the jam stack and then and then finally there are serverless databases and apis and api is a loaded word so what i mean by that are data apis persistent uh persistence apis basically api is to put data and get data back in that category our application areas like headless commerce headless content management systems which are basically apis right right um and and and to a certain degree these are databases that have been exposed to the world as a rest or graphql api and that's actually where astra sits astr sits in this area now why do we want to get to this next state so why that's why [Laughter] why should i change uh well i'll tell you a little story i'll tell you a little story about about how we are doing it uh small application but it's growing um so we have an application um internally we call it graph but basically it's a knowledge graph and cassandra.link is actually powered by it it's just one site uh you know there's probably 15 000 hand curated links but it's it's made up of a combination of now serverless components and virtual machine components and and container components so it's an application in transition just like most applications are always going to be in transition and you know we had made this initially with containers uh because containers were already out there and it worked fine and then we started have to maintain containers and it became append and act and we don't want to do that this is about two years ago when astra started to come into the scene from a beta perspective and um it was it was interesting so we said well let's see if we can transform this and in 2020 uh we wanted to go by taking our current api which was powered by a bit of a cassandra and a bit of mysql with the php application and basically putting that data mirroring the data into astra uh so we could have some legacy support and then making our own apis and running those apis on containers and scaling them on some sort of service right that was the original plan okay and last year we already had our api uh sorry our our front end on a serverless platforms like netlify and versa right that this this area right here i don't know if you can see my mouse this was already taken care of we were just in the middle of transforming this well this is where we're going this year because astra actually gives us an api layer so that we don't have to maintain this we don't even have to have this api layer if if the astro is going to take care of it why do we need to do that right yep and the as you can see the the transformation from here using containers on machines we were we were managing to to this layer we don't have to maintain any software oh sorry any hardware all we have to do is write code well software as well software and hardware and software both and also configurations updates security patches and so on and so forth you know like uh one of the favorite phrases like there is no serverless it's someone else's computer so exactly and uh but okay yeah technically that's correct but what does that mean if it's not my computer right it's not my headache to maintain it support it budget reboot it take care of it remove disks put new disks and so on and so forth so and in the beginning when i was young and wanted to build everything from scratch like i believe most of the engineers in the very beginning i thought what serverless is a bad idea because it's not my computer and therefore i don't have control over it and now i understand what those people are taking care and they are taking my headache to themselves so i can think of what to develop next whatever needs of my clients and how to make it the best way so they make free they make me free and more able to take care of my clients so that's what i love now yeah and and what it what it does uh you know for us is that right now it's a simple application that we use internally and we and we publish knowledge bases right um we use it and we make it uh because we couldn't find anything better and although i've tried to look for software that does this for us in in like the speed that i want i haven't seen it so but the thing is you know as we use it and we start to to publish more sites right now cassandra.link is getting a lot of traffic and you know soon we're going to be publishing one on spark similar to consignor.link but it'll be around spark and we're going to be publishing something on kafka as well so as we as we start to build out these these sites off of the same core infrastructure right these sites are going to be kind of like tenants and they're going to have different needs and those needs are from the users of these sites we want to spend time servicing the needs of the users rather than servicing servers yeah yeah yeah server is to serve me not me to serve server exactly exactly so we save so much time with astra and this is what i'm gonna hand it over to you to talk a little bit about esther yeah so uh astra is a very interesting story uh it all comes originally from the time then facebook first met big very big size problems facebook was one of the first companies what reached really the level of incredible amount of data incredible amount of transactions and so on and so forth and they needed new and better solutions then two engineers of facebook created um let's say first prototype of cassandra cassandra is a distributed decentralized database which was created with three purposes but one general idea the idea is to be able to handle pressure what hugest companies uh taken and the goal was to be to to create a database to what will be able to handle any amount of data any pressure whatever billions of queries per second it gets and meanwhile uh available globally because for many many many many years companies weren't truly globally and only a businesses like amazon like facebook and others the first uh or maybe not the first one but first those who got this as uh sharp as hard as it was for them for real and he gets a key comes cassandra cassandra later was actively developed by datastax and it became an apache software foundation project and it's a really really great database version 4 was recently released and cassandra powers businesses like apple and apple has one of the biggest cassandra deployments in the world with around 205 000 dedicated cassandra servers that's quite a number netflix hundreds petabytes of data and so on and so forth so instagram for example so cassandra is proved to be very successful on this line but i i i tell people alex that if you're using cassandra it's like the last station on the train track yeah because there's no other database that can scale that big yes and that's open source yes right i would say what there are some interesting solutions from aws or google cloud but they are bound to one single cloud provider where for aws or gcp but at this scale and open source and cloud agnostic so you can deploy it everywhere there are basically no competitors and meanwhile uh what i like the most it's developed by a very strong community so as i said recently cassandra version 4 was released but who give the biggest effort and who made the most of the changes for it to happen from version 3 11 to version 4. apple netflix instagram data stacks and many other great companies so it's a truly team work some of them are even competitors which i find quite funny they're competitors in business but they're developing something together isn't that cool it's amazing open source makes that makes us better so absolutely uh with all these things cassandra is truly great but there is always a price to pay on the scale from bicycle or skateboard to a boeing or airbus cassandra is a very much on the boeing side yes and if you first see a skate or a roller or a bicycle you can get an idea how to use this vehicle and maybe after a couple of minor falls you will be able to write and smile and shine and be happy and if you speak about a complicated distributed solutions that is going to be a very different story so with cassandra first you have to speak quite a lot of time to build proper infrastructure learn how to use it then deploy things then run into troubles why because you didn't learn data modeling and you didn't know what you need to learn it in advance before trying to do something in production with your clients data so uh and i like astrodb because idea of astrodb is still the same apache cassandra or it's very heavily based on apache cassandra verizon but it's and it's still platform agnostic so when you create an instance of astrodb you can decide if you want to use aws or gcp or azure that's for you to decide and then that's still the same cassandra with all of these powers but we've uh but you know you don't need to hire a dozen of best database architects and another dozen of best operations team people uh to take care of your deployment because data stacks will do it for you using power also of aws or azure or gcp teamworks makes best work so everything what i said about cassandra is also applicable for astra with a global scale xero lock-in you don't log to aws or azure you can migrate and many other things but also especially for a young project for startups for startups for people who just want to build something but not really sure how it will work in the future astrodb has incredible three tier so if you go and not with a really heavy production workload if you have less than 30 million reads less than uh almost 5 million writes and you consume less than 40 gigabytes of disk space it's free and you don't pay and we don't even ask for your credit card that's quite cool that's and that's a lot of data by the way right yeah it's you you don't use astra or cassandra for your data lake you're not going to put petabytes of data in here because astra and cassandra you can use it for a data lake yep right but the truth is you you're using cassandra because it's the biggest fast data or is the fastest big data database and it's you know relatively speaking it's a much easier to transition into uh cassandra and astro because it has cql but it also has these other cool apis like graphql and rest but you're not you're not going to dump you know petabytes of data into it for analytics you're going to use this for transactions so 40 you know 30 million reads is a lot of um you know reads yeah it's a lot yeah yeah so that's really like uh that's a very generous offer i believe it in some places better than aws free tier for example which is by the way very good yeah yeah yeah definitely um and can you talk a little bit more about the stargate apis because that's one of the biggest draw yeah that's a great thing do you have a slide about stargates yes perfect thank you so much i was trying to answer baburau ball a question but sorry i will first speak about uh stargate because it's also a game changer so i will tell you a story of one of our uh friends i would say a company known as yelp yelp is quite a big company actively using cassandra but as i said before cassandra is not so simple thing to uh use so you have to learn a lot first and they have a lot of developers and they want their developers to be creating things and solving business problems and not learning something new all the time then you hire new developers or teams changing and so on and so forth and idea was to try to be able to use a data layer try to use database as a cassandra but we've no need to learn cassandra query language and on another point of view you see cassandra is a schema full database so you first have to create schema then store your data there and um there were some projects they wanted to use document api like in mongodb or wherever some projects they wanted to use just throw data to database using crest restful protocols and we don't really needed any kind of cassandra query language or any kind of other language any kind of document api just throw data in form of arrest and get it back by the key and can you imagine what would operations guy ask what would operations guy tell if someone tells them okay now you need to run uh cluster for us and uh whatever uh cluster for us and these this this and that and they are like okay guys we are already busy we don't want to do it we you want install database every database you want to try in the world do you know how there are many databases around 400 we want install like there is your cassandra learn how to use it so both sides were quite unhappy and solution was found in the special data proxy api uh proxy api is there they so from one side you have multiple apis and from another site you have single database idea was to give the developers every api they want to use graphql rest document still give them ability to use cassandra query language of course but to give the operations team still to maintain one single database cluster not a dozen of them right and that's basically the idea of a stargate it's an api proxy which gets your requests in a form of documents rest calls or graphql calls converts them to sql and executes as a part of a normal cassandra things now you don't have to learn cql using stargate you can use just for you store documents like a store with or just have a data layer based on rest so you can work directly with that without any document api or cassandra query language it also supports graphql which is quite cool by the way yeah and um what what i like about uh stargate under the hood it's really cool technology and we don't have to talk about it because cedric is going to talk about it i think tomorrow or the day after on apache con um look out for that um the the cool part is that i like using cqr right and a lot of my colleagues that are younger newer uh and they're you know they came in from the plus you know the uh the mern stack right  ex express uh react and node stack right they can they can use the the document uh api and i can use the cql api and it's the same cluster yep it's that's what i like about it it's amazing um and in our architecture we uh if i go back to this diagram right here most of what we were do really doing with our apis were basically rest calls that were save this document and get this document back right so instead of making our own apis converting that into cql or even like i know cassandra can store data as json and retrieve it as design um rather than having to do all that uh i can just use sergey right stargate which is part of the astrodb uh and and what was what is useful for us with stargate is while the apps are talking to the database using these apis we can have spark to do analytics on that same database using a more native uh you know cql to grab that information so at the same time right that's the cool part at the same time awesome um and you can do it and deploy it and develop it at the same time because it's not you who takes care of the database cluster exactly a benefit yeah and it's got a great uh you know user interface um where you know you make your your your databases and you basically will immediately get a swagger endpoint to take a look at your apis how to you know add delete credit operations on on that and if you want to you also have a cql sh where you can go and check out what's happening on your database if you want to um and finally there's health and monitoring and and you don't have to take a look at that for the most part unless you you notice that nope wonderful oh yeah sorry one of the most open openly forgotten idea of the cloud like what makes cloud why this service is a cloud and this one isn't uh well what people forgot most of the time what's the quality of a cloud it's self-service if i need to create something if i need to use something now again we take it as a given uh you just if it's in saturday night you want to create a new database uh when you go and create a new database and that's or you can use api to create a database if you prefer command line tools of course but again people who are long time in this business remember very well when they have first to wait for monday and then make a couple of phone calls and email order or sometimes in some cases even mail order i mean like the paper can you imagine and yeah that's one of also was a big big challenges and changes of the clouds yeah and and one thing you mentioned and we'll talk a little bit about when we talk about devops is that astra also has a provider for terraform right i've also seen some examples using ansible to create databases so if you want to be able to do this automatically as part of a devops process you can also do that yep i have to admit what terraform uh plugin is not fully completed yet so it works in general but there are some places for improvement it's quite a fresh tool uh i'm uh considering to change some of my plans and uh join uh team working on terraform plugin because it's very important for us i believe to make astra manageable via terraform yeah and there's um i'm trying to remember who who published it from the datasex team but there's a set of really good ansible examples as well which which basically wrap i think the data stacks uh you know the rest devops rest api with ansible and uh it's pretty useful right so um yeah astra is great uh you know check it out um and and by the way one you know before astra right and i i would train people on on cassandra and i've you know i've trained people on data stacks i would say to people don't use cassandra to be cool right because it's hard you really need to use it you really need to need it in order to use it and you have to learn a lot to do it after astra i tell people to use it via astra all the time because it's it's actually not only is it easy it's more scalable and if your application does scale massively you don't have to worry about it because you know that cassandra can scale so it's kind of getting the best of both worlds so um and you don't have to use astra for a big database you can use astro for small database too right yeah especially you see there are two points first a safe cassandra requires qualified personnel to take care of and second it's anyway going to be at least one data center of at least three servers and so on and so forth and if you are going if you don't know if you are will have a lot of data or not so much that may be an overkill and with astra you pay exactly as you go and if you don't consume a lot you don't pay at all so for starting projects for doing test projects it's just a perfect thing like really perfect thing and it's absolutely free again we don't ask for your credit card as long as you don't consume other than millions and millions and millions of requests another point of view it's not exactly the topic of this workshop but you but raul touched really uh like pain point of me of my professional experience i've seen many times in many companies using some solutions not because they are good for their use case but because some other cool companies using this approach hey google uses microservices so we will use microservices too hey come on you are not google you are not google you have 50 people in your team microservices in your case will solve this particular problem i don't know it's just cool if it's just cool then do it as your home project but don't touch your business which is for uh to your customers that's that's incredible there's a there's a good article by segment you know segment i think uh most people are in the marketing world know about it but they they're an analytics company related to customer data their customer data platform um they had a good article i think it was them they said we did not we stopped using microservices and here's why and i wish somebody had written that article much earlier because everybody that's gone to microservices has done it for the wrong reasons um you know um and and their reason was microservices made their platform slower because what they were trying to do with with with information didn't fit in the world of microservices it was an analytics platform and so they had to go back to not necessarily a monolithic system but they had to go to a different architecture back to closer to what they had before um but but anyways we digress that's a different conversation for a different day you know um many uh developers remind me uh fashionistas they like see the top model fashion uh varying i don't know a bag or something a dress and everyone now runs and wants to have this bag and this dress don't be like that this be better understand your needs and your ways to solve your problems and and and one one last thing before we hop back into the kind of the cloud planning topic is that people say how how how long do you think cassandra is going to be relevant they asked me that question right is it just fashionable and here's my evidence whatever you said right spotify netflix apple walmart i mean name it there's a bunch of companies that use it i said these companies are not going to stop using it number two why would microsoft make a cql compliant api and aws aws make managed key spaces for cassandra yep why would there be two separate companies that make a c plus version of cassandra completely different technology that does the same thing as cassandra right they wouldn't do it because they're they're having fun yeah because there's a there's a potential of business that needs this big data database that's fast so cassandra's not going anywhere yeah that's for sure and uh you see um many people not yet uh understand and not really realize it yet about how the world of data will change and the point is it basically doubles every couple of years and more and more companies realize what in order to succeed they have to become a data companies data driven companies become data driven or die and to make reasonable weighted decisions based on data you're going to have a lot of data you know what machine learning doesn't work on a small data sets because there is not enough information to learn the model and it goes the same for the data driven companies you need to have a lot of compa a lot of data so more and more companies will have to store more and more data more and more globally and basically there is one uh best of a wave like type of art solution for this yep absolutely good good good discussion um yeah so finally to kind of uh you know put the nail on the coffin right why use astra well for us it lets us focus on the features focus on what matters for users and for us and generally we do want to become serverless but ultimately our time is valuable people don't understand this i think you you know this alex people are the most expensive thing in a business the most expensive thing people and you know the cost of labor is very expensive you're gonna you're gonna save 15 a month or a hundred dollars a month for what right like one person's time even in in the cheapest rates right like that's that's a lot of money to waste building something if you can just buy or subscribe um especially if it has to do with bigger and bigger scale where you have to have more and more people right it doesn't make any sense so so using serverless is actually about being smarter business people for us right to leverage our time better and that's where i think ultimately management can see the value of serverless is your team can do more more intelligent things right and let somebody else deal with the boring things basically um so let's say you make a decision to uh go to serverless database like astr well will it work on my cloud well yes it will work on your cloud uh on google uh some of the complementary tools would be obviously kubernetes right google made kubernetes you can run whatever api or app you want on top of kubernetes um you can run spark on google data proc uh you can run uh google pub sub or if you want to use confluent cloud you can use that um there's also something called google google pub sub lite which is a little bit closer to kafka and then for controlling and managing things um especially with with spark i like to use livy and you know google has airflow as a service we'll talk about airflow in the next talk but airflow is uh it's an amazing tool um you don't even have to run your own airflow you can just use airflow with a google composer that's what they call it so at the end of the day if are deploying astra onto google uh you can keep your apis on kubernetes and you can keep your spark on google data proc or you can even use google data flow um and if there are other technologies on google as well i'm not showing them here but there are technologies like bigquery and uh and and those have benefit their data warehouses that's a different goal however um well what about amazon what if what what if you're on amazon well amazon has uh eks and they also have fargate so you can deploy your apps to uh fargate where they will take care of the scale of your kubernetes um and similarly if you decide to run airflow you can run airflow and libby on kubernetes as well so you'll you'll see this trend right so kubernetes is everywhere guess what astra runs on kubernetes right so so uh there's a theme here right you can use some hardcore technologies like amazon emr which were built for basically analytics they're generally serverless they scale up in the scale down as you need to you can use kubernetes to run anything custom or off the shelf and then you can use a service like astra to to to put your data and to retrieve your data and because astr is scalable you can have transactions happening on one end of the applications in real time and you can have analytics batch and streaming analytics happening on the other end and astro is going to scale because it's a transl cassandra as a transliteral database right they can do transactions and analytics at the same time normally if you were running your own cluster you would have to run two different data centers with astro you you don't have to worry about it because well astra is built to do both for you it can do reads and writes and it can do reads very very fast depending on what you're trying to do it will handle the request for you in the fastest way possible azure same thing right you got uh they have hd insight they also have data breaks uh i think you can get data breaks on every cloud now um they have their own version of kubernetes called aks azure kubernetes service uh and then as with any kubernetes you can run anything on kubernetes right all you need to do is to get the helm chart and bam it'll work for you so you have made a decision you're gonna move um some part of your application to uh you know serverless or you have already moved some part of your application to the cloud and you want to transform it into a service application how do we go about managing that transition that migration well first you have to take inventory okay um we at not usually break down every system every platform into the following categories interfaces software data and systems interfaces are what people use user interfaces or it could be apis application programming interfaces right uh software what is where does the logic live right or is there any particular middleware that needs to do some actual computation or processing uh data data being databases files streams uh it could be other api so for example astra would eventually fall under a data even though it it's also an api um and then finally systems that are self-contained black boxes uh platforms or frameworks that we have to interact with outside of our system uh if you have a collection of systems um you'll have common systems for example that they're dependent on so getting an inventory of everything and visualizing it helps you see the dependencies because if you're going to move one part of the application and it's going to affect another part of the application you need to know that beforehand now if you take whatever what i just mentioned right interfaces software data and systems and you ask like at the end of the day how do how does this add value to the business it's usually in the following categories there's applications that are being you know in there they're being interacted with there are services that may be running in the background um or it could be uh you know interactive apis um and then there are these are what is actually the real application itself then in the background are data operations and devops data operations are things like managing queues managing databases the power of the stream and batch processing running is there a pipeline that needs to be run um and then all of that is supported by devops right every application is powered by services powered by data operations powered by devops and every system has some component of this even if you don't have it you have no you you don't have it um so at the end of the day uh you know when we talk about migrating something you have to take an inventory to understand what you have and what you don't have because if you don't map it out eventually when you go to the cloud and eventually when you go to the serverless cloud and you don't have a devops system in place and you don't have a data op system in place you're gonna you're gonna face that pain later on right so you're going to hear me say devops data ops get ops a lot because that is what actually is the underlying skill or or practice that makes a cloud platform work it's the operations even though you're not managing your servers you're still responsible for your data you're still responsible for your software well who's gonna write the software and get it into staging and testing and production right you still have to do that and amazon is not gonna do that for you they may give you the tooling but you still have to do that so what i say start with the bottom of the stack right the bottom of the stack is what is all this stuff running on more than likely you either have on premise or you have your own uh or you're using uh you know on premise with vmware or you're using one of the public clouds um you start with the bottom and you take inventory you say what what do we use then you may or may not have an orchestration layer like terraform which is one of the uh cloud agnostic infrastructure s code you could also have azure resource management templates you could have cloud formation templates what do you what is it that you have you may not have it but you should say i don't have it we don't have infrastructure as code right um one layer up so this is kind of the devops aspect of things one layer up are the systems and components that make up uh your data right are you using a database an index uh do you have any spark processing are there any systems that need to rely um on the data for data requests for queries right is there a data warehouse component that you don't think about so you know everything is connected i would say if you build if you make a picture of your platform and you can start with your devops and build your data ops are on top of it and then on top of that you can define your user interfaces and your apis you have a fairly complete picture of your architecture the first step is you have to design even if you don't have a design you have to draw this picture and every architecture book uh i have read talks about that the best way to see the system is to to draw it out you don't have to be like really good at like white boarding you could use you know you can use whatever tool we want but if you if you don't put it into a picture it's extremely hard to know how things are connected absolutely um now each component right you have to think about how are we going to go from our current state into the next state so in this example uh is basically our this is the real infrastructure design by the way right this is we're we're using uh digitalocean for some things we're using aws for other things uh azure for backup uh google for backup and then ibm and vmware we're just playing around with some of the we're using natural language understanding api here um and then vmware we're just kind of playing around with it to see you know on-premise well how would we do this but what you notice in on top of the infrastructure is actually we're trying to use managed things right so manage services for astra for confluent cloud for for search stacks for solar algolia google firebase uh and then digitalocean uh has a kind of a mysql service that we like using um managed functions we're using actually a system called versailles versel um takes our code our node.js code and wraps it uh uh with some layer and deploys it as a serverless function somewhere we don't even know what they use actually we just know that they're service functions um and then finally there are some things that we have not converted into uh containers yet uh sorry into service functions yet and so those run on docker and kubernetes and so we're using a managed kubernetes on digitalocean to take care of that for us yep uh raul i have a great question in the chat i want you to answer sure why are you using so many cloud providers any specific reason why someone would do it in the real world sure that's a really good question there's two reasons one certain things are good and and by let's say google firebase um great authentication system right um we don't have to build out i mean i guess we could have used another vendor but we like using it we like using the firebase ecosystem for authentication and from some of the profile storage and we kept using it um algolia is one of the better indexes for making like quick lookup on your user interface so we use it um surgdax is uh hosted solar where we actually have been using solar forever and we like the power that solar gives us but we don't want to manage it so we use so we use solar so eventually all these things run on on these different cloud providers right um there are also specialized services that we can't get elsewhere so technically azure and aws they have their own um uh cognition services for for machine learning uh around natural language um well ibm has the best ones because they they bought out a company called alchemy so that's why we use ibm for certain things um so every one of these two uh sorry every one of these uh public cloud providers has something we like from them that is the best of what they have to offer right amazon has s3 there's no better file system in the world than s3 end of story right it is the like you you put data onto s3 it is globally available right azure can try to compete against that they're not going to be better than that google can try but they're not going to be better because they've been doing it for such a long time so one reason is specialization they do something really really well they offer it up as a service as a subscription we only pay for that we like it we continue using it the other is there are certain services we use as a redundancy so for example astra uh you can do it uh i don't know i think i saw a press release but you know one of the promises of cassandra is you can run one data center in google one data center on azure and one data center on aws we have a cassandra cluster that runs on three clouds okay the other thing that we do uh on digitalocean aws and azure is we replicate our our backup of our mysql database even though digitalocean does a pretty good job of managing backups and you know all that as a ultimate redundancy that if somebody were to completely screw us over right we have backups of everything on these other clouds that we can quickly come up so that's those are the two reasons redundancy and specialization we like we like these uh different clouds for that reason yeah this cycle this approach known as multicloud and actually many companies are using that yeah absolutely and that's that's the way to go you don't want to close yourself off with just one provider um you want to be kind of adapt at a few of these uh you know tools that are out there yep um yeah so for each component right you have a different route um and and each of these things you have to ask do we want to for example do we want to move to uh move all of our software from tomcat uh you know web applications to uh you know serverless java on azure functions or serverless java on on amazon or not or javascript you may not want to do that yet but the question really is how is the devops going to change from how it is now to what is going to happen next the devops is the most important function of the whole platform engineering process because like we've talked about it several times now you don't manage the hardware you don't even manage the operating system right you're managing the design of your system and how that design is translated into other people's platforms and that is a combination of infrastructure as code which you don't even need in many many times it's configuration information and it's how to run the software for your company or your platform on that particular platform so devops is is the literal like backbone the foundation of how everything works and you need to have a pathway for each system how are we going to take this current process and make it work in the next system operations is i would say as important or the next most important thing to think about just because you have your application running on the cloud doesn't mean that all of your processes that we're running on on-premise or on vms or on whatever are going to be magically ported over for you they may not work so you have to think about how are we going to move it forward we like using airflow you can have an airflow process to run your stuff as it is now and you can make another process for how it's going to run in the future and you can try it out you can test it out um services layers are very subjective we're just talking about how like you don't have to use microservices for everything you don't have to use event driven stuff you don't have to use api gateways but the question is going to come down if you're using it now do you want to continue using it in the future or if you're not using it now would you want to use it the devops for microservices or the devops for event driven are complicated and maybe you want to you want to go straight into service functions because it'll take some of the complexity away for you right um and then finally applications um where is it going to be hosted is it going to be an ios application so is is apple going to be distributing this application or is it going to be a web app that people are going to access through their browser so we want to make it fast okay so we have to use a content delivery network great which one are we going to use um we actually use netfly in versailles there's a billion out there all of the major clouds have their own versions of these by the way um great go use them um i just like using versailles and netflix and um they do a pretty good job so we continue using them if they become super expensive we may consider uh moving to a more commoditized service like you know um cloud front or or front door uh but for now they're fine they're pretty good so this transformation i would say if you begin with your devops as your phase one you will then know how your current software is going to run on your next software and so when you start to make changes how quickly it goes and runs on your platform in your staging test whatever qa environment that continuous integration continuous delivery if you have that in place your transformation is going to be much easier and if you don't have it you better not start yes exactly i like that if you don't have devops practices in place if you don't have continuous integration don't start because you whatever you have is going to be magnified yep or better to say first uh start with phase one yes uh yeah don't skip it yeah you gotta devops transformation at the beginning because everything else will be much harder now this is a picture that um is from a site uh daytree.io and i think i found it on an amazon article but basically you know git ops meaning how you manage your operations using git branches and tags and automations around it is the new normal meaning everything coding testing deployment is all done inside get it's saved inside get the configuration of that process saved inside git and then the robots take over right they take over and do the work for you as long as you save it and get in the proper way and gitops is a very big subject um the robots that you create or some that are created by other people they take care of everything for you and this is the not just the the gold it's the new normal if you're not doing git ops you're like you're behind data operations is the next step which is you've got your software it's getting deployed properly what do we do with our with our data operations when you go to the cloud and i kind of hinted at it earlier if you're using a serverless database like astra you're paying for transactions for the reads and writes so you may have operations that are being done by users or systems or iot and a lot of data is coming in right now if you need to do analytics on it you may need to gather all of that data do some analytics on it with astra you're gonna have to use something like spark or data flow or whatever you're gonna gather all of that data you're gonna have to pull all that data from astra and you're gonna have to analyze it and then push it back into astr so thinking about your data operations what are we gonna do how are we doing it now what are we gonna do that's that's phase two and when you can figure out your devops and data ops the rest of this stuff is much easier because what you've really done is you've empowered the developers to actually in parallel start to migrate over in whatever way you want to go so if you're going to figure out that hey we're going to use uh kubernetes or we're going to use uh let's say you know netlify or we're going to use um uh you know vercell you make that decision early on on how you're gonna do the devops for the front end or the back end or whatever then people that are creating the trans transformations from your current to your next their job is much easier right their job is just a matter of taking the code and following the new way that you've defined and so these two things uh the services and api and the application transformation is much much easier because you've done the legwork much earlier uh what is phase five i don't know what phase five is i i don't know um it could be that you know by the way i do i think i know what it is it's it's basically a combination of low code no code meaning clicks clicks not code plus git ops um there's so much you can do with applications with no code load you can even do data engineering with with low code uh no code platforms out there well if your company is starting to use these applications how does that translate to your custom applications how do we how do we talk to that together so i think i do know what phase 5 is but you're always going to have custom code you're always going to have your own data and you're always going to have your own applications if you're a company that exists and continues to exist and continues to grow so you need to have a strategy for your devops in order for you to support everything else devops is basically git to software right you you can use it to deploy infrastructure you can use it to deploy platforms you can use it to deploy um software and that's how you could be doing things on the cloud right now but eventually if you're going to go to serverless you don't even have to manage the infrastructure right you just need to manage your data model you need to manage what your api is going to do you need to make manage what your front end is going to do and git will take care of basically deploying it not git but get ops whatever you end up using this is going to deploy for you and somebody else is going to manage the scale right so this is eventually what you want to get to but you got to get something in place now so that you can transition into this automated way of doing things in the future um and you know these are kind of like two examples of for example using jenkins to do get ops with kubernetes um versus using azure devops right there's everybody has the tools gitlab has the tools github has the tools azure has it amazon has it you don't even have to run these tools by yourself you can just pay a company to do it for you right jenkins x is the cloud version of jenkins data operations what do we use for data operations well luckily uh you know spotify has put out their uh airflow airflow is very very popular now you can also use jenkins for data operations nothing against it you just can't do as many you know complicated pipelines data operations is different from streams by the way this is not we're not talking about event driven uh you know technology right here we're just talking about data processes pipelines um i i tell newcomers on our company our newbies right i'm like hey um all of it is the same thing get into a database get out of a database yep right that's all we do so if you have an app that is putting stuff into the database and you have an interface that that people pull out of it eventually somebody's going to ask for reports okay eventually people are going to ask you to do calculations well how do you manage the continuous processing of those operations that's what data apps is so if you can get to data operate data processes now early the future transformations are going to be much much easier and then finally get to serverless apis and apps we kind of talked about it earlier um but these days you have millions of options to host your custom api um and your custom front ends um you don't have to do that so you know netlify can store your your uh netflix netflix can actually do some serverless functions as well but uh i like netfly for just the html css you know the raw static files uh versel does um node applications and next uh next.js applications really well we use next for a lot of stuff that's why we use versailles vsel are the people that made next um and you know ultimately uh if you're using uh astra you may have some layer around astra that you want to deploy um that maybe takes two different tables and does a join and and gives you that information or it it takes a transaction and saves data into three different tables whatever you're doing with astra you're gonna have to have some middleware right and so that middleware has to sit somewhere you don't have to you know bring up a vm i would say use heroku that's an easy everybody knows how to use heroku use versailles if you want to go a little bit uh more complicated more powerful make containers make services on docker and deploy them using aws fargate it'll infinitely scale for you so lots of options to deploy your applications and so that kind of you know brings me to the close of today's session okay which is you have a lot of things to think about when you're planning your migration it's not just your data you have to think about your devops you have to think about your software deployment because having the right fundamentals in place is really going to make your job a lot easier next time when we meet next week we're going to dig deeper into the data operations because well this is data stacks and we're talking about astra so we're going to talk about how do we migrate data to astr how do we migrate data from relational to to postgres sorry for let's say a relational database like postgres to cassandra in astra um and what are the tools that we need to have in place so that as we're developing our applications we can have our old version of the software running as well as the new version so that we can cut it over properly right you guys know that you don't want to it's just like one of my uh uh favorite sayings for my dad is you know don't quit your day job uh unless you get another job or unless your business takes off i would say don't don't quit your old application until your your new one is up and running and and perform it right so you have to maintain both you have to maintain with how are we going to do that we'll talk about that next time um we have a bunch of resources uh that you can find um on consider that link um but you know that's that's pretty much it guys i don't want to keep you guys too long i know folks are signing in from india and europe and it's late um but if you have any questions just put them in the chat and um but that's about it for tonight from me all right i have two more points so uh first of all thank you so much for joining i've seen there is dozens of people stayed vivace till the very end and i want to say you are the best of the best because you want to be better developers better engineers better administrators architects and so on and that's what makes us better in our job learning doing improving and so on and so forth so thank you very much for joining uh second i see there are people writing questions and that's amazing so keep writing we will answer them we have time before that i want to proceed with the next things um and next thing is uh cassandra is great but again a state there are big problems there are not enough qualified people to handle cassandra and because of that many companies afraid to use that because they know what they cannot hire good enough engineers but you know what there are appeal some people who are ready to be those engineers like you because you attended this workshop datastax sponsors your certification and education in this field so if you go to the academy dot datastax.com https academy.datastarts.com you can pass the courses preparational courses for the exam and with a voucher you will get to uh for attending this session you can get both the training and certification exam absolutely for free if you pass the exam it's a real exam so like it has to be strict uh you will get you will become a certified apache cassandra developer or engineer or administrator and those guys are in high demand over the world so it may can make your professional life much more interesting and second point i already said what astra it has a very nice free tier but if you already uh big enough and you are above this free tier which is uh well first of all big success so my congratulations uh if you already certified for cassandra you can get a voucher to get this thing to uh you can get a voucher for astra for 300 to spend on your astra project so astro db and astro streaming and give me a moment to get a link uh so i will send the link for you uh so you will be able to claim your um bonuses now meanwhile while i will be looking for the proper link i can transfer some of the questions to you so give me a moment first raul however well that's uh raul uh hoyak project i don't know sorry how to pronounce the last name uh asks amazon aurora is how different from astra is uh getting from cloud yeah and moving yeah so aurora to astra how would you compare that that's a really good question and uh i have a good story about how they're different uh so aurora is uh they claim to be a masterless mysql but they're not a distributed database um each node in an aurora cluster has the full copy of the database and so when you write to one it it technically replicates the data to others and vice versa so if you have data as it grows um even though aurora is managing the replication into different nodes your your your database server still has to vertically scale okay so i'm not going to tell you which project uh which client this was but um they they had a uh they had a service that stored uh user profiles and they uh moved it from cassandra to aurora and eventually because of the demands of the application they needed to have 20 aurora servers to manage the reads and rights to be able to do that many reads and rights okay the same load only needed three servers of cassandra because aurora is also locking right it's a transactional database it's doing the locks every time you do an update and it was locking the databases and it was uh and and i don't think they were using the right uh engine for for my sequel but basically you have row level locking you have table level locking that's why they needed 20 servers because they had locking and they had these tables that were related and so uh ultimately um that's one major difference is aurora is not truly a distributed database it's still a monolithic database it just does your applications for you cassandra is a distributed database it takes your data and it partitions it in an intelligent manner around a cluster so if you have 100 servers right let's say you get that big the client that is looking for the data does not need to go to a central load balancer to get that data it can it knows where the data is because of the partitioner so pure cassandra does that for you now when you compare astra to to aurora you're taking what cassandra has to offer and then you're adding this layer of not having to manage the underlying cluster astra can do way more transactions with less hardware and way less cost because i know how expensive aurora can get as you grow especially because you have to replicate the data onto every server so sorry no no no no why sorry i'm completely agree yeah i want to mention what uh in general i uh well my heart belongs to cassandra for sure we i have i have but there is no silver bullet so aurora can work in my sequel mode and postgre sql mode and it's actually a great database actually all of them so i don't know what they have under the hood mostly probably postgre and they support both of them apis uh well they both based on standard query language and it's all managed because it's aws aurora and aurora is great database i know there are success stories like samsung i believe was quite happy with some of their migrations to aurora for example not complete migration but only some parts and uh it all in the end depends on your requirements like the question is if we ask it like way what is better aurora or cassandra it will be like a question what is a better wrench or a hammer range is good when you use it in the right way hammer is good when you use it on the right way if you will try to use hammer as a range it won't work very well and the same is uh they both are good they are for different scenarios with cassandra you don't have a vendor lock-in because cassandra is apache software foundation non-commercial non-profit open source foundation support our first of all our aurora belongs strictly to aws and there are so many differences also what was mentioned by raul now uh okay i would like to take this one uh how mongodb is different from cassandra yeah we i do think we need to run a dedicated workshop on that because people ask that all the time is one of the most famous um databases in the nosql world and for a reason it's a great database i use it for many years uh first principle difference there are many differences again and very a question which is better will be the wrong question you know my position on that hammer and range both are great if you use them in the right moment so first big difference cassandra is a schema streaked so you create tables you define design of your tables is kinda schema-less because you can just throw any kind of documents and it will store it technically schema exists but it's hidden from the developer it still consumes disk space and so on it exists but it's hidden from a developer well then when you scale you can scale quite a lot for read operations and cassandra for sorry a for read operation scales quite well as cassandra does it too but if you try to scale for right operations you will write in you will run into very big problems very soon because mango  is not scales very well for right operations it's not decentralized and there are primary replicas secondary replicas or read replicas and primary replicas are much harder to scale and they are the only one you can write to you cannot write to a read replica it will drop your connection or will drop your request and cassandra is a truly decentralized database so it scales as well for rights as for reads from the scaling point of view cassandra is definitely a real really stronger solution so i would say thinking of that first thinking of which you should pick uh you have to understand what's the pressure you're going to have on your database are you going to have global active active data centers in europe united states and asia simultaneously because on global multi data center deployments cassandra is better do you need to be able to use document api do you need your video to have this flexible schema or schema less so you could use  if you required it to have less flexible or maybe you can go cassandra plus stargate to use document api which is flexible schema with all the benefits of cassandra so those are the main differences there are actually more but we have limited time next question goes to you i believe um okay that is a great question arlando rivera junior asks i would like to learn more about becoming an architect ah great it's a good good uh uh question um so it's it's it's a statement but you know i i got praised i praised that because you know um when i uh first started in technology um i wanted to be an administrator because i i thought that you know administration was uh really cool to be able to build things and then they just kind of ran what i realized after being an administrator is that you can do cooler things by being a developer and as i became a developer and an engineer what i realized is that architecture is actually a combination of knowing administration and engineering and then understanding how not necessarily but a lot of times understanding the business problem and how engineering and operations slash administration are going to help solve that business problem so now there are different types of architects there's building architects there's technical architects in uh in technology you can have a data architect you can have a network architect you can have a systems architect you can have a platform architect um architecture is is about being a lead uh technical person right the word architect arc archon i'm actually in greece right archon means like chief right and tech is about building so so an architect is a chief builder right master builder and to be a good architect you have to be not only good technically uh with administration operation engineering but you also have to be a good communicator you have to be able to basically tell a story because you're you're telling a story to the business stakeholders about why you should do a certain thing a certain way and why you need to spend xyz money um to buy this software or that software right and you need to be able to communicate with other people that you work with that are engineers that you're leading because you're the leader you have to communicate to them what needs to be created so good architects are good storytellers that are able to take a very complex problem draw a picture oh you have to be pretty good with drawing pictures but like not like you know uh an artist but just being able to draft an idea right um but uh there's a really good book uh i found a while ago uh it's called um enterprise architecture as business strategy it's a harvard business review uh book highly recommend you read it it talks about businesses and how they took architecture technical architecture to transform their businesses and it it goes through the the four phases of every big business transformation which is uh silos right every every business starts out with silos of information they talk about standardization of the platform then they talk about uh creating a uh a data core and they talk about business modularity and so that book was the first time i saw how technology transforms companies to be more effective and i think at that point i really wanted to be an architect because i was able to understand what i was doing was actually helping businesses which were helping customers which were helping you know everybody live life basically right so really good book enterprise architecture as business strategy highly recommended that's interesting and from my site i would add one thing for me to be architect is to be always a little bit one step ahead of hours in the knowledge point of things in uh when we talk about which particular um one two three okay looks like we are back my point is when you then your team discuss uh which particular solution you need to use uh for for this particular service are you going to use or aurora or cassandra or astra or looks like we are live hey guys if you can hear us and see us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat because at this moment i don't understand if you can see us but looks like we are live looks like we are live okay so um yeah okay good really so uh what i mean is in general i don't mean to learn any particular topic uh because although there are a lot of particular topics you have to learn but what i mean is you have to make the habit of learning and always knowing you never know which next technology will become a new docker i mean not from the containerization point of view but but something will really change the world what will be the next cloud you are going to use and so on so it has to be a habit of learning make a habit of reading books related to your fields you have to work with a lot of the databases read database internals by alex petrov you are going to work a lot with different highly loaded platforms uh work uh the book what was it um one with a big on the face i just forgot my name uh that's not about a particular name that's about the habit to learn that what brought me to a place i am and that's what helped me to always be a better engineer than i was yesterday yeah absolutely i i think what you what you're describing is um you know there's there's what you do right there's your performance and then there's how you get better which is your skill yep and i would add one more which is your personal development which is when you get better at what you do you can do more well are you able to then handle that stress right because architectures architects end up having more responsibility right so you have to grow as a person you have to grow professionally to be able to to take the responsibility because you end up being an architect of a platform that is serving thousands of users right it's it's responsible for the the livelihoods of people that are working like you have to be able to know the things and be able to to manage yourself basically i think it's it's a leadership quality i think but uh skill development is a continuous process uh everybody that's here watching the the webinar right i would say uh i spend maybe three to four hours a week at least at least uh reading new things watching watching new videos at least but it ends up being more because on a given day you you run across a problem and you have to research it and you have to learn something new right so um yeah it's a job learning is a job uh just a second i'm answering a question yes i found it there was a question about apache pulsar or astro streaming solution content and um there is a shirt or spoon good so yes that's it and i believe the answer answered the question or at least we did our best trying yes and uh last one i believe how do you recommend using astra for multi-tenant application can we have something better than application level isolation so from my point of view when you want to organize installation on the database layer which definitely makes sense you can use multiple key spaces or some so for some cases you can use different databases which will still be the parts of the same organization yours um i'm only not sure what to be on which scale do you mean multi uh tenant organizations because i don't remember whatever recommended amount of key spaces and whatever recommended amount of databases we have for astra but astra in general should be completely compatible for multi-tenancy so let's completely find multi-tenancy when you have a lot of data of different clients that's no problem for cassandra of course yeah what i would add is that it depends it depends on the nature of your software and it's in its purpose so if you're if you're making software that has an economy of scale of having multiple users and businesses or whatever you're making multiple tenants on your system so that you can do some aggregate data operations then your multi-tenant design is going to be different you're going to be using the same key spaces the same tables but with different uh you know segmentation in your actual design right customer id would be one of the fields versus if you don't need to have that and you know that your customers are going to scale and your application is built in such where a customer can have a key space and that's it then i mean that is that is probably the best way right if because you're not managing the complexity of the cluster if you can say here's a key space and everything is going to work for the customer and you can put the devops around it even if a database uh at astra i don't know what the limit is but the point is that like you can just make another database right um it's abstracted you don't have to worry about it i i would say with astr you could go either way you'd be fine um yep uh raul could you please repeat the book name i will copy paste it to the chat so people will uh sure what's enterprise enterprise architecture as business strategy okay looks good um then um raul uh asks um a good session when possible some more session with anand architects uh well i'm not from anand corporation i'm pro datastax but i believe we make a good team now a next session because this one was a part of three episodes next session comes one week later exactly the same time uh two words maybe around what are we going to do then sure so we we talked about a lot of things today about the general strategy we're going to talk about next week is data operations and it's what type of data operations we need to prepare for in order to to do a proper migration while running an old version and a new version of the same software uh and without having any downtime right that's production systems can't go down so um some uh technical uh kind of abstract knowledge and some very specific tools and technologies that can help you along the way yep okay and our time is over at this moment i want uh to say many thanks to uh raul singh and many thanks to our attendees thank you alex for hosting i appreciate it and uh yeah thank you all for showing up uh glad you guys are here yep uh see you again uh next week and don't forget like and subscribe our youtube channel datastax developers has more workshops to offer uh next one we are going to do tomorrow so you can be our guests thank you and see you again a little bit music for you in the end to enjoy the end of this found one new now i have more room no more formats to change [Music] [Music] cool [Music] you",
