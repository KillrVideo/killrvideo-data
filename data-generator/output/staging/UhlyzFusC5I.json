  "description": "David Gilardi talks with Holden Karau of Google to mine many wonderful nuggets on the future of Spark and find out what might happen if she had a magic wand of awesomeness.\n\nHighlights!\n\n0:15 - Welcoming Holden back to the show\n0:30 - So what exactly is going to be in Spark 3? Significant updates to the SQL and Machine Learning (ML) APIs. There are missing pieces in ML API, adding them will cause breaking changes to existing models. One example is support for online model serving.\n2:25 - The DataSet API does not yet fully cover all needed cases, causing developers to jump back to RDD APIs, so some API changes will be needed there . There will be continued performance improvements in query planning in minor releases.\n3:13 - Python changes could include changes to handle Vectorized UDFs in the RDD APIs\n4:35 Why it’s so hard to pin down when Spark 3 will appear: breaking API changes have to be worth it. We need to wait until the payoff in capability is worth the breaking. An example would be making ML APIs typesafe.\n6:57 - What Holden would change in Spark, given a magic wand - shared memory buffer between languages using Apache Arrow\n9:46 - Wrapping up - the most exciting change likely to be in Spark 3 in online model serving\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 5.1\nDataStax Enterprise 5.1, the database platform for cloud applications, includes Apache Cassandra 3.x with materialized views, tiered storage and advanced replication. Introduced in 5.1 is DataStax Enterprise Graph, the first graph database fast enough to power customer-facing applications, scale to massive datasets and integrate advanced tools to power deep analytical queries.\n\nLearn more at http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise and https://academy.datastax.com/resources/whats-new-datastax-enterprise-50\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastax?sub_confirmation=1 \nSite: http://datastax.com \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/datastax \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastax \nLinked",

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] distributed show I'm Gabe Gilardi a Technical Evangelist here data stacks and this is holding from Google thanks and so let's talk I want to I want to hear about spark three that's like digging is part three what can you tell me about what's come with part three awesome so it's hard to say what exactly is going to be in spark three because obviously it's an open source project and we haven't even super decided like when we're gonna start making this book to you but there's there's a bunch of interesting issues which are sort of tagged for spark three and I think there's support three sort of is going to give us this opportunity to reevaluate we've done in the sequel and the data set space especially and also the ml space the ml API is our have served us very well so far but I think we we really there's a bunch of things in them that are sort of missing that we need to fix ok can you talk about on any of those ours that's Tokyo no I mean like it's I mean the things I can talk about are not necessarily the things that will end up fixing but you know there's things that I think we should fix and I have some level of input by virtue of being willing to write code and merge it and so one of the things we've really struggled with is online serving for our ml models and I think there's been a lot of resistance to sort of changing that API because we if we add things to do online prediction to the existing API we're gonna break the other models that have been created by sort of third parties and that's another thing you want to do in a minor release is something you want to do it in a big release so I think that's one of the things that we can sort of expect in spark three is better support for online model serving okay which is to me really exciting we're laying the framework now right there like TV has been amazing has been doing a lot of work on the local and your algebra stuff but we need to do the online serving but the API changes are just fundamentally gonna have to wait I think there the data set API I think is is a really interesting API and I think it's it's very good but there's still cases where people are having to jump back to the RDD API so they work done yep and I think essentially we're probably gonna sit down and try and really make sure we recover as many of those cases as we can some of that stuff is gonna you know continue to happen and the 2x time frame right like one of the big cases with the data set API is like iterative algorithms like machine learning have some performance problems because of the way how we do query planning and we can we can continue to improve that with in minor version releases okay but like a big rewrite there would probably be part of a larger change on the Python API side you know there's the vector as UDF's in spark 2.3 that's going in that's fine okay but I think we don't have necessarily the same support for doing that for rdd's and other things like that and we might start investigating like selectively applying this here there's some interesting stuff around sort of trying to turn byte code into things that spark is more capable of working with or being able to understand some of the byte code which is essentially admittedly it's kind of a mad scientist project it's like I wish to make an optimizer over and previously compiled language yes my pretties and we might succeed at that we might not but I think that's that's another kind of thing which is like when it's a mad science project like we have to get the science at least looking like it's not gonna burn everything down right well we can put it in but that's not a thing that I would expect in a minor see there okay yeah that's okay so you're going my mind a little bit honestly cuz that is a lot of stuff well I mean right like if your so there's there's this sort of mentality if we're if we're gonna change the world yeah we might as well make it worth it right like I'm gonna break your application anyways I might as well do all of the things I wanted to do that's um I mean only obviously like we're not gonna break your application for the sake of breaking it yeah but like it makes a lot more sense to do it I mean in one sort of tearing the bandage off okay okay you got all the stuff you're gonna break all these things right in a good way yeah I got a big major change here so what's gonna happen wait you have a timeline here you can give us I mean that's that's a that's a really good question and I have no answer yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry so I mean sport three will happen eventually obviously I don't think it's gonna be like pro six and so I pretty clear all happened before my death but you know it's it's probably not gonna happen too soon people are still debating so even though you think this is a lot of like big important breaking changes there is debate over if these changes are important enough to be worth doing right okay sure all this stuff may be actually on the plate to do but you're definitely going to take a look at them and kind of see which ones are relevant or not well no it's more like if I'm gonna break your API is right like I want to make sure I I'm giving you enough benefit right so if the benefit that you get from those set of things that I'm doing isn't big enough then let's hold off until we get to something even more right like you know there's so I mean this is honestly it's not likely to get into spark three but there is for example one of the places where where it could make more sense is there's talk about making the m/l api is type safe and this is this is a little sort of left field okay right but like if we if we succeeded at that like that that would be a really important big change right like yeah and that would be a lot easier to sell to people as like yeah this is gonna be painful but like the time for the pain is now yeah and it's it's all about selling people on pain yeah if you can help unruhe leave some of the pain even though they have to make a change yeah that makes sense yeah absolutely okay so is there is there anything particularly what would you change if you had a magic wand what would you change yeah so if I have a magic wand I would switch us into using a shared memory buffer between all of the different languages I mean and we're getting a lot closer to that being a reality rather than like I've had too much vodka and now I'm talking about like API design decisions realistically it's it's actually scotch but you know I think that's possible with arrow and we'll probably start to see this slowly but if I if I had a magic mangi we do it like this year and that would be awesome and then we could just like have these shared memory buffers ship them off to the GPU we could do all sorts of crazy things and I would be super excited yeah so what kind of I mean so from that particular case if you've had that wand like and it was actually feasible and you tried to do that like do you have any I'm gonna go back to your time frame thing do you have any idea like like is that something is it like if you were able to do it would that be like years out or is it gone I think that's that's so I mean if I had a magic wand we'd be talking now yeah cuz like of course [Music] yeah cuz I'm a mágico very nice yeah yeah supermagic but like given that I don't have a magic wand I think that this might happen in the next ah sorry I'm faced with the traditional software engineering decision of like as soon as I say a timeline ia I am screwed yeah I understand so like in the next year or two could be maybe yeah or something like I think I think well we'll see limited implementations of it this year and I think okay fully maybe two plus what I think sooner rather than later okay but I also thought I didn't have to learn portrait so know you're having a dig in for tennis yeah that's awesome I mean I'm not that's someone else's job but like underneath the hood right if you want to make weird vectorized operations on common or data it turns out that through a whole bunch of that code Florida it's all written in Fortran heads Wow I I spent two days trying to call a hello world and Fortran and so that gives you an idea of my qualifications to work on this problem which are limited at best so yeah I can't say that I have a Fortran in my in my background either so I'm there with you no that's fun that's fun if that's there so alright we've talked about all these different things that are going on it sounds like there are a ton of changes coming this part three out of all of those things though is there anything in particular that you were just totally stoked about that you're like so happy that this one particular change is coming up yeah I mean honestly I'm not super certain which of the Python changes are gonna make it I think the one which is most likely gonna make it that I'm really excited about is the model serving I think we really we really need to improve that and it's really exciting to see the work happening there and I think it's it's gonna it's gonna save so much effort for so many people because right now everyone that I talked to has essentially written their own model serving code okay and for some reason no one's willing to open source it because like politics well maybe not politics but like you know Marvel serving code tends not to be your prettiest code and then you feel bad about it and you're like oh I just want to fix it a little bit before I share it and then that never happens yeah and so the fact that we're gonna like just just deal with it head-on because it's really exciting to me that's cool and then you know or don't mean like like two person shops don't have to waste all their time unless they can just you know have a party okay I'm also really excited about an opportunity to update my books and some more copies cuz like dollar bills you owe dollar fifty book I need to start writing books I missing something here ya know well I mean are you currently paid below minimum wage no I'm okay okay so then marina book is maybe not the great ROI system for you but updating a book yeah cuz then even sell new copies with like way less work that makes sense okay that's that's my hope so you should all buy both the copies that are available today I love it and the new copies although available whenever we finally get around to releasing part three girl nice so thank you again holding it was awesome having you on the show and thanks everyone for watching another episode of the distributed air show thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data stacks Academy and tell us what you think you can also find
