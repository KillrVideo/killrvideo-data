    "text": "[Music] now that we understand the basics of the property graph data model let's start to explore how we can do things with dse graph managing graphs in dsc graph is similar to working in any database we can create graphs list and modify graphs and remove graphs note that in dsc a single graph is associated with a key space in apache cassandra any operation or configuration that can be executed against a key space in cassandra can also be executed against a graph just like with any database system before you can begin working with a graph schema you have to create it creating graphs in dsc graph is easy just use the system api and use the create graph method you have an option to check to see if a graph already exists as well just like with data sax's version of apache cassandra graphs created in multi-data center clusters should use a dse database network topology strategy setting and a replication factor greater than one the default replication strategy for a multi-node or multi-data center graph is the network topology strategy whereas for a single node the replication strategy will default a simple strategy the number of nodes will determine the default replication factor as shown in this table it is quite straightforward to create graphs with network topology strategy and custom replication factors network topology strategies should be used in production the replication specification syntax is identical to the syntax used in the cql create key space statement here we see another way to set the replication factor for a graph here we see an example of setting the replication setting for a graph we have a graph called test four and we're setting a network topology strategy replication setting with two different data centers dc east with a replication factor of 3 in dc west with a replication factor of 5. on this slide we see another way to set the replication factor as well as the topology strategy we use the option and use the set method along with the option so here we have a graph called killer video and we are setting the option replication config and we're using the set to set it to network topology strategy and we're setting the two different data centers dc east and dc west each with three and five for the replication factors the describe method of the system api is very handy to see the ddl that was used to create a graph as we'll learn in later sections of this course one can also use the describe method on a specific graph to get the ddl that was used to create the contents of the graph here we see some example code where we're looking to see if a graph named killer video exists and it does we then use the describe method to see the ddl that was used to create the graph and we see system.graph killervideo.create was used to create this graph to find all graphs in your dse graph cluster use the graphs method of the system api you can see here on this example the difference between the describe method which will show how each graph was created and the graphs method which will simply list the graphs that exist in my cluster removing graphs from dse graph is pretty straightforward simply use the drop method to do so so here we're going to drop a graph named my other graph by simply specifying system.graph my other graph dot drop as you can see there are parallels with apache cassandra schema management and dse graphs graph database management here we see a table showing the same syntax in both graph using the system api and cassandra using cql we're going to create a graph on the left system.graph create and underneath the covers the following cql is actually executed create key space and create the other key space we'll talk about these key spaces in just a second same parallels exist for drop using the system.graph dot drop method is equivalent to dropping key spaces manually through cql finally and i highly recommend you do this you can see the actual key spaces created in the cassandra when creating a graph through dse graph for each graph you create using the system api you'll see two key spaces in apache cassandra the first contains the graph data itself while the second the one with the underscore system name contains graphs metadata and schema information okay it's that time again for you to put your hands on keys and exercise all that new knowledge you gain in this section of the course happy graphing",
