    "text": "I'm going to show you how to install Mission Control using our embedded server runtime uh so I have provisioned uh set of VMS in uh AWS ec2 so you can see that I have a uh control plane instance which will be used to uh be the kubernetes control plane uh the primary uh then we have uh three platform VM which will host the observability stack so that's graphon Mir lowkey and uh Vector in our case and lastly we have six uh database uh VMS which will use to run uh DSC and Cassandra uh processes so I'm going to SS sh into my control plane and if you head to the documentation of Mission Control uh here you have the server runtime uh installation procedure and we'll head straight to this command line which will perform the installation uh so it will both install the runtime uh which is kubernetes in our case uh and uh Mission controls so I'm going to slightly change this to install our latest uh data release uh but most likely installing uh stable releases will be uh about using uh just the mission control URL so let me use inst stable here of course your uh license file only um binds to a single uh release Channel the installation of the control plane uh instance is finished and we have a few interesting information that will save for later and for now we're going to focus on this last one so first we're going to make it so that um processes uh for the database uh and uh the monitoring stack don't get scheduled on this uh control plane node so going back to our documentation uh we will run this command which will taint our primary so that it doesn't get any pod scheduled okay so now we can proceed with this command and we'll install the platform nodes so let's add to our first platform instance in order to make sure that the right processes get scheduled uh on these platform instances uh we're going to add a label to indicate the runtime that this is a platform node installation has completed for this platform node so uh we will proceed uh with the same uh command for the next two uh platform noes installation of the platform nodes is uh complete uh so we'll head back to uh the output of the primary installation and you'll see here that we have a URL for CS ADM so this is the tool that allows you to install configure and upgrade Mission Control itself so let's head to that page let's bypass the PLS warnings you can upload uh your own uh certificates if you do not want yeah on the screen if you don't do not want to have the the PS https warning anymore so we'll just proceed and then here on the L next line we have the password that we need to enter here and now I need to upload my license file so I'm going to pick the one that matches the channel that I'm installing so I'll land on the uh configuration screen for U Mission Control so we're installing in control plane mode um you need to provision a bucket uh for metric storage uh through graphon Mir and log storage through lowkey so in this case I'm going to use GCS uh I have a bucket available there so you see that this service account field has appeared uh so I'm going to put in the service account Json that will be used to access the mimir and Loki buckets so I'm going to give my bucket name here for mimir that slightly bigger and then I'm going to give the Loki bucket name and here you'll see that we have the default uh admin user uh that's populated uh but you can specify your own username email and password uh for that uh admin user and lastly you have the Dex connector um configuration so we support L app or open ID and open ID gives you access to a wide array of um authentication system so I'm just going to proceed with the admin user so it Ransom check to verify that we have all our prerequisites so now I'm going to hit deploy and the installation will go on while this is running uh you can see here at the top that we have a cluster management uh tab which allows us to see all the uh servers uh or instances that are part of this mission control cluster uh and you can see at the bottom here that you have a addon node button uh which will allow you to uh get that command line to expand the cluster uh for future needs okay so uh Mission Control moved uh in ready State uh and is up and running uh we expose Mission controls UI on all servers that are part of the cluster uh through the 3880 port and here I can log in log in into mission control so I'm going to reuse that admin user that was created as part of the configuration sign in and I'm logged in into my mission control UI so next I'm going to proceed with the installation of the database nodes heading back to the cluster management tab we're going to get that command to add a new node and we're going to SSH individually into all of the database instances and run our Command and we're going to specify our Ro label and this time we're going to set it to database note that you can have multiple servers joining the cluster uh concurrently that's that's not a problem if you want to move faster with the installation process all the nodes have now uh joined the cluster so you can see that we have a mix of platform and database nodes and our list is complete uh so we can now proceed and create a project which is how we organize uh clusters for DSC and Cassandra so I'm going to create a demo project in this project I'm going to create a cluster which I'll name demo uh we'll use DC 6841 and we're going to create a single DC with a single rack and since since we have six database noes noes uh we're going to use them all and uh start six nodes okay so here you see you have some resource requests so head to the documentation for more information about this it's going to control where uh your uh DSC processes will get scheduled depending on the available uh resources so let's use 12 gigs of RAM uh let's use default storage class we only have one available here and let's start these nodes with six gigs of hip and you can see that uh the hip uh that I can set is at most uh half of the available memory cluster created so it's currently updated and after a few minutes uh the whole cluster should be up and running all six nodes are now uh up and running as you can see and we can for example head to the observability uh Tab and see that we have our metrics let's make that a little bigger metrics are flowing in and we can access the logs uh uh for our cluster for more information on data Stacks Mission Control just head on out to datas stacks.com products Mission contr Control there you can find all the information you need including downloads and documentation thank you and have a great day",
