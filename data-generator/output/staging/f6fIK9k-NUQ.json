    "text": "[Music] hi I'm Tim Bergland and this is introducing data stacks enterprise graph graph databases aren't new to the world but they are new to a lot of developers so I want to take a few minutes and explain what data stacks Enterprise graph is all about basically what a graph database is and a little bit about its internal architecture now it is a real-time transactional OLTP graph database and it's based on some battle-tested open source components there's Apache tinker pop that's kind of the basic graph data model and the traversal language comes from tinker pop Apache Cassandra of course this being data stacks Enterprise provides the underlying storage layer some full-text search and indexing features can be provided by an integrated Apache Solr and of course there's Apache spark in there for fast analytic traversals but data stacks Enterprise graph is a little bit more than the sum of those four parts some of the other features of the product like for example comprehensive enterprise grade data security are fully integrated you've also got management and monitoring with ops center and of course visualization with data stacks Enterprise Studio which is a really cool way to interact with the graph and look at visualize sub graphs so with the addition of graph 2 data stacks Enterprise we have a true multi model database you still have the good old Cassandra tabular model which is good for many many transactional applications and you've got this new data model of graph let's talk just a little bit about the architecture of graph now the front-end that is what you as a developer see when you interface with this database that looks like Apache tinker pop that's a property graph we'll talk about what that is in just a few minutes and the gremlin traversal language there are also some proprietary API elements that we'll cover in detail in other parts of the course but that program our front-end that's really the thing that you see as a developer when you're using graph now if you go all the way down to the bottom of this diagram the backend that's Cassandra that's solar that's spark those are kind of the heavy lifting data back-end of data stacks enterprise now the way in which a graph is represented in the distinctly non graph database of cassandra and the way certain types of traversals are enabled by solar and spark to a large degree as a developer you don't have to worry about that that's the thing that's done in this diagram by what we call the middle layer that schema that's the actual representation of graph data and the way transactional and analytic queries are mapped onto that back-end what you see as a developer is basically you see tinker pop you see some proprietary API elements you know from an operational standpoint that this is being implemented in terms of these things like Cassandra and solar and spark but you don't really have to think about that mapping you really get to engage the front-end learn those front-end api's and that middle layer does the translation for you so what you end up getting is a scalable graph database now historically that's a very thorny problem to solve and it's a thing that data stacks Enterprise graph does for you now let's dig into that front-end a little bit and talk about Apache tinker pop it is kind of a general-purpose graph computing framework it isn't a graph database itself but it's kind of an interface and a model for how a graph database ought to be sort of a graph database API it provides a structure and it provides a process for accessing graph data or traversing graph data that structure is what we call a property graph now property graphs are very intuitive simple expressive flexible data models briefly what are the components of a property graph well you have vertices or sometimes people call them nodes in this diagram those are the blue circles that say things like person user genre movie and those represent individual entities out in the world so an actual vertex in a graph will be a real person like Johnny Depp or the movie could be an actual film like Alice in Wonderland it's not necessarily a type like a generalized film or an actor or something but each vertex is a specific thing the edges between vertices model the relationships between things like Johnny Depp is an actor in Alice in Wonderland we haven't for that Alice in Wonderland as a movie belongs to the genre adventure probably belongs to other genres too but those edges model those relationships now each edge and vertex in a property graph is kind of like its own little map its own little mini key value store and so they have properties those model the attributes of entities and relationships you can see here for example there is a user in the middle of the diagram there and he is male and age 12 and those are some properties of that user and he has the rated relationship with the Alice in Wonderland movies rated Alice in Wonderland that relationship has a property and that's the rating of five so you can see some really simple things that we would do with things in the real world are very easy to model with a property graph now to query a graph database we're going to need a different language Cassandra uses cql which is a lot like SQL which is kind of everybody's default mode that's the database query language that we expect to see graphs are so different from relational databases though that we need a different language in this case we use gremlin gremlin is technically turing-complete it is a functional language but what we use it for is not general-purpose programming tasks but describing graph traversals and occasionally also describing graph mutations now this is the thing that we will spend a lot of time covering together there's a lot to learn about gremlin but let me just show you an example of a gremlin query here you can kind of read this there's some boilerplate stuff in there that you just kind of have to trust us we need the G dot V and that sort of thing but it really looks like we're looking for something in the graph that has the type person and the name Johnny Depp that looks like that specifying a property and it has an incoming edge with the actor type and that thing would have an incoming edge if you look back at the graph diagram that would probably get us to a movie so if you start with a person the incoming edge of type actor that's going to come from a movie probably we want the movie who's year is greater than or equal to 2010 and then at that point whatever movies are in that universe that is whatever movies Johnny Depp has been in since 2010 we just want the title and the year and our sample output here we've got three of them into the woods Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides and Alice in Wonderland so you might not be able to write gremlin at this point but it is a little bit readable it's not too tough to look at you can kind of get an idea by looking at a gremlin query what it might do again lots more to learn there but I wanted you to have a quick look again a look at the open source technologies that power parts of data stacks enterprise graph remember that middle layer super important does the translation from tinker pop to all this stuff so you don't need to think directly about these components all the time but you should know that you've got Apache Cassandra you get the best distribution of Apache Cassandra down at the bottom there that's actually storing vertices edges properties it's storing indexes its handling real-time querying that's always there storing your graph data some types of graft reversals can also be powered by solar which will do other kinds of indexing and of course full-text search which solar is good at and there are some analytical types of queries that actually get translated into Apache spark jobs so optionally spark can be a part of the equation and help accelerate some types of OLAP graft reversals as well the secret sauce that makes graph so valuable is the mapping of the abstractions of the graph database that's that's the tinkerer prop API to the backend so how do you model a graph in Cassandra if you know Cassandra maybe your mind is going right now you're thinking how would i model a graph in a Cassandra schema well we've done that for you so that mapping is done and the translation the storing of the vertices the relationships all that stuff happens for you and then the actual execution of queries and how efficiently to do tinker pop graph traversal or gremlin graph traversal z-- against that data model either in sort of a transactional mode the OLTP kind of query or analytical queries that we might even do by compiling down to spark jobs all that stuff gets done by the middle layer super valuable is what makes graph a useful product and not something you have to build yourself when you need a graph database you are sunk without one but of course you don't always need one it's good to have some guidelines to know when should I be thinking graphs when should I not now just a couple of thoughts for you there if your problem domain is naturally represented as a network web graph something like that if it lends itself to that if when you're diagramming your domain and debating it thinking about it and try and explain it to people if you go to a whiteboard and you find yourself drawing edges and vertices that's a sign that you may need a graph database also if you find that the problem focus is on discovering connections and links and relationships when you do sort of old-school relational data modelling or newer Kassandra data modelling you do think about the relationships in Cassandra data modelling we actually create tables to reify relationships that we describe in our data model so we build in those relationships into the data model and that's also true of as I said older school relational data modelling that's a thing that you design when you're trying to discover relationships and links and dependencies when you don't always know how to get from A to B or what the meaningful connection from A to B is and when you're describing your problem and trying to solve things when you find yourself focusing on that sort of thing that's another sign that you probably need a graph database that of course is bottom-up reasoning when you're thinking as a developer trying to solve problems you kind of have these smells and you're in your design discussions that suggests maybe you need a graph from the top down we can also think of kinds of applications that lend themselves to graphs now Internet of Things is often a classical time series problem that's that is not a graph problem but there are interesting networks that can pop up in large-scale IOT deployments where you need to model them with a graph and a scalable graph the broad category of customer experience applications this is a thing that people are building it's a very hot topic right now sometimes you'll hear it talked about under the heading of digital transformation but really this is a set of applications that try to give businesses a comprehensive view of what a customer is doing sometimes we call that customer 360 or if you're trying to build some kind of a tool or platform that gives your customers a single view into every way they can interact with your business often that kind of application surfaces problems that are fundamentally graph problems there are other things like personalization recommendation engine fraud detection classical graph problems but this exciting new customer experience category is a thing more and more companies are getting into and you may find as a developer as an architect that is on your menu in the future it's likely to be and you probably want to be thinking about graph as you engage those new opportunities you [Music]",
