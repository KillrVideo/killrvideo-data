    "text": "perfect foreign well good morning everyone or good afternoon or good evening depending on where where you're located want to welcome you to data stacks's workshop on building spring applications with spring data and no SQL and I see we have a number of people online already would you let me know in the chat if you're hearing my voice and this isn't just the normal mic check this is uh the first time that I'm presenting a workshop solo so I just want to make sure that the voice is good and I see uh yes we are and loud and clear excellent so welcome it's great great to have all of you on on board uh during this Workshop we're going to be looking at Spring data and Apache Cassandra using our hosted Apache Cassandra service uh Astra but I'm glad you're not going to bite thank you Kevin uh because I have too many screens to look at I may not see if you make a comment or something so I'm kind of scanning as like as I go through this but let's go ahead and get started we'll have a little bit of housekeeping if you'll take a look we have at data Stacks we have a number of courses available to you on YouTube on our data Stacks devs Channel and please uh make sure you subscribe to the channel so you get updates as we come out with new content constantly uh if you have questions you can ask them in the YouTube chat we also are on Discord and our runtime environment for this we're going to do all of this in online and get pod so if you have a GitHub a GitHub account you're able to do this there is no local install required now of course if you want to install things locally you're welcome to do that but for simplicity's sake we're gonna do everything online we're not going to have quizzes during this section so you can ignore the piece about mentee and I'm going to add one other link up here and that's and let me see if if our bot knows it um yeah the but if you take a look at the chat the bot recognized the bang Academy and we have a number of courses online they're Hands-On uh with video guidance and quizzes and everything at datastacks.academy so that's sort of our housekeeping and introduction let's go ahead and get started my name is David Chung I'm a developer advocate here at datastacks and you can find me I'm not really a big Twitter user but I'm online on Twitter at chungfu coder you can connect with me and Linkedin I'd love to connect with you and get to know you a little better and I'm on GitHub at Dr chung5 by way of background I come to Cassandra after a long long career in the Java world I've been in the industry about just over 30 years and started working in Java when Java was in beta I have some people say that's a long time you've done a lot of job on the answer is yes my license plate in one of my cars is Java and my phone number is 431-5282 and 5282 is a mnemonic telephone code for Java so my phone number is 431 Java but the proof that I'm really a Java person through and through is that I have eight children which and I live in Iowa and the midwestern United States where you can do something like that have have large families I have eight children whose names all begin with J you know where this is going right when my wife was pregnant with our eighth child I suggested that she should be called Java Rose Chung since Rose was my wife's best friend's name growing up I thought you know using my thinking Gap there maybe there's a chance well it was at that point that I discovered I'm not really in charge of names so Josefina Rose Chung who's spelled her name the Spanish way Josefina is very thankful that as she puts it I didn't name her after coffee but my background professionally I'm a developer architect I've spent a lot of time as a trainer as well working in all forms of java from embedded Java to machine controls real-time defense and Aviation and of course Enterprise systems and have come to Cassandra the way many people do and that is after having spent time in relation working with relational databases Oracle MySQL Maria DB and others and I'm enjoying working with nosql working with Apache Cassandra but it is a different way of thinking about data all right enough about me let's go ahead and take a look at where we're headed this course has five sections and you can go through it sort of different ways if you are new to the technology or maybe you're a python programmer not a Java developer so you know it may take you a little longer to follow some of the Java stuff don't worry you can just follow along the video will be recorded and all of the materials are available on GitHub so you can do this stuff at your own Leisure you don't have to follow along with me you can follow along if you like or maybe you're an expert and you're just picking up specific things like how to connect to our hosted Cassandra service in the cloud which is astrodb you can do that as well but there will be five Hands-On Parts using uh get pod in in GitHub so we'll have a chance do you to do that I'm just moving my screen so I can take a look at at your at your comments a little better so it's closer to my eyes all right so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be building a thermos using spring data that connects to Apache Cassandra and this Apache Cassandra we're going to connect to is our hosted Cassandra service running in the cloud it's our astrodb and using spring data we're going to build a rest API that lets us access data stored in Cassandra so a very common use case for for spring and spring data is to build a rest API and what are we going to do about a user interface well our Focus really isn't on the user interface so we're going to do we're going to use a a common user interface from a project called to do MVC to do MVC is a project built by some engineers at Google to Showcase multiple web Frameworks for building MVC applications everything from asps to react to angular to you name the web framework they have a version of it in this to do MVC prod project and they expect to connect to backend services using a standard API there are also multiple backend services available and we'll connect to one of those and take a look at it as well so we'll use the to do MVC front end and we'll use a to do MVC back-end service and connect and connects the two and then we'll replace the back end service with a spring data or you say spring based service and we'll use in-memory storage in that spring service and finally we'll configure Cassandra Astra in the cloud and replace the in-memory storage in the spring piece with connections real connections to our Astra hosted Cassandra service so in the end once we have everything running we'll have the to do NBC pre-built user interface will have our spring data service and that spring data service will connect to Astra so we're not really going to build the front end we'll use a pre-built pre-built front end to make it simple and let us focus on the spring and Cassandra Astra pieces all right so that's where we're headed so we're going to create a to-do application we're really going to use the existing to do application we'll create a repository with a rest API that's going to store data in memory and then we'll connect as part two we'll connect that to-do application or really connect the spring boot piece in the middle we'll connect that to Cassandra Astra and we'll have the whole thing running then using spring boot Cassandra Astra and the pre-built to do MVC front end so that's where we're headed and let's take a look the first thing we'll look at is gitpod this application is going to run in in GitHub and we're going to or be hosting GitHub we're going to use gitpod to run it I'm going to bring up the get a GitHub home page and this is the home page has all the information so this is the readme file has all the information you need to go through and work on this application a quick note there's a trick here that you'll you'll see in order to prevent the readme from being super long it's broken up into different pieces and the authors of this Workshop broke it up into different branches so instead of having one massive readme file we have multiple readme files so if I look here in GitHub I have the main branch part one part two part three part four part five and z-e-n-d of or z e and D for those of you not in the United States and the reason it's called Dead End is because alphabetically uh Zed comes after P which is used for part and we wanted to show that piece of blast so what we're really going to do as we move through the different parts main part one part two part three is in git pod we're going to look at the main readme and then for the part one we'll switch to the part one readme and we're really switching branches within the repo there's the part two readme when I first looked at this at this Workshop I was trying to figure out how we were switching from part to part but we are switching across branches it's a little bit of magic there to to make this work and prevent prevent us from having one single massive readme all right so the first part we're going to end hello Paco for the Camaro for the Canary Islands great to have you uh we're going to create the to do application we're going to look at and exist we're going to look at the to do MVC framework we're going to look at an existing front end and an existing back end and then we're going to create a rest API to a spring boot quote unquote repository that's going to store everything in memory later on we'll cut in part two we'll connect that to Cassandra Astra so this is the to do MVC project and you see the the goal was to Showcase these various Tech stacks and here are the back ends their back ends in Azure and accent some of these I've never heard of uh dot net Django c-sharp we'll be using the C sharp back end uh couchdb you name it there's a ton of them the reason we're going to use the C sharp uh back end you may ask why would you a Java programmer choose c-sharp isn't C sharp the natural enemy of java the reason is some of these back ends are hosted or were hosted on a service called Heroku which no longer does free hosting so some of these back ends are not currently available and the c-sharp back end is hosted on Microsoft Azure so it is available in running today yeah so in this to do NBC you can go to this back end index and you can specify the URL of the back end you want to connect to you can also specify if you want to test a back end you can go to Specs dash index.html at to do backend.com and put in the URL of a back end you want to test so the the top lets us run the NBC app it's a simple to-do app with a back end and the bottom lets us test the back end we're going to do both when we build our spring data back end first in memory then later connected to real Sandra Astra we'll test it because there's a set of tests pre-built to make sure that backends meet the requirements or meet the contract of the to do NBC API so we'll do that and then we'll use it to do MVC clients and hook up our back end Bursar mocked back end and then our real Astro back end and we'll test it that way so this gives us a pretty cool framework in which to play with these Technologies so we're going to look at the first Hands-On piece in in GitHub so I'm going to go to that GitHub repo and I'll go directly to the repos Base address so this is the same picture you'll see and the repo link is in in the chat so when you get to the repo you'll get to this readme page and we're going to scroll down and I'm going to launch get pod and I'm going to maximize this and I'm going to accept the workspace defaults and this is going to bring up a vs code in the cloud workspace now a note I'm at datastacks we use some variations of get pod and there's an issue in my browser it seems to be caching some stuff so you won't see exactly what ice what I see here I'm gonna have to do a little magic to get rid of some of this stuff you won't see this stuff because you don't have this cached so I'm going to close these two windows and I'm going to preview readme.md and there is an issue that comes up it's asking about a different Java runtime don't worry about that I'm going to close out the window and the warning is not going to affect us I'm going to preview readme.md open preview and again this is a vs code interface so I'm going to close the file explorer and now we have the instructions or are hands on piece for those of you just joining us don't worry if you're not able to keep up with the Hands-On this will be recorded and you have access to the repo later so you can do this at your leisure and you will have access to me and others of my colleagues on our Discord channel in case you run into any issues so we're happy to help you both during the workshop using chat or Discord and after the workshop on our Discord Channel so if you take a look here in the readme as it says there's nothing preventing you from doing this on your own laptop other than it's more work you can get the important pieces by doing it all in get pod and I encourage you to do that so we've already launched get pod we've done this step step one launch get pod and we're seeing this now we're not having to import into the Java pieces and now it says know your git pod so I'm going to open up a terminal and again this is a vs code interface so up here in the hamburger menu those three bars I'm going to say terminal new terminal so it opens up a terminal and I'm going to run this command GP URL and I in order to paste because this is a web interface I have to give permission so I'm going to allow the paste and what this does is it gives me a URL that's exposed that's publicly exposed we're going to be running spring boot our spring boot application runs on port 8080 inside get pod and port 8080 for my particular get pod instance is exposed at this URL so I'm going to copy that and what I like to do is I'm going to just open another window to that URL you'll notice it says port 8080 isn't found and that's to be expected because so far I haven't I haven't started running anything in gitpod and I'm going to buy myself some more space and just hide my bookmarks bar so buy a little more screen real estate all right so know your get pod we've got the URL at which port 8080 will be publicly exposed next we're going to check out part one remember we said that the way this these Labs progress is not one big readme file but different uh different branches so I'm going to check out part one and that will switch the branch we're working with and it should update this readme it didn't so what I'm going to do is say refresh and it should let me refresh there that's fine I'll close it and read me open preview and here's my part one so we'll open the preview again and that should be yeah we'll we'll come back to it foreign has joined us welcome welcome Aaron all right so spring as I mentioned I've been working with Java since Java was in beta and that that means I spend a lot of time working in jwee before it became je and all of that those Frameworks that sun and the Java Community put out there but if you know the history of java spring saves Java and spring made Modern Java the Java Enterprise Edition was too too heavyweight too complex and spring simplified uh simplified job and we have spring to thank for the the ongoing success of java after after those early days so what is spring if you are a job job developer you most likely know know about spring top to bottom but if you're not a Java developer spring is a framework that is based on inversion of control working with interfaces and what we mean by that inversion of control is that instead of explicitly instantiating and using things you know controlling it from your application your application says I want this interface okay well in interface is an implementation your application doesn't care it asks the framework and the framework provides the appropriate implementation of that interface that's inversion of control so here the traditional application on the left we have a component implements I'm sorry we have a component implements greeting service that's the interface and the implementation is this component with inversion of control on the right in the Constructor of this component we get greeting Services a greeting Services reference passed in and then we call greeting Services say hello it happens to be that the framework will pass in this greeting services but you might in a different instance of the framework you might pass in a greeting services implementation that speaks French and says bonjour or something so inversion of control working with interfaces decoupling implementation from interface and allowing that to be selected by the framework sometimes on its own sometimes with guidance from from us at runtime very powerful idea there are a lot of pieces to Spring that will use spring to build microservices and that's maybe the most common use of Spring today there is also reactive spring which allows us to build asynchronous services non-blocking architectures so we don't even in Java all along we've had a traditional blocking architecture Java Services have worked that way since the beginning in the Jee j2ee days and the idea was you had a server a Java server that had some fixed number of threads clients would make connections up to that number of threads so if we had 10 threads we could serve 10 clients concurrently and other clients either couldn't get a connection or had to wait for a connection with the reactive framework it's asynchronous and non-blocking so multiple clients can be working with it all at once there's a lot to that spring also has it works in the cloud very powerful framework for web applications it can be serverless event driven there's batch stuff a lot of stuff from Spring at spring.io but we're going to be focusing on the microservices and web facing pieces today hello Mohit and welcome everybody it's great to see uh to say you see you in our Workshop in Spring boot Springwood was really a cool framework when it when it came out and remains to this day because prior to this time if you build applications spring or otherwise you had to deploy them inside an application server and this was tomcat and JBoss and I worked for with weblogic server for many years an oracle application server all these massive heavyweight complex servers and you deployed applications in them today spring boot allows us to deploy Standalone spring Boston years I'm with you on that Aaron uh allows you to create Standalone spring applications no need to deploy War files and what that really means is no need to deploy in a standalone application server spring boot uses an embedded application server in this case we'll be using Tomcat to allow us to deploy spring boot applications in a standalone environment and in a microservice environment in the cloud where we may be deploying multiple service instances in separate uh Cloud compute uh components this works really nicely and simplifies things dramatically so spring boot simplifies your build configuration it also integrates a number of third-party libraries and provides features that we used to have to build onto applications for metrics health health checks configuration you you name it those things are provided for or can be added to Spring boot applications very easily so you have the presentation layer and for our spring boot application that presentation layer is not going to be graphical it's going to present the services of the spring boot application as a rest API using using a rest controller there's the business layer that provides the logic in Spring Boot and then the persistence layer which initially which initially will be a um an in-memory storage and eventually as we get to the end of this session we'll transition to being in our hosted Cassandra Astra and you'll notice the slide says inversion of control between all of these because each layer is is decoupled from the other and the framework is going to um pass references to or create references to the layers so the business layer the presentation layer will get a reference the business layer the business layer will get a reference to the persistence layer it only needs to know about the interface not the implementation so pretty cool framework we've talked about the idea that you have the reactive stack and the servlet stack so the servlet stack is the traditional blocking request for thread model I talked about and the reactive stack uh the reactive stack is going to be support streaming I see uh pow and forgive me if I pronounce your name wrong um pal is a question about unit tests what do we really have to test why do we do unit tests we do integration tests directly with test containers um unit tests are going to be done at a lower level before I when I do integration tests I want to be testing components that should work together but a unit test is going to tell me that the component works in the first place so if I do an integration test and something breaks maybe it broke in the component maybe the integration between them is fine but the back end component isn't working so before I test accessing the back end component I want to test do a unit test to test that the back end component is in fact working so a unit test is a smaller test and it looks like someone is asking a question in Russian and normally my friend Alex would be on Alex valoshoneff who would be able to respond to that I believe it's Russia it looks like Cyrillic alphabet but I apologize I am not able to read or speak any any Russian and I don't think my friend Aaron is either so I apologize I'm not able to respond to that so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to move on and look at creating uh the spring boot app and we'll talk about how that works so we're going to move back to GitHub and I'm going to see if I can actually get this to work so let's see what read me okay this is the part one readme so if I open the preview it gives me not the part one readme I'll get around that this way now it should be able to refresh the preview wasn't that a slick workaround but we got it working so I'm going to go ahead and be happy with that okay and talent your gitpod says that your jdk is not updated uh how do I configure that pretty cool answer ignore it so go ahead and close the window that's asking for it and close the warning Paco and thank you for mentioning that so I have the part one readme open it took a little bit of work to do that so let's take a look we're going to run the existing to do application remember I said that this to do MVC framework is a series of front-end NBC applications and back-end applications to showcase the implementation the various implementations all using a common API so you can pick a an angular front end and a.net back end and hook them together then you can switch it out for a Ruby on Rails back end if you like so it's pretty cool so you could take a look at to do nbc.com and this is a look at the various backends that are available as I said some of these were built on the Heroku framework which no longer has free hosting so some of these are not actually live today but there are a large number of them and in this Workshop we're going to use this back end which I said is this a c-sharp back end so I'm going to click on that and it's going to take a minute to come up and I see the I love Java and yes I love I love Java too now you'll notice this back end returns an empty Json uh empty Jason because there's nothing stored up there right now but it is working and we'll we'll show that in a minute so that's the C sharp back end the next thing is there is this spec Runner the spec Runner is going to use this and back-end endpoint and run tests and part of the to do NBC framework created these tests to validate that new back ends do in fact meet the requirements so I'm going to use this GitHub command GP preview and this is going to I think this one works is a little bit flaky but let's do it anyway what this is going to do is open the test engine the spec Runner and you see the second half of this URL is the URL of our back end and this may not work yeah it failed okay and don't ask why if I take the URL that failed and run it in my browser directly it succeeds I'm not sure what what magic is going on there but if you take a look what it's doing is it's running a series of tests does the API respond to a get to a post to a delete after delete can you do again can you add items can you order items can you modify items so it's a comprehensive set of tests for the API and guess what when we build the API in Spring boot both the in-memory and the asterisk Cassandra backed version we're going to use the same tests to make sure we're compliant but there was that strange Quirk whereby it didn't run in the embedded browser in gitpod but if I run it on my in my Chrome browser it runs fine that's not sure what's what's going on there so I'm going to close the embedded browser which didn't quite work the other thing to note is so this is the test this is the back end we said it was empty now if I do this you'll notice that the back end there are Now entries you know title blah blah and blah they're all three total blah how'd those get there they got there because that's what the test did the test did a bunch of inserts updates and deletes and now you see them in the back end all right so we know that the back end works we saw that it passed the test even if it if that be careful if I double click on that it opens the readme source and now we're going to test with the web client so I'm going to click on the web client and you'll if you can see that link that pops up the web client the second half of that URL uh the second the second half of the of the URL is the URL of the back end so we're going to connect to the web client using that C sharp back end and you know we're doing it because they're the blah blah blah entries I mean at a new entry fubar and if I go to the C sharp back end you'll see that my entry Foo bar is there so the web front end that we've chosen is using the c-sharp back end and really storing data so I'm going to ask you think programmers can replace be replaced by chat GPT but what I would say is that some things programmers do can be replaced by chat GPT and I don't see that as being threatening uh I come I mentioned being in the industry 30 years I've actually been working with computers for closer to 40 years yeah so that makes me an old guy I did a lot of machine language stuff in the old days and you know we used to talk about the week having to use high level languages because they couldn't do bit shifting well it's been a long time since I've done any bit shifting in machine language code and with each technology more and more of the tedium is being done automatically or automagically including spring so I think there will still be room for programmers I will tell you a little inside baseball at data stacks and I'm sure many companies we are encouraging our teams to use Ai and be smart about it and use it to help us in uh in our jobs not just developers but marketing folks and everybody and everybody so yeah we are in the cusp of a very exciting uh some very exciting changes and yeah you could get me distracted pretty easily all right so let's let's go back so we've chat we've tested the read me the to do front end and now we're going to create a spring boot application so if you go to uh the spring I spring initializer and there's no e in Spring initializer this lets you specify what you want to um what you want to include in your spring boot application lets you specify uh the version the extra libraries you can add a ton of dependencies out here all sorts of things whether you want to do this in Java or kotlin or gruby all jvm based languages of course and then lets you generate the starter project we've given you a link that has all of these values populated already so if I go in here's the link uh the group artifact and name the description the package name com.datastacks.workshop the Java version It's Java 11. this will be package there's a jar file which means that it will run on its own it doesn't require an application server so don't worry Aaron we're not going to be talking about JBoss at all anymore last time we'll mentioned it today unless someone pulls me into it on chat but I'll try to avoid it and we've also specified some dependencies we want spring data for Cassandra which provides simplified access to Cassandra or Astra Dev tools for spring boot spring web which lets us build restful apis lombok which is for those of you are not Java programmers Java does not allow you to automatically create data classes with Getters and setters so lombok it does that and yeah Samir I see good good to see the use of lombok though even though I'm a Java developer through and through I'm also a kotlin developer and you don't have to use libraries to do that in kotlin you can just use kotlin data classes and the spring boot actuator which lets you use custom endpoints to monitor things that's what we talked about some of the Enterprise features that you can add into spring and then you can generate and this will download um a zip file that creates the spring boot project in our application we're not going to have you do that because that download just downloaded it to my local machine not to get pod the environment in which we're working so we've already done that for you in gitpod so in gitpod I'm going to change to the directory into which the spring data stuff was downloaded and I'm going to use maven and we'll do an install and you're going to find this fails yeah so it fails because it's not able to do uh it's not able to make some connections so step 3B we're going to fix that we're going to have the spring boot application ignore like a couple errors for now of course ignoring errors is normally not a good thing don't worry about it later we'll fix the errors and we'll take the ignore out so I'm going to use and remember this is a vs code interface so I'm going to use Explorer and I'm going to open the to do spring data application it's in Source Main Java right there and I'm going to take the spring boot application annotation and paste in that these two errors from these two classes or these two classes are going to be excluded in the configuration so we're not going to do the Cassandra configuration because we haven't defined the contact of Cassandra figuration configuration or connection information so now that I've done that I should be able to run it again now we see it passed its test the one test that's implemented and it is up and running and let's see on Port 8080. and if I go to port 8080 you'll notice I get an error page the application is running and listening but I don't have a rest controller there are no mappings to incoming AP incoming urls so yeah it's running but saying this is an error because there's nothing on no code that's really listening uh for anything here so there's the error page the author's using the embedded browser I'm preferring to use the external Chrome browser and says okay we can fix that by creating a rest controller rest controllers in the spring take HTTP requests and map them to code in Spring this is the trivial rest controller and we're going to put this in the workshop hello directory so the hello director which will map the hello package and it's called hello world rest controller all right so there's the file and I'm just going to copy the code directly from here and this is about a simple arrest controller as you have in Spring the purpose the rest controller is to take incoming requests and now we have the slash so any incoming request that matches to that and we're going to handle it with this function which returns hello world uh we're not yet doing any of that inversion of control stuff to speak of we're not haven't built any interfaces just so we this is just so we have something that responds because you have no idea how many times I've had people run an application get an error page like this one and say the application isn't running actually this error means the application is running because it's the application itself that's telling you that this is an error page so the application's running I'm going to go back I'm going to shut it down on Ctrl C here we'll clear and we'll now run it again with the hello world rest controller or if I go out here now Port not found is a different um is it's a different error the spring boot application is running and you see when it started we see the hello world and I should probably fix this because the original hello world from the kernagan and Richie c book from the 1980s form some of you were born I would think uh was hello comma world it's like endospace after world all right so let's go back and pick up with our readme so we've been able to run that and the next step is we're going to move to part two so we're gonna end up checking out and I'll close a killer it's running in the terminal and copy and check out part two okay all right so we've looked at the back end and use the client in the back end to connect to the C sharp pre-built back end so the client connected to that we use the specs to test the client excuse me to test this the C sharp back end and you probably know where this is going right eventually we're going to use the test to check our spring boot back end first in memory and then finally connected to Astra Cassandra so the next part is to create the controller and remember the controller in Spring boot is going to map URL patterns to code we've already created a simple controller that was a hello world controller but that's not really part of our app we just did that so we could show it was running and how it worked we're going to create a more complex controller and one that eventually will implement the full API of the to do MVC so we're going to switch back and let's see that's the part one readme I'm going to refresh it and see if we get to the part two readme yes at this time it went right there so there's a part two readme and create a quad controller um anyone know what crud stands for or where it came from might be a better I think we all know what uh stands for where it came from uh you know we use crud for you know to stand for a databases create um great read update and delete and we see that often tied with rest with restful apis and restful interfaces and slipped my mind the name of the guy who came up with with rest the the idea for rest and if you know it put in the in the chat um it comes from the doctoral thesis of one of the one of the key players in the early days of Apache Foundation and he he was responsible for or influential in the URL the URI spec the the HTTP specifications as well as the mime type specifications so it's no surprise that his doctoral thesis which defined restful interfaces uses HTTP Uris and mime types heavily and a lot of people say well restful interfaces are quite interfaces and again the guy's name escapes me but he will tell you that nowhere in his work does it talk about crud people added that on later so not not something that the founder is fond of but he's stuck with it it's the way the rest of the world thinks of restful interfaces so we're going to create a crud controller we're going to look at some sample commands using curl and then we're going to test the controller so remember we went and looked and tested the back end API that was this you know we just went to the URL and in restful can following restful conventions this should select all to do's or I can specify a specific to do by specifying its ID and that ID is a uid a universal unique identifier so that's you know following restful API conventions so the back end is already a restful interface and when you when you look at the output you see something like this oops and that's what we see here there's an ID completed as false there's an order number is a title and there's a URI URL for for this entry okay next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a Java Bean called to do because this is a to-do list so it makes sense that we have to have to Do's created so we're going to create a to-do and that goes in a new package called to do so under let's see under Workshop new folder to do and new file to do.java and I'm just going to copy the contents the basic Java being it uses the longbach data annotation which means that it's going to get a set URL and get URL method set completed or and is completed method of following Java Bean conventions so that's our our to do I'm looking over at the left and I made a common error uh in the previous Hands-On and that is I put my hello file in the wrong place you'll notice there are two that when I in when I switch to this branch and get in in GitHub it pulled the hello rest World rest controller from the workshop you know Com data Stacks Workshop hello package mine was in the com data Stacks hello package so that's an issue I'm just going to delete the old one and it doesn't matter we don't really need the hello anyway that was just there temporarily so now I have my to do we'll go back to the readme and look at the next instructions and now we want the to do rest controller in the same folder so it's going to be in the to do package or folder so I'm going to say to do new file to do press controller.java all right let's look at the contents you'll notice we have those methods that we all call crud methods and then we have some spring annotations some more spring annotations we have our cross-origin settings so we're going to allow these methods across across origin and we have the request mapping so this controller is going to listen at slash API V1 to do's and get requests will be mapped to this method gets forces a particular unit will be mapped to this method post request map to this method and the request body will be in oops if I double click it uh brings up the the source for the readme um and post bodies will be passed in to the method and there's also a delete mapping or specific or delete which is a delete all so that's the let me copy that to do rest controller okay so that's our rest controller and that's the operations that we need to support right now it doesn't do anything returns no returns null so we've created that and now it says hey create the rest controller complete the rest controller using an in-memory data structure and the author says a real simple way to do this would be to create a map because you're going to be retrieving things by you would so a map with uid's keys and to do objects as values make sense and says so the author says Hey use a concurrent hashmap mapping from you would to to do's and the way Within These methods to get a URL is you use the HTTP servlet request object and say request.give request URL to string and that returns the request the request URL and with that you can go ahead and build on an application we're not going to take time to do that there's a you know there are a bunch of different methods here and we would definitely run out of time if we do it so I'm going to cheat and I'm going to complete both of these classes for you and if you look here there's a link to the completed version of them they're actually in a different branch remember each step of this Workshop is in a branch we're in Branch two right now I believe I think the solutions come from Branch four or Branch five but I'm going to pull the solutions I already actually have them in an editor separately first I'm going to pull the to do solution this to do is a perfectly um a perfectly valid Java Bean but we're going to add some more functionality to it uh you know checking for nulls and that and that sort of thing and add a couple different Constructors to it but it is essentially a Java Bean and I see as our Creations is asking about uh Badges and there isn't a badge for this particular Workshop so night nightbot is configured correctly responding so here's our Java Bean with some extra Constructors so you can construct to do using the title and the order the title and the order and whether it's completed are the possibilities you can set the URL get the URL and then the other Setters and Getters will be generated by lombok the to do rest controllers a little bit more complicated but here's what it looks like now and we've created a concurrent hash map just to map uids to to-do's because we're going to retrieve them and store them by youit so that makes sense and for the get mapping we're going to return the stream of all the to-do's so we use the hashmap to do store values stream and then we map it and here searching for a specific unit we're going to call get passing in the key because our store is a hash map and we get back into to do if it's null we're going to return a response entity not found if it's not null we're going to return the response entity and um and its URL and the post mapping again we're going to do a put so a number of operations implemented also there was one other in the create uh creating a to do The Constructor this Constructor calls this Constructor and this Constructor creates a random unit that you would so how does the someone who posts know what you would is associated with their insert and the answer is restful conventions say that after you do a create or or do an insert you're supposed to return the URL of the newly inserted item and that contains the uid that's why when we did the post it's gonna it's gonna return the the URI as part of the response entity Vie Avenue uh Azari you're saying there's a an issue with dependencies yeah there were a couple of flaky things that that happened here one make sure you didn't do what I did and have two hellos two hello packages because I had that error for a while when I was working through this and it was because I had two classes with the same name and package name stored within my directory structure once I deleted the one that was out of place then the dependencies worked because it wasn't it wasn't generating the lombok Getters and Setters was the issue I had right so let's go back to the readme we're now going to try to run it you shouldn't need to create a new app okay now something happened here it started and sorry if you don't get it this might be one you can take into um into Discord since I don't have a co-presenter who can answer questions well well we go on um well Bob if that's yeah thank you sorry but it's Visual Studio code in gitpod so it's just a an online version of it so the application compiled and it's running and it brought this up the answer is why well it comes back to something we said before this is the hello the URL of the restful services and I'm copying it from my notepad off screen is this if I do this now you'll see it's empty why is it empty because we're using the in-memory spring boot application and we haven't created any to Do's so I would fully expect it to be empty it's a good thing it's empty all right let's take a look all right so it's empty that's good and yeah you see the expected output again I'm not using the embedded browser but right there in the upper right I remember not to double click on that in the upper right corner you see the embedded browser is empty so here's some curl commands that you can run against it I'm going to open another terminal not the one spring boot is running in I'm gonna use the Plus sign down here to open a new terminal and I'm going to run this curl command so you'll see the curl command returned the new entry its URL and it has a uett a title completed as false an order is zero if I go out here now and reload I now get that and that single entry so now we're talking to our spring boot in memory client and there's a number of other tasks here to get a specific I'll do this one this is to return an entry by it to you it and I'm going to copy the uid from above oops I needed to replace the boilerplate code and it returned the entry as it should and there are a number of others deletes and so on yeah Aaron I I think the problem as Hari is having is not directly with the palm dot dot XML I ran into that and it was because in the previous section I created the hello rescue World rest controller in the wrong directory and then I had two and it failed in compilation but it showed up looking like a lombok error but there was a lot that went into figuring that out all right so next thing we're going to do is we're going to test our rest controller this is cool so oh and by the way it may not work anyway say Dave you just said this is cool it is cool but I've for me the embedded browser has been a little flaky so what this says is G preview which means we're going to open up in the embedded browser don't double click on it this URI to do backend.com specs index.html that's the test engine and we're going to pass it the URI of our internal service so we're using the get pod notation gpurl 8080 slash API V1 uh to do's and this is going to run the same test we ran on the c-sharp back end with our internal back end and we'll see if it actually runs the embedded browser it didn't but have no fear as I said the embedded browser has been flaky for me I'm going to run it here and you see it run it ran so our back and how do we know we're testing our own back in because we're testing 8080 slash data Stacks Dev Dash Workshop Dash get pod IO you know that's our back end you could choose a different back end and throw it in here if you wanted to but what this tells me is that our spring boot back end meets the requirements of this API even though it's only story data in memory and if I go to let's see I want to go to our back end you'll see now here's the entries blah blah blah blah and blah that the test engine added so it's pretty cool our back end passed the test that's that's the goal we wanted you know the API was defined beforehand and we're building the back end to meet that API well if that's the case if our back end really works with um you know really implements the API we should be able to connect to any any one of the front-end clients to it and we're going to do that with this command so to do backend client.com client index.html and then we pass in that gitpod notation for our Ur internal URL I think in this main network is going to be on the embedded browser okay it did work it did not work in the embedded browser and you may say well Dave what do you mean it didn't work there's a to-do list the front end worked in the browser but we don't see the items these items that are already in the back end already stored so once again I'm just going to copy that URL and now there's the blah blah blah and if I enter a new item pick up milk at the store and I want to go to the back end and there's pickup milk so it worked we built that back end piece we ran the test Suite against it predefined test Suite we met the requirements so we hooked it up to a front end implementation and use the front end implementation to both View and modify the data stored in the back end so maybe I want to get rid of the blah and the blah and I'll go back here and two of the blahs are gone so now I just have one action block and another one pickup milk so to me that looks like our middleware piece is working now we're not yet connected to Cassandra there's no long this is all in memory so it's not persistent so I'm going to advance to the next part and let's see we'll refresh this guy and now that's part three all right so we've we're done with part two we've created the controller and an in-memory Repository the next part we're going to move to the cloud it's actually it's all been in the cloud but we're going to move to hosted Cassandra in the cloud and that is Astra so we're going to take ultimately our spring boot code and connect it using spring data to Astra Cassandra spring data is a really cool part of the spring framework because it lets us get by and simplifies the connectivity and the mapping from Spring boot to Cassandra Cassandra has its own query language called cql or Cassandra query language and yes it sounds a lot like SQL but for the basic queries you know find by ID find all delete by ID delete all patch by ID you know that sort of thing all those are generated for you now if you have more complex data and more complex queries then you you do have to write some of the code for that the query code but for the basic crud operations spring data does those creates those for you sort of Auto magically so very very cool piece Astra Apache Cassandra is oh and Aaron you have to correct me is it 12 years old 12-ish years uh just just over 10 years around around a dozen uh years old Astra is what Apache Cassandra would be if it were designed today in a cloud native world you can think of it as hosted Cassandra in the cloud it supports all the features of Cassandra shares a lot of code with Cassandra and the benefit is it it runs in the cloud it's managed for you by data Stacks does eliminate operations I would say it's low Ops not no Ops but low Ops is a good thing because there's a lot that goes into Cassandra operations I come from our service team and our service folks spend a lot of time helping custom yeah so about 12 12 13 years helping customers with the management of Apache Cassandra and kubernetes and VMware all kinds of things Astro allows you to let data Stacks do that for you in in the cloud it's secure it simplifies development and reduces operations it's also Cloud agnostic rendering now in the cloud you can have hybrid clusters Crossing Cloud boundaries so you could have an Azure and gcp Cloud if you want you can have data centers in different locations take advantage of regions or zones within your Cloud vendor space so a lot of cool features of Astra Astra also has a number of ways to access it there is a framework you see the top icon here under devtools there's a an API called Stargate and Stargate is an open source API that sits on top of Cassandra or Astra and allows you to access it a number of different ways it allows you to create a rest API it allows you to use graphql that allows you to use a document API if you want and there are others and a growing list it also has a built-in console so you can run dql commands directly through the Astro graphical user interface so let's take a look at the database part Astra I'm at Astra that's astride cassandra.com and I'm going to sign in right and I'm going to go to step three so step three is what we're going to do we're going to go to astro.datastacks.com and you can create an account I'm using my personal account with my email but you use GitHub or Google uh Astra has free usage up to a limit you get a use a monthly usage credit and the nice thing is it's you do not need to register a credit card this is not an opt-out you know after 30 days you have to opt out or you end up paying uh you won't accidentally cross the usage threshold and start paying if you cross the usage threshold we're of course going to ask you and invite you to pay but we will not data sex will not keep your credit card information so there's no danger of you running up a bill by doing this in fact I work for data Stacks I have multiple Astra accounts for you know for workshops and expiration and all that and data Stacks doesn't have my credit card so don't worry about it it's a pretty cool deal when we get there we're going to create a database it's going to be called my free tierdb you can actually call it what you want but that's what the lab suggests and the key space will create a key space called to do key space a key space is similar to a schema in a relational database and it is a grouping of tables and some other things like user-defined types but a key space allows us to organize things within a database we'll also choose the database provider and depending there are different providers available in for the free tier and then if you were in a paid tier there's a larger set of two providers we'll then create the database and you'll see the databases pending in in the dashboard so I'm going to jump right to that and do those steps Hands-On now I already have a database called myfree tier so I'm going to create a different database I'm going to click on databases create database I'll call it ywdb and the keyspace dummy it's in the Google Cloud and I'll choose a region and for those of you especially those of you outside of the United States I'm based in Iowa in the central United States and you've probably never heard of it but anytime I see Iowa you've got to stand up uh for my state so I'm going to choose the U.S Central One region from Council Bluffs Iowa there's a data center there actually there are a lot of data centers in Iowa because uh the costs are low electricity is inexpensive and you see the operation Operation costs are going to be different for each region but 36 Cents for a million read requests see I think we're not gonna We're Not Gonna spend 25 dollars worth so I'm going to create it all right it's going to take a minute for it to create and you'll see its status is in pending I'm going to switch over to the database that I already have and just show you some of the features of Astra there is an overview and this tells me about the database it tells me the ID I can do things like you know I can get more details and so on about it tells you about the key spaces I have one key space the to do key space defined I've just had a few read and write requests it's just a a toy database you were in Des Moines for a few months nice worse weather in the world we have cold Winters and hot summers and it's humid with when it's hot but we like it here there's a health Tab and this gives me some monitoring in grafana you know so look at requests errors latency size you know number thing clients or no clients connected currently but I can set a refresh time for data I can set you know how long it would look the last seven days or you know I can set up how I want to view data we'll come back to this one this gives me information about connecting and I can choose different ways to connect apis drivers sdks other and mybov asks it do we have observability addressed through this Ops dashboard the answer is yes but Astra is multi-tenant so there are some bits of observability that you don't have because it it would give you visibility to information possibly about other tenants running on the same um on on the same nodes Astra is serverless of course there really are servers it's not actually serverless but you don't have to worry about servers one of the things in cell posted Cassandra is if your needs you know if you need to grow your cluster it's up to you to bring new nodes online and there's a process involved or worse if you have to be elastic and shrink and grow based on maybe seasonal demand it's a process to grow the cluster to process to shrink the cluster since Astra is zero Ops or as I prefer to say low Ops you don't have to worry about any of that stuff and it acts as a serverless server there's also a cql console that's going to let us run queries and commands directly in the database Astra also supports streaming and there's a Astro streaming that looks like the wind blowing after streaming down here and it supports a hosted Pulsar service for change data capture as well as general streaming so pretty cool pretty powerful framework all right our database is up my data my dummy DB and in order to connect you're going to need to have some information there are two things you're going to need you're going to need to get a bundle which is a ZIP file that contains information like the SSL and T and TLS stuff you need to connect so that gets um that that gets downloaded and then you're going to need a token the token is going to provide the credentials to access the database I'm going to show you how to generate a token and then I'm going to delete this database because I don't want there to be a video out here on the internet of real tokens to access a real database so you generate a token and here's the token you get a client's ID and a secret which like a username and password and then a token and you can't even see the whole all of it on the screen because you'd have to scroll to do it but in real life what you would do is copy or download this information in order for you to do the exercise or to work with this on your real application I'm going to close this I'm gonna go to my dummy DB and I'm going to delete this database all together terminate and now it's being terminated all right so I got a token and here's an example of a fake token and I showed you how to create one on the screen and I deleted it the secure connect bundle you go to connect tab the user interface has changed a little bit since this you don't have to pick Java so if I go to my free tierdb connect get bundle select to region U.S Central One and now I can download the bundle or the URL or the bundle in the lab you're asked to download the URL for the bundle and I'm gonna copy that URL because there's something worth noting here I think actually it's the curl let me down I'm going to copy the curl command all right but the token in the bundle are necessary to connect so I'm going to go back to to the readme instructions and it says use this curl command with your link to download the bundle and attempts creds.zip so I'm going to paste the curl command that I got online and I'm going to modify it and yeah it takes a minute is you'll see this curl command says curl Dash o and then it's going to store it and secure connect myfreetierdb.zip I want to store it in temps creds dot zip so I'm just going to change the url excuse me I'm going to change the local file path in which to store the creds bundle all right damn okay it's downloading and now I'm going to take a look at it creds dot zip and I see the file is there and it's it's not zero size so I'm that's roughly the right size 1237 4 12 2 7 0 close enough all right the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to configure the application properties to use this information and I'm not going to show it to you because it the actual values because the actual values are real credentials but I'm going to set the path to the and these credentials are for a database that no longer exists I am going to set this to temp creds.zip that's the bundle there's some spring configurations bring data configuration the key space is the to do key space and I'm going to use my real username and real password so I'm going to excuse me I'm going to do that off screen and let me get my username paste it in and my password or Secret paste it in close the file and bring it back on screen okay so I've modified the file and now I'm going to run a test this test is just checking to see if we can connect to Astra so it's really checking if the credentials I pasted in and the the path to the creds zip bundle are valid so we'll let it run no pump file I'm in the wrong directory so I can do an LS shell and just check and there is no Palm file so I need to be in the to do backend spring data directory there is a palm.xml here and that's the build file for Maven for those of you who aren't Java developers so now we'll run the maven test and I'm really hoping it makes a connection compiled that's a good sign test now it's running the test all right one test and ran no failures no errors no no tests skipped so now I know that that it makes a connection the next thing we're going to do is run create schema and Astra test what that really does let's see I'm looking for the source there's tests create schema what that's going to do is create the schema uses the secure connect bundle passes the credentials uses the key space name starts a session and uses the schema Builder to create a table and set the the data types and column names and no surprise the data types and column names oh which are defined in the to-do entity class well we know what those are they're the column names to Do's you would title completed an offset so what this command is going to do is actually create the schema in in the database we first tested to see if we could connect we can so we should be able to create the schema and in response to the earlier question someone had about unit testing I might have written these in the same you know as different operations in the same unit test file and one another way to do it so there'd be two tests the first would be a connection test and the second would be a would be would be actually asking it to create the table all right so it ran and what that means is the table should exist so I'm going to go back to Astra I'm going to go to my my database my free trdb go to the cql console all right and I'm going to say I'm not quite following the commands as the author said but I'm going to describe key spaces and I see a bunch of key spaces all of those are system key spaces except to do key space that's the one I wanted and now I'm going to use the key space just like you'd use a schema in a relational database and I'm going to describe the tables in this key space and there's one to do take table called to do's and I'm now going to describe that table so here's the table it's in the key space to do keyspace names to do's its primary key is a universally unique identifier called uid got a Boolean called completed offset which is an INT and title which is text it offset is order in the other places we've referred to it so the table was created successfully and that was the goal of that of that test test files create the table and bill says describe the key space I did a little differently but same basic idea the next thing to do is to connect the application to Astra so we're going to create a folder called conf and it's in com datastacksworkshop.com so a con for configuration folder and in it we're going to create a file bring data config the Java file create that file this says its configuration information this is kind of cool this is part of the magic that spring does we have a reference to the secure bundle well the bundle is a file in the file system normally if you want to do something to file you'd have to go and load it and stuff but spring lets us specify the path from the properties file and then spring is going to load it it's going to inject it and load it automatically and then we're going to create the session Builder Bean and that's going to be used to allow the to do application or the to do um web service if you will a restful service it's going to allow that to connect to Astra using the connect bundle and so on so a lot going on in the in a very little bit of code and that's one of the beauties of spring so we've got the config file next we're going to create we're going to go into the to do backend spring data application class and we're going to remove these excludes remember the excludes were there because we weren't actually connecting to Cassandra now we are so we'll move remove that information because now we're going to make a real connection so there won't be any errors around it and now we're going to run another test another unit test and this is to make sure the context loads before we were really just testing to make sure that we had the right properties and then cheating and using a test file to create the database now what we're going to do is test the application and make sure the application can connect we know the tests can connect but can the application connect and the tests ran and no failures though the application can connect our information is correct and now we can run the application we'll let it finish its startup routine and thank you so much Aaron for jumping in and responding to questions all right let's see build failure of his physical oh Port 80 was already in use okay that's a simple one I have another shell that's running in I can switch on the right between terminals so I'm going to go to this terminal and hit Ctrl C and I'm gonna use a trash can to close that now let's start it again it should start out fine the nice thing about spring is that spring does a lot of the busy work for you all of the connecting stuff and keeping track of that spring largely manages that's pretty cool okay so that's our test here's our application and it gives us an empty result but that makes sense because we don't have any data yet we just connect we just created the table in Astra and we haven't populated it yet so I wouldn't expect to see anything here so as as expected that's a good thing all right I'm going to shut that down just because if I don't I'll forget and run in the same problem later I'm going to try to restart something and that brings us the end of part three I'm going to run those commands to switch branches and I'll open the preview of the readme and see if it opens before No it didn't except it's a little bit flaky about that now we'll refresh the readme over here and it changed to part four and I'll close the source not sure why why it's doing that but so be it okay so we've created the repositories uh a little bit about the data modeling in in Cassandra if you have an application and um a data model that gets stored in the database the queries for to-do's we want and our API already supports these because we've tested it it lists you can list all the tasks list the specific tasks create a new task mark a task let's complete or incomplete lead a task delete all tasks that's kind of the the features that are a part of this to do MVC application in Cassandra and this is one of those places where uh relational databases and non-relational specifically Cassandra are very different as I said it's a different way of looking at data in a relational database what happens is you start with a conceptual data model and eventually you build you know through the steps of logical and physical data model optimization and in relational databases you tend to get very stable data models I worked for a large U.S Bank and I would I was building internal web application for our mortgage team and new requirements would come in for us very rarely did they require a change in the data model good thing because changing the relational data model was a process our data modeling team was located halfway across the country from us you know we didn't know anybody personally on the team you know we had if we want to change a data model we had to file a jira request and set up meetings and go through all these gates to get it done it took a long time now the good thing is we had a very good relational model and if the data's in there in a relational database you can come up with some query to retrieve it may not be super optimal but you can do it in Cassandra it's just the opposite in Cassandra our data model is tuned to support specific queries and to support them at a low latency high volume and high availability so that's what you get low latency high volume High availability and queries data models specifically tuned for specific queries nothing's free if you want different queries you need to re you often need to modify the data model it's not like a relational model where you create a great model and just use it use it use it new queries whatever no Cassandra the data model and the queries are designed to go with one another to give you that high performance play a bit availability and internet scale so in Cassandra we start with a conceptual data model just like you would in a relational database but we also look at what we call the application workflow or queries so what queries will run against this model then once we have those two inputs in parallel we can create a logical model and ultimately a physical model now the task database is super simple it's got four fields the primary key is the uid it's got a text field for the name of the task a completed field which is a Boolean and an offset or order field in case your tasks are ordered and that's it just a side note this particular table is not ideal not an ideal use case for Cassandra remember what I said Cassandra gives us and that is super low latency super high availability and Global or Internet scale my to-do list has no more than you know I mean I guess I could get to 100 items from my personal and work and other to-do lists all combined I might get a hundred items maybe a couple hundred I'm never gonna have a thousand I'm never gonna have a terabyte Worth or a petabyte worth uh so yeah baby Cassandra's a bit of Overkill but it's a great example to demonstrate Cassandra I will tell you that the primary key here is a single field the uid field and that doesn't take advantage of the partitioning of data in the way we normally do in the Cassandra application I'll leave it there it's a much bigger basic discussion about how Cassandra Works in data modeling and you can take a look at data Stacks Academy at our data modeling course and you know really get the details on how that works and why so that's the model you have the user interface the front end you have the API in the middle and we're showing it with a Swagger interface we're not going to get to that today but you could and then you have a driver that connects to the database so we're going to do that through spring boot or spring data into driver there are data Stacks drivers for a number of different languages and I mentioned Stargate that gives us different apis to access data and in Astra the secure connect bundle is going to give us information on the connection you know how do we know where to connect we didn't give any URLs because the secure secure connect bundle has them and then the token generated the username and password information so we opened a session using the secure connect bundle we use the key space and we provide the credentials all of those were hidden in the properties file that I didn't show you I kept that off screen so those credentials that real database wouldn't be exposed the world so connectivity you know in in Spring data at C it looks like we're going to run a couple minutes over so if you'll bear with me we'll we'll get there we've already actually done Parts three two and part and three three which is connecting to the database so in Spring there's a number of pieces but we have the controller layer that exposes the data to the world we have the service layer in the middle and the persistence layer with the Dao and Repository so we need to we need to put these parts together to make spring data work and you can use spring Boot and Cassandra spring data for Cassandra or you can use it without it and then you have to configure the drivers and all that yourself so this information was in that properties file it's the spring boot configuration for Cassandra Samira asked a great question is Cassandra acid compliant and Aaron has a great answer the answer is it will be in Cassandra 5. and Aaron has a a couple of videos on that on YouTube and maybe Aaron if you're still listening you might want to share the the video for the channel on that but yes it's coming we are excited about it and Aaron has a great explanation in video and other format available on YouTube so this is the Cassandra configuration and in spring data you have an entity class which defines the data type you know so you would title complete offset and that's the task type and we have to map the primary key column and say what it is and then you have the Repository here we've provided a specific query select star from to do tasks where uid is equal to the value passed in but we're going to make it even easier than that we're going to let spring data generate the find by primary key methods essentially what that is and spring data will do that automatically so the next part part four is the last part and we'll switch back and look at part four so part four object mapping creating the repository unit test and plug it in and make it work so the object mapping is going to take the to do entity and map the object which is the Java class to do entity I double click that again it's going to map that two columns so the uid column is a primary key and the column name in the database is column underscore unit and we're going to do all of those so I'm going to open the to do entity class and replace it with that and that's adding the extra annotations the Cassandra mapping annotations so the primary key this is the name of the column of the database this is the type name and the other columns all right next I need to create a repository and there are two ways to do it and I'm going to go for the simple way one the the harder way you can create it and do the connection stuff yourself or you could by create a class or you can simply create an interface and this is again where that a spring inversion of control comes in you can create an interface specify that it extends the Cassandra repository specify the types to do entities and the primary key type is the unit that's a repository so I'm going to do that and in the to do folder I'm going to create to do cassandra.java and the author says use get pod to help you with the Imports you have to import repository Cassandra repository to do entity and uid um I'm going to cheat for because the time and I'm just going to copy that information in here into this file so it's just these Imports that were necessary to make to make this work all right that's the Repository oops went back too far there we go and I'm going to unit test the Repository so to do backend spring application test class the unit test now is going to create a new entity and use the repo to store it so pass unit tests First Connect tested connectivity then created a table to do back in Spring application day that's that one it's not that one let me get the right one notification tests here we go all right so this should actually create an entity so that's a good test okay this is similar to the issue that someone else was having before and log it says there's a duplicate class computation Workshop it's spring config and the problem is that this class exists in two places and I know it goes in the workshop subdirectory so I'm going to delete it here I'm not going to analyze how it got there but I might not have been careful in one of the previous sections and in following the author's instructions so let me run that again and we're getting real close to finishing up here sorry to keep you longer but I appreciate your hanging on because now this should once it runs it should go ahead and do an insert into the real database and we'll check that database okay oh I I know it's wrong here too the application properties files no longer when we did the when we changed the branch the application property files no longer has the real credentials the ones I didn't show you so give me just a second I will change the credentials and then it will run and I guess that makes me an optimist okay close that file so it'll get published and let's clear and run should now be connecting to the real database okay it succeeded and let's just make sure trust but verify I'm going to connect to Astra I'm going to go to the cql console I'm going to use the key space and we'll select and there it is simple task one that was inserted by the application so good that worked okay and we tested it got that next comes the magic because we still have our rest controller needs to now use the Cassandra Repository so HTTP requests that come in will be mapped to methods that interact with the Cassandra repository which interacts with the Astra instance and the author says you know here's how you start doing that here's a snippet there is a link if you expand this to the solution I'm going to whoops I'm just going to go and copy the solution into the into the rest controller so there's the to do rest controller and I will show you some some of the solution a little more than the author showed you there okay so there's the to do the completed to do rest controller and now you'll notice it it's got there's the repo reference and how does it get the repo reference it's passed into the Constructor well wait a minute who constructs this the spring framework so who provides the repo instance and the answer is the spring framework provides it that's the magic that's the uh inversion of control and injection that that that's going on and now the data instead of getting it from the in memory hashmap we're getting it from the repo or in the case of a post we're saving it in the repo so this is what connects everything together and you were asked you know you were given sort of the skeleton of this and asked to complete it I just paste it in the solution for for the sake of time and now let's run it okay it's running and I see the sample task this is now running from or get it directly from Astra and now I'm going to test and I'm not going to use the built-in browser remember I was having trouble with that I'm going to copy the URL and run the unit tests against my Astro bake based spring boot service I've got to put a real URL in there so let me copy the URL there I'll put the URL in that way that's working my Aster based service is running and passing the tests and as I said I want test but verify trust but verify I'm going to go back to Astra and if I select from to-do's you see it's deleted some or it's modified sum and it's added the blah so we know we're really talking to Astra and then I'm going to bring up the client side because ultimately said we were testing this using this client I'm going to copy the URL to my backend my rest back end and remember these two didn't have names and there's blah what needs to be done thank everyone four attending and let's check did did that get entered thank everyone for for attending all right well I want to thank thank you all for attending and Aaron thanks so much for uh answering questions on the chat I probably wouldn't have been able to do it while I'm going through and doing this uh some resources data sexdest.com slash Dev our workshops are here and the data Stacks devs YouTube channel that you're on uh go ahead and subscribe to the channel you'll get notifications when we have events coming up and we try to do those fairly often and also I mentioned Academy and I think Knight back bot nodes Academy but Academy or excuse me datastacks.academy where we have free courses and we have a list of courses they'll be growing and when Cassandra 5 comes out you heard it here first when Cassandra 5 comes out academy and our Associated certifications will be updated for Cassandra 5 when Cassandra 5 releases so be a great place when the new version comes out to learn about all the cool new features and to update or get your get your first Cassandra certification but thank you for attending everybody I really appreciate it and have a great rest of the day and thanks thanks again Aaron for the help we'll see you all later bye",
