harnessing stargate apis with nodejs i'm ryan welford and i'm joined by kirsten hunter hello kiersten how are you i'm doing great i'm so excited to present this to folks we just really haven't uh given uh our users a chance to really understand what the apis can do for them so this should be really fun yeah i'm really excited too there's a lot of good content here uh so first off i want to do a little bit of housekeeping um we have uh the the stream that you're watching now is either on youtube or twitch mainly youtube a lot of uh the question answering goes on in the youtube chat a backup if the connection is uh not very great is twitch um and there are links in the description for that if you have any issues um a another place that we answer questions is on our discord again there's a link in the description that is kind of for long term question and answering because the youtube chat goes away at the end of the stream and so if you want to stay in touch and uh and and keep talking to us then discord is the place to do that the other thing that's great about discord is that you can actually paste images in there and the youtube channel doesn't let you do that so if you want to show us something you're seeing that's not working the way you want you're going to need to go to discord so really suggest you get that started up if you can yeah it's turning into a really good community i think we have 9 000 plus people in the server yeah it's it's really big um so today we're going to be doing a lot of things um with cassandra in astra uh we'll also be using catacota for the majority of the workshop um and i'll let kirsten introduce that uh when she when she does her part um and i'll get into what astra and stargate is in just a little bit um but first uh oh also we're going to be doing a mentee quiz both at the beginning and the end um uh so that is mendy.com and i will i'll paste the code when we start doing that but that's a way just to have a little bit of interactivity um and there will also be a a chance to win some swag at the end um our top three uh answerers will uh will be able to win uh swag through that quiz so be ready with your phones or another tab with that it's mentee.com first though i would like to do a little bit of recognition for our previous workshop last week we did intro to cassandra and we had some homework at the end and these are all of the viewers that submitted homework and we just wanted to give them a shout out and congratulations for completing that and uh and give them a little bit of recognition and and community um uh spotlight for that uh we will have some homework at the end of this workshop as well uh and so you can that'll be our opportunity for some continued learning and and some recognition as well all right so today we're going to be using astra and what is astra well uh astra is a fully managed cassandra in the cloud without the ops it is serverless and uh it is uh completely free uh you don't need a credit card to sign up we we have those of you who maybe have used astra in the past uh we used to have a just a straight up free tier we've moved to a completely pay-as-you-go model and the first 25 there's a 25 credit at the beginning and there's no credit card needed to sign up and you get the first 25 dollars for free and it's it's important to note that um that 25 represents a lot more performance than you had in the free tier uh it really gives you a lot of flexibility in how you're going to use our services yeah the the original feature was around five gigabytes of storage i think this is up to like 40 gigs um or something like that and there's you know thousands of reads and writes uh per month so it's it's actually a a huge bump up from the previous offering and we'll we'll walk through how to how to get that account made and and going when we get into the actual workshop um so it's uh astra is globally available um and it's scale it's it is uh serverless so it scales to the amount of use that you're that you're using it for um and and it'll scale like beyond the the free you know the free 25 dollars it'll be able to scale beyond that if you so need it um there's no operations it's completely managed um in the cloud by by data stacks uh and as we said there's a 25 25 25 gigs to 40 gigs depending on on how much you use uh we're also one of the things one of the things that's super great about that is that a lot of people like they look at cassandra and they think i might want to do that but then they look at all the configurations you have to do up front with how many nodes and how many say like how many cpus and but we just take that away from you just you just start it up and it figures out what it needs yeah it's hands down the easiest way to get started with cassandra for sure um so today we're going to be talking a lot about stargate and stargate is an open source api framework uh that lives uh that's basically a layer on top of cassandra now stargate comes built into astra one of the main main reasons we're using astro today and but it can also be used on top of any flavor of of cassandra on dse or on uh the open source cassandra as well and it is totally open source as well yeah and it's just growing all all the time yep and it's a it's a it's a way to to kind of interact with uh with cassandra without even having to use sql cql in a lot of cases uh so with that let me let's uh let's do our mentee this is kind of a get to know you quiz at the beginning here i have some music hold on it's always here we go [Music] all right so minty.com here's your code if i can copy that into the [Music] that's actually really loud hold on [Music] there we go that's a little bit more bearable huh okay uh so the code is five one nine two five three three eight and when you get in if you wanna press the thumbs up button so we can kind of see that you are uh in the mentee there we go we have 25 already give a little bit of time uh and yeah if you have any questions uh make sure to paste them in the youtube chat or the discord and we have some helpers that will assist you as needed all right yeah alex uh alex mentioned that you can scan the qr code as well i'll bring that up again so if you have a if you're on your phone you can just scan the qr code that'll get you right in as well right let's go ahead and let's go ahead and get started all right so what role describes you the best are you a student back-end developer front-end developer operator or data architect if you do lots of these things just pick the one you like the most yeah and this helps us really uh know how to kind of cater the content to to the audience and so it's really useful for us to know where you guys are coming from all right a lot of students a lot of back end developers it's interesting all right let's move on uh do you consume or implement apis at work and what kind if you do [Music] mostly rest apis seems to be the most popular i think that's yeah that's that's uh you know that's the way it is that's the way it is people are are very comfy with breastfeeding maybe you can get some converts today kirsten no it's fine i i think people i'm so excited that we provide so many different ways to interact with your data so if there's a way that you're comfortable interacting with data you know we make that possible yeah that's so that's the real key all right which programming languages are you familiar with now today we are going to be using javascript correct we're doing everything in um so um we're using http which is a command line um utility similar to curl but when we dive into the code yeah that's going to be a node.js document all right and finally uh have or not finally we have another after this have you attended one of our workshops before well for those of you who have not attended welcome i want to extend a warm welcome to you and hopefully you uh learn a lot today and for those of you who are returning welcome back i'm glad you uh glad you are back with us all right and finally how did you hear about this workshop last week we had a lot of uh people who heard about it through a friend which is really really cool i like when people share share our stuff with each other it means we're doing some right i think yeah you still gotta have lunch with that guy so it's really important that you not point him in the wrong direction all right lots of eventbrite that seems to be our most popular instagram as well i think is usually our most popular all right very cool thank you very much everyone for answering those questions it really helps us uh mold these uh these workshops into to reach the best possible audience so with that see we'll go back here and i think i'm going to hand it over to you kirsten okay um and um i'll just go over really quick uh the intro thing so uh go to the um the link that's in the youtube channel um actually um maybe we can paste that in the um discord as well um but it is in the references for the youtube um we're in main chat channel right main chat room is that right yep that is correct all right so um just go to that link and um you start the um the scenario that you see there and uh as i have um so this page is actually gonna just give us a quick overview so i'm going to go over it fairly quickly ryan actually covered a lot of the things but um so let's look at a really top-level overview right so cassandra is a nosql open source database um which is the foundation of our stack our goal as a company is to increase cassandra usage for everybody so we participate very um very constantly in the um in the open source cassandra community we're actually some of the main um uh developers and the core um and uh and we have huge customers that that do an enormous number of transactions they they really need speed that you can't get with the sql database on the other hand it's important to realize that cassandra is not really like mongodb or like couchdb cassandra actually has a scheme by default for the databases now we're going to talk today you can have a scheme a schema you can work with it that way but there's actually a document api which is very similar to what mongodb does so you can actually use your um database uh however you like um and and and that's really cool so again astra uh gives you a serverless instance of cassandra with 25 a month um when you get to 80 of using that 25 dollar credit we will notify you um so you can decide if you want to go ahead card or not um and then stargate is just great like if you're already using cassandra and you don't want to use our services that's fine um you could put stargate in front of them and make it possible for people to interact with your data in ways that are easy for them so that you can really expand the number of people who can work with that data without having to teach them uh how cassandra works so um there's some information about cassandra and then uh and then astra oh hi so i was up at 3 30 this morning working on this and i didn't get all of the things no no then i wanted to get out of here but anyways so i covered it up trying to cover the serverless which is great um and uh just just remember that um any astra instance comes with stargate included but again if you if you play with it and you like it but you don't really want to use our services um you can install it yourself and there's a huge uh community of people working on stargate okay so now we're going to create our astra instance um so we're going to register and sign into astra so you need to go to astro.datasacks.com so notice that i already have databases but you may not and that's okay and then um so you may need to create an account uh or signed in if you already have one um one of the great things about serverless that that you may not be aware of when you if you've used our free tier in the past you probably kind of got frustrated because you can only have one database but with serverless you can have many more so um even if you've done another workshop and you already have an astra instance you can just create a new database and that's totally fine oh the picture. anyways um so we're going to configure and create the databases um we're going to use the pay as you go plan which is pretty much all there is it's not as clear on that screen that uh you get that 25 a month but you do you definitely get that you don't have to pay give us a credit card um and then you're going to name your database now um this picture is not exactly what should be i updated it but that was you know not so long ago uh so you're gonna it doesn't matter what you name your database uh we don't actually use database names in most of the api calls um real quick sorry um i just want to make sure that everyone is getting into the catacota successfully um if if we could get some thumbs up in the chat if you if you have successfully gotten into the catacota there there is possibly if you're having any kind of struggles um please let us know yeah it looks it looks like the the link that's in uh youtube might not be uh working so let me can you paste what i pasted into youtube oh we can't paste links into youtube you can paste it in the chat um i think maybe i've gotten cut off i'm gonna re we replace it in the chat yeah again if if uh if you have successfully gotten into the catacota um give us a thumbs up or let us know in the chat it is possible that it's a little bit uh overloaded with traffic all at once um we actually provisioned a hundred uh uh instances so we're probably good hopefully okay all right i am seeing some thumbs up all right sorry for interrupting you kirsten i just wanted to make sure um make the database whatever you want um but the key space name needs to be workshop and i know that this image that i took for you he has a capital w but as it turns out uh capital um key space names don't work as well as lowercase key space names so i want you to notice up above here i said workshop as the key space name that's great if you did create it with workshop as a capital you can actually create it um when we get to the next uh part so once you've created your database um i also um i suggest uh gcp and the region that's closest to you um you can use uh any provider it actually changes how much the calls are but um i've had great luck with gcp so that's google cloud platform of course so um oh i was supposed to make one let's try i'll make one so i'm gonna call it exploring stargate and then i'm gonna put workshop notice again lowercase works better um and i'm just gonna grab uh i'm gonna use google cloud and um i'll just pick the one that that is there um and again the provider you choose changes the the amount that you have to pay for various things so we have exploring stargate here and maybe we need the wrong key space and we need to make workshops so i can actually add a key space here oh when it's actually up notice that mine says initializing it doesn't actually take very long to get a new table but uh sometimes it can take a couple minutes it's actually faster with the apis which is really nice so um let's look at what else we're doing here so um i'm just going to start up and the status is going to change to active when the database is ready we'll come back to this to the astra page in just a minute but um one of the things i wanted to point out is that you have databases and databases have key spaces and then the key spaces have tables so it actually allows you to divide up your data um appropriately and that kind of um tells cassandra where to put the data so the related data is stored in a similar place um if you're not familiar with cassandra um one of the things that it's all about is scaling so you can just shove a new computer or node into your into your cassandra instance and then you've got more capacity any one of the nodes can answer any calls um so you know our goal is a hundred percent of time so you can have some in a in one data center some in another data center and it will do its best to always be there for you and when you want to add more nodes you don't have to have downtime on your database which is critically important to a lot of our really big customers okay so let's move on to the next session section which is step two so um this is one of the cool things about catacota is that you don't have to do a lot of typing now you know i don't love that because i feel like you're not learning as much but you sure just make it handy so we're gonna um get hd pi astra so again http pi is a command line client like curl that lets you get resources but it's a lot prettier um it's really designed for for rest apis and uh so the interaction feels a lot more um simple so if you just click here click here come on wake up oh great catapult is not working no all right well i hope nobody else is having that problem i will i will start again but let me uh i'll try it on my side and see if i run into the same issue but yeah i mean it was working when i tested it like 20 minutes same uh okay that's i think i think we're overloading them again yeah it is saying uh it wants me to refresh so it could be uh could be just some overload yeah i think it is here we go all right yeah it's working for me just fine so maybe refresh and try it again yeah i'm just gonna open another window it just doesn't it doesn't like me maybe we hit 100 already maybe we did maybe you since yours is working um you can drive uh yeah let me you can do the screen and i'll do the talking okay although i don't know what you're talking i don't know i can't see your screen but i'll just follow on you talk and you maybe uh let me know if it comes back for you but for now um i'll follow along with your your description uh is anybody else having this problem in uh in their instance yeah let us know if you guys okay so we have some people saying it's working for them yeah i think if you just re if you refresh your window but it's it's still giving you problems huh i am getting a gateway timeout okay well there we go it's back yay all right i'm sending it back to you so i will uh go and we're going to skip through this the great thing about this is oh i'm not going to have to wait for this and sometimes i have to refresh after we do this counter code is really super fun and i promise you it's gonna seem really cool uh when everything is working are you are you sharing a different are you using a different window because i don't think that the screen share is oh um let me see oh might be it's not working anyways so um [Music] there we yeah i'm go all right i see it now man sorry everyone technical difficulties happens every time yeah and yeah and the thing is that that that's cool about this is that you don't need me babbling in your ear right if you if you want to come back to this we'll we'll have a not uh all sequential um at the same time but you should be able to review this information all right no no all right just go away all right i'm coming back always something huh yeah that's promising is this the one that you're looking at um so your screen is blank for me right now okay let me go back let me just close this one and then i'll just change my sharing if i actually get it to work okay sorry everybody sorry i'm just showing my screen again just to show people what it should look like if it's working i know some people have said that it's working and uh but you can't see it because i'm not sharing the right screen is that correct uh correct yes it's just white for me okay let's see what we got no uh switch screen no uh oh um and so for those of you who are still waiting for your database to initialize that's that's totally fine um we will we're doing some setup stuff on catacota um and then we will we will be entering some information in catacota from the database so we still have time for that database to initialize it should be done pretty soon yeah um you know it it sometimes takes um just a few seconds and sometimes it takes a little bit longer and again slack is not showing me the window that is actually working well i i have my screen up if you want to i'm just going to share my um whole um your whole screen that should work it's a little bit simpler it's a little bit funky but you know what this is all good all right um i have this one and now it's working so when you click on the commands and there's a little brown and the dark gray boxes then it'll run it in the in the terminal for you so you've just installed http astra and we're going to give you a script to set up your environment because um http likes to use a um a file to keep track of the environment variables for you so here we are please please paste the export block from the connect page here so now we're going to go back to astra and here's my exploring stargate i'm going to go over here to the connect button and the connect button is going to give me a super handy page right this is what you want to copy so you can copy it that way or you can just click the copy button and then we go back and we paste the export here now it wants an application token so let's look down a little bit more retrieve and paste your application token so it says in the astronaut dashboard click the settings tab for your database all right i can do that settings so you can see up at the top the first thing on the settings page is to generate a new token and what you want to do is choose the role of api admin user and then you generate the token so just like all the other fancy tokens you get from github and and gmail and all the various places um you'll never see these again so you can download the csv so that you have the information available for you at a later time but the only piece you actually need right now is this token so go ahead and copy that and go back here paste it in i think i did not copy it correctly let's try that again all right okay and does this work no hmm oh caterpillar is giving me trouble i hope the rest of you are having less trouble than i am um let's try one more time maybe it just doesn't want copy in chrome let me i'll i'll i'll do a secret thing um i'm gonna go and look at my token um in terminal it's me you have my window up it's all right i didn't expect to see me there i covered you up thanks so i'm going to grab astra in the dot astra rc file on my own computer and so the token i'm going to use here is this one it's in bad but it's not bad i've used it many times it's really good um oh no that's not what no really no i don't think that's it let me see where we are yeah that's that's the window that's one that works all right so now i'm gonna try again and it's not working which is really icky um so we'll just do this the slightly harder way oh it's just not responding at all it's broken okay let me uh i will i'll catch up to you and i'll stream my screen just to uh make sure that we can get this going um i think it's just overloaded okay well uh so i've got my screen up uh so go ahead and and run through it uh again i'll kind of talk through where i'm at too i'll look at my actual uh code on my system and people can see actually how catacotta works uh all right so just to catch people up so i'm at uh i'm in the the astra um on my astra account with uh with my new database and i'm going to copy uh the the this information um in the connect tab uh you already started induction i'm sorry you already start in dot sh i i will i will start that in just a moment uh so if i start if i use so i'm in uh step two under setup credentials and i'm going to start the env.sh and dutch doesn't sound i can't understand that okay so i'm gonna paste that export block uh that i just copied from the astra page and then it's gonna return yep and it's gonna ask me for the application token so then i go to settings and i'm going to generate a new token the api admin yes and then the token is at the bottom here so i'm just going to click the button on the right to copy that and uh please you can download a csv so that you can have that later because it's never going to tell you about that again yeah you can't that's a good point you can't access this again once once you uh navigate away so um and please let us know if uh if you have any questions or have any issues as well i'm going to paste that token in the in the terminal here on catacotta all right all right let's just uh just making sure that everyone is uh caught up and and having or is not having any issues please let us know some people are still waiting for the database to initialize okay um you may have to refresh that page uh the astra page um it it should tell you automatically uh when your database has been initialized but um we have seen in the past that sometimes it does not yeah i definitely have to refresh before but not often which is good all right we are getting some thumbs up or at least one um if everyone is at uh is caught up please give us a thumbs up um bertrand says they're kind of lost um okay so where are they yeah let us know bertrand where where you're at where you're stuck and we can uh we can go back and and cover it so remember that in in catacota you can click on these uh code blocks on the left side and it will paste them into the terminal on the right side um so you don't have to copy paste or retype them you can just click the blocks makes it uh makes it pretty easy that is if catacott is working working correctly i'm gonna try safari okay yeah see if you can get safari uh caught up and we'll let some people catch up does anybody have any questions so far i mean i realized that this is this is uh we're just at the very beginning but um so you've created a database you can see the database you can see the status of the database you can see the the key spaces in the database um and uh on that same screen you can also use the c cql console um if you're interested in seeing um some of the ways that you can connect to the database then click on connect on that line with your server and you'll see that there's actually there's there's demonstrations of how to do it uh using the document api or the rest api or the graphql api yes and there was a question oh it looks like alex uh answered it bertrand uh yes the workshop will be available at the same link um on youtube after after the stream is done and uh and we'll also have the catacota hopefully it won't be so bad when we i don't have to do something else for the europe people but um i can't i just can't start an environment it just won't let me um so bertrand is asking uh or says i don't i didn't see from where i have to create my database so we're using astra for the database um and i will um paste a link to that yeah you can just ryan you can just go through it again i mean because it's serverless so that's true yeah you can make a second database i'll uh i'll go through the process of creating a database again so after creating the astro account um let me actually just go back here i can create a database and i think if you're it's a new account it will prompt you to make a database but if i just uh make a quick database called exampledb and i'm going to choose the region google google cloud north america and south carolina usc is the closest one to me and the the plan is pay as you go now no credit card credit card is needed again uh you get a 25 credit every month uh and i can just create the database just like that and you will see a pending status that pending will turn into initialization and then it will be turned into active it takes about three minutes sometimes sometimes it's really fast sometimes it takes a little bit longer um but that is the process of creating the db it's really really easy it it looks like i might be having some luck so i will see you in just a moment i'm i'm i'm checking to see if it'll let me set my environment variables all right well if you uh if you get catch up there i'll switch it back to you otherwise we can just continue and i can continue yeah it's fine um i i have the the information about those files so um the nice thing though about catacota is it lets people basically uh not even have to copy and paste but monsie you're asking if uh if you should read okay i'll switch it back to you monsieur asks if uh if it's showing initialization if they should refresh and you can certainly try refreshing um it it sometimes uh is kind of the the site the page sometimes hang us on it but it does take a little bit to happen so um just in the interest of time though we should probably continue moving on um yes okay let me um share this this window well i'm sharing my whole it's our screen you all can see my craziness it's all fine okay so um so i'm still on step two we're on step two so i hope that you all have gotten your um your credentials um all set up you can check actually you can do a cat on dot astra rc see if i can get my files to show up there they are so you can look at your astra rc file in the editor at the top as well so you can see here remember i said it didn't really matter what you named your database that's because we think about databases in terms of their id they're given a unique id when they're created and that's how we refer to them uh in the apis there's the region u.s east one there's workshop again if this is uh capital that's not gonna work really well for you um the astra db application token that's the token that you pasted in and this other stuff is there for another um scenario and you don't really need to worry about it but what can we do now that we've settled these things um so i i was saying 85 is great let's take a look and see what happens see now by default um i get to uh it's going to show me my request headers and then it's going to give me a prettified version of the json that comes back so we're looking here there that's cool um but um i i you know i'm not really sure i love having to type dash off type astra dash a default every time that's what i'm just gonna do um in general so i'll go ahead and make a directory and i'm going to download the config file and now i'm going to just do http colon recipe one key spaces and it works just the same because it knows uh that i want to use the type of astra so uh we actually wrote that plug-in um for the astra authentication for http and if there are other things you want h5 to do magically you are welcome to put issues in so can we get some hands how's everyone doing on just this basic stuff and hopefully by now everyone's databases have finished initializing yeah again it's a refresh thing i mean um the databases are usually much quicker than that but it doesn't always remember to tell you yeah yeah and i'll just uh i'll just repeat what uh cedric posted in the chat um it looks like there's been a lot of refreshing of catacota which has uh created new instances and we have looks like we've reached and surpassed the capacity that we have provisioned for so that's uh probably one of the factors that is leading to some of the errors that we've had so please uh don't refresh and let catacota catch up as those old sessions are are closed out just let them go all right um so did we get some hands ryan yes we have some thumbs up we have uh see how it says i'm good so now that we're here and uh we can we can dive into the stargate apis now um one of the things that's fantastic about stargate is it's actually a very modular system and it makes it possible for our developers or other people in the community to create uh plugins for the kind of apis they want to use to present the data so we have rest which is of course the basic one that everybody uses we have graphql which is fantastic um when you want to be very precise about uh when you want to let your developers be very precise about the data that they get back and then there's document which works very similar to mongodb so we're going to go over all three of those but i will tell you that we're working on adding new ones like grpc um and other api types and um if there's an api that you're really familiar with and you love a lot we would be happy to have you in the community helping uh to create new ways of getting to that data so the goal here is for you to work in an environment that that feels right to you um as you'll see as we go over this um you don't need to know uh cql at all you don't have to know anything about cassandra so um i'm first going to start out this is the rest page i'm going to first start out by creating a new database if i'm successful it says you made a database and it's called caveman all right great um so now let me ask about the the the the tables in my in my area all right well hey check that out so here's works at workshop again that's our key space and the name is caveman and there's the last name first in occupation just like we had over here last name first name and occupation fantastic so now let's try to shove fred in there he's good caveman all right and it says yeah yeah sure i i got i got a fred flintstone it's all cool it's a 201 fantastic um and then we'll we'll stick his friend barney in there that's good barney's really nice so now i have two that's great so now we're gonna check to make sure they're really in there so this is uh so there's a where clause when you're doing searches um as of now there's not really a way to get all of the elements of the rows but you can get specific ones um and you can have a really long in list if you want now um notice that i put dash vbv on this command that tells httpi to be a little chattier so yeah tell me about the headers that i'm sending that's useful but also tell me about the headers i got back um and but it always gives you the json in this pretty format any questions uh so i have i just wanted to clarify some things now i don't know i was answering some questions uh earlier so you may have gone over this already um i just didn't catch it but the the post stuff is is um you're just sending json yeah directly to the endpoint yeah in fact um well let's make sure let's see um ah let's see what oh let's do let's add um like wilma or something so um we'll do this again we have another barney rubble but we're gonna use um i guess we'll have betty betty rubble i mean she's not technically a caveman but yes and and and uh see had asked this question we use json uh instead of cql correct correct json this is just a json you know this is this is what you expect from a rest api is to be able to interact using just um objects at json objects so one of the things that's really important that i want you to see and i encourage you to play with like you can send these like commands again sometimes it won't work like if you try to create a table after you already created a table it's not going to work but um if you do dash vvv to your any of the http commands it gives you a lot more information so what am i sending what does it look like it looks like that it's a json object right and what did it send me back sent me back a json object looks just like the one i sent but that's but you know that's good right so um once you have some rows in there um you can go ahead and update them so in order to update them it's a pu it's a put command but again we still have the same endpoint and um so i'm just saying he's got an occupation of query screamer so let's let's uh just just uh back up a little bit to where we um asked about you know those those people so you can see fred flintstone now has an occupation of cory screamer i updated that i didn't have to tell it that it was his first name with fred his last name was flintstone but if you do look at the at the um the path that i called i called last name and if you look at the schema for our database last name is the primary key and the clustering key is first name so primary keys tells me how it starts to tell me how to partition my data and the clustering key sort of goes beyond and helps me to put it um in the right places so that the similar information is is where it should be so um all right great um let's get back down here where's my checks there they are oh that's what it is again yes good good good um so you know what barney's just hanging out and betty's actually better she she cooks and bakes and stuff she takes care of the whole house so let's delete barney okay so it gave me a 204 no contact so i'm not feeling super confident about that i mean that's exactly what delete should get back but let's see what we have for our users oh wait barney's gone so you can also do a direct query to barney and again this is his it's his last name then his first name but he doesn't exist in there and then uh we're just about done with the rest so let's just do a delete and check our our tables to make sure that caveman is gone so we don't have any tables anymore so does anybody have any questions on rest we'll give a little bit more information about this when we get to the um the astra js node collection um and i'll encourage you to play with that but um does this make sense uh so there's a couple questions um so what endpoint this is on on discord vj asks what endpoint are we hitting to get these responses ah so uh let me do uh the vvv again and i'll explain so the host name is this which is your database id dash this which is your region dot apps.astra.datasox.com and http assumes everything it's going to call is slash api so you're going to rest v2 schemas key spaces workshop tables so that is the schemas if you want to look at a data in the database let's take a look at this so again the host is your database id dash region.apps.astro.datasacks.com this is a long call right because uh api rest v2 key spaces workshop cavemen and then my search query so um when you uh create your database you actually get your own um server running for the stargate calls um which is which is great so you don't conflict with other folks the other thing that you want to realize is that the cassandra extra sandra token that's the astra cs token that you created that's actually a really fabulous thing so it used to be that you had to get your tokens per database but now your your token works for your whole account so you can have you know some tokens for you know read-only access and some tokens for read write access and you can have them used for any of the databases in your account so it's pretty nice and it's important to know that that we are we're not http is not directly talking to the database it's talking to stargate which is the layer that lives between and so stargate's receiving these um these rest calls and retrieving the the data from the database and sending it back so the endpoints are and correct me if i'm wrong kirsten the endpoints are dynamically generated by stargate uh well they they kind of are i mean it's always uh rust b2 key spaces for the graphql or the rest um stuff it's all and and then you're going to go straight to your key space which is um you've designed and then and then your table name and um so it's kind of gathered together based on the information you give it but there are consistencies about um about how things work uh which is great because you can automate them which is really important right you always know what the key space you want to be working in is so you can set that as a variable and send it along actually um there's there's a cheat you can do which um was to use ks same thing but uh so you can see it's still api recipe two key spaces workshop caveman um and that's actually based on the configuration file so you can see up here the dbk key space is such a workshop so you just if you're using httpi you can just uh use ks to indicate i just want to use my default uh work my default keys so um so moving on let's play with graphql so you may not be familiar with graphql um uh one of my favorite databases in the world was freebase and they were great if they were in san francisco it was meta web they came from applied minds and it basically was wikipedia as a graph and you could just you could be like so tell me about all of the actors you know that are under six feet tall a scientologist and they're married to another scientologist and um they have a kid in new york city and what's her middle name and that was just one column it took 50 milliseconds right so crafting this is great we aren't there we we but we are going to have a lot more uh functionality in our graphql uh coming coming up but even so looking at your data in that way um can sometimes really help your developers to describe exactly what they want like they only want to know the person city or you know it just it just saves a lot of um mess for them so um again we have a post to create the table um no let's try that again so it's taking them a sec and so again caveman true same thing so we're making a workshop uh table name is caveman uh my my partition key is last name my clustering key is first name and then i also have uh an occupation so same stuff because i just wanted you guys to have to do the same thing over and over again and just entertain you while you were doing it so let's go ahead and look what tables do we have hey there's that table it's workshop caveman first name last name oh that's not good no purchase you can keep you that's right so partition key is the primary key and that's the last name and then the clustering key is the first name and um so that's great so real quick kirsten do you mind um do you mind magnifying the uh your browser there it's a some of that text is a little small yeah a little hard to read especially the colors what happens if i do how's that that's much better okay may i make it even bigger there we go um okay so um oh see so so just so you know um i i accidentally clicked over here so easy to do um on the create table thing and it said dude you already have a caveman table i don't know what's wrong with you so yeah that's cool you know it protects you from um accidentally doing something twice um okay so i it doesn't have any data um so i'm gonna go ahead and insert pavement so this is um how you can work with a graphql in fact just a moment and i will i will show you something really cool um actually we'll just go to here so um i've been going exploring stargate this is all things that you can do whenever you want like there's no it's not gonna go away so here's connect oh great um so now look at the graphql api you see over here there's lots of different ways to connect with your database and you don't have to use sql at cql um so you can go to your playground which is just a link and um you need to paste in that that um that uh application token there and this will go down here in http headers and then we'll take a look at workshop that's our key space that we made and then oh i can't reach the server oh right it doesn't remember all right um and then let's let's look at that um master page again sorry for the the the side stuff but if you're interested in uh graphql this is actually really helpful so i'm looking at graphql again and we'll go ahead and create a couple more tables but this time we're just gonna copy we'll go over here to the playground and paste so there's two different kinds of things can we get that can we get that magnified again again the the colored text is a little bit hard to read especially at that size so just there we go there yeah that's much better thank you okay so um over here on the right hand side you can click on schema and you can see that there's basically two kinds of actions that you're gonna do you're gonna do a mutation which changes data in the database uh ads or updates or deletes and then there's query which just asks for information of what that's in the database so this is creating two tables why are you not oh so the examples uh assume that um yeah that'll work all right let's see if that works nope well anyways i i i didn't test this but um this is a way uh you know i can i i can take some of the stuff that we are working on over here so i can take um i can go ahead and put another another burnian what the heck could be like barney and his friend barney daryl and his brother daryl's other brother dale um so here we have it so you see i posted it in here so this is actually a way that you can kind of play with graphql and um and figure out how to ask for what you want and the schema over here makes that really helpful so back to each pie we have um so we've inserted our cavemen did did we do ball well we did now i don't know why this doesn't automatically scroll up i think yeah so um one of the other things i wanted to point out is you see i used fred here and there's like what do i mean by fred well what i mean by fred is when you hand me back my json data please put the stock that you're sending back about fred in the fred object right so if you send a query that has like three dif whatever um different actions um then then you can actually figure out um which um which response is uh associated with which of your queries so again it's easy to do when you're when you're automating things and then we'll um see if we can't find barney and i i again i named it cavemen and un under caveman we gotta we got a barney cool um fred needs a job because you know wilma doesn't like him around the house all the time it's kind of a pain so um so i update the caveman and then hey let me see my caveman now so this i said query that that's the the object type that we created for the table it came and and one of the other things that i wanted to mention is that um when you create your table um these uh these graphql um uh functions like update caveman and delete cavemen all that um they come for free like it sargy just makes them for you it's like hey i see that you now have a table well probably you want to insert create update delete so um super handy um anyway so i got caveman and then we have the values and again fred has a has a job um i couldn't figure out what else he did there so but i knew he screamed um and barney all right um so again we didn't give barney a job so let's just get rid of him he's deleted but is he so this one again this is a query not a mutation i'm not changing anything in the database i'm just asking what's in the database and caveman is my query and i'm filtering on last name looking for rubble or flintstone so what do i have i only have fred now why am i only getting the first name it's because i said i only want the first name right i could have said first name last name occupation i would have given those all to me back so here you can see um how excellent this is as a developer to be able to specify exactly which data you're looking for and what pieces of that data you want to work with okay well um sadly um you cannot delete a table in the in the graphql api yet i'm sure you'll be able to but i just deleted it there and we'll use the hdp call and see that i don't have any tables in here all right so that was graphql i think we have a mentee we do have a mentee so uh but before we do a mentee anyone who has questions about the graphql please ask anyone who's stuck anywhere please let us know yes please ask any questions um i will uh i'm going to switch over to the mentee uh so this while people are asking questions um if they have any this is the beginning of the quiz that you can win some swag off of so make sure that you are ready to go so because answering quickly gives you more points um to be at the top of the leaderboard so answering correctly and answering quickly are the two factors so i'll give um everyone some time let me actually switch over here you go the code i'll i'll put the code up i'll give everyone some time to get in there before we uh get started let me do a little music oh if it'll let me play it there we go uh so i'm looking for any questions so someone asks uh jesh and youtube asks uh is that syntax of queries of query specific to graphql or cassandra kirsten oh i'm sorry is that is the is the syntax of the question no okay is the query uh specific to graphql or cassandra oh the query is specific to graphql all all graphql databases understand queries and mutations as the two different ways to work with the data and stargate does that translation for you awesome any questions in uh discord were you uh i think they seem to be you know having a good time in there cool very cool all right let's see how many people we have here in the mentee got 45 give us some thumbs up if you're ready i don't want to start it when no one's ready or when someone's not ready and remember answering it quickly gives you more points all right it's a race but no pressure oh did we lose a bunch of people let's see we says we have nine we had 45 just a minute ago maybe that was from a previous thing uh yeah mentee.com i'll bring the code up again and you can use the qr code as well all right all right i'm gonna go ahead and get the next okay start the quiz so here we go oh pretty soon answer fast to get more points yeah i thought there was a little intro what is the name of the graphql tool provided in astra uh-oh did you go over this at the sandbox i'm sorry no but i didn't name it specifically i didn't name it i realized that when i read the question like oh no i don't think she said it ah well hopefully you guys this will be like a extra bonus point if you if you know this one graphql playground now kirsten uh you did not specify it by name unfortunately i did not i'm a terrible person that's okay that's all right mistakes in my defense i didn't see the mentee before you know i started blathering all right let's see who who are the lucky ones that got it fastest just the off andy and jasper the three fastest we will come back to uh this mentee in a little bit we have five questions total but we're going to uh do a little bit more on the uh presentation before we get into that so i'm going to hand it back to you yeah just um and get safari back wherever it went there it is that looks good okay so we're ready to move on and check out the document api it looks like a couple of people are coming in um a little bit later and uh we're happy to have you um you should be able to follow the catacota and catch up with us uh without a ton of problems but if you don't have problems just ask we'll help you out okay so we're gonna actually look at the document api now so if you're familiar with cassandra you know that it is sort of this hybrid model um it's not like the other nosql databases that have no schema but on the other hand it doesn't use sql um and um but you usually normally with a cassandra database you have to have a schema but we've created a way for you to interact with data as just as json objects plain old json objects just like mongodb and you put them in collections so you can this is a great model for like craigslist for instance right most of what they have is documents and the way they want to work with the stuff it doesn't really lend itself to tables so we're going to go ahead and look at the list of the namespaces so here's the namespaces hmm those look really familiar i think we saw them a little while ago so as it turns out a namespace is well it's a it's a key space so we've got workshop here great um let's um let's make sure and this is important uh that your key space in your astra db file your astra rc file is set to workshop doesn't if it isn't start the workshop then you know go up to the top click on astro rc go ahead and change your key space workshop very important um okay so we're going to write a document now remember we've deleted our cavemen table twice um and we're just gonna throw a document in the database and say it's going in the cavemen collection cool so how does that work well in a minute well now all right so i shoved that in there and you know what i did it made the pavement collections for me and then it put fred in the in that collection uh as you see this is this is straight on json right so you just put it and it can actually you can go as deep as you want um you can have sub documents which are basically um sub objects in your json you can have as complex an object as you want um but so this is fred's database a document id it's kind of not great um so i'm gonna put barney in but when i put barney in you notice that i actually said in cavemen put and and also notice that this was a post to put a new item and this was basically saying update the barney rubble item and put this thing there um there wasn't a barney rubble item but it doesn't care it's just gonna put it in there for you um and then let's go ahead and see what we've got like what how many cavemen do we have what does that look like all right so now we can see uh barney rubble is barney rubble um and then there's this this lovely long id for fred so we can look at the i uh using the id of the document you can get information about it and then oh so and what if i want to look at fred like i don't remember that id so let's uh let's do a a call to again rest v2 names it's so this is so here's something that you want to pay attention to when you're doing things with the rest or the graphql api you're going to use key spaces but when you're working with a document api you're going to use namespaces ks still works as a shortcut collections cavemen and then you give me five um so oh look at that i i broke it oh yes i know why that is because we didn't fix this all right so hey we're gonna fix this now um so http actually we'll just go about barrel so the problem i use here is that i i made some mistakes and i i did update them but it didn't make it quite so this is json right so everything has to have quotes and i have no idea why i didn't put a colon there so now we have first name and then we're doing a filter against um it being equal to fred in http pi um a two equals means uh it's a it's a query parameter so that's how it's sent but just to make sure we all understand how this is working let's make it be very talkative okay so you see this is different i'm not sending a body i'm sending as part of the the query string right and then everything's the same this is my database id notice that i'm able to use my database for either collections or um rest or graphql tables and um or at the same time it's it's it totally works so here's fred and that's his id and uh let's take a look at let's see what we're looking at um so we know barney rubble right and um and then it's first name right i just want his first name and here it is barney is his first name right so you can actually um address different sections of the object that you send over there obviously this can actually get you can be it would be like first name slash you know whatever the next object down is slash whatever the next object down is and you'll get exactly the pieces you want back for that data and then so in this case we're getting uh namespaces again collections caveman barney rubble where last name is greater than flintstone now that's not good i shouldn't have done it that way let's see what happens if we take out the barney rubble identifier it should work yes so so you can see in this case i said tell me about barney rubble if his last name is bigger than flintstone but it's not really i mean i already know what his last name is but i can also say give me the items in the caveman collection where the last name is greater than flinkstone and then we have barney because it's rumble and then um we're going to go ahead and get the document id for fred again again i did a terrible job let's let's use the fixed one that i did i promise this will be fixed all right and then let's yes i got that oh yeah okay so i i was uh i'm i was getting tired so a couple of these i need to update and i will um i i should have something um better uh by the weekend but you can look at if you uh are interested um so fred still doesn't have a job and just for those of you who are um there so there was a typo in one of these um uh code blocks i am pasting the correct code block in uh the youtube chat so um in case anyone missed what the typo was they can just copy paste um i just realized what i didn't do i didn't i didn't set fred to a environment variable i skipped over because i couldn't because there was no dark background oh so uh okay so let's i don't know let's see if fred will be updated now oh there he is okay so um basically this piece if you skip it then you get a 405 because you can't actually um do a patch to the um the caveman collection it would be just to one document all right so now let's look inside now he's of course so he's good um so again this api is pretty simple i mean you've probably gotten that you use the urls a lot to identify um and where you want to go in the collection and what you want to do and and you can actually do a lot of a lot of work there without having to do uh special filters but um i'm going to go ahead and delete it that's not right oh key spaces yeah so there's another uh typo what did i say key spaces are for the rest and graphql and namespaces are for four documents all right um and then we'll go ahead and delete the collection as well again oh key spaces it's not like it was 3 30 in the morning when i was doing this yeah it happened so so key spaces are used for the rest api and the graphql yeah api and then namespaces is used for the document api yeah so i i um it's good time for questions yeah if anyone has any questions i know [Music] um looking back you have a mentee so we do have a mentee yeah i'll uh i'll switch are you we're we're good on the um on the document api if anybody has any questions i'm happy to you know yeah in the meantime i will i will switch over to the mentee so this is our second question of the mentee and remember this is for swag uh so be ready with that um let's see doesn't look like we have many questions i answered a few i know alex is in chat as well answering so um let's go ahead nope nope my music sometimes doesn't like to work all right so we are back in mentee um i'll put the code back up hopefully everyone is still in here uh five one nine two five three three eight those codes are getting longer um yeah so make sure that you are uh ready and give us a thumbs up when you are uh let us know that you are in mentee and ready because we're gonna go on to the next question and uh you gotta answer quickly and make sure you you follow your phone or your uh your browser not the stream because the stream is delayed by several seconds so if you want to answer the fastest best uh must be on your phone or the the browser that meant he's opening all right i'm gonna go ahead and go to the next question remember answer fast to get more points what is the greatest advantage of document api you can upload docx files it's less verbose api is now schema-less or there's nothing at all advantageous for document api api is now schemeless it's the correct answer congratulations everyone who got that correct upload.docx uh that's a word document all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like all right rupaul is now in the lead followed closely by justif and jayesh so congratulations all right we are going to uh pause the mentee again and we will go back to uh the presentation and we will finish up the rest of the quiz um very shortly so kirsten it is all yours again all right so um i i wasn't kidding when i was talking about 3 30 in the morning i um one of the things that's happened recently is we just went to serverless and some of the ways things work have changed and our documentation is scrambling to catch up but in some cases it hasn't um so you know i'm trying what i'm trying to build here is i'm trying to build a sample node.js um file with examples of all the different ways that you can work with the databases and i got like let's say half done so um what the homework that we're going to have today and i'd like you to think about this a little bit is um i'd like you to um look at the different methods in there and suggest a new method that you tested and it works so you'll you can have the astra the the the code that i made and you can copy and paste and play with it but i just want you to figure out uh the kind of question or the kind of update you want to do in the database and um so let's talk over what we have so first we're going to install astra.js collections and astra.js rest and we have to so this time we're going to copy this configuration block i know this is a pain but um so copy the configuration block again and then paste it in your terminal and then just backspace on the app token this time and you can just copy that token from your astra rc file above and then hit return so basically what we're doing here is we're setting these in the environment it actually will use astra rc but that just happened this morning and i did not have time to test it but this will definitely work so um you're going to grab the caveman.js file and then we're all done with this part what no wait oh no it decided i was done well i can just i can forward forward forward forward forward but i don't know if it's right what oh i see okay i figured out what i did wrong all right um let's try that one more time it won't let me in well so click on the box and not on the green uh not on the orange button um and that will put you in um in the right place it it won't let me oh that started test let's try this all right look at all those awesome things we have so i'll start again and that will be really fast all right so i will describe this to you guys so you're gonna do this but i didn't do it right so you're gonna have to copy and paste that and what that will do is it will get you a file called caveman.js which should then appear as it does come on pay attention to me all right i think yeah it's just there it is okay all right so um what we're our goal my goal here is to redo exactly what we did with http in node so i'm going to go through the rest api i'm going to go through the graphql api i'm going to go through the document api however i only made it through i got all of the document done and um with the rest api got through several calls so let's look at what we have so first of all um we're um we're requiring astrojs rest i'm just using the rest uh client even though i'm doing the doc things um i'm i've set some paths right so we have the document based path uh has name spaces right and we are we're just gonna be using caveman that's all good um the rest based path i'm going to have to tell it caveman or i could you know because i have to create it to begin with and then the rest schema path that's how i that that's the the way we actually create the tables so in the rest api um we're going to get the rescue path what are the tables that we have let's um let's throw a got console.log status on that um but we're gonna delete cavemen in case it's already there because sometimes we didn't go through the whole page before we're going to create the pavement table this should look really familiar this is the same basically as when we were using the rest api um this doesn't work because we're an async um and then um then we're gonna post fred to the caveman table and then you know say we created him in the caveman table and check our tables again create a new user bernie rebel same thing and then um there's all sorts of other things we would do but i ran out of time so that's one of the things that you could do for your um for your homework right you know what we want to do right we want to give fred a job delete bernie check the what's left and then delete the table right so that all exists um and that's in the in the rest step i just didn't have a chance to get it done um so let's look at the document id so it's very similar right we're we're posting so again here we already know we're using cavemen and it'll just create it for us so we don't have to take a step to make our collection so we're going to create a new user without a document id and that'll be fred and then we're going to search a collection of documents this should look very familiar notice that in this case we're actually passing a python object not json so it doesn't have the quotes around everything right um uh create a new user with a document id right so we have the path and barney rubble um get that single user by document id get a sub document so this is where it's actually possible um to have like address city uh or zip code or something so you can have different uh you can plum plumb the depths of your item and and uh and and get down into those uh the nested objects to get the information that you're looking for and then um put mcbarney fred's friend gonna update fred to make him wilma and delete a user and then it looks like we're just uh that's just that's just a bunch of extra stuff that i copied and pasted apparently so um i can't run it because i just started my catacota of again but i have it in vs json so i will show it to you there all right and can we get the text blown up a little bit yes thank you make it bigger no that's probably too big that's good all right um gosh i feel i feel lucky let's try i don't think it's gonna work because so in this case testing in production yeah that's great okay so the astro stuff isn't set so i need to go back to my astrodb and get this stuff and i will cheat i'll just go pack a strip rc and i'll get my application token i like it because it says bad on the end but it's not it's good all right so let's see what happens now what what oh i didn't create an uh uh that's this so let's just get right back so basically what it's saying is you don't have a caveman why are you telling me to delete it you're stupid okay so um i like the status of getting the rest schema path and uh there wasn't any data and um we're still having some problems but so you can see that we're making progress here right so what did we get we got we made a table and then we put a thread in and then we asked for the items and i got fred as he is and then i got barney and then we failed at 83. that's hmm wait am i yeah that's not right and we don't need to do that because we already created friend and that's the documentaries anyways so um take some time to look around in here um i i don't know why it's not doing the right thing yeah i had seemed to lost the document api beginning so um well let's let's see what we get i think i can fix this oh here are the document api so let's make a new astra client for the document it should just work all right well i will get this fixed um this afternoon but um i guess it's a good time to say i could really use your guys's help and if you give us something that we add in here i will go to town and ask my my my boss if you give you a piece of swag so but it has to be really interesting you can't just be liking adding wilma or something you have to you have to perform a new a new task that's interesting so um that that is what i would love for you guys to do um and in order to do that homework you're going to go to bitly slash oh it's probably too little make it big oh it does of course it's bitly slash node um stargate and then you'll end up at this repository and um you can uh submit an issue um no why is it not with the what um okay i will fix that um because we have a way to um to go directly to the homework but let me uh i can't let you guys see this because [Music] and i can just post it in the chat yes okay so i'm going to post that in the discord slack the discord i'll update the bitly so that it does it as well but basically what i want you to do is i want you to look at caveman.js i want you to find something you think it should do based on all of the pages before and make it happen so but i i would love to know if you have any questions no questions let me i'm seeing if anyone has any questions uh so some people have had their catacota expire i had that issue as well i think just uh timed out but i have the the homework um link up as well and we do have a mentee to go to um i don't see any new questions coming through and looking back it looks like alex and cedric are in the chat addressing a lot of the questions so i think we should take this opportunity to go ahead and finish up the mentee quiz so that we can get some swag one what do you think yes definitely all right remember uh answering quickly is uh the best way to get max points um i'll put the uh code up again five one nine two five three three eight and we are going to be finishing the quiz in this round so make sure you are ready and give us a thumbs up in menti when uh when you're in so we know when we can start just taking a look and seeing if there's any questions um all right let's go ahead and get to the next question all right question three what is astra it could be a pretty easy one it's a local in-memory version of cassandra it's cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a development tool or it's a gateway to the stars 18 people got it right it's cassandra as a service in the cloud that's right all right let's see where we are in the leaderboard the previous uh top three with rupal just yaph and jaesh see if that changed some people did it faster oh has not changed yet but jazz beer is very very close all right we'll move on to the next one all right what is stargate it's a new mario game it's a tv show it's a data gateway to give you rest graphql api on cassandra as well as document api maybe perhaps or it's a gateway to the stars all right 22 people got it right and it is also a tv show only one person got that one right uh kind of a easter egg there for you but yes it is the data gateway to give you rest graphql document api on cassandra all right let's see where we are on the leaderboard all right jasper takes uh overtakes jaesh for third place otherwise it has been unchanged final question what does server server list mean for a database pay as you go pay only for what you use client applications must be serverless each table is deployed as a new component or you need to write data on sheets of paper all right let's see all right the answer is pay as you go pay only for what you use so it scales for the use that you have up or down all right let's see where we are in the leaderboard let's see what our winners are all right rupal jazzbeer and arnab are our top three winners congratulations uh if you want to reach out to uh uh jack.fryer datastax.com i don't know if he's in the chat he can uh pipe in um if you want to uh submit your uh sorry i'm typing here um you want to submit your screenshot or or um uh what you know on your phone or the tab that you're in um and and email it email jack.friar datasacks.com you can claim your swag congratulations arnab you won all right so to wrap up here uh if you go to that uh bitly um and scroll down to the readme it's got information on how to submit a homework and also uh information on uh one of the cool sample apps we have which is tick tock you can make it tick-tock clone just using you know various free services and uh that also uses astra js so um it's a different way to work with it and in fact if you can um create a tick top clone and point me to it um i would count that as homework too and did you have that bitly uh in the chat did you paste that it's the same it's it's known no that's target no that's target yeah you just have to scroll down a bit to get the readme okay let me uh i want to show that to people all right so yeah here's the submit homework uh and the tri-tic talk section right here all right so let's uh let's wrap up here um for more learning we have our developer site datasacks.com there's a lot of content there more courses more scenarios that you can or more more learning courses that you can use to continue your cassandra learning we also have other scenarios on catacota as well um and we also have the data stacks academy which is um for like certification training and and going like a deeper dive into cassandra uh some of the resources that we have obviously as i said at datastax.com we also have the community uh.datastax.com which is where you can ask um and answer if you know the answers uh to community user questions we also again have our discord channel um where we have a we have a growing community of of people that can help you out and we are pretty active on there as well um you can follow us at datastaxdevs on youtube twitter and twitch um and these uh um these slides or the the category will be available um we'll get uh there should be an updated link for that later we'll get that out as well um so with that said we want to thank you all for joining us um for this workshop hope you learned something hope you had a good time um sorry for the some of the technical difficulties it happens um if you have
