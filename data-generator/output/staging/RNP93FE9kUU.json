    "text": "[Music] welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stacks Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed in building large scale distributed [Music] systems welcome everyone I'm Patrick McFadden I'm live in the studio today it's just me and Jeff Jeff how are you hey I'm great how are you doing I'm good so uh we don't have any remote people today it's just you and me an intimate session really we're going to learn a little bit about data sax Enterprise but from a different perspective you um you've built systems with Apache Cassandra you wrote a book about Apache Cassandra I like to say you wrote the book that was you right that happened yeah that happened but then along the way you got to know data STX Enterprise so this is a good point of view like a like a a diff or a Delta between uh Patrick Cassandra and what's happening in data sex Enterprise which is obviously a lot more than just you know a part of the data cassander database there's a lot more going on there so what was it like for you getting to know data sex Enterprise okay well I it was very eye openening for me as I got to learn the product and all of the capabilities that were there um I got really excited in fact and you know kind of you mentally go back to systems that you've designed and things that you've worked on and oh I I wish I would have known about this feature because I totally would have made use of this here and etc etc so uh what I did is I I took I gathered up a bunch of those things my excited discoveries that I made about dsse and I and I put together uh an old school top 10 list oh like David Letterman style exactly yeah well you you know he's not around anymore you know that right it's getting pretty dated reference is it though well yeah but it's not I mean top 10 lists are still pretty cool I mean BuzzFeed does it now right it's a classic thing yeah no buzzfee does lists all the time like top five things to know what type of bread you eat means how lonely you are or something like that so exactly we'll be fine exactly so this is a little bit better than the um top 10 numbers from 1 to 10 uh maybe just a slightly more substance a little bit less uh absurdity right let's roll with it okay that sounds good okay so number 10 certified Apache Cassandra releases for bug fixes with confidence so you got a little story about that oh man there's a story here yeah I mean uh you know one of the things about when you're working with an open source project is uh one of the great things is obviously you see this you see the source you patch it yourself when you need to and you put a poll request in to try to get that into the official release um so I've seen teams do this where there was a an officially supported version by the Ops Team and then one of the dev teams found a bug in Cassandra and rolled their own version and then there was this inertia like they never wanted to get off their version that that one Dev team supported or there at least there was a head hesitancy there because well we know this works right and the Ops team was like well we don't want to support that anymore because you rolled your own and then there's this tension and well it's that conservative nature of Enterprise development places you know any big shops where hey we're going to be doing this times a thousand times 10,000 we need to make sure that it's exactly the same thing all the time it's consistent so having that certification at least and and knowing that you have a process to get a bug fix instead of just building a oneoff is really I think that's a good thing for large companies right that that that gives you the stability and the comfort that you need and you know knowing that's that's all been tested on maybe up to a thousand node cluster like it is in our test environment right pretty awesome all right so next is number nine ongoing performance Innovation um you know I'm privy to a lot of the stuff I hear about what our product team and engineering team are kind of up to you behind the scenes but I mean there is a lot of performance Innovation that goes on we're not standing still uh you know we're not doing fake benchmarks we're we're benchmarking against ourselves you know most of the time mostly I'm I'm against benchmarks comparative benchmarks against product a versus product B I think they're just kind of a good way to say exactly what you want to say I'd rather have a benchmark that says this is exactly how it works under this particular condition but you're right yeah and then we're doing Apples to Apples against our own product exactly and so we are you know this is part of what data STX is doing is building the best version of Pache cassander we can build and performance is is a big deal and let's let's face it that's probably one of the top things that people come to Apache Cassandra in the first place is they need more performance well in datax Enterprise our version of Cassandra has a lot of Innovations and there's a lot more to come some of these I can't really talk about right now they're still in the forming stage but things that have already shipped for instance are this increased performance on uh paging so whenever you're running a spark workload and that is a big deal because it with when you're running bulk operations with spark that it takes a long time to do anyway because you're doing spark but right if you have fast paging off of the disc with your cassander tables where it sits that can make a big difference in a long running job um I think the other one which is near and dear to my heart is in increased speed on compaction oh yeah that's that's in 5.1 right now that's shipped um great blog post on that in our engineering blog uh I think Dy high is going to be doing a tutorial on that soon so uh it is like twice as fast as what you can get out of the Apache project it it's just our own version of how we do compaction right and that's not something that you're going to see on a specific reader or write request but that's background thing things background processing that is additional load on your nodes right and it's going to it adds up over time so you know we're we are doing all these little things behind the scenes that make everything faster and more performant less resource utilization We Care all right so number eight flexible deployment options for multi- Data Center and multi- workload uh so one of the things that I think is really powerful about dsse is that we don't try to treat uh every possible deployment the same you know different systems are are unique in their requirements in terms of the numbers of data centers that you have where they're located how far apart they are are you doing analytics are you uh running search options are you using graph you know no no two clusters are the same and so there's a whole lot more going on on each one too yeah right so we have things like Advanced replication that allows you to actually hook two separate clusters together that might have low bandwidth connectivity between them yeah that's actually one of the probably the the the least known features of datax Enterprise is the advanced replication it allows you to basically set up a star uh topography where you have a central Hub and then remote clusters entirely new clusters that replicate into a central Hub which has so many cool use cases but that's just not something that's really easy to do or even you can do with uh regular patchy Cassandra out of the box um so data sex Enterprises adding that feature this is pretty important to a lot of Enterprise companies they need this feature for uh things like oil filled operations remote sensors that sort of thing um so that and then the multi- workload would be uh also in How We Do DSE multi- instance how we can run more than one instance on a single server exactly I was just learning about this if you think about it you know you uh may have some existing Hardware resources let's say you're not running in the cloud hey everyone's running in the cloud no we have data centers that are you know on-prem data centers with perhaps some really large machines that we need to get the the most usage out of you know what if we can run multiple nodes on a single large ma large machine this is uh you know this is reality so yeah server sorus Rex exists I I talk about server sorus it's actually one of my presentations so yeah it's a big box like what do you do with all that Hardware utilize it yes so that was a theme that I just saw emerged in a lot of the features that we have in terms of you know it's not a one-size fits-all deployment number seven Advanced security features for your unique environment so uh you know I have made uh liberal use of the outof the-box um default kind of authentication and authorization implementations that come with Apache Cassandra they work great they're extremely functional but okay now we're deploying uh you know we're deploying Cassandra as part of an Enterprise application and guess what in the real Enterprise world I have an existing L app server or Kerberos installation that's been set up how do I integrate with that uh so uh also what if there's a mixture of those uh kind of in place so active directory that sort of thing yeah yeah hooking up to all of those but I may have applications that also like they need their own credentials cuz applications are people too or at least they are from a security perspective Ive well I'm going to make a lot of uh like security people that work in in large Enterprises really angry right now but let's face it security is like the least sexy thing you're talking about when you're deploying an application I it is really the besides documentation probably the last thing you do and you probably aren't doing it very well most times because it is such an afterthought but the problem and this is what I think a lot of people run into is when you forget it and you don't do it right yeah you get the CSO in your office and you look forward to that just like you look forward to having the cops pull up to your house you don't want that right it's kind of that same sinking feeling in your stomach yeah did you really deploy this with the password called 1 two 34 five did you really do that so you know we we do take this seriously so that and we try to make it as easy as possible so you do it um but there's also some cool little features that enable with uh the role based row level access that is a great setup for a multi-tenant story on data stack oh I mean this is I I feel like very very very cool cuz I I have been in conversations in the past about the hypothetical okay what if this app gets really popular and we need to turn it into a multi-tenant app how would we do this and the conversation always kind of Gran to a screeching halt when we got to the data tier like how are we going to enforce this oh man I don't want to try to you you think about it's going to take to implement this ourselves so now this is a now a capability that's built into DSE I can use use the same cluster and use this Rowl access you know uh controlling access to to Fields based on a predicate one of the primary key columns and then I now I can control the access of who gets to see what rows right this is so much better than having to roll your own all right number six reducing your operational burden with Ops Center okay so if you've seen the user interface for op Center I love the visualization of the ring and how it kind of helps you to see I'm a visual person I love to see that organization with the cluster that's not even really what this top 10 list item is is really about for me as much as I love the Eye Candy of the pretty pictures this is a huge time and effort saver and actually honestly keeps you from screwing up um you know having worked with a team that invested a ton of effort in automating the repair process and scripting that and getting that all running just right um and and honestly making several mistakes along the way I don't know that repair is something that you uh want to try to manage yourself manually gosh no or you know even automate the scripting of that yourself uh really I think you know for example Repair Service uh other services that are built into to op Center itself like upgrade service you know take take all that uh kind of doing it wrong off the table Yeah and the services are I think those are one area of course because it they're built by experts people who have been running cassander clusters and datax Enterprise clusters for a long time and they get some of the the Nuance of that but uh even before you get to that point um lifecycle manager LCM yeah it's a deployment Tool uh which is really I mean let's face it this is a hard topic distributed systems are hard especially when you're doing Ops you know these are from my Ops people hashtag Ops life go yeah the Ops people that have to deal with hey we're going to deploy a lot of servers how they need need tools and and help to make that work and LCM is really helpful for the deployment sure because it allows you to get a consistent configuration deployed across multiple servers and trust me that is easy to screw yes I've seen people hand edit 10 configuration files and get 10 different configuration files then beyond that is updating and keeping TR if you have to update a setting making sure that's consistent across your entire cluster again hard one because you don't want to fire up an SSH terminal and go and edit hand edit all of those if you're doing that you're flirting with disaster well a lot of people don't even allow that in their environments right SSH not allowed yeah no it's big big no on that or worse you have these Change Control meetings I know those people out there feel your pain Change Control meetings where somebody has to approve the change set well this is a good way to make sure that those happen with an approved thing so if you're in an environment where you have that this is really going to help awesome so I mean for me it's like taking all the best practices about maintaining a cassander cluster and now it's available in this automated tool right number five okay fast text geospatial complex searches what what have you uh with DSE search so for me like hidden we getting closer and closer to to my heart here and uh you know things that I've been frustrated about and worried about over time and had developers mad at me about when I told them they were using Cassandra uh just the ability to support additional search options so I remember one application where we wanted to do a a kind of like a geospatial location based search and if you think about it what do you need to do you know to put a to do a bounding box you basically need to do a range query on latitude and longitude or some you know multi-attribute kind of query Cassandra doesn't support that out of the box uh and so I I I spent time you know should we do geohashing should we start to trying to roll our own sort of solution out yeah don't do it yourself yeah there just too many Geniuses out there that know how to do this that have figured it all out for you I am a big fan of letting the Geniuses work out the hard stuff and this is one of those and search let's face it is table Stakes anymore for any application you you don't deploy an application without search in it if some facet of search and facet is actually a part of search funny pun I see what you did there yeah you see that uh but the the search capabilities that are built into the data that you're storing inside a c standard table also a graph database and also and this is the cool part is inside of a spark query when you're running analytics um all of those places that can utilize a fast index search for text full text that's pretty cool and then I didn't even know this but in we have this is this is like 5.5 is inside uh our DSC file system if you have a file in there you can also index those files inside a DF dsfs and have a query language to do that that's super flexible it's going to make your application build life a lot easier all right number four real time and operational Insight with the SE analytics okay so what am I getting at here um you may have had conversations as as I have in the past uh about someone asking uh you know a peer project or another team um coming to you and saying okay well we love all the um the great services that you're building in in your new system and we need to be able to get that data out and extract that out so we can get it into our analytics environment so that we can run uh you know some reports and build that kind of stuff up so you know either we can go and write some code that uh hits a rest API and go starts to go and pull a bunch of things out or maybe we could just um you know maybe as you're saving stuff you could you know put it on a queue and we can just kind of monitor that that event stream and do a little change data capture and blah blah blah move data move data move data moving data it's just a horrible horrible thing because in my experience soon as you start getting into the operation of moving data then this is where trouble be begins because you're you you're always going to lose data something's going to get dropped out bits get Fly you know they fly into the wrong place right um it's very complicated to get parody and match up the the the impedance matching between data sets is very difficult then you're into that's the tea part that's why we have transform is because the impedance matching between two different data stores is really difficult um and I that you know I I've been very vocal about this I think ETL is a disaster you don't do it if you can help it and that's one of the reasons that running uh any kind of any kind of analytics workload inside data sex Enterprise is advantageous because you're working on data that's already stored in a Cassandra table locally and it operates against that table locally it isn't going out to you know have a load job that finds the data from some other data store dumps it into a data warehouse and good luck yo it may not be there right but then again you know we have okay we have this data in Cassandra that we want to run spark jobs on sure yes we can go to other data sources from other systems and pull those in as well it's all it's all spark right so we can we can certainly do that in that DC analytics environment number three exploring New Horizons with DSE graph so I've got to say that you know in some of the past uh applications that I've designed and helped to build you know the graph technology wasn't even on my radar uh I yeah it's it's it's just popping onto everyone's radar I think so I think it it's like you know you're only beginning to see some of the use cases that are coming out but uh I I definitely you know have um had discussions about interfaces with recommender systems and oh how are we going to pull again how are we going to pull this data out so that we can do realtime analytics uh customer 360 we want to be able to do product recommendations based on our perspective of the customer that we have uh I think it's phenomenal that this is an integration that we now have built in right on top of the of the core data sax product well it it adds another dimension to the way you look at data and I that's what's fascinating to me is I had not really put the time into thinking deeply about graph until I started seeing the use cases which are much different than in a lot of cases for instance you know the the classic is the bill of materials is recursive queries where you're having to Traverse lots of data and you have no idea of the boundary and you know anyone's in ever written recursion code knows that that's super scary because you know what your bottom out case is and if you're doing that on a database that could be equally as scary um I didn't even know you could do recursive queries but that's you know in cql uh or SQL and I don't know if I would even write one but graph makes that super easy it makes it a lot easier plus the relationships of data it uh where relational data relational tables describe the relationships uh graph is lets you find the relationships embodies the relationship and I think uh you know there is a lot of talk in Industry about um digital transformation that's like big buzzwords you know customer 360 customer experience customer experience the the technology that enables you to do those kinds of things is the technology that understands people and relates to understands people and how they're related and yeah and say that and you say hey my data is related it doesn't mean you're talking a relational database exactly right yeah number two letting your data tell its own story with data stack studio so we've been talking a lot uh on the distributed data show about studio if you are following us subscribing um you'll you'll see definitely a number of episodes where we are talking about uh Studio and giving demonstrations of it and so on and you know evangelists are out there recording lots of content about uh data saac Studio there's a reason that we are so excited about this as a tool so uh in development shops that I've worked in I just anecdotally um you might expect to see developers that are working with Cassandra you know doing lots of cqlsh and kinds of commands and no they're using Dev Center which is kind of our our previous tooling that was based on an eclipse styling environment uh even to the point where I would see testers so anybody who was touching Cassandra uh was running Dev Center and I think the reason that why is because of that that visual aspect to it the syntax highlighting the and especially the ability to see traces of queries and see where time was being lost yeah so I feel like Studio takes that to the next level it has all of those capabilities but now we're talking you know the autoc complete type features that that are there the the ability to take that data yeah I just ran a query uh whether it be a cql query or a graph query and I now have that data in a table and that's great I can look at in Json format some people like that but I want to see a visual representation of it I want to see it in a graph a chart High charts that's I mean that's how I I've see well no pun intended again but that's how I see graph data is in those dots with arrows connecting them all together and and that brings it to life a little more it gives you a better I'm much more of a visual person I guess in that regard right um typing out a gremlin command doesn't give me the feel for my connected data and that's that's the truth but I you know notebooks are really they're a Hot Topic right now um they've been around for a while but uh you look at Jupiter is is taking off and doing its own thing around Python and some of the data science but a studio fits that same mold where hey I it just kind of acknowledges the fact that we have people that work with data somewhat transactionally they're working around it they're they're exploring data that's right before they write applications or as they're writing applications it's just an important part of working with data now yeah I mean that ability to sort of interact and and save off little Snippets I would say that the the other thing when I saw people using Dev Center is the the companion application to Dev Center was notepad right or I have these little Snippets of you know of of partial queries and and attributes um primary key columns that I've kind of Saved off because I want to look at later now I save that in a notebook yeah and it's all there and I can write a markdown comment that describes what I'm seeing and it's all self-documenting it's all right there well I know SQL people out there have probably been using toad forever so this is just what we expect to have as a place where we can store all our cool queries because you we keep them to ourselves right right all right and can we have a drum roll for number one help me out no there how's that okay number one all right number one that was horrible all right so well we need to raise our our game on we need sound effects okay number one is innovate instead of administrate or administer with data stocks manage Cloud um I'm super excited about this capability to the point where I'm kind of driving the product team crazy at times on the data CL like can we talk about this yet can we talk about this yet are you ready to talk about it well it's out it's around it's and I it's funny because we were talking about Ops Center is it makes um Ops life uh a lot easier but data section managed Cloud's acknowledgement that some people just don't even want to deal with it at all right that hey I'm not interested in running this massive uh cluster of you know this super important data I would rather you just do this for me and that that's where data sex manag CL comes in right so I mean do is that what you want to be thinking about I'm starting new Project X okay I'm in a big established company and I'm working on the awesome new corporate objective or I'm a startup and I you know three guys and we're coding in my basement in either case do I really want to be spending all my time figuring out how to set up and administer my Cassandra cluster or do I want to be writing business logic and cool web UI and mobile apps that sit on top of all that I think I know where I would be wanting to spend my time it's it's the natural I think it's a Natural Evolution of infrastructure where the the problem that we're solving for you know whatever you're writing your application for the problem you're solving for that's that's the goal that's the mission the the methods that you get there need to be cost effective reproducible and fairly error free so we we've seen that with Cloud adoption where people are like I don't want to run my own data center I don't want to think about power and fuel contracts and all that stuff I'll let someone else deal with that we're we are as a industry moving towards that because we're we're trying to solve the problem of how do I get people to use my application or interact with my products or whatever exactly MH all right so that's it that that is the top 10 that was very and yeah it was very David Letter manes it was not BuzzFeed I thought okay that's good that's what we were going for yeah you know it was really good thank you all right Jeff well thanks again for joining us on the distributed data show a very small intimate version studio version but thanks again for joining us thank you for joining us
