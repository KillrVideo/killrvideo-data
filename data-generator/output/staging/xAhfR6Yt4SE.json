    "text": "[Music] now that we know a little bit about what the dse search index does tokenizing descriptive values applying complex query predicates and producing a set of row identifiers primary key values that are returned to dsc core for further processing we enter a brief discussion about a number of further dse search metadata objects regardless of the number of columns in a dse table that have the dse search index ability placed upon them the dse search index is a table wide object that is given a dse table with 10 columns and a dse search index ability to add it to only two columns there is still only one dse search index on said table as such the dsc search index name is the same as the dsc table name upon which the dse search index was created all dse tables and the dse search index placed on each are uniquely named by the combination of key space name and table name while there is no technical limit to the number of dse search indexes created or the number of columns given dse search ability there is a cost to indexing all indexes are in effect vertical slices of the tables they support the index contains all rows and a subset of columns the index columns thus inserting updating or deleting from a table with many index columns incurs the additional operational load of not only changing the row proper but also any index entries as such only index columns that you know are referenced frequently by query predicates dse search indexes can be created and managed using cql and or the dse tool command line utility dse search uses apache lucene libraries to generate and maintain index data files similar to dse core these index data files are immutable appended to and compacted on a scheduled basis index data is stored one index per directory in the parent directory specified in the dse yaml with the setting solar underscore data underscore dur dse search index data is updated automatically as the dse table proper is updated to ensure that these updates occur a specially designated commit log is assigned to each dse search index lastly dse search index data is co-located on the same node with the data in the dse table proper that the index data refers to when you call to create a dse search index you specify a number of index configuration details these details are organized into two groups schema and config or configuration schema is what you might expect column names column types the treatment a column value receives as it is indexed and other config offers a number of settings related to memory use and other each of these two groups of metadata are stored in solar admin dot solar resources system table as blobs each of these two groups schema and config are associated with distinct cql commands commands for just schema and then just config as well as distinct legacy apache lucene xml encoded data files one for just schema and one for just config ultimately you may need to execute one cql create search index statement followed by a number of cql alter search index statements to get exactly the dse search index ability your end user application requires as such the metadata you define is first pending received by dse and in dse system catalogs and then active after you deploy or build said dse search index dse search indexes are always available that is after you create or build the initial dse search index any subsequent dsc search index recreation or reconfiguring is done in full multi-user mode and the new index once complete is made active with no interruption in service or processing once any changes to the dsc search index are made active both the pending and active metadata will be the same until the next change in dse search metadata at that time any dse search index changes will appear only as pending and then not active consider these are all design phase activities once a dsc search index is in place you may need to change it only when your end user application requirements change and then the last of the dsc search index metadata objects resource files also known as resources dse search indexes have the ability to remove stop words words like a and the or other dse search indexes can also support synonyms mobile phone cell phone mobile moving picture movie picture show elizabeth liz beth tina and more by convention these lists of data are submitted to dsc search using the dse tool command line utility and are stored in the solar admin dot solar resources table these resource files are later referred to by an identifier specified at time of submission and are table wide in scope they are also dropped when the dse search index is dropped versioning updates are performed by uploading a new version of said resource file and then calling to rebuild the index as overview previously when we discuss active and pending",
