cassandra today alex wallisner here and i'm very happy to greet you at this event and first of all i would like to say thank you many thanks to christina and lynn for hosting this event it's a big pleasure for me to speak here and we are about to start very good time to start if you can see me if you can hear me please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so i will know what you are together with me and we can start hi ahmed i believe i've seen you at one of our previous workshops that's great very happy to see familiar names yeah we can hear you so i will start slowly but smoothly so this one i don't want to spend too much time on the preparations this one we are going to discuss today the topic of today is the designer designing resilience systems based on the apache cassandra experience and you know what apache cassandra is a great thing to base any kind of our analysis and attempts to build better more silent and capable systems because it's well one of the most capable systems in the world in this moment that's used by like very many big companies you know for sure so why do we speak about the things we are going to speak today that's all because of murphy whatever you don't like at this workshop at this session don't blame me but blame murphy and his law anything what can go wrong will go wrong and that's just a question of a time today we try to investigate the general principles what help us to design a better more silent and more powerful systems and then that's based on the apache cassandra and why it's based on the apache cassandra that's a simple answer out of all the powerful distributed systems over the world this one is maybe most widely used by the biggest companies and everyone who works with the big data so today we will do a deep dive into apache cassandra architecture because of the features of the system and the things it provides for the users big data ready and when i say big data i mean real big scale so we speak about dozens petabytes or more we speak about linear scalability we don't know how our system will grow but we need to have some linear scalability we may need more nodes to have more servers how many you will see in a moment then it's famous for its geographic distribution so you may have multiple active active data centers all across the world disaster tolerance as there is no single point of failure to be discussed today again even full outage of a single data center is not a problem because clients can always proceed with a next available data center so it's not what you call fault tolerance but real true disaster tolerance and highest possible performance so those are the things we will speak about today and that's the platform we will use to discuss on how it's designed luckily it's an open source project so it's really easy to investigate deeper how big is big we use it to call netflix one of the biggest cassandra users and they have uh last time i was talking with the netflix guys it was around 70 000 cassandra notes maybe now it's higher because of this year 2020 madness you know they are used to be even in higher demand than before so i guess that gets closer to 100 000 of servers dedicated to work with cassandra and well pretty a lot of operations some of you may never met apache cassandra before you think no of course you know cassandra and you use cassandra moreover do you use apple or macbooks any iphones you use cassandra because cassandra is one of the main sources of trough for any kind of apple products with 160 000 nodes servers working with apache cassandra and storing data building clusters on this infrastructure and this is scaling by the way we use it to call apple the biggest cassandra infrastructure in the world that was wrong i said it as well i was wrong as well too um sorry biggest now um deployment for the cassandra is huawei with much bigger numbers than like 150. so we will speak about disaster tolerant design principles and i have to sorry if you are await from this uh session to be like how to you go you do this you do that you have resilience system it doesn't work this way because i'm very sorry but it's still the fact different companies different businesses different projects have different workflows and use cases so what we do today is not we are trying to build the how to um but we are trying to do something better from my point of view we are trying to work through all the main general principles you need to know to build a highly resilient system system able to scale as cassandra scales and first thing we just a second yes okay so first thing we will speak about is uh replication or i would better say that never have a single instance of something whatever you're trying trying to develop always think of every running unit you need to have three of them even if you now find you for one if it's a development ecosystem that's still fine staging testing it looks like it's fine to have one running server one running service but that's a mistake think of free not of two because when you have two you also that's a trap in our mind trying to bring them uh together but think better or free always have to run three or more instances even if you don't need them right now think what you will need them in the future what does that mean what does that mean replication replication data replication in case of cassandra or service replication in your case it's a question of single instance of whatever you run is doomed and that's not a question of if it will happen if failure will come or not but that's that question of time so failure is inevitable as long as you have only single instance of something of a service you are running it will die it's a just question of time we have to counteract that somehow and our easiest way to interact that is to run multiple copies of what you find crucial to run so as cassandra replicates data we may replicaf replicate services but it's not so easy as it may look like you cannot just start the second instance of your application mostly probably it's going to lead to some problems what kind of problems let's talk a little bit a little bit about that first problem we want to cover and how do we avoid that that's inconsistency inconsistency in general a very simple and very bad thing imagine we have a situation you're working with data and your data is replicated as cassandra replicates data and data is replicated into multiple nodes if we run an update we change something we change username or account state maybe and some of the nodes were updated and some of the notes weren't it may lead to problems because well then when you may query stale data that's what call it cross note inconsistency so that's a big problem why it happened in general so take a look as long as you work with single instance so no distributed system you may ignore this cp theorem but as long as you start to work with distributed systems you really have to focus on that and you have to learn that as a law cap theorem also known as mark brewer's theorem speaks about distributed systems and in the distributed application that's impossible to simultaneously deliver more than two out of three following capabilities guarantees consistency partition tolerance and availability what does that mean so take a look i will briefly describe every part of this combination consistency means whatever you want of your service of your nodes return the same value the most up-to-date value if database is consistent you may ask every of the nodes of this database every parts of the system and they will return the same volume if database is not consistent you may deliver stale data which was updated for other nodes but which one didn't get the update somehow second thing is availability availability means what you always get the answer it may be a stale answer but at least an answer not a 500 error code response code you got my answer highest possible highest possible availability means what you can lose uh node by node and cluster by cluster data center by data center but there is as long as one server is running you can get your response that's what we call highest availability and partition tolerance is the ability of a system to survive network partitioning and if you aren't too much into networking things and distributed systems that's a little bit more interesting point to explain it means what you may have lack of network connection not between your client asking for some data and your database server but between some of your database servers and that's a very bad thing that's for example if you work with postgresql or mysql if you have some situation of a split brain network partitioning also known as split brain when you have some of your servers on the one part of a network some of your servers on the second part of your network and then that's a big problem because if a second part elects a new master or you arrange a new master as a result you have two masters or two primary servers and that will work not so good so you have to remember what there are three primary features and in the perfect scenario if you have no network problems if your power supply is always perfect and there are no rains in the skies you may have all three of them together if you live in the real world like i do then you have some problems because at some point something will happen and at this moment you cannot reach all three of them features you want to reach so what we have to think is what how it works and which is most important for us for any kind of a distributed application we cannot sacrifice partition tolerance and when we have to decide if we have to stay highly available and partition tolerant and highly consistent and partition tolerance so the trade is between availability and consistency and at every moment of the time you have to understand what you are sacrificing if you are waiting for the response for all of your notes to keep it always fully consistent then that's a problem as long as one note is not available because of network problem you cannot get answer and you are not highly available anymore but as soon as you decide okay i can sacrifice one or two answers but i want to be highly available then you cannot guarantee consistency because maybe the note the answer you didn't received was for only one updated note okay then uh now after all this story you may be like okay how the hell distributed databases work at all and well i cannot say for every distributed system in the world but the as the example for us the main lab sample for us is cassandra i will speak about cassandra we cannot break cap theorem but we can adjust settings what does that mean very simple every application works with data of different importance at the same application you may make i don't know a money transfer and you do want it to be very consistent and at the same moment your friend may have changed a profile picture and you are very fine if you open page and you get profile picture which was not fully not finished the full update and you were receiving the old one which changed like half second ago but you are still watching the previous one it's not a big deal you can survive that but you do want to be strictly consistent about your money so you see same application different importance in cassandra the cp uh theorem problem is passed on the perk very basis when you do a query for your data like you are writing something or you are reading something you can explicitly specify which kind of a consistency level you may want to have right now so if you are working with like very secondary data throwing some logs throwing something what will not be required after a minute you can go with any that's pretty dangerous ground you don't want your bank and banks are using cassandra a lot you don't want to use your bank use any for any kind of your transfers no way but when we have something with a higher level of a consistency and we are starting with one two three local one quorum what does that mean it means of how many of the nodes we wait for confirmation before we consider data written or before we consider the data we read as consistent and in this case that's one note we need we wait only for one answer of course that's dangerous but the fastest two three the same but here interesting thing comes quorum quorum means the majority of the notes so if i have for example five notes i will wait only for free answers and if the matching if they all okay approve it then i'm done my write is done and the same applies for uh read as well so we're giving a matching data if i use all then i will wait for all responses but do you remember what is the cap theorem says only two or three are achievable at the moment so if you decide to go with consistency level o you are getting immediately into the consistence and partition tolerance by the price of the availability the only thing we can trade and at this moment you are losing availability one server is not available you are not highly available anymore so how to treat them here is a nice mathematical trick we want to be quick we want to keep higher highest possible level of availability but we also don't want to have stale data how do we handle that very easy in general in short if you write your data on the quorum getting confirmation for all of the servers you are working with and if you are read the data on the consistency level quorum getting the most up-to-date data from quorum of from the majority of your servers your services then you are always consistent because it's uh cannot be the situation when you have quorum right quorum read and you are still getting stale data very simple you will get the notification if quorum cannot be reached in this case and you will um you will identify the situation and you will not dispatch stale data so usually that how it works and by the default settings majority to write majority to read means immediate consistency it's called immediate consistency okay so we discussed cep and that's a big thing but we have to move on here comes one more problem to discuss before we go on from the replication topic to next one stateful services typical example to explain on the web services working with user sessions when you find a web store you are looking at nice t-shirts you want to buy a couple of t-shirts and you will you work with one of our servers and let's say it will be service a1 instance you are good but what can go wrong your user session is written only in these instances like a normal symbol web application store session data in files and if by any reason your query goes to service a2 so the same service but the second instance of its service what will happen there is no session stored and you just picked up all the best t-shirts you want to buy and boom your cart is emptying on next query is full again and next query is empty why because your queries are balancing between multiple service instances and some of them have your sessions some of them don't and you have to again log out again and so on if you are working with the application and then boom you are logged out and you have to log in again it may have been this exactly the situation of a user session instance of the service is not available anymore they're running a new one your session is not transferred you have to log in again i bet every one of you met this situation before because that's a common case okay so i say stateful services are bad try to avoid them so how do we avoid them first point for us would be um sticky sessions sticky sessions is an interesting idea it keeps a load balancer in front of your service instances and remembers the first server you conducted and after that tries to root all your queries to this particular server so it means what all queries of a user a will be processed by an instance service a1 and all the queries of user b will be always processed by service instance number two it's a good idea it works but it also has one strong downside if you're if you have to drop its server you are planning an upgrade or you are planning something uh to change you want to take it down you want to restart it put an upgrade whatever then with sticky sessions it's kinda impossible to handle so the only thing you can do is to inform your customers what um you maybe will be logged out in a couple of minutes that's definitely not nice practice and so session stickiness is a special story uh there is another interesting way which is a shared shared state in our case you try to isolate all their state out from the services making them as stateless as possible preferably perfectly stateless and then you go uh and services a1 instance service a second instance don't stay don't store uh user session at all but they're getting that from any kind of a quick k-value database maybe roxdb for example and it allows you to work very very quickly in uh loading data from that and that may introduce a tiny delay because well quick file operation may be quicker than a network operation it depends on your network and it depends on your file system of course but in general it works pretty well and then you are planning to scale out your application you absolutely must think about shared state and you must think about how to make your services as stateless as possible typical thing as said are the user sessions but there are much more so you have to find out a way how to make your services as stateless as possible sticky sessions will work but it may be not the best approach you may use okay are we done hardly started there are a lot of things to discuss so let's move distribution what kind of a distribution what does that mean very simple what stay together is doomed together again it's a question of time we have to distribute things like we distribute them in apache cassandra we distribute them over the world over multiple data centers as cassandra's designed to way to have multiple active active data centers over the world it also a long story there are some points to consider first of all any kind of network communications especially when we have for example here me located in germany and eric ramirez in australia you know what uh that's obviously going to be a network delay between two of us what does that mean work with local data center that what matters work with uh the one instance which is close to you while keeping our instances distributed how to start if you have a tiny application well if you have a small application and you think how to avoid risks like that you definitely want at least if you're working with a normal data center to put your services running into different racks of this data center this way you avoid a network delays while at least avoiding single rack failure then all of your servers are staying in the single rack if you're already in the cloud that's much easier because then you can you can go from one availability zone to another having your services running in availability zone a b and c at the same time if you coverage replication problems discussed before when we when you will be fine and a few more things to talk about uh about how exactly are you going to handle this distribution and route any kind of network queries services are doing to each other there are three main things uh cluster shema so how the uh which service located where and how do they work together if we speak on a higher level we can use any cast ip or dns load balancing so what does that mean cluster shamma is not exactly our way in this case because we want to serve we want our services to be more flexible and easier to use so we think of better things like on a global level any cast ap or dns load balancing what does that mean first point dns load balancing is the way easiest to explain you have your instances of your application running in multiple data centers united states west united states east europe central very good and you can have completely one single domain name for all of them my perfect t-shirt shop shop.com but depending on the geographical location of who is asking of a customer it will receive different ip addresses so that's what call it dns load balancing if you you allocated most of you i guess located in the united states are doing question for uh my perfect t-shirt shop.com you will get one ip address and i am doing the same query in the europe will get another ip address that allows us to go to work globally in multiple centers in multiple data centers that's especially convenient with the cloud of course so things like aws or google compute platform have native services to support this kind of things that's very great another option which is more advanced in even cooler is anycast network routing anycast is like low level networking thing but i want you to know it because just because it's really cool that should be completely enough any cost how do you think one single ip address how many servers may have this ip address if they work in the global internet network answer is basically as much as you want a single ip address may be registered for multiple servers and then you may ask how does my laptop decides which of them then to access because servers are different answer is that's a question for a router and router picks the closest one so if multiple servers announce the same ip address routing mostly probably of your isp provider internet service provider will pick the closest one automatically so any cast ip network addressing is the coolest thing which is not so easy to organize so mostly probably you if you are going to use any cast you are going to have an experienced network engineer and that's well not the as simple as just uh normal network address but it's really one of the coolest things you may use from the point of view of the network balancing and moreover it also has automated fallback if you have multiple servers with the same ip address and closest one to one of your clients by any reason is not available anymore whatever happened that doesn't matter when uh what happens this ip address will be there registered by your internet service provider router and all of your queries will go automatically to the next closest ip address also cool downside there is a time gap when this time is not this ip address is not deregistered yet for the missing server and at this time parts of this region may be uh detached so that's the site i don't like as you see dns load balancing might have some better options as well but any cast going to be faster stainless okay you know what that's not enough even if you have uh multiple servers uh but running on a single cloud platform that doesn't matter guess what that's just a question of time we have seen network and power and many other outages by all the major minor as well cloud platforms and any kind of hosting companies over the world all of them fail and that's again just a question of time so good side uh try to be as platform agnostic as possible using proper tools like infrastructure as a code for example with terraform but that's a special topic to speak about and speaking about many other things that's very important to be able to run the same parts of the same application over the multiple platforms at the same moment of a time and that's really cool because that's exactly how apache cassandra works that's one of the core principles be platform agnostic be able to run on every platform today it's azure tomorrow you found out what google campaign platform gives you 50 persons discount on everything boom migrate within one day okay if you have a lot of data it's not going to be one day but still and so on and so forth what are the downsides first of all it's harder to manage of course it's much easier to work with a single data center of one single provider if you are going to work with multiple data centers from a previous topic that's already a problem but if you're going to work with multiple providers then it's double trouble so and it's costly any kind of a data transfer if you speak about the big data any kind of a data transfer between multiple different network different cloud providers for example going to be pretty expensive so uh this one approach is for everyone to discuss uh on your planning meetings what do you really want to have uh if and you have to watch your slas sell the service level agreements what's the level of um uptime you want to deliver how quickly you want to deliver your responses and you know you have to understand what every next uh percent of the uptime comes with higher and higher costs so at some points you have to stop and if your application that have no slas you really have to stop quit with meet up right now and go and read about what the slas and slos are because that's very important i'm kidding of course please stay with me till the end uh but that's really important you have to clearly understand whatever requirements for your application and what do you want to have in the end and even if you don't have any like fixed formal service level agreements you definitely have to define at least for yourself in person your self service level objectives service level objectives are important agreements they are for customers kinda then signing contracts you are going to deliver something for microsoft for microsoft congratulations then we have to sign a contract and agreements go to contracts but what you always need to have even if you are running a tiny web store i don't know based on god bless wordpress i don't care you have to understand for yourself what do you want to have and which level of service level objectives you want to have like i want these website to be available 99 persons dot 99 and that would be enough for me then the costs can be pretty small if you want to go higher you have to pay more sorry there is no free cheese durable design some more things to cover that very important to remember [Applause] those services meant to be expandable and those services meant to be replicable and that's very important every unique service in your ecosystem is the bottleneck and the single point of failure so you always have to remember that points of failure ever every part of a system must be expandable replicable and as stateless as possible that's always important to have that decentralize it on one of my former projects it was pretty funny story we were getting ready for a huge success on some marketing campaign and we prepared everything from them scalability point of view so we wanted to have a lot of every that was microservice based architecture and we prepared everything to scale out we prefer it everything to be very ready to the new customers coming and then it happened and application was not available at all why because we just forgot the one single service responsible for authorization and whatever we did it didn't matter because one single service became a bottleneck a single point of failure so you have to walk through all of your architecture without missing every single tiny service without missing every single part find out and identify every part of them to find who can be who is if you are unique that's bad it's great when you are unique as a person every person is unique but services must be expandable not unique if you want to have five of them today then make five of them tomorrow two is fine two is fine okay no single point of failure that's very important principle and there is a very good example coming from devops world old story about cattle over pets what's the difference between cattle and pets first of all pets have names cattle have ids if pet is sick you will bring your friend to a veterinarian if a cattle is sick it's expanded and um your services i'm sorry to say so i believe you love your work and you love what you are doing as much as i do they meant to be expandable their cattle so every service should not have a name but only id every service instance of course and then if you need to have more run more if you don't need them anymore drop them that's important that's what call it durable design you need more you will have more next one horizontal scaling so first of all there are two kind of scaling horizontal and vertical what does that mean with vertical scaling now i have one middle range server and it looks like i'm pretty successful on the market so i'm going to have more people coming to us very soon and i'm buying more powerful server migrating my service to this more powerful and that's what working vertical scaling is you are buying more powerful machine and moving to it uh in comparison with that horizontal scaling is very different we are moving not to them oh next one bigger machine but instead of that we are scaling out to multiple amount of machines of the same level well depends on your strategy but more or less the same level commodity hardware they are never too much expensive the point is if you do vertical scaling you know how numbers start to grow at some point with just like every next click becomes too much and too expensive even for the biggest companies so what cassandra does and what i recommend you to do think of a horizontal scaling if you follow the previous points and follow some other points from this session you will understand you don't need to have powerful machine you need to have enough of a middle level machines to have your application uh successful for the databases it may be different but for the normal application servers think of horizontal scaling that's a better thing possible downsides the more machines you have harder than to manage fleet management may become very hard in this case two things to help and two things to consider configuration management and infrastructure automation or infrastructure is a code another big thing so configuration manager management your configuration for service should not be done manually they should be done by the special software configuration management software example uh main mainstream most widely used now ansible chef puppet there are some more but those three are the main things to manage configuration over multiple machines and infrastructure is a code in you may have heard something about terraform but also every cloud provider if you go to a cloud provides something about infrastructure as a code infrastructure as a code yep uh so for google compute platform it's going to be um cloud manager i believe and for aws that's going to be cloud formation horizontal scaling with no overhead now take a look and then for most of the applications they can scale but every next added node brings some overhead it means what scaling is not linear and on then every next step you will have less and less addiction addition to the computational power or storage capacity you are having right now netflix one of the biggest not only users but also developers of apache cassandra made a very nice experiment uh that's available in their tech blog i recommend to read very interesting reading they scaled out a test cluster with apache cassandra from 50 nodes to uh 300 nodes like 280 i don't remember exactly and notice the results that's a client writes by node with replication factor free so every uh piece of data is replicated three times you know what that means already and on every next on the downside you see the amount of nodes oh i have a mouse that's great here we have amount of notes over time and here we have writes by node count you see this sweet long line that means linear scaling it means we can add more nodes it brings no overhead try to watch things like that if your system scales no linearly it means at some point scaling will not help if you see it's predicted to be in a far far future then it's fine but if you're getting closer to this point you definitely want to consider something then one more thing managing of a complicated system is a big story is a big job and for us that's important to have a system as capable to manage its own problems as possible then it's great uh situation changes quickly and if you are trying to do it manually it's not going to work very well when we speak about cassandra explicitly as it's our uh demo uh base for today it's a shama aware cluster it means every node in the cluster doesn't matter if you have three or three thousand knows which kind of data located on which node if this node becomes the coordinator it will serve a request it will know whom to ask immediately gossiping nodes are communicating with each other all the time no primary secondary databases but masterless system so all of the nodes communicating with each other of them they are gossiping so note understand all the time what this node is fine and it's my neighbor it's close network time network response times is always very short so that's my neighbor and it's healthy and another note is also healthy note answers always but it's like uh way far from me it's always very slow response and okay now i know who is my neighbor and this node is not responding from time to time i have to consider that if i have to ask something and i can avoid this one potentially sick node it will avoid that so that's a self-aware cluster understanding how the how the different part of the cluster work or not work really so you want to know it also helps with early failure detection as even before metrics on your monitoring showing something is wrong gossiping may have a clue about what something is wrong in this part of network and we can avoid that and one more thing of course to uh consider is service out to discovery if we are speaking about no manual management you're definitely worth adding you definitely want adding a new node and decommissioning an old node to be automatical process and you don't want to go and manually register this new node of all of the nodes so we will know where the new guest has come you do one command and that's a cluster task to do that and you know what it's a long story because cassandra is one of the most sophisticated systems we may have an open source but that's definitely worth trying to see if your system may require something like that self healing and we are getting close to the end failure detection and recovery error will happen over time it's what just a question of time you already know the answer and i can tell i was a developer for a significant part of my life i was in operations i was a devops engineer one of the first i would say and i can tell the one thing which i hate developers the most there are two things actually but one thing why i hate developers sometimes so strong nearly no one cares about error handling and then you writing your code don't care about raw handling then me on production have to handle this so i do ask you you are great people you are attending meetups it means you want to grow please handle your errors properly it will be a very separate session i really want to do later because error handling is a great and highly underestimated topic but in general we are used to have missing error handling and recovery as a result of all of those things usually very slow people don't monitor what they have and people don't handle properly errors as a result there can be a mistake which happened couple of months ago and you will recognize that only then you are receiving message from your angry customer obviously it means what that's a very very very big fail a roar detection should be quick and automated and on every kind of potential fail situation we have to write the code which knows what any kind of network operation may fail like developers are so optimistic they usually forget what network operation may fail and what worse what can be worse when failed network operation you are sending a network query to a neighbor service and you don't receive and response what can be worse answer is simple very very very slow ping then you get the answer and you get this answer in half an hour it means what we service instance was blocked for all this time so you don't only have to wait for them you don't only should expect uh network failure on any kind of a network operation but you also have to expect slow response and always set the timeout and cut their connection if it doesn't work quick enough speaking about cassandra things uh there are multiple things first of all every node in the cluster is ready to discard to dispatch and answer every request it doesn't mean what every node stores all the data if you have 10 petabytes of unique data you don't want every server to store 10 petabytes of data because it's like just stupid but what you really want to have you want your nodes to understand where the data is located and which node to ask but as a client you shouldn't care whom to ask that's a cluster job to dispatch a query to a proper replica node to answer when you always have to think about the failure if you fail on right some of the nodes got update some weren't because of network outage okay a node handling with query will write so-called hinted handoff that's apache cassandra word so if you never met this before that's perfectly fine hit the hinted handoff means that note what was dispatching query coordinator node will store this data and as soon as failed node uh recovers and notifies neighbors we are gossiping okay i'm here would am i missed anything uh coordinator will dispatch with storage hinted handoff to one who was missing but also many other layers of the fans fail and read wait for next response decrease weight of a suspicious note and initiate repair on read for example if required of some of the nodes answer it out there stellar data because well inconsistency is a big problem in the distributed systems we have to remember about that all the time and one of the sweetest things operational simplicity lack of laziness is the developer's worst curse and if you will look for the author of a quote it's me because well it is one of the worst scenes of a developer is a lack of lessons only lazy developers may be truly efficient and lazy developers efficient developers don't want to do the same job manually again and again manual operations a slow very error prone and no transparent and that's bad to have no transparent operations every operation should be traceable all repeatable operations should be automated and traceable and that's very great if your application may work with the data like that uh what do we speak for when we speak about cassandra what does that mean i bring a new node and what does that mean i need the data to be replicated and move it to the new node as well that's i initiate that but that's an automated operation i don't care i don't put any kind of data manually if i decommission the node if i don't need this node anymore data from this node may should be moved out to other nodes so we will have higher density but i can take down this one it must be fully automated operation repartitioning and emergency rebalance when we have lost some nodes due to whatever that's also must uh have to be prepared these kind of more advanced steps i guess you will not do it for your perfect t-shirt shop.com but when we speak about more advanced distributed systems that's definitely can be a very important thing again that's really great then your system is able for self-healing uh typical think we speak about the cloud deployments with auto-scaling groups for example if he if a health check report this note service instance is not healthy for a few times in a row this node this service instance must be decommissioned and we will need to have a new one and it must be automated process that's what we have in clouds the flood balancers health checks and auto scaling groups but it's also doable on your own data centers if you prefer to work with your own data centers for cassandra what does that mean if you read some data if you rewrite with quorum we read with quorum we know what data will be immediately uh consistent but we can still find out what one of the notes were not updated what do we deliver to a customer we deliver up-to-date data it's consistent but we also have to fix this not updated note it's called repair unreal that's completely automated operation i don't manually initiate repair and read it happens automatically self healing on demand repair okay of course administrators must be able to initialize on demand repair for uh datastax enterprise which is more advanced version of apache cassandra but proprietary we have notesync and for cassandra version 4 going to be released in some months we are going to have some more interesting things scheduled repairs improved incremental repairs and many others so there is a lot of work in this thing and you do want these to implement it automatically unless you don't have 5000 perfect operations and you don't because no one has the site of a great operations guys and last one continuous improvement debugging of a distributed system is indeed very very very hard if you ever did transition from monolith to microservices before you may know my pain i did it for different projects multiple times and i'm very curious my why my hair is not white by now because well debugging of a newly created distributed system is very very very hard so think ahead make logs great seriously that's by the way the second thing i hate in developers they don't write logs and then they ask me oh application doesn't work in production could you please take a look at that we have to fix that our customers aren't happy and our project manager is angry and okay i go to production i open service logs to find out what's wrong and you know what there is nothing logs are empty and how the hell now i'm supposed to debug this problem writer logs please i beg you thank you then for the distributed systems one more very important thing transient unique transaction id what does that mean the point is when you have your system of a single service single application working on a single machine you can go to this machine open the logs of this application and read through all of them you're a good guy you are writing logs so you are able to debug that and see what's going on but when you have dozens of services running in hundreds of instance numbers many of them around launch it in multiple instances and then you have like some dozens or around like 80 of servers let's say i'm speaking about absolutely real life example and here you have some problem with some customers what exactly you are going to do and which logs are you going to read they all are on different machines even if you have logs it will take ages before you will put them together trying to analyze how do they match so transient transaction id is very important thing as soon as a request comes into the system from the outer user so from end customer buying something this request has to get an unique transaction id transient transaction id and then these transaction id must be printed in every lock output of every service on every on every server running on every server with exactly the same id that will help you analyzing the logs over the system see what those those and those actually happen together whether a part of a single transaction workflow and that's just incredible how it helps uh to analyze uh logs and uh keep debugging your system moreover that's nearly impossible without trench and transaction id um one last final hint on that usually you have two kind of uh workflow initiators uh some of them are outside so that's our external users and some of them are your internal scheduled jobs for example they also must have those transactional ids uh transient ids otherwise you will be not able to debug half of your system then continuous monitoring and everyone says monitoring not so many people says continues you want you have your monitoring continues so you will be able to make predictions have you heard maybe of um ml ops that about things like that getting machine learning into the things by making predictions about how your system will behave in the future very interesting topic and you really want to work on that and to see how the situation changes with your system over time but you know what we developers engineers are always thinking about software and hardware but there is something which is much more important than any server and any kind of application let's say humanware or just people or teams and the thing is you may have best technologies in the world but if you have a bad team you cannot build a great system and you may have like not so good technologies but if you have great team you will build a great system that's about people and what about people do and you know what people aren't perfect people are doing mistakes and we aren't here to blame them please post more time and root cause analysis are never about whom to blame you know uh i was born in soviet union uh and we have like motors like every every failure every outage has a first name last name and job title let's get rid of this sheet let's stop the uh blaming environment and let's think how we can improve system and there is one more trick because well if you don't do postmortem you have to do and there is one more tip i can give you which will help if as a result of your root cause analysis you found out what it was a human mistake it means what root cause analysis is not yet done because you always have to get deeper because people will do mistakes so you always have to think how to prevent those that's a point conclusion we are almost done if we speak about those topics a lot you see we have a pretty big list replicate services distributes replicas diversify infrastructure have no single point of fail or scale out and so on and so forth and that's like a long list you know if you have uh 200 action items then mostly probably that's not the great situation for you what i prefer to think how i prefer to think him is think only about very simple thing very simple the main principle expect failure praise failure designed to fail take a look we may think to try to have the uh system available 100 time but that's not possible because failure is inevitable again that's very important to remember so what we want really to have at some point is we want to think of having our mean time to recover equals zero when we have multiple nodes um and we have multiple service instances distributed over multiple data centers even if some of them fail we will be always able to recover and for me it's not about 100 percent of time but about mean time to recover equals zero so i want to recover quickly then i always have notes to answer as apache cassandra does i will always deliver my response and that's it for today and the only one last thing i want to do with you is play a little game uh our uh great uh data stocks a company i work with generously supplied some prizes uh for a little quiz we are going to run right now and as we don't have too many people today everyone have chances to be in a price don't expect anything big don't expect houses and cars but that's definitely going to be interesting to compete and win something so to participate in our quiz please go to mandy.com and enter the code 676 sorry free free free to free or simply scan this qr code and join our nice competition so i really want to see uh some people joining again that's mendy.com six free free free to free notice that's completely anonymous you don't have to put your email address you don't have to put your credit card or whatever that's completely anonymous okay we just need you to join and scan this qr code or enter mendy.com using the code easiest way to do that is just by using your mobile phone that's really the easiest way to join the quiz and i think we have some people if you have joined us please press thumbs up so i will see what we have more people and we can start okay i want to have a couple of more persons i will give you 30 seconds we are almost done so there are last final questions don't miss a chance to win some swag we have nice t-shirts and cups and some more actually eric do you remember what do we have in the winter set right now i don't remember it was t-shirt it was um cup um but okay anyway those are great i'm sure so i'm going to start five last seconds okay okay i see some more people have joined it so let's play the game question one and i'm going to start yeah we don't have a lot of people today and seven questions to answer answer fast to get more points but you don't want to make a mistake apache cassandra is an sql database a nosql database a mysql database please watch your phones because youtube has a delay one two seconds watch your phone's way will be more on time than youtube correct answer is a nosql database and someone answered an sql database now that's no non-relational database so yes correct answer is the second one and let's move on who is going to be winner after the first question i see so it looks like it's joanna joanna congratulations 895 points but snuggles is very close with 888 points and well that's just the beginning we still have six more questions question number two and i hope you're ready and warming your hands right now so let's go answer fast to get more points we replicate services to achieve fall tolerance consistency inconsistency and the correct answer is we replicate services to achieve fault tolerance at least no one have answered we try to achieve inconsistency that's good it means i did something good today but we do not replicate services to achieve inconsistency of course to achieve consistency uh actually consistency is what we is the price we pay to have our services replicated and how does that look after the second question i see so ahmed i'm sorry ahmed that will be enough not so many attendees today congratulations it was the fastest answer and you are getting the first place with 1806 points and montana is on the second place with small difference jerry keeps the third place and it goes pretty interesting so let's go further question three and you still have to answer fast but don't make mistake cap theorem says what in distributed system consistency availability and partition tolerance all can be achieved one of three can be achieved two or three can be achieved that's an interesting one i can't wait to see your answers so time is up and the correct transfer two or three can be achieved or we need we speak usually about consistency and partition tolerance or availability and partition tolerance and we can try to keep balance as we do vivka syndrome so leaderboard who was the fastest now i see people are answering pretty quickly and their lola was fastest and that's a great result but that's yet not enough to get to the top three and top three answer top three person get for prizes so top three at this moment looks like ahmed montana and jerry so keep fighting it's not done yet question four focus sticky sessions help tomb stick a user to a service instance stick a service instance to a database stick a posted note to a user so how it goes [Laughter] okay so um in most of the uh implementations sticky sessions help to stick a user to a service instance they not to stick a service instance to a database and definitely not to stick a post-it note to a user so let me see the leaderboard that's not so many people today but the competition seems to be interesting and jerry it was a mistake oh that's interesting so we have changes there pavel montana gets to the first place and moving ahmed to the second one which is still good and jerry now holds the third place again so let me take a look what comes next because that's getting more and more interesting and that's for question five and we are getting close to the end who will be the winner ip network addressing what allows multiple clients to share single ip address called every cast anycast abysscast i very curious how many of you paid attention to these kind of things today and the correct answer is any cast every cast well it's a little bit different but any cast any cast is the thing what allows multiple clients to share a single ip address very well and there is nothing like abysscast i'm very curious who has answered that so let's let's take a look okay a lot of mistakes this time what will change game a little bit so pavel montana and ahmed binaya keeping thirst and second place accordingly and ahmed was fastest but due to mistakes vladimir of mistakes of others vladimiros gets to the third place reaching these top three list which is great so congratulations keep fighting it's not done yet but i believe we know already top two don't make a mistake that's a tough competition today question six answer fast to get more points what is the sla service level agreement service level achievement service level attempt and so quiet in the chat everyone is on the mobile phones clicking very good that's exactly what i want to have correct answer is sla is service level agreement the promise you give to your customer which kind of which response time or which uptime you are going to reach that's perfect and what's coming with a little pavel i can't believe our first place makes a mistake and lost the first place to ahmed getting to the second one and vladimiros answers correctly keeping the third one that's incredible and so we have last question so i'm nervous i have to admit i'm nervous let me drink some water i love quizzes that's always great part of a session answer fast to get more points spof is um single point of faint single point of failure stateless patch of fate that should be an easy one that stateless patch of fate of course i believe everyone gets that okay and the correct answer was single point of failure and that was the last question for today and we can take a look at the leaderboard and oh my god ahmed how could you now i'm really curious okay so pavel montana gets to the first place with 5251 points ahmed gets to the second one with 5232 if so minor difference and vladimir skips successfully keeps the third place i kindly congratulate every one of the winners so top three people please uh oh missed the button okay but anyway second place gets the same price so you have nothing to be too worried about now please um make the screenshot or i don't know photo of your mobile phone or whatever you are using now with the results and find me you can find me in two different ways first one will be alexander.volchnev at datastax.com looks correct to me or what is better find me at linkedin so it will be even better because i really want to make friends with every one of you at linkedin it's great to have friends with people who are interested in getting better in their jobs i'm very happy uh to see so um to see you all today and i believe we are out of time or at least very close to that so thank you thank you christina it's a big pleasure and thank you for thinking of me i it was a big pleasure to participate in your meet up that's that's great take screenshot at your of your mentee contact me send me a message on linkedin or via email whatever you prefer and i can't wait to see you on our channel again we stream it this meetup with help of a youtube data starts developers youtube channel and you have a button it should be somewhere right behind me like subscribe that's what you have to push today because if you stayed with me for more than an hour or actually yeah for more than an hour it meant you'll like it this session i know you like that so it's a good time to push the button thank you so much and i think we are done that's incredible and for no doubt we will see each other again [Music] so thank you christina thank you lynn and that all was a great pleasure we will meet again i found on the same page [Music] [Music] oh [Music] cool [Music] you",
