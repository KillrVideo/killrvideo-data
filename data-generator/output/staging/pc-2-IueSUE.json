    "text": "[Music] let's talk about backup details so in an overview how the backup works what it's supposed to do i gave you just enough information to show how it works but let's dig into actually how to do a backup using snapshots so there's a couple of concepts here that you need to understand if an access table is immutable what do you do with that data as it comes in so when you do a snapshot you're only going to see that point in time so the snapshots in between times need to be maintained as well when you need that data is when it's flush from the mem table to the disk that's when it creates an ss table at that point if you're not running incremental then that data is now not backed up so you have an incomplete set of your data so how do you keep up with this well there's a setting for this if you set the incremental backup to true then every time that it flushes an ss table it'll create a snapshot of that file as well this is a great way to keep up with the moving data in your system how does it work well incremental backups are stored under the backup directory in the same snapshot area so when you run a snapshot that will create the snapshot files but the incremental files are added to this to do a restore you need to combine the snapshots with the incremental files to build out a total picture the thing to remember here is the snapshots and incrementals are stored per node and they're only the data on that node and that's a really important concept to understand when you do a snapshot of your data it's not the entire cluster you're not doing an entire cluster backup you're just doing it on one node which means it's only that one token range you can get in trouble really quickly if you think you just backed up your entire database on one node because when it comes time to restore you're going to have a whole lot less data than you expected and that's not a surprise you want to go tell your boss i know i wouldn't want to do that so understand how snapshots work will first save your job and second make you a lot more sane when you're trying to restore your data the important thing you need to remember is keep that data off the node so if that node disappears that data exists somewhere else so when you restore data back into your cluster you know you're going to have to take it from some other location this is just good backup technique and learn how to do this because if you're in a situation where you need to restore data figuring out how to do it is not when you need it immediately when it's an emergency bad time when someone's breathing over your neck where's my data not the time to figure it out learn how to do it way ahead of time so one of the really neat features about cassandra is that it's always had this thing called an auto snapshot if you truncate a table it will take a snapshot of that table first here's a great idea don't ever turn that feature off ever it is such a great safety feature and i've heard this many times i've actually experienced it myself where somebody thought that they were in qa they did a truncate uh oh that was production well you can go back restore your snapshots sure it's not very exciting to have to do that that's a lot of data getting moved around but it sure beats not having your data okay now that i've sold you on running snapshots how do you actually do it this command is pretty simple if you look at the options on here this is not really that difficult you do no tool snapshot most times that'll just do the job you don't need to get fancy add the table to key space you can if you want to but most times it's just no tool snapshot walk away it's pretty instantaneous once you say you've done like a copy of that data or gotten it away from the node you could do a clear snapshot as well sometimes you build up a lot of snapshots when you do a lot of truncates for instance in a qa system or something that's used in dev testing well use the clear snapshots it will clean out the directory and make sure all those hard links are removed in a very clean fashion one of my favorite sayings you get one point for a backup 99 for a restore and why is that backing up data is easy but it's also unverified you have no idea what you've just backed up until you actually try to restore it i have personally been involved in a lot of bad days that involved oh the restore didn't work anymore for lots of reasons this is something you should be testing all the time because when you need it you need it it's not time to make excuses and it's definitely not time to find out that your data is no good so let's learn how to restore that data as well the most common way to do this delete all those directories with your data in it and then copy all the snapshots directly into it it's one of the magical things about a cassandra file system if you put ss tables in the data directories and start the system it will read them and use them it's awesome now if there's a situation where you can do that ss table loader is also a good option as well because it can take a running cluster and insert data directly into it this is also a good place if you need to change the cluster topology let's say different data centers or even different sizes let's say going from a five node cluster to a 10 node cluster ss table loader was actually built to bring snapshots into new clusters if you need to do this cluster wide op center is really your tool because when you run op center you can go in there and say i need to run a backup it knows where all the nodes are it can control them that's what it was designed to do one of the many things it was designed to do so use a tool to do this if you're relying on a person going in and typing that command you're doing it wrong because that's a good way to fail get a machine involved either set up a cron job use op center something like that and let's not forget test your restores did i mention you should test your restores you should test your restore process if you do not know how to restore data this is the first requirement even backing up your data before you know how to do that learn how a restore works because that will help you as you build your backup procedure and then be happy because you just have a way to pull yourself out of the fire someone changes a table drop something does something they shouldn't do you have a way to get out of it so let's try an exercise where you actually can do a backup and restore",
