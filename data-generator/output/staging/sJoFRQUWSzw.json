special republic day installment uh the grand finale four week boot camp i if you can all hear me and cedric do you want to say hi to uh so that you know everybody can yes so good morning good evening everybody happy to be here for this uh last week for the grand finale today we will build the to-do apps all together with javascript python and java pretty exciting uh real coding so hope you will enjoy this two-hour session so can you hear us audio is good okay all right i think we can move on uh a little bit of us um i mean i i'm first so i go first being the developer audition team at datastax uh i'm a java geek so i'm doing i created ff4g an open source framework eight years ago already doing a lot of apis of spring and i train people do sample apps anything related to cassandra this is again the database that we will talk about today with me today rags hello and again you know glad to be here um on like i said the republic day installment for those of you around the world you know we get people from all around the world right and you know india is celebrating its republic day today january 26 1950 when uh you know the constitution was formed so a special day for us for all of us and really all of us in the world uh i myself am a developer i also do write a lot of middleware code um i love distributor systems uh but most of all what i'm trying to do you know i'm on the community side uh and essentially i'm trying to simplify the inner loop and what i mean by you know the inner loop is a way to do this over and over again multiple times during the day as opposed to a more robust ci cd cycle i know that we have uh only two hours lots of stuff to cover so i kept the introduction really really sharp i'm just kidding are you surprised you know some of us are with us for uh four weeks now and you know that's all the those sessions are food packed of content today is no different uh it's not only me and rugs on screen you will see people helping you in the youtube chat so pay attention you probably will see alex stefano uh and and jack tonight in the chat yeah and and it's actually you know uh what do you do mention some of the people who are not even here you know who have helped us out like chris wilheit who is writing the python javascript and then gary harvey uh you know who's working behind the scenes uh really a whole lot of people um you know who are helping us out to you know to make this happen oh yeah thank you to them uh we should create them an avatar and put them on screen the team is getting bigger and bigger exactly exactly that's for good uh okay okay so uh what have what do we have for today so uh we will um so this session could be follow as a standalone if you just join us we will build a to-do app together but it's also a follow-up of three weeks we have done before um so the first part will be to put everybody at the same place to start doing exercise so i will go into the micro service and why other good fit for apache cassandra talk about apis mostly http api so race graphics grpc talk about the to do application famous to the application and we will build rags will build mostly this application uh in front of you in java javascript and python and of course uh then we will do a game altogether for you to win some swag okay so as i said this is week for uh week four or of a boot camp for if you complete the four weeks uh you could have a voucher to try the cassandra certification so you may ask okay what did you do in this boot camp well we do everything needed to build this to do application okay so week uh how it works uh you attend these two hour live stream with with us you saw the live stream are streamed on youtube and on twitch as uh as a fallback we are not really monitoring twitch mostly youtube we are answering your question both on youtube and discord so here you do have the link on discord it's in an interactive session totally interactive so you can stop us ask questions and we will also ask you question through this tool called mentee so pretty soon you will open a new tab go to mentee.com use a code i will give you and you will answer a few questions and play games with us after the session is complete you uh finish the labs okay we will do labs together including during the la during the life but maybe at the end sometimes we go a bit too fast just to be able to show all the content in the two hour and sometimes you need to take extra time to finish all the ends on do not worry it's all written in github github guitar git pod to do all these exercises labs and zone you have nothing to install everything is provided to you all the instruction on github uh the database will be customized service so the platform astrodb the id will be something called git pod which is vs code in the cloud with no installation um and you know you will see it will be um magic everything will be ready for you to go node maven and python pick the one you like the most then we ask you some homeworks because the idea is in these four weeks to do some learning watch some free video to get ready for the certification have the voucher take the certification and to validate your week we share with you a google form and we will go back to this form at the end where we will ask you five questions just to see if you paid attention to the session uh and a very small coding exercise uh could be done in you know how much drugs less than 10 lines of code but you know that's you know ready for you to uh reuse what you will use it is it fair to tease people about the boot camp warrior that we were talking about um you know essentially go forward uh maybe maybe you should talk about the badge and then talk about the warriors all right yeah let's let's go ahead and talk about the badges cedric yes so if you complete any of these weeks of the workshop and you know if you want to get the links for the for the weeks you can use some code in the youtube chat so exclamation mark week one exclamation mark week two week three we you also get all the recordings in this youtube channel so you can complete the previous workshop at your own pace when you complete them and submit the form validate your week you get this badge one of those badge you can share those badge on linkedin wherever you like it's open badge recognized by open badge so it's still a cool skill to have if you complete the four badges then you get the golden badge and the voucher to take the certification so yeah a lot of stuff going on and for those who were really you know paying attention in the homework and uh are really dedicated uh this is what rags what about to tell about the wires can you tell a bit more yeah yeah so essentially what we're trying to do is come up with this thing called boot camp warrior we didn't want to publicize it too much early because we really wanted to save it for some of the dedicated people who are going to get answer all the homeworks you know we haven't quite figured out how it's going to work in the end but but the idea is that you know if you're the dedicated one maybe you answered all the questions got it all right did all the homework and all that we will label you as a boot camp warrior and we haven't quite figured out what we're going to do with that but at least it gives you some bragging rights right so so pretty cool but but the whole idea is that you know no matter what your skill you know your your skill is going to be up level and and to be very honest i myself you know in just kind of going through these courses kind of going through the exercises my skill itself has uploaded so you know so definitely it's going to help everybody newcomers um you know people who have been here before people who have attended a lot of workshops the idea is that you know the badges are one thing the boot camp warrior is another thing uh but but you know hopefully you're gonna learn a lot and that's why we're also calling it as learnery you know january learn memory yeah exactly um yeah so um we talk fast but i don't want to spend too much time on housekeeping because you know it would be better if uh we dig into it as soon as possible speaking of which now is the time for you to uh try this tool to for me to ask you questions so now please open a new tab go to mentee.com and enter the code 7753 2085 so i can put it as bigger here hopefully you can see the code 77 53 20 um nt5 so in the beginning we will ask you just a question for you to get used to the tool and for us to know where are you coming from and at the end of the session stay with us because we will do a game where you need to answer fast to the question and the fastest among you will get a swag box the three fastest among you will get a swat box that we ship at your location for free okay so let's see i see that we do have 50 people with me on mentee right now i see almost 200 people on the youtube so come on we can do better probably some of you is the first time that you join this live workshop uh so i will wait for you to join so again open a new tab mentee.com use the code and i think the code has been provided a couple of times on the youtube chat for you to just copy paste and again do not hesitate to ask questions uh we do have people to help you with anything you need also later we will do the end zone with step-by-step instructions those are on the github you know it's quite detailed so you can always catch up and do it on your own pace the session is recorded you know you can come back using exactly the same link and you will have access to the recordings of the session i think okay i think he's asking um you know i can't see the mentee code just type bang or exclamation menti and you should get the code too and thanks alex for putting it in yeah also the code is on top above us very at the top uh you can see the code 7753 2085 i see vignesh asking for uh is it the same code for tomorrow so we do the same session twice uh once like now for people living in mostly latin region because it's quite late for for folks in in europe in india but you know and we do another one exactly the same 13 hours later to have most more people from apac joining and you know what the code will be different and the question will be different so no you can't reduce the same code tomorrow good point okay uh oh see i have now 120 people with us on the mentee so most of you uh join so thank you thank you uh we will have a great competition in the end with more than 100 people playing but for now okay let's see how it works i will move to the first question so um so the screen should have changed on your tab or your phone depending on where you are using mentee and then comes the first question so where are you coming from so now you should be able to point on the map where are you coming from and you see on screen it's updating in real time uh and see you know where you are drawing from four people from boston that's cool like you great scc friends as well or you know i don't know if these two just say hey everybody coming from europe europe is just a big dot and india sure so thank you for people uh coming from india it's i i know it's late for you that's great for you to stay with us so today will be two hours uh and we will try to be on time and also india you know today is the day off so thanks for taking the time to um join us exactly what do you appreciate uh okay see look at that so many people that's great everybody from australia okay okay so i've told you uh some of the folks present here did the first weeks uh just um let's see how many of you today uh was with us in in the previous session and if not it's not a big deal of course but you know it's also good to see how many of you uh did the three weeks i just got here so uh thank you very much for joining uh we are live every single week every single week uh no for two years already we are doing exactly the same format live session interactive covering a red range of topic center around cassandra but we can cover deep dive cassandra deep dive java python javascript mobile app we have an architecture we have so many topic yeah take a take some one minute to browse all the video on the channel and see how many topics we have covered in two years so about about i would say 40 of the audience are new thanks for coming again uh and don't be too concerned if you have missed the first three weeks because like what cedric said the recordings are available and and we'll go through part of that today so i don't think you'll miss too much no exactly i mean you won't get blocked because you did not follow the previous weekend at all okay so all the previous work has been done so if this is the first session great thank you welcome if you want to watch the preview session again it's in the youtube channel everything's recorded we will probably create a playlist for the boot camp i don't i think it's not done yet wait there's homework yes there is yeah that's cool okay so thank you just got there again totally fine i think it's the last question and we can jump into a few slides before ends on i mean we need to tell you something before asking you to do some exercises okay great so see a lot of newcomer uh thank you very much for your trust hope you will enjoy the experience and if you do uh consider to like the video or subscribe to the channel uh now all later oh yeah i had the last question i did not recall this one uh which language do you want to use because uh we have prepared the exercises in three languages for you today and undecided it's fine you know by the end of the workshop hopefully you would have decided uh you know which language to go with uh we will primarily be doing java for the demonstration um and for kind of the walkthrough uh that's not because you know we like java i do but but that's that's a different background yes yeah you should yeah the only problem is we don't really have a whole lot of time to cover the remaining um and and actually some of those are being worked on as we speak you know it's really it's a real hacking session right so um so we're gonna um focus on one but but you know the code is there for javascript for python and uh and you can come up with others too if you want see we talk about java java just got the majority so we're good to go i will change slide before you keep telling something that's a good point yeah yeah that's right it's almost almost like python is overtaking java now okay so uh please let this tab open we will come back to this tab at the end of the session as i told you to play a game altogether now i will move back to the slide just for everyone to be at the same uh starting point for the session okay so week one we did introduction to cassandra introducing the nosql distributed database so it's a column oriented database so it's the use case already for big data ready a lot of throughput read and write performance it scale as much as you need if you need more capacity more throughput simply add new nodes there is no master if you lose any of the node it's not a big deal the database is still working okay you don't lose any data because the data is replicated you can install your node all across the world in multiple clouds if you want and have a single data layer available across multiple technical platform or musical region it's apache eson apache community open source software uh and we won't change i mean the the license won't change anytime soon uh it's platformized agnostic and vendor independent okay so um that was the week one great database people did a little bit of create a first database a first table things that you will do as well today week two dig into the the data modeling it's totally different from rational you there is no joints no relations so you cannot reuse foreign keys or anything like that it's um it's the denormalization so user by group group by user kind of table you want to denormalize the joints in a single table okay um it's kind it's like what we used to call maybe data mart or data warehouse if you have encountered that before in the rational world no sql is okay different there is no join so data model is different and uh we end up with the data model we want to use for the to-do application so again no big deal today we gave you this data model week three was last week okay the database is created we know what it's good for we do have the data model week three was let's try to connect to the data and insert some data retrieve some data using the connector which is called the drivers in java python and javascript okay and and now we are going for the previous slide for a little bit we didn't do any of the front-end part right in the previous um so uh so what we're going to do today is kind of add that and and being able to connect these services together as well um in in today's workshop exactly yeah yeah yeah we will uh we we will explain you these step-by-step uh okay so it was week three and now week four uh so we do have the connectivity to the database but it's far from being a real application right so today is all about building these application so a rest api and having the web user interface the one that rags just talk about talking to your backend okay so you will have the real app working in your machine before the end of the session okay all right so uh let's go into uh just a little refresh reminders regarding microservice or some learnings if you have never heard about those so um if you look at this it's kind of the evolution of architectures from the early 90s up to nowadays it used to be what we call a monolithic like mainframes everything is installed on other symbol single place user interface service data all together okay big big machine in the early 2000s we split you know i like to say that uh architecture love to split things it's like having a big swirl so the monolithic in three layers data layer data bases okay but let's say in the early 2000s it was really only relational databases so oracle postgrad mysql db rational database uh audio for a second um there i think i don't know if you know it was just me but but maybe if you can repeat the last like 30 seconds okay yeah all right so okay so back to the uh some 2000 three-layer three-layer three-tier front-end web server back-end application server database data layer okay then soa som service oriented architecture it's kind of the beginning of micro services a bit different the idea is is here to split again now inside one layer you will split what you want to do is specialized and make the component scale i mean only the component that you need should scale so already in 205 to or 10 we add different user interface for the same application depending on if you were on web or uh what they call desktop client or mobile clients okay it's was not the same technology so you had to build three user interface for the same business application in the background this back end that use everything was on the single application server now you try to split the back end in multiple services tried the services to be standalone so you may have heard about soap soap xml fpc type of services or the esb which is a platform to connect all the service together uh esb is still in use nowadays you may have heard this time about spring integration apache camel talent all the solutions are here to help you integrate service a and service b and for the databases again specialization relational database is not again is not anymore the only database you have new requirements new needs more throughput more variety of data it's not only rows maybe you want to store json of course object graph so we need new database flavor no sql to come in big data and now i mean it's not now macro service is not that new the idea is again split again specialize again your uh your component to be very focused and scale only what you need and if you look now micro front end is you know quite trendy now when you build a user interface if so of course you still have multiple user interface depending on the the device you you work on but inside the app you also have some web component plug-and-play that you can move from one application to another we use in multiple application from your own company if you want to this is what they call the micro fontane services and micro services is also quite the same you again split to a very very simple and single business domain service you focus only on the business logic in your service and anything technical you try to delegate to something else so you put an api gateway to do some authentication authorizations hotline monitoring you try to delegate those in dedicated proxy and tools and focus it on your code and it's super easy to to to to develop and for the database we have even more new kind of database here i put no sql but there are so many more new sql distributed sql um that you know that yeah data warehouse data data analytics now again even new even more database flavor technology and those are segregate isolate per business domain again in something called the data mesh and you know if i would talk about the next evolution uh it would be the serverless okay so now you your service will be even smaller and just as a function will be considered as a service and those are quite new because the serverless could scale to zero so at one point of time you can have no service running because you have no need and only when requests come he will spawn a service for you and answer your request so this is uh what we call the micro service um not reinventing the wheel i will pick this definition and principle from building micro service from sam newman also the deficient from martin fowler so a micro service is really means to be deployed independently you want that stuff to scale on his own you want to add implementation implementation detail automate as much as you can make that observable you'll be able to track monitor log deploy redeploy automatically isolate failure so really single piece of software try to be as much independent as possible it's not only a technology uh stream it's also an organization stream so you need to be organized as as now product and you need to focus on the business logic inside this macro service and let the martin follow just here something here um okay keep going the slides are in the github repo so um there is no point for me to read and detail everything so this is where we are coming from here is the principle so what are the advantages and drawbacks advantages of course very small software you reduce the cost because you scale only when you need you reduce the risk that tends to be very very simple you increase the redid speed there is obviously no dependence no dependency between your service and you are autonomous to deploy those and it enables visibility because if you track your micro service properly you can see where your requests are coming from or coming to disadvantage it's not a silver bullet it's quite complex to have so many stuff running in your it a new tool to learn for the security transaction orchestration it's a cultural change and to be honest it's not less code or less complexity it's adding on top of what's existing uh but you know for any new project you should consider those if you you know if you if your team has the the majority to go there and the tooling to be able to do those but if your team is just a junior and beginning why not starting with the monolith and only then split in microservice when you need that scalability but you know again i love the micro service but it's not a silver bullet only use it if you feel that it will help you and reduce the costs okay um won't read all the box here but if you see all the again micro service patterns and principle now you can say oh where now the no apache cassandra could fit first quite obvious to me is there it's the database so you may want to save anything that you any kpi any monitoring metric that you track so it could be logging could be throttling could be your request could be your else check could be the the the response time of your apis anything that is monitoring could be there especially because those kind of data are called time series which totally fit the cast on railway to store the data but not only that okay i would like to to demonstrate that it could be more than that it's fit uh the database per service principle and i will detail that and also you can totally uh they both embrace the same vision of distributed system okay there is no distributed transaction or they are not easy to put in place uh so both microservice and cassandra make the chance of availability um you know on the contrary of consistency and uh yeah let me dig into that to explain you that more so so one of the things that is talked about when it comes to microservices is this concept of two pizza teams right so so each team has their own strengths weaknesses whatever right so i might do python whereas another team might do java uh so i think you address this a little bit but but you know in terms of databases um you know how do you how do you go about picking that you know should you use cassandra for everything or maybe it's dependent on the on the team correct okay um now a bit of demystify if some of you are intermediate to advanced level you may have heard this when you work with micro service to ensure maximum decoupling loose coupling share nothing what you need is one database for microservice because then your microservice will work with its own database and everybody will be happy look around you have you really seen that before i have not and i'm i'm there for you know 20 years now in the iit industry so you may ask why and you know my response to that is uh you will you will see that one database per micro service is really one data scope for one service and not really installing the database another time just for a microservice so first you we are in the distributed world so if you work on a single machine like a relational what you like to do is acid transaction ensuring atomicity consistency isolation and durability be able to do some rollback if something go wrong and be sure that when everything is uh saved you will commit you save it's not easy to do in distributed system it's possible there are some distributed consensus algorithm you may have heard about paxos raft but it's it's slow and not easy to do you need to ask the service a prepare commit service b prepare commit is both service a b say yes yes we are ready only then do commit so that's four round trip between you and the services and there is no real standard at the service layer to do so we used to have something in the soap services with ws transaction but you know nobody use it to be honest so in the distributed system long story short especially on the micro service distributed transactions are not really possible with rest api yeah make a pause here because now if i need to save data for my user in one microservice and then service for my holder in another services if the second fail the data in customer is is still updated validated and saved so the only way to do a rollback is to do a compensation service come back to the customer and delete what you just did there is no magic uh want to do it so to cope with those constraints in a distributed system what you want to uh embrace is the base basic availability soft state uh eventual consistency and so now you the data model is designed in a way that you can insert multiple times the same records it's not a big deal there is some id importance and event sourcing you only add the events one after the other and when you want to read the state of your system you go over all the events that have occurred and get the final state of your system and you can retry you can you would ensure eventual consistency to get your system as available as possible and so this is uh what you can do with some micro service again uh if you want to to shane or if you want to change some micro service this is called the saga pattern so you will do local transaction in service a send an event do the transaction service b and so for and so on it can be done with the choreography as soon as i'm done i'm sending an event to my neighbor boom or you could have an orchestrator somebody in charge of this workflow making sure that the workflow happen as you expect and one of those is cadence for the open source temporal for the company a distributed workflow and i like to talk about it because they are using cassandra under the hood and for the events you will use any event or streaming platform like pulsar of kafka i've seen the reference in the youtube chat in astra the platform that we will use today you do have cassandra you also have uneven streaming solution and both are for free in the free tier for you to use but today we will focus only on the database so after this slide i will ask you to go create your database in astra if you have not won and if you already have one just keep go back and authenticate again to wake your database up but just the final word on that cassandra embraced the microservice very well so first the loose coupling because the no because the data is replicated on multiple nodes and you can lose any of the node there is no real single point of failure you can lose of the node and it's still working if one of the service really really do a lot of heavy load on one node another service could use another node there is the load balancing the health check and everything is in place at cassandra level to distribute the load evenly across all these nodes now when it comes to two service should not share anything because you do not want any dependency in between the service right well first i told you in the infrastructure level the drivers will do the load balancing else chat for you and all the nodes are peer-to-peer no master so no constraint here now at the service level if you want to to embrace data isolation you can do it by key space each application will work a dedicated key space in cassandra and if you are with us for a couple of weeks now uh you know what your key space is the the best use case for that is really to have one key space per business domain per application if you want to have the business domain located in a single key space then with cassandra one table per query that's the way you should design your data model so your data is look is isolated per table and then per profile at cassandra you can also enable what we call roles-based access control and make sure that only some user can view some rows or column and so data isolation is done at three level with customer and you know with that this is how 98 of netflix uh data are stored on cassandra uh as said by the technical leader of netflix on this very uh channel uh one year ago you can find the recording in the youtube in the channel as well so one question that came up here a pretty advanced question is are we using vector clocks to ensure ordering in distributed transactions um do you want are you using what using the vector clocks so basically you know it's using clocks for a distributed transaction to be able to synchronize i guess that's that's really the question here oh vector clocks to ensuring ordering distributed integers yeah the point is uh there is no real distribution transaction exactly uh there is no lock so no distributed transaction uh the idea with cassandra is just to to do eventual and immediate consistency focusing on availability and no consistency so no luck and so no algorithm of distributed transaction except in some circumstances for some query you know sometimes you would like to lock stuff in this occasion those are called lwt lightweight transaction people following the s21 know what it is uh for those we are using paxos so no vector clocks but just uh standard paxos okay i've talked a lot uh promised it is a lot of theory uh now we will more and we dig more into enzyme with rags and even when we will come back to discuss uh about apis it will still be more practical all right let me see if i can share my screen i should be able to see my screen now um and we do you see me getting onto the astra database basically astra is uh a database as a service it's hosted in the cloud uh and and i don't really worry about you know which cloud um you know i'm gonna um yeah i'm running my cassandra as a service on it's automatically done for me and that's why we tend to call it as a serverless database so i really don't worry about any of the features that you know you normally have to worry about like scaling uh backing it up you know and things like that so all of that is done with this database as a service rax even before starting can you show everyone where are the instructions what are you doing because you are throwing it step by step so everyone do the same so yeah let's show everyone where it is perfect yeah thank you thank you for reminding me that um so essentially what you're going to do is you're going to go to the github link right and and you know navigate into week four um api services okay so so you'll see here um you know i have my github link up and running okay and then the first step here is connect your data uh asteroid eb instance okay and it talks about kind of water or what is available in the free tier at 25 credit per month you get 5 million rights 30 million reads uh you're really sufficient to run some small production workloads okay so so what you would do is you know if you if you don't know this github link you know you can just go down on your uh um on your uh you know what you're viewing the view uh youtube link uh and you should be able to get the uh astro instance uh and and just uh you know get to that and some of you already created this databases you know in key space uh so i will show um you know how you can un-hibernate that before you get started okay so for those of you creating it for the first time right just put in your email and hopefully i'll remember my password racks are you really submitting your email each time and i'm just only using google and nice yeah exactly yeah yeah i'm i'm just showing this because you know i'm i want to show this uh from scratch um yeah that's okay okay that's yeah so yeah so i'm not gonna save this so nice from you it's a nice point exactly yeah yeah and you'll see here there are four databases that i've already created for for you um you know you may have to create start with the create database if you don't have any databases running uh you can see that you know some of these are in standby you know you can see the status here um you know most of these are in standby right uh and and let me see if i can get rid of uh cedric so that you can see what exactly is going on um so you can see that it's it's in standby here um but my the one that i'm going to use workshops uh is an active because i've i've already you know using this um so so what you're gonna do is you're gonna create this um and and make sure that it goes into an active state so even if it doesn't go into active state and it's in kind of a creation phase uh i it'll be great if you can put a thumbs up to see that you're you know at almost at the point of creating the astro database instance once you have created this it you know it becomes fairly easy to you know follow the remaining steps but essentially what i do is have this in one of my tabs you know the uh instructions like for example you know if you want to know what the database name is and what the key space name is right uh you essentially you know it's it's all in the instructions i just follow the instructions sometimes i take a moment to read it because it always helps and also nice the nice thing about this is it has a walkthrough it kind of walks you through for example how do you create a token which is going to be the next step but for now i would suggest if you can create this database name and this key space name uh and give us a thumbs up that will be great all right we have a few thumbs up yeah it's already coming yep and please let us know if you can't create something for whatever reason occasionally we have had some issues at workshop but but you know what you could do is you could try a different region if it doesn't work but but usually you know most people are able to create okay that's fantastic we have a lot of thumbs up i think that's the point wake up the database of standby um i i think we're good to go right um what do you think i think i mean i i think we are um it will take a few minutes for your database to be active it will be spending for a few minutes because you know you still you need to start a three node machine and even in standby we need to wake three instance so during the time you are waiting i can come back to show you a few uh slides again about regarding apis yeah give me a second before i um oh tell me do you want to create the token right now no no no uh i'm just going to switch to your screen okay all right you're good okay all right okay so hey the database is uh starting the rocket is launched so next is uh api so i love this topic but i will try to stay focused uh to give enough time for everyone to really do the and enjoy the homework no rushing so http apis uh you may have heard about rest apis so let's see what it look like the rest really embrace the http standard so using the verb get to retrieve post to to to update post patch to update put to create delete to delete and uh you know patch to to update as as i stated also you can see that the endpoints are what we call resources with some conventions of slash api to have all the api accessing in the same url v1 it's a major version always good to have that in the url to be able to do two measure versions side by side then to do is yeah we will work with to-do that's the business domain if you want and then exactly the to-do you would like to access that's the task id or to-do id so this is a very simple create a create read update delete kind of a very small rest api done and exposed using rest meaning representation state transfer yeah i think i think you know you can't over emphasize um you know rest uh it's it's completely revolutionized how we do programming right um you know i'm wearing i don't know if you can see it but basically this is the w3c um you know shirt but essentially what rest did is make it as easy for programs to interact with each other as it made users to use the web right you know with http remember that right um and and you know one of these conferences i met tim berners-lee and essentially west has really revolutionized the way in which you can do programming because programs can talk to each other and be able to do the create read update delete i can't over emphasize that rest for you know a lot of years you know the transition from soap to rest happened you know about 10 years ago and it was only rest from 210 to 215 more or less and in 216 we do have two challengers so the first challenger is grpc meaning google remote procedure call the idea was it's not easy to it's not fast enough i would like to do some operation fpc so remote procedure call so instead of accessing a resource i would like to invoke a function do an operation this is what rpc means invoking executing something um on you know through a web service using very very optimized payload to be as fast as possible and have the payload as small as possible and the payload is using something called protobuf which is a binary serialized format to be as fast as possible and it's gaining some traction because it's uh as i said super fast and the the very um very small payload so everyone could reduce the cost sometimes by just using grpc but it's mostly used for service to service communication and not that much exposing to the public yet i think last i would like to introduce is graphql so again created in 216 this time by facebook it's like all the innovation coming from the fam lately i mean the nosql databases and now the rest api is no different so there you will describe your data it's strongly typed so here i put an entity called workshop then you will expose some operation treatment function available for this object like update delete create and it will be part of a schema and the schema is exposed to you and navigating your the the schema you you can see what is what is available and with the tool here called a graphql playground you can totally see what's what's in there okay looking at the time i will skip the demo um but you know trust me on this super easy to use the main use case for that is when i execute a request i can exactly ask what i need so here if i want to list all the incoming workshop and i do not want to retrieve all the fields in my request i can simply provide exactly what i need and i get what i need so pretty useful to expose services that will be consumed by multiple people exposing as well the schema the contract and also reducing the payload is not necessary it's not optimized binary uh binary with binary format it's optimized because on the wire you only you only send what has been asked by the by the client so instead of providing a huge dependency uh tree and see when to use what i like to give some tips and rule of thumb the rest is great for decoupling so schema and read for anything api lifecycle for the versioning i told you majon version in the url all the tooling like api management really work well with rest not that great with the other technologies so far but it's not a silver bullet like for anything in the world it could be verbose with json and xml fat payloads there is no way to know in advance what are the function available on the rest api or there is something called open api swagger that can show you some interface but that's not part of rest itself it's built on top of rest so it's suitable to to exchange with the data but not doing some common line function for the crud create update release create with that they delete this is still what we want to use and this is what we will use today for the application okay so quickly for the two others grpc is mainly used for high performance communication service to service communication you can do streaming sync async the interrupt interoperability is great because you will expose your interface using a file called proto and you can give this proto file to java python see dozens and dozens of languages and they do have some script to generate clients based on this proto so if you want to expose an interface that will be consumed by a lot of technology it's a good one it's a good way to do it but it's strongly compelled okay as i told you you need to give the proto so you really need everyone to be aware of the type strongly coupled no discoverability it's all done on the proto uh so i've give you already the the sweet spot for grpc last but not least graphql is mostly used in javascript and front-end world to bns right now uh so as i told you which is great discoverability custom payload it's still on top at http like the two others well it's not civil bullet single single endpoints so pretty hard to track what you are doing which function are you really using because you always invoke the same endpoint it could be great for the user because you in you ask exactly what you need and only when you need but sometimes without nursesing you ask for an object with multiple nested level in your object and under the hood at the database level you need to do a lot of joints that could take forever so actually it's now it's reused in gs project at what i call back-end for front-end remember my slide on the micro service a front end will create some kind of dedicated backend just for them specialized function only for some screen only to have the field needed for the screen so that's match the graphql specification or because it's the interface for the for the front end to communicate with the backend you can aggregate multiple data source aggregate and compose so if in at the screen level you want to request one with one request get everything you need for the screen graphql could be great to to compose and aggregate and filter only what you need okay um in the astra platform what you just created you have all this interface available so grpc rest and graphql are available for you but that's not the purpose of today so i put this slide just for you to know it's there what we want to do today is coding coding our own rest api so we won't use that so what we will do is code the to-do application okay we get there so soon we will move to the end zone so now you see what's new in this slide the rest api right in the middle so let's create a rest api in java python and javascript all together how would you do that so for the user interface uh rax told you it is not the purpose of today we won't code the front end here and the reason is it's it has been done dozens and dozens of times if you go to todomvc.com there you will see the to-do the same to do user interface implemented in dozens and thousands on framework i mean if you want to create a new javascript framework and want to be famous of course you go there and publish your own version of the to-do application with your own new framework yeah that's quite amazing how many you can find there so we will reuse one of those the purpose is really to build the backend the rest api with us today and for the back and look at that if there is a website called to do backend.com and you know us backendfolk said there is no reason why everyone used to do mvc to know how to use the new javascript framework let's do the same for anything backend and there you will see again dozens or dozens of implementation of the same rest api validating the same specification in multiple languages and so this is what we have done we have used the specification there and we have built the free language with on top of astra so this is what the api look like okay and in the to-do back-end website the to-do back-end.com will provide you already a client to use and the spec runner to see if your um api validated this specification or not so part of the homework will be to execute both and i think with that uh rock that will be on you and you will have plenty of time to go through the code and explain how it works perfect okay again let me make sure that you are off and i am on yes um and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna get rid of your head for now if you don't mind um yeah yeah you can voice over yeah exactly yeah no ways and i will move myself a little bit down so that you know you can see what's going on all right so this is my um um get part and and you will get to that in a second but let's take this step by step right so so we generated the astra i mean we um created the database the next part we're going to do is we create going to create the astra token okay so to create an astro token pretty straightforward you know again this walks the instructions walk you through again remember you know go back to github and and look for week four uh api um microservices and some of you already done this before uh so if you have done this uh you know no problem this this token is gonna be still valid um but but for those of you who who are kind of doing this new uh you know this this kind of walks you through how to do this uh and i'll walk you through this as well um in a second oh still logged in yes please okay so what you're going to do is you know you after you've created the database right let's assume that this is an active state um if it's not an active state just click on it and it should it should come up um okay and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna go into your organization okay and then um for organization settings and you can do token management okay and and just pick a database do we recommend the database administrator right uh again it's in the instructions you know you can always fall back on the instructions and and pick the right right one okay database instruct administrator let's say and generate the token you know i'm not going to do that because i've done that before but if you generate the token um okay you'll see that you will actually let me do that anyway okay so you'll see that this token has been generated again what i recommend or what we recommend is download this token details okay so if you download this token details um you can you can put it in wherever right and and usually it opens up in excel or something like that uh so you can open that up and and keep it um ready ready to be copied because some of these copies you'll need later okay so my suggestion would be let's go ahead and generate the tokens did i miss anything here um and and once you're done with the token uh give me a thumbs up or give us a thumbs up okay we are not gonna use i don't think we're gonna use the api token today but but you know the client id in the client secret is something i mean if you want to use some other tool to copy and paste that's fine but but one warning is that if you navigate away from this page like right now it's here right you know if i go back then i've lost this okay so there's no way of getting back to this you'll have to generate a new token which is fine uh but but just just be cognizant of that you will need these two values the client id and the client secret uh again the suggestion is you know put it in a spreadsheet or keep it somewhere handy and we are seeing a thumbs up coming in coming through we see lees again maria perfect sir david in consolidation bay looking good all right exactly all right so should i proceed then yeah so this is a new concept right you know what we do is we concept we conceptualize this before we start building you know uh we have we have a um a a phrase within data stacks which is called as thoughtful execution so you don't just don't go in code uh you kind of you know do the wireframes kind of figure out how the workflow is this is a very simple to use uh app but it still helps uh to kind of visualize how this looks okay i um so there are a number of applications that are already provided you know what you can do is you can just click on them okay and and here's one that i just clicked on okay let me first go to mvc.com right and like what citric was saying um you know there are a number of different frameworks some you may never heard of right uh like polymer knockout.js uh kanjas some of the oils probably know like kotlin plus react claw closure dojo backbone and so on uh but but the point is we you know quite a few of them right and and again you know since you're talking about microservices uh you might think that you know uh dual is the one that you want to use for your team right you know so so it really depends uh on on your team on what kind of uh solution you're trying to solve right so now let's go actually look at you know one of these to-do's right and and that's the one that i clicked on and and what you should see is you know these uh uh different to-do's right you know to do this 42-41 and 42. uh these are the unique ids and basically they're all blah blah blah right not a whole lot uh but but at least it kind of gives you an idea of of what it's supposed to do okay uh be patient uh if you click on some of these uh because an empty json output means that you know it's just starting up uh so it might take a little bit of time one of the cool things from a programming perspective is to be able to understand how the api works right and and you know the specs the swagger specs are also available and and again you know most of these are already provided to you so if you want to run this um it kind of walks through those endpoints consolidates those endpoints and provides you uh you know with what is available right so a lot of these are already available and and what we're going to do is we're going to make uh use of this but we're going to hook it up to our application that we are going to build okay so that way we can leverage um you know what's already provided so again think of these as micro services right and and you're really hooking them up together to make your application up and running okay so click on any of those it should all work fine and you know finally i'll get to my web client okay so this is my web client and this is kind of how it looks let me do the spring boot one no particular reason okay so i am looking in a very simple interface spring boot okay and and hit return okay and then when you're done with it you can just click on this and it's going to knock you know it's going to strike it off and you can remove it if you want by just clicking on this very simple interface and and you know you can try any one of those it doesn't really matter okay uh they all have this you know kind of the similar interface okay so let's do micronaut for the heck of it right so this is uh m-i-c-r-o-n-a-u-t right i just want to be sure i don't want to waste too much time here right and say same thing yes and i'm gonna finish this up i can finish this up i'm gonna get rid of this get rid of this and i'm good to go right so if you if you go back to micronaut hopefully that that is still there oh it didn't delete it uh but i can we can figure that out right uh what happened then exactly that's probably what happened somebody else got in there and you know because we are doing the same app but don't worry what we'll do is we'll create an app per user so that you know you your you know data is not going to be messed up if uh by me and so on so it's going to be per user multi-tenant however you want to call it okay now comes the cool part right we all love this right good part i know that if you have attended our workshops you know we we do everything in get part um let me show the git part to you before i bring it up it kind of looks like this okay and essentially what it is is it's visual studio code uh in the cloud okay so you can add extensions to visual studio cloud in fact i have installed a data stacks astra you know you can you can kind of look around it's still being built um but the point is it's it you know it's an editor in the cloud you don't have to install anything and and you can be up and running okay so i get a little carried away by git part but how do i get to it just click on it okay so you can you can either do this open link in new window open link in new tab open link in new private window whatever you want to do it will ask you for the github credentials so you have to provide your github credentials and once you put in your github credentials you will be brought into something like this uh it might be doing the initial setup but let the initial setup happen and you know while it's happening can you please give us a thumbs up i see that already david bachter has already done a thumbs up so yeah yeah that is true so what you can do is you can fork it and and you can check back which is which is very cool okay um uh what this does is it opens up and let me show you what happens when when you open it up after you put in your github credentials and all that uh you're dropped into something that looks like this okay and if i do a git remote minus v in what we call as the terminal window okay you'll see that what i'm doing here is i'm forking full stack apps with cassandra.get which is really what you know um the repos repo we're working on so a lot of thumbs up that's that's pretty cool um so now what i'm gonna do is some critical things okay and and believe me this is the toughest part of the workshop and and really probably the boot camp itself right so we have had some issues with before so just bring up you know i'm bringing up my explorer no that's not a good sign when my explorer is not looking all right let's not worry about that yeah it's not good yeah but but that's fine uh let's let's proceed so i'm gonna go um take my uh [Music] sorry and bring up my finder window actually let me do this let me take it off full screen okay bring up my finder window again okay and and look for oh uh one of the things that i did not show you was uh how to download the security bundle okay so go back to the astro dashboard okay if you just click on the astro link you'll go back to the dashboard okay go to workshops again you'll see a dot dot dot sign here right or connect you can just click on connect okay and you'll be dropped into something like this and all the instructions are there as well you can pick any of the connect java driver right um and essentially just let's say python right and you'll come to the screen called download bundle okay so click on the download bundle and click on the secure connect bundle okay so if you click on the secure connect bundle you will you will see that it can it will you will be able to download the secureconnect workshops.zip which is roughly about 12.0 k okay so about 12k uh i'm not going to download it here because i've already downloaded it but but you can go ahead and you know basically save it to whatever directory you want uh and then from that directory we will bring it into git power okay and believe me this is one of the toughest steps okay if you if you can really um visualize that right so so let's go back to get part okay and i'll show you how to drag and drop this okay so let me see if i can go back to my downloads directory okay and let me see where is my security workshops uh i can find it right now but but i know it's somewhere in there okay um maybe what i can do is i can just let's let me show you with you you want to take the bundle that zip file right and essentially what you want to do is you want to drop it into this directory okay so make sure you're dropping it into the home directory because we have had some issues before where it was dropped in another directory um and and you know it it kind of created some issues there okay all right uh unfortunately like the explorer is uh having some issues so let's not worry about that for now all right so i can i can work around that um so once you have downloaded this security uh secure connect bundle okay uh which is the security workshop.zip if you do a ls minus l okay and uh i believe it's in the previous directory um if you just do ls minus l started at zip you should be able to see something like this okay so so secureconnectworkshops.zip which is roughly about 12k should be in your home directory okay so so if you look at this current directory workspace boot camp and again all these instructions are in there so once you launch the kit part your git part you know it talks about what are all the different windows on the left side is the explorer window that you can not see right now but two is the editor window where you can edit files and three is the terminal window where we'll be showing a lot of commands you know and you'll see that in a second okay um what you can do is you can familiarize yourself by just clicking on this plus sign in the terminal window and you'll get a diff uh you know multiple shells uh and and all of this walks through we usually get a question of can we have dark mode with uh git pod and you can you can definitely do that the next part remember is the client id and the client secret right uh that you got from um you know from uh essentially generating the token and hopefully you've stored it somewhere in a um you know in a spreadsheet or something like that or in some place where you can copy it right but but at the moment if you can give us a thumbs up once you have downloaded the zip file and you have uh let's see you're able to get to this point right if you if you just do this ls minus l you can go back and do this in your terminal window okay you should be able to see this is 12 k like i said before and this is the shells that are available there are a number of shells and one of the cool things that we have added today is what is referred to the sequel shell um you know this this won't be available to you right away we still have to go through one step but for me i've already gone through the step and what it does with the sql shell is essentially be able to connect you know to your database okay hmm not a good sign that that's not coming up either all right let me try this z shell and see if that's working or did i create something else okay so maybe i need to bring this up again so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to bring up the workspace again let me see if i um all right so let's reload this okay and let's see what happens let's see if i can bring up sql shell okay much better all right so now you can see i can do sql commands so like for example uh to do slash two dot to do items okay um so the table is not there which let's not worry about that oh it just i did not type it correctly it was like oh i deleted it uh and you'll see some entries here we'll walk through this but at the moment if you have you know if you're able to um see my explorer window is also working now essentially once you get the zip file in give us a thumbs up and we're good to go should i should i proceed because we really don't have too much time right cedric give it give it a couple of minutes exactly yeah this is cool uh so what you're gonna do is you're gonna go to week four once you have done the um the zip file okay and then here this is what know cedric was talking about you you have to update this plug astra credits or you're not going to update that but you're going to run it but to update that you have to create a a sample file okay or actually copy a sample file um and let me show that all of these are again in the instructions okay so so you're going to replace this username with the client id and the password with the client secret and everything happens automatically for you which is really cool okay so let's assume you connect you have downloaded the zip file okay i went into week four i copied the env.sampleto.env right i replaced the username and password and then don't be fearful fearlessly execute this dot plug astra credits okay and it'll tell you you know if it doesn't have the security connect bundle and things like that in the proper place um so let me know when you have been uh you're able to um basically run this right the plug astro credit creds and if you go to sql shell right you should be able to see you know i'm going to bring this up again yeah great and great question and and if you look at plug astra creds you know i have to get rid of some of these you can you can see here um you know what it's doing you know it's changing the environment variables and so on so um let me get rid of this let me close all all right um let me bring this up again actually let me do this here which is which is the nice thing about the editor here is right i can do it here or i can do my favorite vi plug astro credits okay and you can see that what it does is it looks for the env file uh then looks for astra username and all that you know so so nothing no blackmagic here um essentially what it does is it uses those environment variables and then plugs it into the right places okay all right so let's see so we are at this point the sql shell file okay so make sure you have this and and let's describe the key spaces okay so let me go back to my git pod okay now make sure this is the sequel show and this is the best shell so some of them will do in the bash and some of them will do in the sql shell right it should be obvious just by looking at it okay so if i do i describe key spaces here right you should be able to see you know what's what's going on there right let me again put this focus back on full screen okay you'll see uh if i do a describe key spaces what else um use to-do list okay or today's today right um and then you know describe tables programs okay so it will show you the to-do items okay and then you can do select star from to-do items you don't have to qualify it with the key space okay and you're good all right okay so let's see how people are doing um able to download anybody having trouble with uh running it okay so let me let me go back to that step again that's cool right right so yeah if it's still the zh prompt then it means that uh you know we haven't plugged in the credentials okay so to plug in the credentials there are a couple of steps that you need to do first you have to download the zip file locally i mean there are other ways of doing this but we'll not get into that today uh i showed you how you can download it by clicking on any language right first connect then java then download bundle then secure connect bundle and download it locally once you have downloaded it locally all that you're going to do is you're going to copy it you know to the uh home directory okay and the very critical step is to verify that it's in the right directory by by running this command ls minus l uh and and making sure it's in the right path okay and also make make sure that it's roughly about 12k okay then what you do is go into week four api micro services because you're in week four right copy the env.sample to env and replace the astra username and the password from what you downloaded into your spreadsheet right so so you got it into your spreadsheet or if you have the tab running you know like uh let me see if it's still up uh now see i want it away from the tab and it's gone right so i can't i can't get back to it i have to create a new database i mean i have to create a new token okay so let me get back to the git part let me get back to the instructions so where was i i was plugging in the username and the password and then fearlessly run this plug gastrocrets okay just make sure double check once that you've got the username right and the password right because sometimes what might happen is you may not you know you may not um you may miss the first character or the last character or something like that and that will uh that's not gonna help you right so okay yeah i can i can show that actually here you know that might be easier right um so here's my sample file export astro username is equal to export astro password is equal to that's all you really need okay or you can put it on the command line too but but you know this is the easiest way to do this okay yeah very cool yeah yeah but but like what powell said he copied the token as a client secret so you know sometimes it happens you know uh but but if if something like that happens just you know start from scratch again worst case uh you know you can create a new uh workspace you know git pod allows you like 50 workspaces i i've gotten into situations where i have to create a new uh workspace which is fine right um so i know we have about half an hour um should i wait for a little bit for people um perfect okay your screen is up and running and let me put your head also you know i will try again yes all right you're back in the moon okay so let's do this um it will be quite quick okay again i would like you to have time to spend in the code so our backend is composed of three layers uh even if it's a macro service inside the microservice you want to uh well design what should be used for exposition for the api what should be used for the persistence what we call the repository and what is in the middle so a service a service is kind of the app totally independent of the technology used so that way you can expose your service in multiple ways using multiple frameworks and same for the repository you can have multiple implementation multiple database for the repository i like to have this nice interface kind of abstraction in in the middle so for the repository and so you know the service look like that for us how to list the task create a new task market assess complete or delete the task nothing new here so um this is the data model we came up with two weeks ago and if you pay attention the user id is our partition key and the reason is you never you you never want to do select star from a table in cassandra it will do a full scan cluster will take some you want to always provide the partition key in your work clothes so what you this what we decided is uh our to-do app will have one to-do app per user and there i will be able always to provide the user id in my workflows only work on the single transaction and i will have a super super fast to-do app so this user id should be uh should be sent as the ma of the parameter somewhere somewhat right so let's see the design what have we done to transform this data model as a rest api so the partition keys i said is user id that's the first two rows in these in this slide the service we will do the service each time providing the user so what you will see on screen is the to do for one user so find the to-do's for a user create a do-do for user each time we provide the user you got the id okay so the rest api should also provide the user id and this is how we implement it in the api path we provide something called a pass param here we call user id and then you will see in the end if you go slash api slash v1 slash john slash to do you will see the list of john i mean the task we created all together a couple weeks ago if you pick mary you will see the task of mary if you pick somebody that does not exist in the table the to-do will be empty but as soon as you create something you will create tasks for this new guy okay so that's the rationale the api would be just a little bit different from the screenshot we have shown you in before and the reason is we are working with cassandra we need to work on the dedicated partition the partition key is user id let's provide user id in the url so uh rugs will show you the java path so java has been built with a framework called spring boot for the runtime the java driver to connect to cassandra the spring data framework to have the what we call object mapping layer from data in the database up to java object so it's done with spring data and the exposition as a rest api are done with spring mvc you know that's really just a sample in this various channel we have done we have done some some courses with quarkus we have done stuff with jersey rest easy i have completed a sample with micro note last week so it's just a sample okay spring boot and for the other two languages that's also just a sample for the javascript we picked express and node.js to expose the api so the file will be called api.gs just expose to expose the data and to do's dot gs to have the data logic uh we could have used something else we could have picked the netlife function as we did before on the channel or next gs also great to explore some apis and for the python again we make the choice to use flask so you will see api.pi to see the flask api exposed and todos.pi to get the python code and again we could have used jungle fast api so that's the three most famous in the python world in the github organization you will you will feel you will find some samples using jungle i think we don't have some face api yet but again that's sample ready to go and working and that's the name of the file again the slides are in the github repo you can download everything is given to you for free and i think it was now you have 20 million rights to do the five exercises before we came back to play the game perfect yeah um i think one question that you may want to answer cedric uh mark smith brought this up a little bit earlier and i think you glossed over this a little bit because of lack of time right but i think it's very critical to talk about the object relational map right so essentially what spring data is doing here is taking your data um and converting it into an object you know so sql data and converting it to an object so to say okay i'm oversimplifying this but but i think mark's question was uh do all the different languages kind of support these different data types uh do you want to talk a little bit about the orm layer and a little bit about you know what are the data types and and then i'll i'll show that working in action as well i'm yeah i talked a little bit about spring data uh so the data are stored as table in cassandra and with your object-related programming language you want to work as object so you need some mapping layer so object mapping so converting data to object it's not called orm where m is for object relational mapping here there is no relation and for each language to be an s there are multiple solutions so the driver themselves provide an object mapping layer okay spring data provide one you can if you use micro node micro node will have its own object mapping layer and what rags will show you really is to say hey my table is called to do item have three columns i will create an object called to do it them same attributes use a little bit of magic annotation and then i don't even need to code any cql the the java code will do that for me perfect thank you um all right so i'm gonna again get rid of your head if you don't mind i like saying that get rid of your head um so all right and i will move myself to a fairly obscure corner okay let me see oops i mean to do that okay all right so let me move this just give me a second i'm having trouble here picking the right one okay that's good all right so let's move on um so i go back here since we're all working i will make sure that i have the latest in my github repository thankfully i'm up to date so everything is up to date right so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go back to my instructions again right i already looked at the sql shell now i have to pick time comes for me to pick a language right so i can pick either java javascript or python java node.js python right um we'll just go with java because you know that's uh really um the one thing that you know is more involved than javascript and python i think there was a joke earlier that you know java is so much more verbose but sometimes it's also much easier to understand as well um so so with that said again just follow the instructions there it will take you to the java page make sure you have the right logo right um you know if you want java if you want python then you know if you go back and click here uh or let's say javascript right and open link in new window you know i just bring it up and you will see here that's in javascript right and it's has the node logo so so we try to make the instructions as specific as possible right um and but it follows the same line of what uh you know cedric was saying right essentially what you're going to do is you're going to create the application you're going to test the connection to the database and then what you're going to do is you're going to create an application that provides the crud api which is basically the create read update and delete right and we'll take a look at that once the api is available what we're going to do is we remember the the mvc front end that we saw before we're going to take the mvc front end and plug it into this api so that all these apis are available and bingo everything works right and that's the whole idea of connecting the services but let me not jump ahead let's take a look at what we need to do first okay in all of these we recommend that you take a look at you know the java file okay so so let's start with with that um you know initially okay all that you need to do again is copy paste and put it in the terminal window okay one of the things that you want to sometimes what happens is i i i'm not sure that you know i put my focus on the terminal window and i start typing and i have no idea where it's going right but notice here you know i'm typing it in the wrong window right um so all that you need to do is you know use some of the undo commands like you know uh z right in um on my mac okay so just just remember that and sometimes i've done this too you know i put in sql shell and and i say something like this right and you know it will keep going like this right you know just hit a colon and you'll get back uh to where you are okay so semicolon rather okay so go back to bash okay and i'm going to open this file so you can see here it has this application properties right where i've said the username the password the key space name the bundle and all that i don't need to worry about any of that and all that i'm going to do is i'm going to create a sql session and basically what it does is it basically says connection established to astra with this particular key space right so it's getting the key space and i am good to go right so how do i run this again go back to the instructions right i do the maven test the first time around it might take a long time okay if you want what you can do is you can do a maven clean compile um you know uh it's it's not required because you know you're probably in a new workspace but just in case you have attended your our previous workshops and and you know you don't want to uh get into a scenario uh so what you can do is you can just do a maven clean compile but other than uh i'm not gonna go through that step i'm just gonna paste right maven test and i'm gonna try the test connection uh that's not a good sign um not sure what's oh i'm in the wrong directory see this is what happens so yeah it happens you know so so i go into java right so the appropriate directory and then what you do is you issue the command okay and now things are gonna it's gonna connect to the database right and hopefully it's going to find the key space right the appropriate key space so you can see here it connection established to astra with key space to do's because that's really what we specified um in the key space name okay and you can take a look at application or properties uh which essentially does you know just does that okay so that's test one okay um in the interest of simplicity i'm just gonna run test two okay and what this is gonna do is it's gonna drop the table so why don't i do it manually so let me go ahead and drop not froth drop table to this what am i missing here oh it's the other way around right okay so now i've dropped the table two items okay and and you may get a timeout here um you know working through what the issues are uh but but just make sure that you know it did have a timeout but let's not worry about that right now so it says clearly that this table does not exist so it means it's dropped you can do that a few times just to make sure that you know it's it's all gone right and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to my bash shell okay and instead of running test 0 1 i'm going to run test 0 right maybe i got it wrong let me go back and get this right so sometimes it's easier just to follow the instructions right oh that's the create schema that's that's the reason okay so so i will create schema and i'll run this so what this is going to do is it's going to create the table and and plug in the appropriate schema okay you will see what what happens at this in this particular case okay so let me go back to my sql shell okay and let me show this in action okay so i don't want to drop it because i already did right so just let me do a select not a good idea to do select star but since we have only a few items i think it's okay right at least initially right so you can see here it it basically has the schema that cedric was mentioning before right the user id the item id what's completed and one of the cool things is it's in color right you know because we set it up for color um so so it's you can you can see this and once you start uh plugging in values okay and that's the next thing we're going to do which is insert one test right so what we can do before that is just describe the key space studios okay so i'm going to go ahead and describe that and you'll see here you know again you will see this in a little bit more like a um code format right where it has the user ids text item id is time u uid um whether it's completed or not true or false right offset and so on so forth okay that makes sense so with that uh what i'll do is uh go back to my bash shell okay and essentially look through this once so that i kind of get an idea of what we were talking about before right so um if you want to take a look at this gp open right but but it kind of does the same thing so i'm not going to actually let's take a look at this because what i'm going to do is i'm going to create one for myself as well right so let me do this okay there is john right and i'm going to create new one okay which is i already have it here but rags and fish already okay and i will basically you know make sure that i'm getting this right so i'm good to go let's see if this works okay so the nice thing is it does it also does the auto save okay um oh actually i did not even insert it right so so let me go ahead and insert myself first right so so how do i insert pretty straightforward you know there is the save task okay so i'm going to go back and run it let's see if it works okay it's going to take a little bit of time and you're good to go right so if i go back and look at two items right um so let's start from two items you can see here rags and finished already okay just for the heck of it because we're gonna be using john i'll make sure that john is not gonna um i'll make sure john is also happy okay john and uh let's say something else i don't know what to say but that's fine john is john okay and because this assets i want to make sure that i'm doing the right thing here okay so go back to and do add one more entry right and this is pretty much the same thing you would do in javascript and python you would you would add an entry okay so let me see how i'm doing with respect to time every eight minutes so it should be pretty fast from here okay i think i got the task wrong because i added the rags again i did the comment you know so it's not a good idea to okay so let me go back here and this is the nice thing about doing programming is because it catches those errors right away right right so now i'm going to do the save again and this time it should work hopefully it's going to be a success okay go back to my sql shell you by now you know the drill right you know you you create an entry do something and come back and take a look okay so there are those uh three things that i created okay uh so now i'm gonna go a little uh fast okay validate this we did that uh now test the end point right to be able to do that you know you you can run this test controller okay so i'm going to go back run the test controller right and really what what it's going to do is not a whole lot okay but what you can do is you can you can look at uh you know essentially you you made sure that the controller is up and running now the next step is the critical step which is running the application itself right so i'm going to run the application keep the application running so keep this tab going okay this this tab will change to java as you can see here right so now this application is up and running and if you get something like this perfectly fine you know because what happens is and again this is explained in the instructions as well you know if you see something like the white label error page basically what it's saying is you know there are no resources listening at root but pretty soon what we're going to do is we're going to set up the endpoints properly you know remember he you know cedric talked about slash specs slash client and so on and that's exactly what we're going to do okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to do go to the next step which is g gp preview okay and since we can't do it here we're going to run it into another we're going to open up another bash and here it doesn't matter if you're in the right home directory or not because all that we are doing is gp right and what this does is it basically resolves this url and then adds the endpoint slash api slash v1 slash john studios okay and just for the heck of it since i only care about myself i will try rags okay and hopefully you will see something like this okay so if you see an error what you can do is you can you can just say you know click on this and it will open up in the browser okay or what you can do is you can take this url okay and you can add it here and check for the same thing here in this this is a much better interface where it shows you uh you know in json and other formats as well so if you want to just do john you can do that as well you know just by clicking on this and you'll see johnny john right so so so pretty cool right so what what this did is you know i essentially went to that in uh to that particular application that's running um went to the endpoint api slash v1 slash john slash todos and got me the data from there okay all right we are making good progress here all right so we are almost there to look at the specs now you know the next point is we're going to take a look at the specs and to do that how are we going to do that you know we we kind of do the same thing so essentially we use the to do backend.com right and use the specs and then point it you know to our application okay so let's go ahead and do that okay and you should see something like this and and if you see a lot of red here uh it's perfectly fine because you know it's not perfectly fine but it's okay because you know it's a limitation of the git part preview and again this is also included in the instructions so don't worry about it so let me instead paste it here okay and let's see what happens here there okay all the specs are coming through right this is the cool part right and if i do a a client in here which is what the next instructions are going to show okay you should you should get the application itself up and running okay which is kind of the nice part right and if i use the right url rags to use right this is my application finish already finish already remember that right and i am almost ready to finish okay now if i go back to my git part right go back to sql shell you know the drill right what you're going to do is we're going to take a look at everything i i could just say where user is rags right you know that's probably a better way of doing this query [Music] okay but let's take a look at everything right so there you see rags finish already rags and i am almost ready to finish right so what i could go back here is click on this right which basically means it's completed and let's go back and check to make sure you know i'm keeping my fingers crossed and see if it works right so this is all happening instantaneously and you can see here this completed as true right so you know earlier it was false now i went and you know got true so that's the complete application um i took a little bit of shortcuts because you know you can this explains it a lot more um you know in detail but essentially yeah you know what we did was we used the back ends one thing i should probably talk about is a dig a little bit into the code right what do you think do we have some time or quickly okay so here's my to-do and and essentially like what um uh cedric was talking um you know this is the to-do right uh which which essentially takes the um you know sets up the different endpoints you know gets the uid get the title gets these completed and all that this is automatically done for me by using spring data okay um you can get the different to-do items um and you know um basically here um you know it gets me the user id item id and so on uh and then you know those are the things that are absolutely required right uh and then um you know you can put in um you know default values for this so what you can do is you can you can take a look at this the one thing that i wanted to talk to you about was the to do rest controller and this is where you know kind of the api mapping comes in right you know this is the endpoint that we were talking about right api v1 slash rag slash to do so slash test slash studios r slash uh whatever the name is right uh john studios right and you have the mapping here um this is to get the user id i mean to get the particular to-do item and then you have you know mappings for create read use update and delete okay so all of them are in there uh take a moment to kind of walk through this uh this is the map as studio entity that you know again cedric mentioned this where you can do the mapping from the object layer to you know not quite the relational layer but but you know the database layer if you want to think about it that way and and and you know that's kind of what we are doing here as well so that's like a very brief walkthrough of the code i know that there are some more things to do [Music] yeah and you know i know that one of the criticisms that we get is that we don't walk through the code much but but all of this is available for you guys um you know to to try at your own pace with that said um cedric anything else to for me to do or should i transfer control to you let me see if let me see if i can bring in the quiz music also okay which is please let me know if this is too loud you know i'll try to keep it low uh but sometimes i've had issues with that or if it's too low also let me know okay please let let me know if you are hearing music and it's all yours see rick i'm going to get rid of myself as well for now oh hold on somebody's saying that they cannot hear you um can you keep talking okay it looks like it looks like you're on oh neither music nor neither music nor cedric yeah just give me a second it's my my problem there let me see if i can i might have missed something my mic is good uh select this music all right okay that should give the quiz music and let's try this all right keep going maybe you should be able to hear now uh can you hear me now uh everyone uh i am back am i back no it's quite silence everybody's so focused yes what the heck is that all right thank you i'm back okay yo so now we plan we we can play the game uh finally uh yeah okay loud and clear okay so uh i don't want to make you wait more so let's get rolling i think we do a six question for today here we go let me click here and start this is the fun fun fun part and fast fast to get more points why monolithic architecture are often considered a back practice that tends to grow out and become unmaintainable they are often harder to scale tightly coupled independent development or all of the above and max mister is hearing voices in your head but that's the right answer right yeah exactly monotique is very hard to scale hard to maintain and uh tidy couples so yeah it was all of the above so and usually usually if you had or if you had a question like why monolithic architectures are bad practice then you can say none of the above right wow very cool okay actual was the fastest for question number one but nothing is is is done uh it was a little tricky question because all was true and you may you might be ten just to answer the first one because it was correct two okay question two in six answer fast but more precisely accurately micro services are a method to ensure tight coupling a way to isolate domain workload and reduce coupling only implementing implemented through apis services in a micro company are small services right yeah i know i'm microsoft yeah okay everyone so i must have are you are you made the question i mean yeah come on not at all emo the first question was easy this one is not moving on answer fast correctly and let's see how the leaderboard has changed very exciting right all right okay so mark was the fastest uh guy with dogs okay taz son sun god arsene wounds wow love all the avatar you know those those are random but you know something you could see this okay who is at the bottom but but you know could come up right yeah question three okay look closely at your tab or phone question will appear there first rest apis are a remote implementation of rpc our apc offer great discoverability are based on the http methods and standard are required after a long portion right it looks like i mean i like the latest you know yeah exactly just rest yeah so indeed they were it it was a little trick okay we like to be a bit tricky it's not really rpc fpc are soap or grpc not http i mean it's still http but it's it's try to invoke remote function you know that's something that you have to put on top right so uh now discoverability you know really more about graphql because you export schema and rest okay you do have a rest endpoint but if i don't tell you how to invoke it what is a payload you don't know so it it's not really uh discovered okay so sushant uh takes the lead ashit is second and guy with dogs uh keep the third position as i can keep again nothing is one point so you know you never know you know you could you could spring all the way to the front oh yeah that's so close and three questions to go oh jp gfpc is now your favorite right are is binary serialized payload for maximum performance are not based on http struggle with interoperability and avenues you know it's not nice for grpc yeah okay yeah most you know it's not nice but most of you got it correctly yeah i i i try to be very strong on binary serialized performance there are based on http and even http 2 and all the multiplexed available on http 2 again as fast as possible and for interoperability it's not bad because you provide the proto file and a lot a lot of frameworks and language could connect okay uh two oh no leather board and two more to go man we gotta have the leaderboard let's see some movement on top look at that you know uh consistency with dogs is not a guy with dogs uh but you know it's close anyone in the top 10 could still make it to the um [Music] okay okay okay question five so two last question do acid requirements fit micro service architectures yes micro service perfectly support acid yes if if support acid configuration is explicitly enabled not really distributed isolated architecture is better fit for base no microservices are alkaline no you know you know why i put that here uh because the french word for alkaline is base and you know so it's so easy to say the contrary of i see this base in french so well uh but you know in english it's called alkaline so you know wow okay um so yes so long story short indeed micro service no great nice way to do distributed transaction so really focus on based we had a slide on this so when i looked at bass i said you know centric put a lot of emphasis on bass so maybe it is that yeah okay oh and check it take the leads congrats uh guys we start this second yeah position but really i think it's very close this time right you know it looks like all within like 50 points okay last question yeah the suspense is killing me okay final what where the framework use into the end zone spring express flask micro node nest jungle quakeus netify fast api coffee you know there is big chance that the latest one is not the correct one each time wow yeah this one was quite a speed question because you you probably pick one of the three and immediately recognize which one you what you were using okay great okay so final result everybody and then we will wrapped up um and uh okay i know look at that cute guy with your consistency is key boom you made it okay so congratulations so for the three winners uh do a screenshot of your screen now okay i will keep give you 20 seconds now to give to do a screenshot uh and you will send an email to gary harvey dot com i will share his email in a minute uh but during the time i do the wrap up i open here a quick survey so what can we do to improve ourselves remember we are there every week for new session on new topics uh so we would like uh you know we would like to know what you would like to see us covering in the coming weeks or if we can do things better and in the meantime so that's the email for gary so you know you can watch the recording pause the video and send an email to to gary homeworks so the homeworks for uh this week is a couple of questions like the mentee same level no tricks no no trap and then a coding exercise uh update the api to add another endpoint just to list the to-do's that are already complete you will have uh you will have a new endpoint a little filter could be so that's less than 10 you know less than 10 lines of code but all the layers the api access to the data and if you complete the four hours and if you complete the four hours you'll get the golden badge and the version sure to take the certification uh give us a few weeks uh for uh you know to be ready um and especially so just a few weeks because mid february we will do a dedicated session uh to prepare you for the certification maybe we will call that a rehearsal of certification so at mid-february it would be great that you completed all the homework did all the the free online training and we will do a dry run of a certification to see if you are at the expected level and you know then you can redeem your voucher and take the certification on your own um beside that we told you we are there every week so next week so the boot camp is closed but you know the light is still on so next monday we will uh show you how to build the e-commerce app i think it's still spring the technology and we will exactly show you how the shopping cart work and on wednesday we will do a streaming uh build a real-time streaming game so everybody will move a spider on screen and uh it will you know everybody will get the notification using a streaming platform so you know pretty cool uh accaton all the session we are doing is really for you to you know start using cassandra and uh and astra by extension and we start this acaton uh every month you can get some prices by submitting some small project does not need to be the new facebook but you know get your uh a few first sample project every month you get some some prices okay so three months three rounds uh i'll start advocate we will do some session across the weeks as well to show part of the product if you want to do office hour session and yeah we'll get we get ready speaking of office hour uh because it was the last week of the boot camp we will probably run office hour tomorrow uh 4 p.m nice time so that will be 2 p.m utc on friday like just yeah just just on screen live waiting for your question helping for you to complete the homeworks uh pretty soon on the youtube channel you will have an invite for that tomorrow if you want to join us uh no real preparation we will just be there to answer your questions on thursday or friday you know just to clarify all right what i say i say no thursday okay thursday yeah thursday 4 p.m yeah um and you know if you do have questions after this is ended um we are going to the end uh use this code to reach out to us uh some of you already asked questions there today uh we are pretty reactive there uh try to help you can share your your your you can copy some some pictures and share your error message and we we can help you there and i think with that uh with a couple of minutes late sorry for that uh if you enjoyed this and we are there every week consider to subscribe like share whatever you you feel uh you know needed and you know we would be happy to have you in our network as well we share the linkedin and twitter coordinates in the beginning uh but you know so that's that's a question a question on chat about uh homework did you talk about homework i'm just trying to remember i mean yeah i i've i've yeah i've uh commented what uh that will be the homework but in the readme for today go to the bottom and here you will see exactly what is the homework of the week and how to submit the homework is here submit the homework for the week if you're interested in taking the homeworks for the previous week again it's in github here go back to the the root of the repo and see if you week one two three four go for instance week one screen the readme and look for homeworks and each time you will see the work that is expected and the form to validate and i think one of the questions that we frequently get is you know is there a timeline for this homework uh you know we usually expect it in like a couple of weeks um you know but but uh if you take like a couple days more i think it's okay but but you know if you can do it in the next couple of weeks when the memory is still fresh i think it's good okay well i let these uh you know answer uh on screen and we don't want to hide anything here uh thank you very much for attending the session we are still on this car to answer any question and uh hope to see you next week thank you ciao and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of
