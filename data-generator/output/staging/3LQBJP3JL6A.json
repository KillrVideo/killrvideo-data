  "title": "NLP text classification as a REST API using Keras, FastAPI & NoSQL",
  "description": "Are you interested in Machine and Deep Learning and want to learn more about NLP (natural language processing)? In this 2 hour workshop, you’ll learn to create your own AI-based text classifier and make it easily accessible as a simple REST API.\nBy using a database as a cache layer, you will improve the performance of the API.\n\nWe’ll assume you have working Python knowledge. From there, we build with Keras (Tensorflow), Fast API, pedantic and  Astra DB, a serverless DBaaS built on Apache Cassandra. This is an interactive workshop, so you will go through the whole process yourself with our 100% hands-on session! \n\nDuring the workshop, you will:\n  - prepare the labeled dataset for model training\n  - train the model to classify any input text\n  - export the trained model and test it interactively\n  - create your free NoSQL database for data storage\n  - set up and start an API exposing the classifier as a reusable class!\n  - learn how to speed up the API with DB-based caching\n  - inspect how a streaming response is handled in the API\n\nAnd much more!\n\n\n📚 To access the learning materials, use the GitHub link below:\nhttps://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-ai-as-api\n\n☁️To create your very first NoSQL database, use the link below:\nhttps://astra.dev/2-23\n\n💡Get help throughout using our Discord server:\nJoin our Discord here - https://discord.gg/UEBDeBq\n\n✅ Sign up for more workshops below:\nhttps://www.datastax.com/workshops\n\n🚀 🚀 ENJOY !! 🚀 🚀",

back from a vacation last week and uh you know to be doing this workshop um we always get a lot of international audience for those of you who are here for the first time welcome for those of you who have been here for multiples uh welcome back my name is rags and stefano do you want to say hi to everyone and make sure if you can put a thumbs up that you're getting two watches once you hear stefanos and no more than two voices you know there are no echoes anything like that um we want to make sure that you know you have a good experience for the next two hours yes thank you rux hi hi everyone welcome to today's workshop um please tell me if you can hear me as well and right there maybe i need to let the music on [Music] we save it for the quest right yeah yeah yeah exactly all right we can't give it away now thank you we hear you you should be off now sorry okay so i think everyone noticed the music i think we are good now what do you think i think we're good yeah yeah i turned it off okay great so again hello everyone and i think we can start someone says i might be made a bit louder i could try that yeah i can definitely do that all right yeah it was fun music uh music will come back so okay i can start now hi alex it's nice to see you in the chat as well okay so let's go um i think you are showing my screen looking good you are okay please nicely placed as well so keep going so introductions i'm stefano i'm glad to be here we will have fun today and learn a lot i'm a developer and architect at data stocks actually i'm a developer advocate here at datastax i know cassandra i love cassandra i love distributed systems and i love to teach so today by the way we are going to the to to speak of some other topics namely ai and machine learning which is also a very fun and cool topic so join us in our journey and to you rugs thank you stefano and um my name is raghavan shrunivas and for whatever reason a lot of people in the world have a tough time pronouncing my name so i just go by rags easiest way to remember me rags not to riches and i'm in different forms slightly different from you know in linkedin i'm rags on github i'm rags and s and on twitter i'm rags s but in the end i'm racks um i'm also like stefano a developer advocate at datastax and you know i come from more of a kubernetes java uh you know that side of the world um i've done no sql also quite a bit but one of the things i like about the workshop is that no matter what your level is our goal is to up level it and i myself learn by attending the workshops by teaching the workshops and so on and one of the main passions that i have is kind of improving the developer productivity by making the inner loop easier um and and you know today we will kind of touch upon it uh you know there is a a new really new trend that's emerging uh in machine learning called ml ops where you know you have all this operations that are associated with machine learning but from a developer perspective we want to provide that as an api and that's exactly what we'll see today so although you know we will go into some aspects of ml uh we will focus really mainly in the operationalize operationalizing ml part of it as well okay all right with that stefano back to you yeah good point thank you so uh i see um iris uh writes that he like or they like the light sabers so maybe next slide is for you because you can guess uh these workshops are not just the work of the two of us but they there is a whole team behind and it's good to it's good to acknowledge all of them so this is the full team and you see we all have lightsabers right you know we still rely on a lot of help from them you know basically in pushing the content out uh you know making sure swag is sent you know and things like that a lot a lot of things you know that happened before absolutely so there's there is a whole team and we have to thank all of you and by the way some of you are in the chat so okay so let's start with the topics first we will see uh a few practical advice for today's live and and how to how to follow us in this hands-on workshop then we will quickly view what is the main goal of today and then we will take a look at the database side of this of today's application then we will uh look at a few uh important points about ai and we will start training the model which is then brought to production within an api and then we will close with a a bit of fun and a bit of a rim over let's say closing words okay so i think we can start with the housekeeping so this is live and there will be a bit of hands-on so briefly what are the tools we use today first you are watching us live presumably on youtube but in case youtube would fail which happens a few times let's say two or three times per year uh we will head to twitch which is our plan b for the streaming that's one thing then on youtube there is a chat box and i see you are all very active there that's good and that's a good place to ask questions but we invite you to join us on discord because this card is the place where the discussion can continue and also touch on other subjects when this live is over so please join us on discord we will maybe uh paste the link in the chat just for for you to join us because we invite you to join us there uh that's not the end of it because there is also another uh kind of interactivity we will do quizzes we will do a bit of games with prizes later and for that we will use mentimeter we will give you the link in a little while oh okay so now more to the point today we are going to do a bit of live hands-on exercises and you are going to do that with us for that we have a few resources and first thing is there is nothing to install it's all in the cloud it's all in the in your browser so nothing to install of course if you feel more comfortable you can also decide to do that on your pc as long as you have you know python and you have a git and basically that's it and on ide maybe um but okay so just to make it clear you know since we have about 400 people um you know looking at this workshop right now uh we want to be um able to support the the uh majority experience you know so so we will not be helping you you know not because we don't want to but because it takes more time to do it locally so our uh recommendation is to use git power uh and and the you know instructions that are provided uh that we'll see in a moment yes that's a good point so we will not give you live support live troubleshooting if you decide to go on your local machine but you can and we will be reachable on discord later if you want uh but as rox just mentioned today we are going to use an an ide in the cloud which is gitbot which is very cool and it will automate most of the yeah the cloning and the running of code for us uh we also will have a database as a backend for data persistence for that we will use uh astra db which is based on apache cassandra and it will provide each one of you with your own database with your own nosql database as a service in the cloud for free so that's it i have to mention because a very important thing most of the content of today is based on um original content by the coding entrepreneurs developer influencer and the content is different there is much there is less in the two versions so to speak um so you are invited to visit their youtube and their blog because you'll find more more parts different usage of several tools so all in all you will learn a bit more okay so i think that's it for so aditya had asked the question about how long is this workshop this is two hours sometimes we have had eventbrite calendars being off a little bit but but again you know if you cannot uh stay on for the entire two hours and remember we have some fun stuff at the very end right uh still it's all recorded and you can come back and watch it later and you know do it yourself yeah yeah definitely one thing that i want to mention is that we will soon give you the link to the github repository there you will find detailed instructions that by the way cover also the case of local running and all in all they will contain far more details and information that we are able to convey into ours so you are invited to go there and maybe yeah deepen your knowledge um okay so i just pasted in the youtube chat the link to join us on mentimeter and in i want to start the process okay i'm gonna i'm gonna go to two small heads if anybody um you know uh okay has any issues with with sound or anything you know let me know because i just changed it a wee bit okay it should be okay yes i think it's all right sound wise okay so please join us on multimeter so you type menti.com and enter the code that you see here in the chat 60 10 6344 or you can scan the qr code because this is the platform we will use to ask you a few questions first it will be initial questions just to you know get to know our audience better and uh later the same platform will be used for the quiz so for the quiz it means that it will be timed question with prizes and all that but not yet uh an important point is that uh now as well as later please do not answer in the chat and do not watch youtube for the questions because there is a delay and the quest and the answers you type in the chat will be wasted so please use mendy.com don't look at youtube but look at many now let's see let's see we have many people join already but maybe we can wait in a few seconds more let's wait for 200 people on board yeah yeah we're there all right we are okay so you will you're it's still time for you to join uh maybe i will repeat the link on the chat but let's start so let's start okay so these are just a few questions to get to know you better to to know our audience so of course we want to know where are you watching us from so where in the world are you from let's see i see lots of people from england from canada one point from africa canada brazil united states mexico all over europe welcome everyone nice to see there's a nice uh no matter how many no matter what times you see this this is so exciting because you know it's so nice to interact with the international developer community uh knowing fully well that as much as you learn from us we also learn from you yeah so yeah yes and so again please do not uh use the youtube chat yeah please don't answers because they are wasted answers so it is a pity especially later because there will be the quiz so by the way kudos to india because i understand it's a bit late if i'm not mistaken so congratulations but okay we have a lot of people here all over the world somebody from china there sorry could that be new yes i've seen yeah i see a point from china now what is your role as a developer front-end back-end more web apps or data engineer cloud native opera developer dba or other well other is really means many possible but i see most yeah that is to be expected most of the attendees are dead engineers or backhand that kind of backhand or other which yeah is sort of umbrella option i mean the other other could be a real estate developer you think i'm just kidding but it's cool to see also front-end developer i mean the interest in these topics is really is really uh um transverse or how do you say a widespread uh kind of interest so so we have a comment uh there's a great workshop but we need really need to get to point we will get to the point the idea is that uh you know some people might be arriving late but point well taken thank you yeah okay so we will start shortly don't worry what is your primary programming language you know these questions are also aimed at tailoring our content to be better and better next time because we run a series of workshops and every week we want to give you the best possible experience so that's important i see well that was uh expected so the vast majority are proficient with python and that's good because today is python and i guess for most of the data science data oriented coding out there it's python so no surprises here and i want to move on so today your primary interest is more the ai machine learning or how to put models in apis all of today are you here just because you're curious or maybe you're here for this one which is our world famous as well we have three people admitting that they are here for the swag that's cool well i i appreciate your honesty exactly yeah oh yeah cries in our i know yes are i should not have i should have mentioned r i agree but okay it happens that today we are focused on uh python 100 so you know okay but it's cool to see that it's also here a nice distribution now uh um a flame provoking question python scripts or jupiter notebooks so do you prefer python scripts do you prefer interactive computing so jupyter notebooks and shift enter all the way to the end of the cells or do you have a moderate position so there are different tools for different tasks or you really don't know what this question is about so that's interesting jupiter yeah okay i see jupiter let's say interactive computing wins over ordinary python scripts yeah it's very very very okay yeah i mean i think by a factor each task the right tool i like i think pretty good answer anyway right okay okay yeah yeah okay that's good we will keep that in mind uh if we have time to go the jupiter way but i wonder if there will be time last question i guess right okay so do you know machine learn last question again sorry almost there yeah almost there do you know some machine learning i see there are some very expert i eat keggle masters for breakfast good to know um total beginners i've had some exposure okay so of course we tried to tailor the today's content to an average kind of audience so you will see i'm sure every one of you will find something they you don't know and it might be good to add to your tools okay so so i think nitish makes a point it's really fun here i didn't expect this uh uh keep going and and i think that's one of the differences in our workshop is we expect you to chat uh but we also expect you to you know kind of not chat uh when we're gonna go through some practice and we'll talk about this uh when we when we come to that but feel free to ask any questions especially if you're stuck yeah absolutely um okay so i see most of you are new welcome um so this is probably this is the first workshop of ours that you attend but maybe not the last we'll see and to those of you who are have already been to our workshops welcome back and today is new content so i hope you will be having fun uh there is a question on certificate uh yes there will be a badge if you complete the uh so besides attending the ho the workshop is not enough to have a badge there is also a bit of lab to submit so i will tell you later there is a submission form in the readme for doing a bit of a work of your own a bit of coding and then you submit a homework form we will grade it give us a few days and you will get a badge which is a verified attendance patch so it worked as a certificate that you attended and did the homework of this website might might as well give you a question or answer um you know one of the questions we get is when can we submit the homework we recommend one or two weeks you know so that it's still fresh in your mind and you know by repetitions you you get the uh the concepts better right uh but but you really you know if it's not possible in one week or two weeks it's okay you know a little bit a few more days is fine we recognize that we're all talking to professionals with that said stefano back to you yeah that's a good point okay so let's start and take a note let's start with the content um okay so what is our goal very broadly speaking we want to create an api that exposes um kind of task so what we want is our customers or our web application or maybe our internal other microservices they want an api that they can query with a question uh in our case it's going to be a classification question namely i give you i give the api a piece of text and i ask it is this spam or it is a legit piece of text let's say these are messages email subject uh sms whatever and the api does its magic and it will reply yes it is spam with 96 percent confidence or no it is not spam it's okay so this is what we want as seen from outside right okay so the api will be uh sitting if you want on top of a machine learning thing a machine learning classifier in our case and so today we want to learn two things first is well not in order two things one thing is we want to learn how to take a machine learning classifier and properly expose it as an api in a production kind of uh so stefano um yeah let's let me preempt you there is a question about yeah what the heck is that api thing in the middle right i don't think you expanded what api and and sometimes we make this assumption but thanks for your point bringing us to task api stands for application program interface okay so it is a service that is reached by usually http requests and it will accept requests do some processing and respond with an answer so i think we will see it at work later but in general it is something that might be used by uh front-end by another service that needs to query it let's say you have a complex data pipeline and you need to filter spam messages as one of the steps in your process pipeline you might have a separate service just working to do that so you have your let's say you have you are running a data ingestion service that gets more and more pieces of text but it has to filter out spam so this is a service that your main data pipeline might have to query systematically to make sure it doesn't include spam messages for example so actually the api might be exposed to the outside might be part of your internal uh pipeline you know it might be directly exposed to customers to clients to whatever okay so i think we will actually run the api and request and run a request to it so i think it will be clearer in practice okay so from the standpoint of the api the ai part so the classifier is best seen as a black box it is something you put text in and you get answers back more or less that's the way and this is the side for this is the side of today's uh concerned with you know the serious engineer kind of guy you see here in the picture he's very serious he's production guy he wants stability performance and maybe he's not even so much concerned as to what is the inner working of your classifier because that's tough for another guy here the crazy metadata scientist so now i'm making it a bit funny today but actually it's two different uh person two different kind of people here two different jobs i i don't think i don't think it's the cds engineer because he's wearing a suit and how can how can an engineer get yeah okay these are you know just pictures but i don't even think many data scientists have to wear goggles or lab coats but still that's funny and that's the crazy the mad scientist and you know it's still data science i mean it's engineering probably it's mathematics but it's science and as such it is experimenting prototyping it is a discipline that is very much evolving and a lot of dead ends a lot of attempts experiments and this unfortunately sometimes shows in the code which is a pity because sometimes the machine learning components you see around are hidden treasures that maybe are hard to reproduce they are not always polished and ready for production they are hidden in notebooks maybe and similar things now today today uh we want to bridge the gap we want to make these two people uh speak to each other actually we want to be both people at once because that's something that emerged most more and more in in the last years it's not enough to have cool machine learning models it's also important to be able to use them reliably in production to expose them the right way to promote interpretability you know open specifications and whatnot there is not much use to a very cool model if the only way to run it is in a in a notebook hidden somewhere in my own personal folder with a lot of caveats run this cell before this one and then go back i mean the usual real-life messy things that you probably have seen and maybe you also have done you can also if you go back to the you know the developer inner loop where you you know you do this edits debug it profile it and so on you will do the same thing in machine learning as well um you know you will be building um you know training models which which take much longer so you want to streamline this as much as possible and that's kind of what you'll see in today's workshop is being able to bridge the gap like what you know stefano was talking uh you know between the ml consumer and the ml producer right you know so that's really what the goal is yeah so um okay i see the chat is becoming a very funny place and that's great of course um now trying to be serious again one second uh when we explain uh try to keep your questions a bit because we might be giving you the answer later so try to let's try not to get distracted too much of course with limitations because we will not be able to pay attention to so so many of you very well so let's go ahead maybe what i mean is that maybe most of your practical questions will be answered in the practice part because we will have time to inspect a bit of the code and see how the main bits work okay so um very generally this is the architecture we have in mind when we want to build this api there are requests coming from outside and hopefully getting answers and that's one point the api will have access to two things there is the machine learning model which is you can call it model or classifier it is the thing that this crazy scientist prepares and then hands it to the serious engineer right so this model or classifier is in is now in the hands of the api code and the api is able to use it to query it to run it against any new text that arrives and give the answer back but that's the main operation but you know in most cases maybe not much today but in general running a classifier model on new input is expensive it takes time it takes cpu maybe it might take a few seconds so uh many models as this one for example they work deterministically so once they are loaded they will give always the same answer for the same question so why don't we cache the results and indeed we do that's why we also have a database here and the database will be used as a cache for previously processed inputs so every time an input arrives actually what we do is we look into the cache and if we have a result we reserve it done very quick if there is no results we run the model for real we serve the result but we also cache the this result for later queries again whether to do this or not depends on many many considerations one is how expensive is it to run the model sometimes it is uh very expensive and i mean seconds sometimes many seconds because there are very complex models there is another question that is how often do we predict the same input will be submitted more than once to the api and in this case probably it will be submitted multiple times because let's say this is this is a service to tell apart spam email messages so usually spam comes to very many recipients and if suppose this application is used in a way that every individual recipient will query this service so we will have a lot of requests with the same input and then caching is more and more relevant so i see a question in the chat here we use alaru cash uh ru cash no actually we cache everything so in this model in this simplified model we just cache everything because we use a database that has a lot of space and we avoid uh in memory cache because we can restart the api and we don't want to lose the precious effort spent so far okay so you see you you just saw the architecture and let's have a look at the technologies that we will use to create this okay so uh basically as maybe that's an answer to someone asking what an api is um request and responses from to and from the api will be served through http ordinary request so http protocol and then the api is written in fast api fast api is a modern framework for writing api in python and so it supports a lot of cool features it's uh aimed at reducing the amount of boiler plate to the minimum possible um first api in turn will uh be run using the uv core um runtime which is let's say it's a thing it supports modern protocols for running python apis and speak http on the other side of things the model is is a keras model so there is a very cool uh machine learning library called keras that is now completely part of tensorflow uh tensorflow is a library for machine learning and let's say in general vectorized computing written at google and keras is an interface is now let's say a layer on top of it that makes it easier to let's let's say it makes it for a higher level abstraction on top of tensorflow very much familiar to neural network and similar classifiers okay so the last point to um to observe is the database the database is going to be astrodb i mentioned that already astradb is a database built on apache cassandra a nosql database and it has the advantage besides being free to use for us today it has another advantage it is um very good at scaling it has very many nice features that we are going to briefly mention in a while but most important it is in the cloud so it is offered as a service so we just have we will get our own database with a couple of clicks and uh no operation no maintenance no deploy needed so ready to go so i think um you know stefano there are a couple of questions one from gautam and from one from um huisan uh you know essentially what about other technologies uh you know obviously we could pick another database we could pick another um you know technology for doing apis uh do you want to touch upon that a little bit and you know this is something that we picked because it's kind of easier to use right yeah yeah okay so well uh maybe part of the answer is going to be in the next slide so maybe uh let me go forward okay so um indeed we are section three database setup okay so let's start with apache cassandra apache cassandra is open source nosql database on which astradb is built the cassandra is a let's say something that you install if you want on your machines so as opposed to a database as a service but the principle is is the same so cassandra is distributed database data is distributed over several machines it is able to to deal with very big amounts of data and it has astonishing read and write performance not only that but it can scale easily so if you need a double performance you just double the number of machines hosting the data and you will have a double performance so that's what is called linear scalability so there is almost no overhead no overhead because of its architecture for similar reasons so i mean the architecture also implies that it can be configured to have basically zero downtime so very high availability it is good at self-heal when let's say there are some nodes that have been down for some time and they need to catch up with the data um cassandra can be also configured to be geographically distributed so you can have data duplicated uh all over the world to better serve your customers it is platform agnostic so it is not tied to any particular platform so you can run it in your machines in your data center on aws on google azure whatever you want also you can also have a hybrid deployment and it is uh it guarantees no lock-in because it is uh it is open source protected by the apache license so uh the main point the main answer to the question why cassandra is cassandra is very good at handling very large amounts of data with a linear access time so regardless how many rows you will have in your cache you will always have the same time to access them writing to them is very fast which is important because we want to serve our results very fast without wasting time in caching because that's not something that benefits uh the the the customer who made that request so it makes no sense to to give him a penalty and um yeah that's it so another point is that the the particular uh usage we do of cassandra today is not uh very much tied is not does not require many relations between data so if you think of a relational database there's nothing like that we just have basically a couple of tables that will act as a key value store and this is where cassandra shines most because it is absolutely super very fast in that you will quickly you will soon see more on that okay so well now we say we spent a few words on cassandra and let's see what astra db is astra db is a database in the cloud it is built on apache cassandra so it inherits all of these nice uh features i just mentioned and uh it is just handled as a platform for you in the cloud so no operations no maintenance not only that but there is a lot of further ways to interact a lot of tools there is also a message an event streaming platform coupled to that there are all sorts of ways to interact with with astra db so not only the cassandra drivers which we will use today but there is also rest graphql grpc etc etc document api i think mongodb so there is a lot of there is a whole ecosystem ready to be used there in the cloud today we use the ordinary basic cassandra way of speaking to the database namely we use the cassandra drivers that's because there is complete compatibility so there is not such a thing as the astra db drivers you just use the cassandra drivers okay so that's good that's an important point and it is something that we will get ready to use with a few clicks now before uh before going on i would like to show uh so today is not about databases that much but we are going to use the database so let me spend five minutes on uh some peculiar features uh of using cassandra as a database because it's cool and because it's good to know and if you ever plan on writing an api like the one we are seeing today that is very useful knowledge probably um so we are going to do two things with this database one as i mentioned already is we want to cache predictions uh by the way you might wonder what is a prediction well a prediction is actually what the model uh gives us when we uh give it a text so you you remember this it spawned 90 96 confidence this is the prediction so it's not a prediction like the for weather forecast but in machine learning it's always called prediction meaning the response from the model okay so you remember in the architecture sketch we want to store predictions in the database to be able to later query them for serving them if they were already processed there is a second usage we want to do for the on of the database and namely we want to log calls we want to keep a record of the calls issued the request coming from particular clients particular agents requesting from the api let's say we want to do that for i don't know to compute pricing in a specific way or we want to issue to implement rate limiting or whatever so we want to keep a log of every individual call issued by users okay so these two queries so these two usages of the database become two different queries so what what do we want to ask from the database first tell me if there is a prediction for this input text and this model version let's say this is always going to be v1 but maybe in the future we plan on deploying a new classifier a v2 of the classifier and we want to keep the two entries separate in the cache because you remember uh every time i give the same input i get the same output but if i if i replace v1 with v2 probably this would not be true in general so we want to keep them separate the other question the other query we want to run on the database is tell me all calls that this person this ip this client ip basically has issued in the last hour or in this hour in this our chunk now a point of cassandra is that first you look at the needs of your application and then you design the table another point is that every table is distributed so table is made by is made of a lot of rows but these rows will be grouped in several machines that form your database okay that's something we unfortunately on we we can just touch briefly today but still i want to show you that looking at these two queries we come up with two different tables one is called spam cache items and it will host the already processed pieces of text with their result their prediction and the other is spam calls per color you see every so these two here you see a schematic view of the structure of the two tables you see there are some columns so model version input confidence and so on for the cache and caller id caller hour and called at which is a full timestamp and the input text for the second table now the meaning of those is actually those are called chabatko diagrams and these are this is how you model your data in cassandra we will just gloss over these points of course but the important thing is that as many other databases there is the concept of primary key so you you have to pick rows columns that make that ensure every row is unique uniquely determined as these three in the in the purple box but also you define something called partition key which is a subset of these columns of these rows sorry and these uh th determines how the data is physically located over several nodes now that's just a detail but it's an important detail because um because it basically determines what kind of queries i can run in a short and i can run quickly and i can run and have the result quickly the meaning of this kkc is [Music] specific to these points so k and k define the partition key and the c means this is part of the primary key of course this is something we have to touch very quickly so primary key is concerned with unicity uniqueness of rows while partition key is what determines how physically the data are stored together so what what rows are grouped together on a single machine and that implies which are the queries that go fast because they just go to a single machine in the database um okay so i feel a bit sad because i have to go on of course cassandra and and data modeling with cassandra is a very cool and interesting topic but we have to skip and if you are curious you will find a few more links in in the github repository and um in other many other of our workshops but i i'm afraid it's time to move on i wanted just to you know pick your interest in cassandra we will use it later so i just want to say something on the code how the code uses this database there are various ways of accessing cassandra or astrodb for that matter what we do today is we use the drivers but the drivers in particular offer a nice abstraction that is made of objects so you see here we can avoid speaking the low level language of cassandra and we can just define you see okay i'll go through the four blocks of code here in the first one you see we define a class a special class with some particular properties and that's something we define once and this is where we imply the shape of the table of the underlying table but then we never speak of tables anymore because after making sure we initialize things properly when the api starts and this sync table takes care of creating the underlying table after that we want to read and write objects to the table we just create objects as we create ordinary python class instances for reading and for writing and that's it so we we just speak the the language of ordinary python objects and everything else the access to the database is handled for us behind the scenes uh that's cool because we don't have to take so much care of the underlying low level parts of the database but still that's an important point you can't avoid thinking of your data model because if you get your data model wrong you will have suboptimal performance so you still have to think carefully on how to plan your tables but then in terms of usage in the code you just use ordinary python objects and that's what the object mapper does for us okay i think i've been speaking enough already so rugs i suggest uh we go with the first part of the hand zone so let me maybe the well that would be an oram except it's not relational so it's just object mapping so no r no relational because the underlying is not relational is a nosql database in particular it is it doesn't know the concept of relations proper so i think now the youtube chat should give you the link to uh okay that's there already uh so rux do you want to take over and start the demo part or yeah absolutely i'm good yeah yeah i think i think there is a lot of uh activity and chat about horizontal scaling vertical scaling and all that and i think yes stefani you talked about this there are several workshops that go into quite a bit of detail on all this intro to nosql intro to cassandra data modeling you name it you know we have workshops that go for two hours so there is no way we can cover all that so we'll just point you at that but uh do you want to take up one question which is like why do we want to cache both the text and the prediction part uh you know in the database um yeah maybe maybe if you want to do that i will i will be ready to go yeah okay so yeah so why do we want to cache both the input text and the prediction yeah well that's uh what we need for the cache to to be later used to as a cache so let's say tomorrow tomorrow the api will receive the same input text as today so i first have to look into the database and see if there is already a row with that input text and this can hardly be done unless i stored the input text not only that but i i better store it in a table where the input text is part of the primary key so i'm this is also specific to cassandra but it's not not so specific the best way to look to look up a row is if i look it up by primary key so i can go straight to that one row right so if the primary key includes the input text i'm done because i can really fast i can reach the proper machine in the database which is as many machines i can reach the proper node and find out if there is that input yes that's a good point so it cuts down computation cost by showing previous results if it's available in the database but then once i know that row exists i have to read the prediction that i wrote yesterday in order to you know serve it to my to the the caller so i have to store both the input and the output think of a key value store so i'm using that table exactly as a key value store where the key is the input text and the version of the model and the output is the result of the computation so i can avoid repeating the computation yeah that's more or less the reason yeah and there are some answers in chat which kind of point to that as well so so that's great thanks for helping us out with the chat as well uh but let's get started i know that you know all of you are kind of waiting to get started uh typically i mean there are a number of ways of doing this you know i i like to kind of put this in different tabs um and you can see here i start with my github repository if you don't know where the github repository with all the instructions is just type bang get part or i'm sorry band github or exclamation github on in youtube chat you should be um able to get to this repository okay so so i get to this repository and then you know the instructions are pretty straightforward you know i just kind of follow step by step and if for some reason i get lost somewhere you know what i can do is i can start from from the beginning we have enough time for you to get started and so on um but you know just follow it step by step as much you know as you can right so the first thing we're going to do is create the astrodb here you know so let's start right create instead of the astrodb um in a number of ways of doing this again what i typically do is i just use the open link in new window okay you can you can do it wherever you want uh it doesn't matter okay it will take you to the to the uh sign in um website right and and essentially essentially what you can do here is you can put in your email password nothing else right no we don't ask for credit cards nothing you can you can get quite a bit of significant uh credits uh to be able to use it no promotion code nothing you know very easy just put in your email password i've already put it in right so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to sign in okay i'm going to sign in here and you should be able to see your dashboard okay so i already have quite a few um you know databases up and running right um so uh you'll see that some of these are an active mode and some of these are in standby mode if they're in standby mode you can wake them up right that's what we recommend but i'll get to it in a second okay but basically you want them to be active like you know like workshops is and if you click on workshops there are a number of key spaces we want you to create a key space called spam classifier and we'll and we'll um look into that in a second okay so let me get rid of this window and go back to my instructions right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to create an astra db instance with the database name as workshops and this key space name is spam classifier do you absolutely need to have the same names not necessary but but you know it's just easier that way okay so let me sign in here okay and go back to here okay and you'll see again you know i'll see my dashboard okay and let's go back you know i just switch between the tabs right this is my git part window which we'll see in a second okay and i'll make sure to open it i'll come back to that in a second uh and and what i do is i switch between these tabs right i switch between the github tab the git part tab the astro tab and and you know you eventually you'll get to the browser as well so we'll you know that's just the way i do it you know you can have multiple windows you can have multiple browsers and switch between browsers whatever works for you okay so let me not beat that to death um so so once you're done this right what you need to do is you have to generate and download a secure connect bundle okay so so to be able to download a secure connect bundle is pretty straightforward make sure you have workshops right and then what you're gonna do is you you can say connect okay and and then what you can do is you can connect using a driver it really doesn't matter which driver you're gonna use you can see here um it'll give you uh you know java c c plus plus c sharp and so on um you can you can pick whichever you want you know python is fine you download a bundle and all that you do is download and say secure connect bundle um and it will download the bundle locally okay once you've downloaded the bundle we'll talk about what what you do need to do next okay but for those of you who may still be creating a database you just do a create database the database name is workshops remember right and this thing is a spam classifier okay and you can really pick any region you want we recommend just using google cloud and and picking something that's closer to you so i'm based in um usc east and i can i can click on this and you know hit create database and you can see here it's a free plan which actually enables you to run uh significant production workloads um on on this um i i myself have never really had to you know i can i can easily do all these workshops and do more uh without really having to do anything else if you want it in multiple regions you want it on on a cloud of your choice okay then you know the easiest way is to put in your credit card or you can even live chat and talk to um you know our other operators where they're really 24x7 and can kind of help you out okay uh anything i missed stefano or um um i think that's it so database name key space name and then you choose uh error area region and you hit create database yes so there is a question do you incur cost on google cloud no you don't so free plan is free plan but to unlock other cloud provider you have to speak to an operator and have it on have it locked unlocked and that's still free so what is not free is the enterprise plan which is very very way beyond a reasonable usage that you might want to do especially today exactly for enterprises um yeah for today for today in most of our workshops you don't need to put any credit card but but you know if you want like i said inter region and so on then then you may want to put in your credit card or using a different plan okay uh one other thing i forgot to mention was you know if you want to get to the sql console you can just click on um the workshop right and and then click on sql console and this will bring you to the sql console for those of you who have used cassandra before comfortable with this um you know you can you can um click on the sql console and then run the sql commands these are very similar to uh sql commands uh in a way but it's different in the sense that this is for cassandra you know that was more for you know sql right but but you can kind of you know if you if you never use sql and you've used uh sql uh it's it's fairly easy to kind of translate those commands to sql as well yeah all right so if i may add a few things because i've been keeping an eye on the chat yeah so there was a question uh my database is uh um standby so hibernated yeah that happens to databases in the free tier after maybe one day of inactivity they get hibernated and to wake them up you just click on the sql console and there will be a message saying uh uh that's we are unhibernating your data exactly let's refresh and you will see when you see the sql console ready and working um cursor blinking then your database is back to activity so it's really a couple of minutes another question so if you have created or waken up your database you have probably downloaded your bundle uh drugs you've been showing that there is a question okay if your database is pending then it's all good because it a couple of minutes it will become uh active now it's probably pending it's being created and it will be back to it will become active in a couple of minutes i see a recurring uh point in the chat namely secure connect bundle download is blocked and i think someone mentioned that chrome is blocking it that's i have to say new to me but then again i'm not using chrome so that's pretty strange oh yeah rugs is showing what happens when your database is being waken up again that is taking a couple of minutes or so now another point is if you see your region being locked uh you might the quickest thing for today workshop is to just pick another region and that would be good enough for us today no we don't have particular latency needs today so no point in choosing a region on the other if there was another you know the downloading the secure bundle is locked you know what you can do is um you can go uh here um and essentially you can you can say copy the link um you know so there are there are a number of ways of doing this uh so let's say i have my python driver right and then download bundle um and then what you can do is you can say secure connect bundle and then you can copy the link okay and and put it in in in another browser uh maybe that'd be more tolerant yeah if you're getting to that point okay yeah so thank you aaron for writing in the chat uh a link to a trick on how to make chrome less fussy and that might help you guys using chrome there is also uh an important question what's a key space because that's something that probably yeah i didn't mention that yeah go ahead might be a question of you so okay we instructed you to create a database and to create a key space and a key space is just a logical grouping of tables so today we are going to use a couple of tables in our database to store call log and cache requests this we want to keep grouped into a single logical container and that's what a key space is so it's in other databases this is called a schema but i mean that's not even so important today it's just something that has to be there to contain tables so key space contains tables and other things but that's no problem uh aaron thank you for pointing that out in the chat i'll voice you your remark for everyone when you download the bundle please keep it as a zip file no need to open it just take the full zip file and save it on your local machine ready for later um did you create a token maybe i missed that i did not create token okay so maybe i can go back and so that's the point sorry yeah good point yeah so let's go back it's basically a name space sorry yes so uh i i asked please drugs to show these other points so so to be able to create a token uh what what i'm gonna do is uh you know there are a number of ways of doing this obviously like like you know right and uh you know essentially i can go into organization settings okay and there is something called a token management as you can see here okay uh pick token management okay and then um hit database administrator there are different roles you can fine-tune the role we just make it easier for you to just pick database administrator and then hit a generate token that's all you need right and what this is going to do is it's going to create a token for you for that you know uh specific database i mean actually it's for that region but it doesn't matter and and what you will do is you know it will provide you with the client id client secret and token uh what you want to do is not leave this page until you've copied this you know if you leave this page then it's gone and then you'll have to um you know generate a new one and all that and typically what i do is i i just say download and once i download uh you know essentially uh i will i will get this in like a excel spreadsheet you know which kind of looks like this uh the role the token and all that uh and then and then you're good to go just make sure that you copy it uh sometimes i copy it to notepad uh whatever whatever works for you but but you know just remember if you navigate away from this page uh this is gone um you'll have to create it again um again no big deal uh if you if you navigate away by mistake um but ideally you know you want to keep the client id client secret token in a safe place because we're going to use this pretty soon yeah so thank you rux because you also answered a question by kirsten so token will be downloaded as a csv file yeah that's the preferred way if you want because as prague said this page will not be visible anymore when you leave it uh of course you can also create a new token that's okay but the point is that creating the token and downloading the bundle uh these two things solve two different problems one the token is to authenticate when you will later speak to the database the bundle is a big zip file big 12 kilo bytes or so a big zig file that you just download and this answers to yash you just download it and keep it there for now we will use it in a while in a little while uh inside the bundle there are all sorts of routing instructions certificates and everything which basically uh make it they this bundle will be given to the astra to the cassandra driver in your application and it will know what to do it basically opens the zip file and knows how to reach your database in astra db because there is a system of proxies that may that so okay that will leave lead us too far away but there you have to you need some specifications of certificates and uh um proxy information and server names to reach your own individual database later to the drivers but this will all be done for you with the astro with the cassandra drive exactly yeah you don't even know you need to know which provider it is you know automatically taken care of yeah okay so okay so by this point you should have a database a token in particular client id and client secrets today we are going to use those two and the bundle zip file ready for later okay yes so i see questions that are a bit uh so someone is uh going faster than us uh don't worry d37 don't worry this error uh unfortunately it happens this is because you know python dependencies are like a jungle but don't worry everything would work i tested it today already so um then there is another question uh i'm getting error when i'm connecting git repo to your git pod that's okay so that's it sorry okay lifetime of the token the token will last forever until the day you revoke it and if you ever happen to commit your token to a public repository you probably want to revoke right because with the token everyone can you know access your database basically okay how to create the token uh there was the question uh you can create the token in several ways i'm answering with a link because i cannot go again through it now you create a token uh from the astra db interface you can click on your um organization settings token management and then you can create the token okay uh assuming most of you we you have done this part maybe yeah should we get a few thumbs up of people even if your database is in pending state you know put in a put in a few thumbs up we just want to make sure that this is done because this is kind of the as strange as it may seem you know the most complicated part of the workshop i mean maybe we there's one more but but you know once we get this through then thereafter it becomes a little bit smooth so let's see if we get a few thumbs up okay we got a few stephanie good to go with the all right we are good to go oh okay i see a lot of thumbs up so database token and bundle so we can move on and we do that with the part on ai so to load the data we don't need to load data today because it will be our request to the api that will later write the rows into the cache and into the code log so very good the token has to be created with database administrator powers that's because we want to use the fact that the object mapper is uh capable of creating the table for us so we don't want to create the table explicitly so that's an advantage we skip a few steps okay so ai let's see a bit more in detail how to train this text classifier that will be the the heart of uh the api okay so let me first uh set a a little disclaimer this section is going to take a a handful of minutes so this is absolutely not going to be a lecture on with a lot of heavy mathematics that somehow contains the whole human knowledge on machine learning so i i i want to set expectation right we have a few minutes to speak on that so that will be a very non-technical introduction to to machine learning uh focused on what we need today sorry about that by the way if you happen to recognize the guy in the picture uh write it in the chat you win some moral points for me because that's someone who is very dear to me but and i guess some of you might be good at recognizing it it's illegal to use much image recognition software yeah good done well done yeah did you recognize the person or the formulae in the blackboard yeah okay very good congratulations okay so this is not going to be one of those mathematics heavy uh lectures but we will try at least to make it possible for you to understand sentences such as this one ml lstm rnn for nlp what does this mean come on okay so let's start from the beginning what we want is some kind of machine where we put text in and we get results back no we put a text and we get something like this spam 096 m004 by the way ham is of course the opposite of spam traditionally so what is machine learning in general yeah abhishek you know that already so why are you here i'm joking okay well done good abhishek so in general machine learning is a very general term it's not even easy to actually draw the boundaries of this concept it's let's say a collection of algorithms that uh learn from data so they improve as you give data to them and the point is that you don't have to explicitly program them for that particular problems you have in mind so they are general algorithms that will learn to solve your problem without being instructed explicitly to do so let's say it's a glorified statistical inference right so it's a very complex and specialized kind of statistical inference and of course it is built on a lot of mathematics linear algebra calculus probability and statistics and what not luckily for us we don't need to have a degree in advanced mathematics for to use them today we just need to know what we are doing because the tools are now mature enough to be easily accessible as nice to use packages especially in if you think about python now uh if you ever did a simple least square regression or a logistic regression you already did machine learning so that's really there are really simple examples that you can grasp with your eyes you can almost do machine learning by hand on a piece of paper but of course the real power comes when you have a very big kind of uh problem and [Music] let's see more okay today we are going to focus on what is called supervised learning which is not the most general machine learning problem because there are also many problems that are uh grouped into the unsupervised learning label which means okay let's see let's first see what supervised learning is supervised learning means that someone uh gives so let we start with a model a model that is ready to learn but has not learned yet and so we have to choose how the model works then we give the model examples of how to associate inputs and outputs basically in in our case we give the model a list of texts and a corresponding list of whether they are spam or not spam this is the sample this is what is called the training data these are the labeled data no this is known it is a known association between input and output and we want this model to adjust itself to tune its parameters to best reproduce uh this kind of output given this input but of course it will have to i mean the model has a value when it is able to do uh to solve this problem for new input right okay so um this operation giving up a new board model input label data and having it learn from this one from from this set of points and and until the point it become it becomes able to solve the same problem a new input it is this process is called training and training essentially is tuning parameters and tuning parameters in the direction of getting the the results from the model as close as possible to the training data right that means that in in supervised learning the role of the med scientist here is of course to cho to choose the right model because there is a lot of different models and a lot of different details and fine knobs to tune and everything to choose the right model but then the the crazy scientist also has to find and prepare and polish the training data to to actually run the training now the training is something that is run once in general let's say in typical cases you run the training once then let's say this crazy scientist is satisfied with the results it says okay the model is good enough then training is done and then we have the final model the one on the right in this in this image which is then ready to be given to the series engineer right okay so what is training training again is really just uh tuning the parameters of the model to make the predictions from the model as close as possible to the labeled input that's in general how it works so this is supervised meaning that we give the model instruction on what it has to to to what problem it has to solve uh how it what what the model has to reproduce to work unsupervised learning are problems such as i give a model uh a set of points and it has to find groups in them no other instructions or i give the model a set of properties of features of i don't know a lot of features of a lot of individuals and it has to find what are the important uh features to single out to best describe the differences in this population so no there is no basically there is no training set but just the the data set to work on but today we are going to stay on supervised learning supervised learning is in turn a big family of different models they're different from each other there are a lot of them again logistic regression support vector machines a lot of them today we focus on neural networks which are very famous very well known and they are by no means the only machine learning algorithm that is there so uh neural networks well they are somehow inspired by the way our brain is supposed to work indeed neural networks are a simulated version of neurons exchanging signal somehow as in a brain so look at this uh nice image we have a lot of a lot we have some neurons in a real neural network there are many more than this we have some neurons which are again simulated in your computer of course and they are connected by arrows errors means that the signal moves from one neuron to the other in this pattern or in some pattern every neuron is very simple it will receive input by from from several other neurons so look at the diagrams on on the right every neuron will receive input from other neurons it will combine these inputs these numbers it will combine them according to some weights some factors to to multiply and then it will emit a new signal according to some internal function so basically a neuron is very simple it receives a number through different and input legs it will come sum them and it will emit a single number as output that's it that's what a neuron does but a neuron has already several parameters because there are weights there is another parameter internally um but still the neuron is pretty stupid i would say it's really simple it's working so the intelligence of a neural network comes from the sheer amount of neurons and the clever way they are connected to each other or in other words once the architecture of the network is chosen by the crazy scientist in general the actual ability to solve your problem lies in the particular choice of these numbers the numbers in purple here and there are a lot of them probably hundreds of thousands of them so learning so finding the best combination of this number is by far not a trivial task even just for a computational reason so um in a neural network basically the input is the first legs let's say in this in this diagram is on the on the far left input is encoded as signal entering the input layer then the signal propagates according to the rules of the neurons and then you will you would hopefully read your answers as signal coming out from the output layers so this is the general idea of a neural network uh what you see here in the picture is a simple kind of network so there are layers every arrow goes from one layer to the next so the signal flows clearly in a in a precise direction in this case from left to right but that's not the most general network of course indeed um what you just saw is the architecture called fit forward which is easier to reason with and it is something like lasagna because you know it you have layers and every layer is very clearly defined but there are problems that somehow require uh more general architecture indeed you can imagine having signal going back in the network or just going to the same layer somehow and this has an interesting uh consequence okay so this is a more general kind of uh relation between neurons it is more like a taliatel dish right so you don't have any more neatly distinct layers you have any general kind of arrow and okay sorry joseph i'm not telling you what time is it me too i'm hungry too okay i will quickly skip to the next slide anyway but okay the point is that as soon as you introduce loops in the signal propagation you have a very big consequence you somehow make a neuron able to remind itself later of something it knows so you have you have introduced memory of course this is just the idea but these kind of networks that are the so-called recurrent neural networks they are much better than the feed forward networks at processing sequences so a time series a text a speech a handwriting to recognize this kind of sequenced input is very much better if you treat it with these kind of architectures now there are all sorts of technical hurdles there especially in learning with such a network because advanced techniques are required and in the landscape of recurrent neural networks or rnn a particular choice uh is made so it's not the only one but historically a clever solution was invented to overcome a few technical limitations in the recurrent neural networks namely the long short term memory that someone mentioned already earlier lstm so instead of relying on the loops themselves to somehow indirectly retain memory the the lstm architecture directly encodes memory elements so it has explicit uh elements that control remind remembering and forgetting and they are directly tuned yes so lstm are great because of gates and the gates somehow bypass technical problems in training mostly and they directly control what is learned what is forgotten for the next step so they are easier they their training has the hope to work in a shorter time and shorter i mean reasonable time okay so uh of course this is very sketch sketchy you can see um okay so let's quickly spend some words on nlp uh natural language processing so being able to extract information from generic text is a very important business goal almost in all uh fields of human knowledge because you know most of human knowledge is there in unstructured form it is just in text and being able to automatically uh squeeze data out of it has a very high value so you don't just have you know spam classifiers as today but you can have auto completion automatic translation chatbot or maybe today you would call them a smart assistant or whatever sentiment analysis topic detection there's a lot of things that you can do with such architectures when you when you approach text and there is a lot of text with a lot of valuable information hidden in it okay so the point is that uh lsdm are very good at things at problems where there is a sequence to be analyzed so for example our text now this is by far not the state of the art using just an lstm so there are newer advancements i saw in the chat someone mentioned transformers we are not going to use them today we are trying to stick to something that is manageable in two hours of everything including you know bring into production but yeah there are modern uh recent advancement where to vac is was very famous at some point because it was a way to translate words in a semantically aware way so for example in this sample text today we will just translate every word to a conventional number and that's it but um where to back would be probably translating free and gratis and complementary to very similar results and then a more recent even more momentous advancement was with the transformers for example which are somehow able to give more to be context to be aware of the context when they convert words phrases sentences to numbers so a transformer would be able to look at the whole sentence when the whole surrounding of a word and it will um probably translate this free in a different way than the free as in freedom so it is context aware but anyway let's stick to today uh because there is some something more to see um okay so what we do to train first we have to um prepare the data set for training because the the network itself does not know words so we have to somehow make a sentence into numbers and to do that there are various ways i hinted that some uh just now but what we use today is a tokenizer so we will just create a tokenizer that cleans the sentence and associates every word it finds to a number so every cent every input sentence will become as a string of integers uh we will then pass it with zeros so the input the label training data will become a string of integers for the input sentences also the column ham ham spam will become a column of numbers and notice that we have we have two columns actually because we want we use the so-called one-hot encoding instead of having a single column with the various values of the classification result we prefer so the network works better if we just have every a single column for every possible result with at most a single one moving around as you see here and the tokenizer itself will be uh trained if you want so will be made to best reprodu to best cover uh up to a given number of possible words so the training the tokenizer will be not aware of the whole words in whole vocabulary but let's say the 300 most used words in in the label training data and everything else will be dropped and hopefully this will not be a big problem we also split and that's that will come important later we also split training and uh we split the input data set in two parts uh you will soon see why and i think with that we can start and train the model uh something that i didn't see is that there is a whole part preliminary to that because even just getting this cleaned data set with sentences and result is work in itself and sometimes a rather boring work at that we did that for you today so we will start with a clean the data set and for that i'll leave to drugs all right um one one thing i wanted to mention i really want to thank everybody who's on the chat and and helping each other out because i this is this is a field with a lot of terminology i think stefano has done an excellent job of trying to do as much and not more right but but there is definitely a lot more that we can cover uh but but really thanks for helping us out um you know with with all the different terminologies uh and and where you can get more information and so on this is really after all as much your workshop as ours so um thanks once again so what i'm going to do is uh you know um do i prepare the data set for training so i have to go into good part right stefano okay yeah okay so what i'm doing is yes uh once i've created the database right you know you're all uh up and running right now i load the project into get part to load the project and get part all that i do is i hit control click on get part button as you can see here so i can say open link in new tab i can open link in new window open link in new private window whatever you want you know pick whatever you like okay i'm just going to show you a quick one of open link in new window okay and essentially what it does is it it opens up this link rugs sorry i think you are still showing my screen okay sorry guys uh maybe you can show the git button but uh maybe i'll paste the link anyway so let me go back uh so so if you go back to the git pod link um what you're gonna do is you're gonna control click right and you can open link in new tab or you open link in the new window or you can open link in the new private window whatever works for you um you know usually i go with open link in new windows so that you know i have get part in another window but i have running it in a new tab it will ask you for some of the credentials you can use git github um and and get in right you know i'm not going to show you all that but essentially once you do all that you're going to get a window that looks something like this and and if you have any trouble um you know um opening this what you can do is you can again you know copy the link okay and you can put it in explicitly yourself okay so so if you put it in like this basically what it is is it's getpod.io and pound as you can see here the github link okay workshop um area is an api and so on okay so don't don't need to worry about any of that all that you need to do is like i said you know hit uh control and um you know the right um right most button right and you can open the new tab open link in your window and so on and so forth okay uh so once you open this you will you will see something um you know which is what we call as a git pod window okay and you will see here um essentially you have all the um you know the the uh different artifacts that are required to run the workshop we actually have done the install um and all of this is done for you automatically you know we have something called a git party ammo which essentially does all this uh um you know installs for you uh and and basically you'll be dropped into something um that looks like this okay you can you can have multiple shell windows as they refer to uh but but essentially it'd be um dropped into something like this okay and uh let me clear this okay and uh if i just do a git remote minus v okay this basically tells me what um uh you know um repo remote repository i'm cloning here okay so if there are some changes i can get pull and all that these are all git commands that you know you don't need to worry too much about it um but but you know if you if you want to use this as a defect or editor you you can do that as well uh it it is visual studio it's visual studio running in the cloud um you know and and you know we have done workshops where we show how we can do debugging profiling with visual studio you can do finding files just like any other editor nothing nothing to install locally but everything is available on the cloud okay so i've said enough of that okay just one sorry sorry i have to interrupt you a few of you are reporting um versioning errors between tensorflow numpy and six yes uh we i've seen the same and uh you should be able to ignore them because uh these i tested you see the errors but you know you know how python is you start having more than two packages in a python requirement files and you will see these errors but somehow in many cases everything works out and today is going to be the case so trust ignore these errors and let's go absolutely yeah yes i i didn't show any of that uh you know i mean i uh i i'm from the java side of the world and when you bring this up you know maven essentially brings the entire world in here right and and you might see something a lot of things coming in uh ignore them for now if it doesn't work then you can always go back and fix it but but i think you should be uh good to go at this point so so how do i i know that training takes a long time so i would rather get you guys um started on the training um so to be able to do that um i need to be able to um does the training require me to download the bundle or uh i don't think so right yeah no you you can start with the preparedness section okay so let's start with the prepared data sets okay so again basically what i do is i follow the steps right i have i open the git part right essentially i think we can keep inspecting the data set so we go to the important part so there is it is available as a jupiter notebook as you can see here too we are not going to cover any of that because we just don't have the time today okay so we're gonna yeah can we jump straight into the train model uh now we have to prepare the data so go go go oh no no no no earlier sorry a bit earlier yeah here so there is a step to prepare the data set which is basically uh what yeah so here you see the astro man here yeah so the astro man will tell you what what exactly to do next right so i go here the key steps and essentially what i do is i i cut and paste from there okay um first time around it might ask you is it allowed and all that you know just say yes okay and then i'm i'm preparing the data set now okay okay so basically yes uh if you are interested in further steps and further insight please go have a look at the readme these steps does what we saw so far so it makes the sentences into a big block of numbers it prepares and saves the tokenizer and so on you will also see a few things printed just for you to later inspect and see what is going on these steps is also available as a jupiter notebook so if you want you can alternatively run it as a notebook so again go looking into the readme and you will find all uh details you need yeah so this jupyter notebook can be accessible through uh git part as well so there are there you know will not get into all those details because there are different combinations there so i want to get you all eagerly waiting to train the model so i'm going to get into it uh right now because that's the heart of it and it takes quite a bit of time so what i will do is i will run the command and again all that i'm doing is taking these commands right i'm copying it and i'm putting it in what we refer to as the terminal window okay um on git power okay so let me clear this so this is the output from the previous command and i just do the python train model.pvr okay so i'm i'm running the train model and if you want you can go check out what exactly this is doing right um you can you can look at uh the uh the python file and and see what this is doing uh you know essentially it's importing a bunch of different um you know modules right and then uh it it basically does the fitting and the training that uh you know stefano was alluding to and and he also has a way in which you can kind of get a little bit more details by uncommenting some of these lines um so you can try those and and try it yourself but what you're gonna do is you're gonna do this python trainmodel.pr the train model you know run this and once you have this up and running just give us a few thumbs up because this takes like a good maybe anywhere from 7 to 14 minutes right we have not done this with you know so many people um so so it might take a little bit longer um or it probably doesn't really because you know this might all be distributed in you know different regions but but once you have started the training give us a thumbs up and if you're stuck let us know as well and you can see how we can unblock you okay okay i see a lot of a lot of training started that's great you probably noticed it is not uh instantaneous thing indeed uh i'm going to quickly go yeah you can see here mine is running some details of the training that's okay take a moment to notice the output and again if you want to see more uh all scripts and notebook are there for you to inspect better but i'm sure we now make a better use of our time if we switch to yes thank you to the slides so okay so training is going very good um if you look into the training script train model you will see that there is a part where the network is created so the network structure is created in code and this is the relevant snippet of code basically what these lines do is they initialize uh network as a stack of layers so basically something similar to a feed-forward network and then layer after layer the network is created with a layer that basically is the input layer then a drop-out layer that is what implements the dropout what is dropout dropout is during training you switch parts of the network off at random just to avoid you know the the whole knowledge of the network being concentrated in a single part a single neuron possibly and because that would be a fragile architecture let's say uh if you if you switch parts of the network off and off at random you are sure that the knowledge the the skill of the network the skill of the model is evenly spread somehow which means that it will be uh more resilient to new inputs more or less then you add the lstm layer which is recurrent because it has loops but it is recurrent within the layer so in this architecture it is still a single layer indeed you see this gray arrow that tells us that input input information flows layer through layer until the final point and the final the final layer is just uh it's just the layer that takes the information from the lstm and makes it into a two dimensional a two signal output basically it will be spam or not spam numbers okay so this is of course very schematic but i saw a question how do we alter the architecture of the network well you you might want to play with this part of code and rerun the training okay so a few more words on the training while it is running we already saw that training schematically means we tune the parameters so that the predictions are very close to the label data right which means that we need to somehow find a way to measure how close the predictions are to the label data and uh you see this blue function in the in the in the sketch here the function that we are trying to walk to the bottom of the valley this is uh exactly that so this is a mathematical way to define how close the results from the train from the model are uh to the real thing to the training to the label set and this is what is called the loss function or in some cases cost function and well there are a few choices but in particular for the case of a categories to choose from so spam not spam for example we use the so-called categorical cross-entropy which comes from information theory you can think of it as the categorical version of a least square objective function sort of but you see on on the horizontal axis there is these uh parameters uh slider you can imagine moving these until and moving this progressively until you reach the bottom of the valley and then it you you have one uh the reality is that you don't have a single parameter to tune and you don't have two parameters as in this small uh sketch here on the right you have probably short of 300 000 parameters and you have to move somehow all of them in order to make the model match as much as possible the labels and that's mathematically speaking is a mess right that's why there are specific algorithms that make it possible to find a minimum of a function in such a high dimensional space basically because that's what the problem is the the typical algorithm that makes this work is the stochastic gradient descent so gradient descent means more or less you look around yourself in a point you look where the slope is the highest and you do one you walk a bit in this direction then you repeat you look around and you see oh this is the steepest slope i walk here and but this is in it's not in two dimensions like you would walk in mountain this is in 300 000 dimensions so that's not not easy to make this calculation feasible in a short time short time there is also a stochastic component so instead of using all of the input data set all the time we do a random extractions of some points we are using stochastic gradient descent dinesh yes um so instead of using the full input data set every time for evaluations we use a random selection of these inputs which makes everything works a bit faster but that has an interesting consequence namely that my training will be different from your training right because of slightly different choices again the results will probably match reasonably so my what this spam for me will spam for you but not exactly down to the last digit so my model is not exactly your model uh that being said my model will always give the same answer for the same question and yours as well i see a question about global minima yes there is in principle the possibility of being trapped into you know local minima usually given the shape of these machine learning problems that's not a very common occurrence so more or less you have a half guarantee that you will eventually reach or at least go in the direction of the right of the correct global minimum okay so i will skip back propagation and drop out propout we already saw back propagation is essentially the chain rule of calculus applied to neural networks becomes a powerful algorithm to to adjust the changes in the weights uh in a in a coordinated way but i can't elaborate more on that for time reasons um so some of you wrote in the chat about uh books and yes so uh well basically the training proceeds through epochs which are more or less sweeps over the complete training set more or less uh we decide to do five just because uh in in many cases when you don't know yet what you're going to encounter you might um interactively decide whether to go forward or not today we are going to make it easier and we stop at five epochs because this is empirically work working uh for this input okay so um one thing that we did and i also showed the relevant line of code we take you remember we take the input label set and we split it into two parts the training set and a smaller test set why do we do that well we do that because we actually do the training giving only the train part as input and periodically we validate the how the model works with the test set independently so the important thing is that the test set is not used in training is just used to probe in an independent with an independent set of data to probe how the model is working indeed in the output you probably see uh two kinds of values being printed at each epoch you see accuracy and validation accuracy you see loss and validation loss and they should more or less go the same route so they should both uh follow the same trend if they don't like in this inset here then you have a problem because you have overfitting what does it mean basically it means that your network is not learning to solve your problem anymore it is just learning to mimic that very set of lines you give in training and then with a independent test set you you bring this in in evidence and then it means that you have to stop before this takes over so the problem of overfitting is this is a way to keep that under control okay um i think we could do a few slides on the api part and then we go to the final uh part of the practice so that your training will still uh probably still running we will probably have it finished by then so let's move to part five bring the api so bring the model to production with api well here there is not much to say so not many slides at least because i i would like the code to speak for itself and there will be time to just see a few points in the code and most of it will be in the readme i think so there is a extensive explanation of many things in the code okay so we finally let's say we finish the training okay so there's a question where would you recommend we delve into specifics if you if you look into the readme there are a few more uh paragraphs on the details of the first api implementation and how the api is structured and every so most of them will have links to the relevant documentation so maybe that might be a good starting point that and inspecting the code and maybe experimenting with that i want to say one thing the first api documentation is famous for being one of the best documentation of python packages ever so it will it is very it is a pleasure to read i mean uh it's very good so it is um it brings you by hand through all of it so it's i suggest it's a suggested reading let's say okay so back to back to this sketch we have at the end of training we have our mad scientist finally ready so the model is ready so the model is wrapped into a neat black box and it's given to the engineer who loves api and has already in mind the full architecture that we know already now in the architecture from the api point of view the the model the classifier is a black box and we respect that and we put this box in in in the sketch so now it's a matter of how to structure the code the code which is ordinary python code and here you see the sketch of the modules at play and their various dependencies basically main is where the api is create the api object the first api object is created defined and where the roots are defined so that's the main point uh this is the module that we would give uvicorn when we start the api then there is a config which is a simple module that is able to fetch configuration from a dot m file there is a schema module that defines objects and data types so complex data types are defined there and there is a very nice nice package called pydentic that assists us in data validation so um request bodies and response types are validated in their schema which is good and by the way pydentic plays very well with fast api then we have uh the database access part which okay it's rather simple if you want to inspect there are functions to write and read data from the tables there is the definition of the models you remember these uh python classes that abstract over the the rows in the table and there is a module that creates the database connection using this conf the connection secrets like bundle and and the token secrets uh the last point and you see here in with the black box in in the in the in the balloon is the ai model that's a class that wraps the model itself so we have the the trained model will be saved as a bunch of files uh tokenizer and so on and the weights which is a big file with a few megabytes file with all of the numbers for these network parameters that's a file what you do in python is you load it and you you can you load it with a tensorflow specific functions to load a network from a from a stored file and then you can use the predict method on it but there is a bit of pre-processing because what the api receives is a piece of text and it has to be made into numbers you remember to be later given to the network to extract the results spam ham so what the network actually eats as input is numbers so we don't want to do to write the logic for this pre-processing of input text more than once so we write uh so we wrote for you a class that abstracts this uh this um text pre-processing into this ai model.pi which is a thin wrapper around the model and it makes it possible so it offers an easier interface to users or or more than users to the main application the main api um this model this model uh class you might want to inspect it because it's by no means specific to uh text spam classification it is general and reusable for any text classification problem basically so you might want to really use this um i think that's it so there are a few nice features of fast api or the way it is used so um how to save the train model this is done for you by the end of the training script you probably want to look at it it's very simple there are a few methods saved offered by a tensorflow so you train the tokenizer as it is and you train and you save the the network weights as they are with uh specific methods offered by tensorflow so it's very easy there are actually various formats but today we stick to the hdf5 format but that's in detail um okay so there are a few nice things in fast api uh caching you will see how it works let me just quickly mention two things one is that if you take the care of documenting of commenting your functions and adding a few properties to the api you will get for free a well done a well-made api documentation that you can directly expose and it will be interactive it will make it possible to issue requests for testing and so on so the swagger api which is a standard no pay an open api standard so this is all done for you by fast api um another cool thing is that you can have this uh transfer chunked so you can have a streaming response and fast api very easily let's say you have a a very big input from the database so a very big call log from the database and you want to return it to the caller you might do you might do it in a streaming way with and fast api has native support for that but okay all of these is explained in more detail in the readme so i think with that we might go to the file to the last part of the hands-on and assuming the model is trained and saved it's time to configure the api and start it and do a couple of requests drugs to you all right let me see if my training is done uh it's still working on apoc 4. um so so it's it's taking a little bit longer but but uh why don't i um you know kind of walk through the instructions that that way you know let's assume that it's whenever it's done uh we can we can do this um you know essentially okay if you if you prefer you can also set there is a setting in the dot m that makes it uh possible to mock the model if you want but why don't why don't we start by setting up the secrets yeah i think yeah so that'll be useful it's probably going to be ready okay so let's do this um secrets that you will need and remember we talked about kind of downloading the zip file which seems like ages ago right but uh but essentially what we are doing is we are downloading the zip file locally and then moving it into git power okay and and all of this again is explained in the instructions um so so what you're going to do is to expose the api uh we need to be able to configure the dot env and the dbconnect bundle right so so essentially what we do is locate the file on your computer whatever finder explorer whatever and drag and drop the bundle into the gitpod explorer window okay so i'm going to go back to my git pod explorer window i've already done this before but i'm going to show it again okay so i'm going to go to my finder window okay there's my finder window right and i'm going to go back okay so i know what what's going on here um yeah so let me take this out of full screen okay and now locate the finder window find the secureconnectworkshops.zip which is the um you know down the connect bundle that you downloaded earlier and drag it and drop it here this is the easiest way of doing this okay there are some some other ways of doing this but this is what we recommend here and you can see here you know the entire um thing got highlighted in blue right um and if you drop it here you know of course this is say you know do you want to replace it because i already have it i'm just going to cancel here but you can say uh you know it probably won't ask you uh if you have not downloaded it so the way to verify that you have done this right is just go back into your again you know just all that i do is cut from here and paste here make it as easy as possible for it okay you will see here that yeah there is a secureconnectworkshops.zip that your copy and it's about 12 000 um bytes on right um obviously i downloaded it like a week before when i was preparing here but you should see that date to be today if you if you just downloaded it okay um did i miss anything and and you know the next thing that i want to do is copy this env.sample into dot env okay so i've done all this before but i'll kind of walk you through that so here's my dot env dot sample okay so i can do more and you will see what it is you know it has a whole bunch of stuff in there right you know i have to update my key space my db bundle path my client id and my client secret okay that those are the ones that i need okay uh let me open it here which will open.env.sample okay so we have you know prompts for you to add these database access parameters the key space is already populated for you the bundle path is already populated for you uh all that you need to do is update the client id and the client secret to do that again follow the steps copy the en v.sample cp.env.sample.env okay and just say gpopen.env um so what i'll do is i'll do exactly the same okay which is copy right and assuming i've done that then what i can do is i can just say open the dot env okay i've already made this changes here so um you know if i do the open env you can you can see all the information is in there but essentially what i did was i went back to where i had it as a you know remember as a spreadsheet uh or where i put it you know and then i copied the token um the secret uh and that's pretty much it right you know i needed to do the client id uh and the client secret and and okay um so so this will help uh this will actually um you know enable us to connect to the cassandra database right uh and once i have this running and let me see if my my training is complete and you'll see here i'm basically flipping between these different two tabs okay you'll see that my training just completed right it took a while but it did complete okay and what i'll do is i'll skip the step where it talks about kind of the minimal api the minimal api you can see um you know you can kind of walk through this there is a miniman dot main.api okay and it has different endpoints like uh the endpoint of slash the endpoint of slash prediction and the endpoint of slash uh predictions okay uh with s in plural right and then you have the main api which really is the main api and this has a little bit more than what what was there before it also uses uh you know a way to tokenize um i mean to authenticate the to the api um so so you know it essentially asks you to provide you provide a token and only after you're authenticated you can do um you know uh invoke gain points there are also some endpoints that are added here like for example slash recent log um and and i think stefano talked about this uh you can play around again with this code unfortunately we don't have too much time to kind of dissect the code but but all of this is available in your gitpod window if you want to play with this uh you can kind of look at the ai model you know there are different python um you know comma i mean python programs here um so here's the dbio uh so all of this you know you can kind of take a look at this uh and and you know play around with this um it's available for you so the next step is kind of getting the api so like i said i'm going to ignore the minimal api and go straight into the full api okay so to use this um or to be able to provide this we use uh something called as ubicon and again when stefano talked about the technology stack um he talked about this all that i need to do is let's see if this works is again do a cut and paste right i just run this and what this does is it it invokes the api main you know which is right here right and and and essentially involves the program right so so let me start this off uses the training you know the model you know does all that um you know and i got something wrong here let me see what went wrong here you know you know what's a live demo without something going wrong right did i miss anything here oh should i go into episode did you set the 10th oh maybe that's what i did i forgot uh that's probably thank you what happens if you skip the steps right it doesn't yeah well the time is essential unfortunately you have to tell the api house to how to connect the database it wants to speak to the database but maybe you can just run the minimal api and we do without database yeah just give me a second so if you want to just copy the attempt that's it let's see if then if if i'm missing something else here it's i think i did that um i okay so let's run this okay so we can start the minimum let me start the full api let me let me try that fast right uh okay so this is not it okay um no no you have to cd dot dot yes all right so let's try this this is what okay now it should work if you put the time that should work okay i'm not sure so no no okay you you have uh you can can you show my your your tamp i think it it is missing a last line maybe this is a yes can you open the time sample and copy the last line over to the time i think i think you you have a git pod that is you created it oh maybe a few comments by me thank you i should have so much classes equal to zero yes if you add these to the temp it will perfect presumably okay let's try that debugging on the floor yeah for all of you uvicorn should run because uh you created the the github the gitpod environment today but rugs of course was tested earlier and so the temp which is outside which isn't get ignored it was not updated with the latest uh okay now the moment of truth uh no need to source by the way yeah you see a lot of things happen yeah and i still i'm feeling there yeah uh okay you know what let's you also have your old the the table is old right so in the interest of time do you want to take over and do the good part um part of it maybe so give me time to make it work to make it start maybe so yes it will start in one minute okay okay so these are a bit of last minute points the the point is that in the last days we've been changing a bit of the data model and now rugs rugs's table is not exactly matching um the schema so the driver complains and it doesn't they're destroying the table as they are so that's the point um uh okay i'm showing you mind i think it is starting okay so perfect you see a lot of output so what happens during startup is two things the model is loaded by the api code the model is loaded and maybe i can try to make everything a bit easier to read yeah the model is going to say maybe here in this part so this is where we initialize the api object and also something that will happen only once is that we will um we will load the model in these global objects spam classifier which is then uh this is an instance of the ai model reusable class okay uh at the same time also in initialization time we also prepare the database object so that the table is in sync with the object definition and we are ready to just read and write cache items and so forth from the database so uh there are various ways to test this api which is as far as we know is running the uh let me get rid of this the easy way would be you know to so the hardcore way maybe would be to curl like i'm doing here is just i'm just asking an um slash endpoint which tells me a few basic information including my own identifier no big deal but i might want to try and do a bit more uh this is you know i might want to do some more cool things so for example let's say i want to do a request to my api like this why not so i want to there is an endpoint for multiple text with these slash predictions let me show you how you do that with command line curl yes so this is it you see it worked what happens is that we send a request with the body containing those two sentences to classify and the output tells me that click to win a free car is spam with 87 percent confidence and i like this end point is ham with 95 percent confidence and that's very good i'm apologize to those uh saying they have errors but uh we are we will be reached on this chord and please uh have a closer look at the readme instructions um for that because i think we are a bit late on time i just want to show you one thing and then we will close for today and again we will uh accept and discuss a lot more in in discord if you want but issuing curl commands is not the only way because as i quickly mentioned uh as i quickly mentioned you can also the fast api directly offers an interface a swagger api so a swagger interface uh conforming to the open api specification which means that for free by running the api you will also get this slash docs endpoint that is a need a new easy interface to try endpoints besides watching besides checking the documentation you see every comment every doc string in my endpoint function is and ends up here and every schema definition is uh used by through through pydentic is used to create a meaningful documentation you see for example let's see the predictions end point here in the maybe i make it this bigger but the predictions and point i can also so it tells me a bit of uh details for so documentation for the endpoint i also um it also tells me the schema that i have to use when i pass a body to this request and i can also try this endpoint out here live within the documentation the documentation let me just click execute and magically here is my output you see within the documentation is ham yes for sure is ham and that's just something i can do here so it's good for debugging for you know exposing the api documentation i just want to show you very quickly that if you repeat this call you will notice that the first sentence now this is the second time i call this and it is coming from the cache well this one the ddd is coming not from the cache so the model has been run only on the second sentence here and i can play with these and have a look at the recent log which i can run like this and i will know the history of my calls so within yes for sure within ddd this is exactly the log of the calls and this is also coming from the database and being served to me by the api all of these in a production level api that exposes the model and it also offers this neat documentation basically generated by looking at dog strings throughout my code and a few other small things okay so as as i say that there is a lot more to be explored in um in the readme of course this was barely scratching the surface and getting you started with the two phases of both say training your first classifier model and making it into a real working api so so stefano i know we have much more to do but uh yeah yeah i know we're already beyond but but i just wanted to tell you that while you were you know gladly stepping in for me i was able to debug the problem you know essentially what the right problem with the schema so i dropped the tables so you may have run into the same issue as well so if you drop the tables it'll automatically recreate it for you uh and and now i am essentially in the same you know i'm able to run the api and and you know stefano uh talked about how you can kind of walk through um you know these different uh um you know swagger calls right uh and i basically did the same thing as well uh i executed this so so if you're running into trouble you know maybe what you can do is you can go into sql um you know and uh essentially what i did yeah here was i robbed these two tables you know probably that's not relevant to those of our attendees who started today because that that com your problem comes from having created the tables right earlier if any of you are done with this you may have run into that but but yes um you know so so let's i know that we are already way past time so so stefano i will hand it back to you just give me a second okay so everyone who can't run the api like levitian here uh of course for time reasons we beg you to reach us on discord and we will be happy to help you and uh troubleshoot your execution and go through the steps in the readme with more time and attention okay so let me close we might have uh we just have a few final points one is the quiz so those of you who endured and are still with us are awarded a chance to win prizes so so i'm gonna start with music and if it's too loud let me know um so again we invite you to join us on mendy again so in the meantime for those who have to leave this is the link to join us on discord in the meantime i hope many of you are joining us on mendy which also the link to so mandy.com and then you enter the code that you see on screen um so now i hope we've been showing you everything you need to be able to answer the questions this time the questions are on what you learned today of course and there are prizes for the first one two and three in the in the leaderboard and remember that you have not only to answer uh correct but you also have to answer it fast and now we start with the quiz so please join us here to menti i think we can start gathering you to join so i glad to see i'm glad to see that uh most of you in the chat managed to have everything working uh if you didn't you probably just have to go slowly through the instructions because i i appreciate with we had to rush a bit through here there was indeed a lot of stuff okay so i think we can start and there are six questions and get ready flex your fingers and be ready to answer correct and fast today we saw an example of image recognition ai supervised learning random forest unsupervised learning or a ballet by tchaikovsky remember to answer on your phone don't forget to check it out otherwise your answer is lost so supervised learning very good but led by tchaikovsky i wish oh you wish so let's see let's see after this first question how is the leaderboard and pavan is leading but there is still quite some ground to run yeah anybody husband white giant anybody you know could could just pop up there uh again you know just as a fast and that's correct yeah siva sorry but your answers on youtube will not be counted because you should be on mendy and if you miss the code uh maybe it's a bit too late now sorry okay oh next time question number two um the text classifier model is trained within the api or is a fit forward neural network or needs no training it is designed to have memory or i cannot tell you it's classified boy all of them look like it's possible carefully yeah absolutely especially the last one is designed to have memory yeah it looks a bit like a fit forward but there is an lstm layer so it is indeed these loops in the signal that uh make the trick and may give it memory so yes it is designed to have memory and it is not trained within the api code but rather before that remember the crazy scientist does that and not the engineer stefano you really managed to you know um stump a lot of the natural intelligence there right okay okay so uh chandra is the fastest but now kriti is and first position and very congratulations to all of you who are not fooled by the way we phrase the questions and get ready for question number three to train the model we called the train method we call the fit method we call the optimize method we call the predict method or we set the x train and x test model properties or we have to write the full training algorithm ourselves uh you know maybe rugs we didn't pay too much yeah let's see let's see if this works yeah yeah we called the fitness that's kind of showing me here all right that was a bit hard maybe some of you uh had a look at the code and this is your reward you know let's see what happens to the leaderboard we can imagine some changes no but most of you managed to answer correctly and item jumps to first position but the pretty follows very short ah brandon i'm sorry you see that okay number four three more right so we still got four five and six yeah but there is always next workshop to to play again question number four we use a database for called keras or actually we don't use the database or maybe it's called astra db it is a middle layer between the api and the classifier or it is built on cassandra um looks like it's possible looks like yeah so almost everyone got this right so database is called and it is built on cassandra so congratulations we got it wrong that's cool yeah the database part and we are proud of it was given enough time to make it clear very good so adam stays in first position juliana and kriti second and third okay still more left okay question number five answer fast to get more points so using the cassandra drivers object mapper you can forget about the table structure or there is not even a table involved in any sense or maybe still a proper data model must be chosen or using the object mapper is an alternative to the nlp classifier tricky tricky tricky looks like i can yeah [Music] uh okay that was fast i know a proper data model must be chosen so we say that yes you can forget about tables in reading and writing but still when you plan the objects you have to think about data model otherwise your performance will be possibly terrible and probably not very optimal so this shattered a bit the leaderboard but let's see uh adam and the ogona cemento and chandu jump to the first three positions totally overall yeah i like to put her tough questions otherwise where's the fun question number six okay so what are notable features of fast api streaming responses request body validation mostly scriptable in kabul or cool support for open api and docs or maybe it has native support for golden dolphin we saw many of those and yeah so it is not scriptable in kabul as far as i know and as for golden dolphin i want to know what this is because it's a name i made up and i made sure there is no relevant software product with that name so i really don't know what golden dolphin is sorry that was a bit mean from my side but still that's the way it is okay so leaderboard and these are the winners right uh so last surprises adam ron s and chandu first second and third position congratulations to you and to everyone for attending congratulations and thank you for staying with us until now please the first second and third position please take a screenshot of your winning mentee score your winning screen with the mentee take a screenshot now because later you will be required to send this screenshot by email as uh proof to these address that you see in a second in the chat and you will be able to claim your swag to everyone in any position in the quiz congratulations because you are walking home with i hope more knowledge and more experience and you will be probably ready to play by yourself now the road is wide and uh actually there are many roads to follow so the fun there's a lot to learn and uh i will leave the mentee open just to collect a bit of feedback free form feedback what did you like what should we improve just to you know tune better the next workshops and in the meantime while this wants to close with just a few slides and uh thank you for your patience so winners please send the screenshots to this address you saw already in the [Music] in the chat but it's also here in the slide okay so there are we run a workshop every week so next week is going to be an e-commerce application which is part of uh uh you can't get the screenshot anymore yes i moved forward after a little while but ron you probably write an email to gary anyway and tell us who you were in this quiz okay so um we run workshops every week so these are the next uh episodes and please join us because there is always a lot to learn and special announcement two days ago a long term hackathon started a build-a-tone which is lasting a few months so there is absolutely still time to oh we missed the screen too many crashed so okay i will so those of you who had problems with mentee send an email to gary and let's see if there is a way to secure your identity maybe you might want to you might want to add a feedback with your email address in your in your in the current mentee if you manage so the link to the next workshop is here should be here if i remember correctly there should be a link to see all of our upcoming calendar uh so there is a unhackathon and again there should be uh yes so uh in the youtube chat you see a link to getting to get update up to date to our uh future workshops and there will also soon be a link to this hackathon it is there is real money in prices so a few hundred a few thousand dollars worth of prices so please consider joining us so it's here the link is in the youtube chat it's going to be fun there are three different challenges one per month and you can do whatever challenge you want uh form a team you can come with your team ready or not and it will be the only constraint is you will use astrodbs database which you know after today right so no big deal um yes this video will be on youtube for future viewing sure as we said already please please please join us on discord so we can carry the discussion forward because that's a chat that is not disappearing when this video is over which is very soon as you know of course we ask you to to click the thumbs up and maybe to subscribe to our channel because we are we push out content every week and if you like what we did today there's going to be a lot more so that's it now the last important point is about homework now before we say goodbye homework in the read me uh in the read me in the repository there are there is a full explanation of the homework that you have to hand in to get your badge it's nothing complicated there is a form for submitting yes you see here in the chat you should go to this link the homework the submission form is a few theory questions nothing that was not covered today followed by a small assignment a small lab where you have to code to extend the api and show as proof that you made it work with this extension after which you will submit the homework you will click submit we will grade it and you will be awarded a badge so that's it as far as the homework is concerned and i think that's more or less all right what do you think uh no i think we got pretty much everything uh again i know that we are a little bit beyond uh but uh hopefully this was uh really useful i know we barely scratched on the surface of ai ml and and and all that but but hopefully it gave you a a feel for how you can do the ml ops which was really the goal for today and you were able to build an api and and and kind of connect all the dots together um that's it yeah i appreciate you uh staying with us until now and sorry for being a bit late i hope it will it it has been time well spent and with that i think we can tell you goodbye and thank you and thank you rugs thanks everyone bye great guys take care see you next time bye bye and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats no problem i i didn't think of that myself so no big deal i think you should you",
