    "text": "[Music] welcome to ds310 i'm nick panahee and this is datastax enterprise search our learning objectives for this course are outlined as such we'll start with explaining and understanding the datastax enterprise search architecture we'll show examples of executing search queries using cql we'll touch on how to define search schemas for indexing and how to perform full text search and queries we'll also discuss customizing your text search by using different analyzers and even implement other popular search functionality like faceted search and geospatial search dc search is powered by apache solar which is built on top of apache lucene leucine is a de facto information retrieval library used by other search technologies search functionality is built on top of dse's core database which is the best distribution of apache cassandra available this integration provides distributed multi-data center and hybrid multi-cloud capabilities for your search where your data is always on and available dec search integrates and improves on industry-leading search functionality for our use cases we'll be working off the killer video demo to highlight search functionality taking a look at the domain model for this use case here we have a table with a very simple primary key it just consists of one field as we know this will limit our ability to query data with pure cql",
