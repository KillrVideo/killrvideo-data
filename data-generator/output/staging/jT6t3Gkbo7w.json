    "text": "hello everyone that's Alex polish knife and we are an accelerate huge conference for Apache Cassandra and all the related technologies and I have a very special guest today Jack watch on him he works for a cassandra community and data stacks for almost ten years I believe yeah yeah from the very very beginning tell us how it started for you from data stacks this is the distributed data show well let's see I was working in investment banking back during the whole you know what mortgage crisis and I have my first kid and you know I was doing side stuff like for fun and you know I was working on this side project now I was like I need a distributed database and I started looking around and I was like Oh Facebook just did this Cassandra thing and I looked into it and it was my first Java project I ever looked at but I was like and you know it took a few months to wrap my head around but then once I got a hang of it I started you know contributing to it and then a few years later or I guess a year later or so Jonathan Ellis who's the co-founder here called me up and it was like hey we're starting a company you want to come come work full-time on Cassandra and I was like sure so I begged my wife and your antennas like yeah great and what do work right now guys well I have transitioned slightly from coding full-time to slightly managing a small portion of the core team so my teams six people of the core Cassandra team on that focuses on the GIC projects I'm on the PMC of the Apache project I'm also on the PMC of Apache thrift and Apache aero though I haven't really done much with that recently with you know everything has been going on but overall you know I like open source I like data stacks I like distributed systems right now I believe you are mostly in the big note thing yes what's bad well we're working on something new to kind of help drive down the total cost of ownership for DSC most times when you are in a company and you ask for you know I'm going to run a big distributed database IT or the cloud team will say well here's our big distributed database instance which is like it has you know 20 terabytes of disk wow 6864 CPUs but unfortunately Cassandra is more built for you know 16 to 32 cores with like one terabyte it's more built for like blade technology and so we've been trying to modify it to you know to move to the real dick dick to get rid of the bottlenecks that keep it from working well on you know dense machines I see that's the question people asking all the time what's the recommended suggested the data size per node and that's usually we say one terabyte I believe yep though I've heard some guys prefer to stick to two terabytes per node sure that's also works but when you say about Dino do you mean like big note yes and 20 yeah we're trying to it's not gonna happen all in one shot but the idea is to remove the parts of these system which make it hard to improve your mean time to recovery on large dense nodes so there's three sort of areas to it one is streaming the the streaming performance is is currently CPU bound hmm because what happens is if you bootstrap a new node and it is going to take on ten every bite sum of data what ends up happening is it sort of works like a giant Network flush operation yeah which means it has to you know deserialize all of the data that's going to that node yeah off of disk from from the surrounding nodes and stream it over to to the new node which then writes brand new SS tables it ends up being a a very expensive slow operation I see also trying to move more towards a zero copy in all cases oh yeah so that that the bottleneck becomes the network speed okay and you know what's interesting I believe you guys doing work right on time because I wrote recently an article for a German IT administrator magazine and did some researches because of that there are some estimations some research is done what's now approximately in the amount of data at the planet last year was 33 zettabytes but to a year 2025 it's going to be approximately 175 zettabytes guys we do need big nodes as soon as possible too much data yeah Wow we need more kittens we need more exhausts yeah digital exhaust okay yeah so so there's three parts to it one is streaming one is a compaction right imp right amplification and one is the repair process so those are kind of the three main areas that we're focused on on the DSC side on the open source side there's also been a lot of work that's going into a Cassandra 4-0 which which addresses yeah absolutely well upcoming release for Cassandra 4 of course we are just waiting for it for too long I will ask you about your some features going in but now actually you work in a team of seven people altogether of whom and most of you guys are not in my office now there's there's actually very there's no engineering office for the server team the larger server team is about sixty people and our sort of core Cassandra team is about twenty okay yeah so we work there's people in South Africa and Brazil Hong Kong you know France Bulgaria Germany so yeah it's it's pretty much a very distributed culture and there's a lot of pluses and minuses to that but obviously I would say coming from an open-source background there very much fits the culture of opens yeah yeah that's about culture and actually I can say what part of development relations team we work in a distributed team over overall most of our guys in the United States me and Cedric in Europe timezone issue guys but you have even more because you spread it even more yeah how do you handle that well I think for the most part all of our but all of our communications is asynchronous for the most money so we primarily probably primarily rely on chat and JIRA and you know email it's funny you know coming from the Apache foundation sort of way of working it's it's it's it's very much the same when you go to work on a open source project you know you don't all get get to two together and come up with a you know scrum for you know this next next checkpoint um you are you basically just going and you're like hey this looks like a bug that I would like to work on and I'm just gonna start working on it yep so it's very much a empowering environment there's a lot of autonomy I'd say we have had cases where you know if someone's come from a very structured work mmm-hmm environment and then they get thrown into you know our environment which is very unstructured it can be very challenging so it takes a balance of you know engineering abilities plus some some sort of just grit yeah and and being able to to not be afraid to ask questions yeah or to look stupid I look stupid all the time one of the that's one of the important things well actually i with my experience I believe you can afford to run the distributed team like that only if you have a really good team really a team of great developers what's your team can you say word about them well yeah I mean in terms of great developers I'd say most of the people on the team would say they're probably the worst person on the team because because everyone brings to the table a a a strong cultural and diverse perspective so it's always amazing to see someone you know who's a PhD in math no we reviewing someone who you know got C's in college it's like you know you kind of have to you kinda have to work with people who kind of offset your weaknesses and working in a large distributed team you end up getting together this sort of just random group of people who all come from their own perspective and and have their own strengths and weaknesses so let's say it's a massive benefit of this model yeah yeah I mean in general that's one of the best things in the distributed work remote work you can hire people all over the world best of the best not limited to any country or city like a lot of company does question when you are about to hire a person hire someone some new developer for example what's the most important things for you like what's should be good sites or not acceptable bad sites what's for a rotten tree only yeah I would say you know the the things that I try to look for someone who's a self self learner you know someone who's always trying to learn more someone who's not afraid to to ask questions and is willing to open willing to talk openly about their challenges that they've had on projects that that that they've worked on a lot of times there's you know everyone has impostor syndrome but if you start in a remote culture where you don't want to look bad in front of your peers it's sort of a recipe for for for failure so trying to trying to find people who you try to get a sense of whether or not they will feel some kind of psychological safety we really try to bring that piece of it to our team so that it's okay for people to you know ask dumb questions I try to ask the dumb question if I think you know everyone's thinking of you know well how is this gonna work and no one wants to ask the question I'll just be like how's this gonna work it has to don't wear so I so I would say you know obviously there's a technical side of it you know they have to be able to you know write write code well think think outside of the box and not fall under a large challenge but they also you know need to just have grit I'd like to say grit like you know when things get get hard they you know they they don't just get get frustrated they kind of double down and yeah yeah and push through okay so Apache Cassandra version four comes in very soon all the Apache community is very excited about that and data starts now puts a lot of efforts into that I believe question the main question people ask me what's new coming into the Apache for what's menu features like I know we discussed recently zero Cooper screaming what's four zero Cooper screaming sure well let me just say there's there's definitely been a incredible amount of elaboration going on I'm the open source project you know it's it's traditionally been you know a large portion of the code being worked on by a small group but over the years it's changed you know and now we have people from like all the big companies contributing and small companies contributing to chew through the Apache process so it's been really great to see the project thrive in that fashion so zero copy streaming I believe came from Netflix if I'm not mistaken but yes but so the idea for the zero copy steering the patch in forw is under certain circumstances instead of doing this large network flush there are cases where you need to send all of the data for a given SS table from node 2 to node so so in those cases now in Cassandra 4 oh it will just do a net network copy and that gets rid of that excuse me it gets rid of that serialization and deserialization bottleneck that we see all the time so and that's mostly for we use cases when you are running can you note yes it's mostly for a decommission or a a bootstrap I mean has some caveats it I believe only works with leveled compaction sense leveled compaction is split by Okin range hmm and it splits it up into small chunks so that's the that's the common case where you are going to send most of a bunch of SS tables Alex so in those cases you can get massive improvements great but I mean how am I suppose massive like I mean so you can go I mean it depends on a lot of factors but let's say you are just streaming from a single node to a single node right now the current Cassandra will write at about 20 megabytes per second in 4 oh it will go to you know depending on how fast your your network is five gigabits per second or 10 gigabits per second Wow so you can transfer that data and you know you can get a 30x improvement in some vats like butts guys if you are on the level of compaction you may have some fun with Cassandra for yes okay virtual tables yes what's that so virtual tables is something people on the operator side have been asking for for a long time which is you know I don't want you have to use jmx to basically look at some things and cql to look at other things and vice-versa so what what virtual tables does is it it's based just a construct to allow developers to put any operational level information they want into a virtual eql table this means that that using CQL you can see how many pending compactions there are what the configuration values are per node you can see what the metric values are per node so it gives you kind of one query language for your vote for your data plus your operations and this matches like what you can do in my sequel or well Oracle you know and any most large enterprise databases already have this feature so it's being rolled in as now there's now a unified way to get access to to your operational data plus your actual data yeah sounds great okay and last one we wanted to mention is the asynchronous internal messaging yes a singers internal messaging has been on the table for a long time the main problem with the existing internode messaging is it's all based on a thread per connection so if you have a few hundred nodes you can and you have three connections per node in each direction yeah you can end up with like six threads per connection yeah you can easily get yourself into a lot of trouble that's how you get into our troubles yeah so it's one of those things that we've always wanted to fix but finally the community's gotten around to improving that so what it does is it it basically puts it puts it into the same Navy based infrastructure as the as the clock the client connection RPC language so that's all built on on on top of you metaphor mm-hmm and this also verifies if all all of the internal messaging so you go from having hundreds of threads to you know a very small number of threads okay like eight or sixteen so you guys prepare it a lot of us for Cassandra four okay one more question and now you work as an engineering manager for data stacks and you work if data stacks Enterprise at data structure Enterprise I believe but you also did a lot of computations to Apache Cassandra project so guys asking me on our Evans sometimes like how do I not only consume what Cassandra gives but what how can I do it better how can I contribute to the community and to a project what would be your recommendations for beginners yes well so if you go to the if you go to Cassandra dot apache org under the documentation section there is a whole section about how to how to develop Cassandra what our code style is what our process is how to get the you know tests up and running so you need to sort of get the basic framework of you know I need to be able to check out the code I I need to be able to run the test and then you can look in and and go to the issue tracker and even other find a look low-hanging fruit bug we have a tag called low-hanging fruit which is something that you know a first contributor can you know you start to start off with and then once you get your hands dirty you can post a patch yeah and one of us will take a look and you know yeah help help get it in but like I was saying with the remote culture it definitely takes a attitude yep of you know I would say one of the biggest hurdles for people contributing to open source is since it's it's open and public if you write a really bad patch that you know comes in you know there's there's there's this tendency to be you know afraid of like well now that's there for all time but I mean if you look at most of the contributors to Cassandra we've all written really horrible things which went in and broke everything and then you know had to be fixed and I have plenty examples of that happening so so again it's just one of these things where you know you have to be aware that the community is there to kind of help bring new temple in and we all want to see you us succeed yeah so I would say you just gotta pull yourself up by the bootstraps and get started that's what I want to say I know a lot of developers are scared to start to become an contributor for an open source project guys if it hurts do it more often seriously let's just jump in you try to get in a simple back from this least you've mentioned and community will help you be stronger and better into that sure we are almost done one last pink that's a question I love to ask developers what's your favorite buck my favorite bug the IRA well that can be like that or sure well when I first started at rip tonneau which was the old previous job company's name we got tasked with changing all of the types from from byte arrays to quite buffers and and the Java byte buffer API on the surface looks pretty straightforward but it's actually one of the worst API is ever written in Java I think and most people will agree so I just kind of went ahead and you know changed it changed to change everything over and everything you know all the tests that we had at the time ran and it went out in like a sandra 0.7 and then for the next like three or four release cycles it was all about trying to undo the giant mess I'd created because I didn't understand all of the downside so that's probably the most embarrassing bug yeah that's mine that's pansy but there's plenty of examples oh wow okay so Jake thank you for being the mouse that's Jake luciani engineering manager and data stocks Apache Cassandra contributor and Alex polish knife developer advocate in devrel team data starts to thank you for being with us and stay cool",
