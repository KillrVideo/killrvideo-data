    "text": "hello everyone my name is aaron pletts and i'd like to welcome you to building an e-commerce website on astrodb for session number one product catalog and pricing our goal for today is to uh kind of take you through this process and uh hopefully get uh get you started out right if uh if building an ecommerce website is uh is on your uh to-do list so some quick housekeeping things first of all there's nothing to install uh we're gonna be working out of a github repository today that's also integrated with git pod and the nice thing about that is git pod will fire up as a like an ide and you know basically run everything right in your browser it's super cool so that's going to make things a lot easier um for for following through on you know the exercises here and of course the application and website we're going to build is going to be sitting on top of data stacks aster db um which is our version of uh cassandra as a service that we support out in the cloud so our goal for today is to um you know work through the this first session in a series on common e-commerce retail co colloquially known as etail type use cases each session is going to build on the previous one and we're going to show how simple it is to build scalable solutions backed by java spring boot and ultimately running on data stacks aster db so let's take a look at the architecture that we've got going for today first of all we're going to be building a simple ui um that that's actually included in the repo and everything so it's um you know a react js um you know type of user interface built with tailwind css the service layer is built with um java using the spring boot library and the back end of course hits uh data stacks astrid eb so be very simple of what we're what we're working toward today so why astrodb well astrodb is a a great choice for a back-end database for a large-scale ecommerce system first of all because there's no operational overhead it's a database as a service um so we actually handle all of the pain of managing and operating on it so that you don't need to worry about it astrodb like cassandra is geographically aware so that if you are running a uh large-scale retail operation online over over vast geographic regions um you can have your data uh replicated out to where you're where your customers are that way your customers with your application aren't making this really long data trip and then really long trip back um to um you know that's cutting down on latency and wait time and uh yeah it actually makes things easier to build it that way it's not cloud vendor bound so the cool thing about that is we can build out astrodb instances on um multiple major public clouds so we build out in azure gcp and of course aws and astrodb also has no touch scalability meaning that when you have periods of higher traffic that require more resources that will be allocated to your cluster automatically and there's nothing you need to worry about for that it'll just elastically kind of grow with your application okay so now that we've gone through that let's actually jump to our git repository that we're going to work today we're going to go to step two to start with step two is going to be creating our aster db instance so what we're going to do is using the link in the descriptions go to astra and it'll ask me to either create an account or log in using my github or google credentials um so i'll go ahead and sign in with google so as this comes up um you can see that uh that i'm logged in i'm currently on the free tier you can see that right up here and actually you get a certain number of uh of credits every month that um you don't have to add any sort of payment type or credit card or anything to uh to get started so what i'm going to do is go and create a serverless database i'm going to name my database workshop now you can really name the database whatever you like it's it's not uh not uh not anything that's used anywhere else the key space name however it is important to make sure that uh for this exercise anyway that you're naming it e-commerce all right that's going to be important to making things work as you as we go on all right um so i'll say well let's see we'll stick in a google cloud here and i'm in north america so i'll pick south carolina and i'm in the free tier so that looks good we'll create the database so now you can see that my workshop database is an appending state which means it's coming up so i should get an email saying that it started to create it and then once it's active i'll get another email saying it's ready to go and that whole process should take about five minutes ish so while we're waiting on that let's jump back to our presentation so the next thing we're going to talk about while we're waiting for our astrodb uh database instance to come up is we're going to talk about use cases so when you're building an ecommerce website um there are many subsystems or components that that really go into making an entire site however some of those components are you know more necessary than others some are really nice to haves um so kind of the four main components that uh that we're going to go over in this series are going to be obviously a shopping cart an ordering system a user profile and then the product subsystem is what we'll be building today so as far as the product services go there are three that we're going to work through today first of all is the product data service which obviously has you know all the details about each of the products next is the product category navigation service because all products are inside of uh you know a hierarchy of categories that gets built out that you know ultimately we can navigate through and each product of course has a price so we will need a pricing service to handle that as well so now let's take a quick look at our data models before we get too far into that let me just say that that we could dedicate an entire session on cassandra data modeling if we really wanted to trying to keep this as short as i can so i just have this slide here for some quick tips on building out large-scale cassandra data models first of all think about the queries that you want to support and think about the data that you're going to pull back in one query well data that's queried together should be stored together so think about that secondly you're going to want to make sure you're using high cardinality keys um that's you know something that's very unique something like a uuid or a time uuid what what you ultimately want is something that that has a lot of possible values because those are going to distribute in your cluster the best on the other hand going with something low cardinality like a boolean where you only have a true or a false value that's going to lead to problems down the road so you know when you when you implement your keys and and you're trying to figure out a primary key strategy more high cardinality keys the better um third if you've used cassandra for some time you know that there's an allow filtering directive that essentially lets you run queries either without a where clause or with a where clause that's that's very liberal on non-indexed fields um that's really not a good idea to do especially in production you know allow filtering basically says hey i'm okay with doing a full table scan on a distributed database and that's never going to be fast and it may actually time out so pro tip let's stay away from allow filtering and then lastly try to keep things small small partitions small result sets small column values you know the smaller the better the the more you pull back from cassandra only what you need the happier you're going to be so let's think about the queries that we need to support first of all we need to be able to query your product by its identifier that should be simple we need to be able to query a product's online price more into that online bit later but um but yeah that's that's definitely a requirement and of course we need to be able to query product queries or sorry product categories in a hierarchy so this is what our our physical data model is going to end up looking like um first of all we have our product navigation or hierarchies here where we have our categories by parent id each category underneath that is clustered or has a clustering key based on category id that way you can have you know multiple categories under a parent id and you can recursively call or query that table and get a new set of category ids as you navigate through now of course each category is going to contain many products um and each of these products are gonna have they'll be they'll be keyed on a product id but they're gonna have things like brand description model maybe some images um and then of course based on based on um you know if you're a brick and mortar type of retail organization as well um you may have um multiple prices for each product and the reason that that happens is that you know sometimes you have you know you'll have different um different prices for the same product in different stores you know the the reality is that it just costs more money to get the same product into manhattan than it does into sheboygan wisconsin that's just uh that's just how it goes um so there'll be some some differences in cost based on geographic region ultimately too you'll have a special web price likely um you know because you may run you may run promotions or whatever where you know everything is uh is a certain price just on just on the web you know so that's a distinct possibility too so we need to be able to have multiple prices per product is essentially what this is saying so starting out with that pricing table it's going to be very simple we're just going to have a product id we're going to have an id for which store it's in and we're going to have a value where we actually you know store what the what the um what the price is per product now important to note but the price and service and pricing table is separate from product you know when you when you look at smaller e-commerce operations or or a lot of examples out there on the web on how to do this they'll have price simply being a property on on the product table and and that might work at a small scale but the reality is when you're running a large-scale e-commerce operation and you have a couple of million products you probably have several hundred or maybe even a couple thousand developers working in your organization and you're just going to have separate teams for things so you'll have a team that handles product data you'll also have a team that handles product pricing and they'll build out their services separately the thing is too is that price data is going to have a different read write pattern than product data you know you'll you'll have prices be upgraded or sorry updated more frequently whereas product data is is largely static speaking of which we move right to the product table um in this case we're going to have a product id and that's going to be our loan primary key we're going to have a product group you know a name a brand a model number you know some description categories um a map of specifications just if there are any extra properties that we want to add per product maybe some documents you know you might have um like msds sheets you know if if there are products that are you know have like different chemicals in them or or whatever um you might have multiple images as well per product so we we have that as a collection as well um the thing is is that when you're when you're using a a non-cassandra database for this balancing that read traffic can sometimes be a challenge especially when you when you get into um the architectural differences between databases and how data is distributed um really going with um you know astrodb or apache cassandra is going to be the best way to kind of serve this out on a large scale and that's just with the way that um you know the the partition keys are hashed and then it makes for an easy distribution and pr and essentially that prevents one specific node or set of resources from being worked too hard and lastly of course we have our category table which we've talked a little bit about with the um you know having a parent id for the partitioning key and then category id for the um for the clustering key and that's so that we can have multiple categories per parent and again as i said this is designed to be called recursively going through a list of different category ids every time until you find you finally work your way down far enough that the products list is populated so now let's go back to our github repo and we're gonna go to steps three and four inside the readme which will run us through creating our schema and populating our data so if i look here you'll notice that in three a we have a command of use e-commerce and then we have four tables that are being created and i'll talk about that last one for a little bit too but that's essentially what we're going to accomplish right now inside of that third step so um i waited too long so i was logged out of aster dv so i'm going to have to sign in again just make sure that i click that hey outstanding so i'm going to click on my workshop database i'm going to say cql console that's where i want to go okay so the first thing i'm going to do is make sure that i'm using the e-commerce key space so i'll say use e-commerce and if you have that we should have that created already so that might autocomplete oh look at that use ecommerce semicolon boom now you notice this causes my prompt to change to have the key space i'm currently authenticated to listed in the prompt next i'm going to go ahead and create those tables simply put we'll start with the category table i can just copy and paste that right in then i can go to the pricing table and also paste that can go to the product table just doing a copy and a paste let's do a describe tables now you'll notice i have a category price and product table just like that and actually if i say describe key space you'll see that the actual data definition language for these tables is contained inside the e-commerce key space all right so that's all set now remember i mentioned a fourth table that fourth table is going to be something called featured product groups as we were putting this uh this website together you know it was it kind of came about that um you know many um many websites have like featured products and have random things that show up you know so we wanted to you know kind of get a smattering of our products and put them on the front of the site well we didn't really have a service that did that other than to like try and query all the products which you know as you know is a cassandra anti-better so we definitely don't want to do that so we created this table just to be able to feature a few products and and show them on the on the front of the site so let me get that table over here as well all right copied and pasted now if i up arrow through my commands here oh you're gonna see described tables there you go now you can see that that featured product groups table is indeed in there all right next if i go back to the git repo we're already on step four which is populate the data and again we have it listed right in here so all you really need to do is just kind of select it and copy it in there and the same thing with uh with our price table there we go and again with our product table oh i went way too far there okay copy and paste all right and then we'll go to the featured product rows which there are only four but that's that's really all we need and we'll paste those four in there okay now just to make sure that we we have that data in there um let's just do a quick select from from that last table here so we'll do a select star from featured product groups and you can see hey we have our four rows in there outstanding let's move on to talking about the service layer so the first service endpoint that we have is the price service now the price service has three restful endpoints um first of all it has an endpoint that allows you to retrieve multiple prices for a single product id that's what this first one is so if you essentially what you're doing with this is you're querying that price table but not specifying you know a store so you're getting back all of the prices um here you're specifying you want a single price back and you're also giving it a product id and the idea here is it's going to default to the web store and assume that you just want to pull that web price back which again is is useful for for what we're doing with um with the website and finally we have that last restful endpoint which will pull a single price back for a product id and a store id combination so here's what a here's what a simple example of that if we're using cql looks like where we have our select from price where product id equals and then we have a product code that we've put in there and that actually pulls back the product id the store id of web and the value of 14.99 moving on we have the category service endpoint um which again has two restful endpoints that that you can hit we have a multiple wait a way to retrieve multiple categories with a single parent id and that's that's what we're mainly going to call for navigation and there's also i'm sure there are some scenarios where you want to look at a specific category id and in that case you can query a single category with both a parent id and a category id so now you know we have a little navigation example here um in our database and the data set that we just copied and pasted in our top level parent id has this um uuid that that designates that it's uh that is the top it's that ffdac25a o2444 4894 bb31 80884bc82a9 i know that's a mouthful i don't expect you to remember all that that's why we're we're making a point to call it out here um and actually this is defined as a variable inside of um of our website itself so um you know it's not something that you'll have to worry too much about but anyway when i query with just that parent id i'm going to get back clothing wall decor tech accessories and then cups and mugs now you'll notice that each one has a category id and the products list underneath each is null so there aren't any products at this level in the hierarchy which makes sense because it's the top so if i go to the next let's say that we grabbed um oh let's see here what was that oh clothing yep yeah so let's say that we grab the category id for clothing and we make that be the new parent id well now we come back with hoodies and t-shirts and jackets likewise let's say that we're going to grab that category id for hoodies and navigate into that next so now as you can see we actually have products showing up you know where we have a vintage data stacks 2015 mvp hoodie and then a datastax black hoodie and we have some product numbers listed here um so yeah that's that's kind of how this works so you navigate through the different levels you know um a click done category id becomes a new parent id and then you keep following that exercise until you have your products underneath specifically once we get down to individual products there really only is one endpoint that we're going to worry about and that's going to be our product endpoint and essentially it's very simple you're retrieving a single product with a single product id and simple enough you know if we were to go ahead and query you know um against our product table for a product id of dsa1121l you know we would pull back this um you know t-shirt long-sleeve large t-shirt about um hey this is given out of the internal summit show proud you are to talk about the world's best multi-region multi-cloud serverless database so so there we go that's individually how each of the services work okay now we're actually going to get down to connecting to our database and um firing up this website and watching this all work um so yeah so now let's go back to the git repo and down to step five of create your token so if i scroll down to step five you'll see that we have some steps here of um going in to manage an application the application tokens for a for an organization inside data um and stacks astra to create a role of database administrator and that's what we're going to at least for the purposes of this example connect to the connected database with and eventually it's we're going to get a token returned here that we're going to want to make sure that we save off locally just for now all right so let's walk through that so i'm going to go back to my dashboard and if i have a look here we go i see generate a token so i'm going to click that for my workshop database all right so i get this screen that comes up i'm going to select a role of database administrator yep i get all these privileges with it and i'm going to say generate token now what you end up getting is a client id client secret and an actual token now you will want to um you know if this is real i would probably click this download token details and save that locally but since i'm just using this for the purposes of the example for this workshop i'm going to really quickly just kind of copy all of this and just store it in a text file for now let me just double check the token and make sure that i got the end of that i certainly did okay great so now if i go back to the instructions here so we have the token we've saved it off locally let's set up our application somewhere in here ah look at this right here scroll down until you see this button that says open in get pie so i'm going to click this button oh and actually you know what what i should have done was right click and say open a new tab there we go let's do that and i will say continue with github and i'm going to make sure that my account is authorized and get pod is working and preparing my workspace here all right so get pod has loaded it is uh still working through some things here all right and it's done so if we go and have a look at our instructions you'll see that we have this little copy command that we're going to run here and what that's going to do is take our env.example and create just a emv file so i'm going to copy that and right here is where i'm going to paste that in so so this is essentially a linux terminal right in here i'm doing a cp.env.example and you can see that that file is right here so let's uh close some of this just to make things a little easier to follow and you know i'll even uh increase the view a little bit here and let's hit enter okay now as you can see inside my git pod ide it's created a new file and if i go in here you'll see that my astrodb id region application token and key space are all kind of they're all kind of set as placeholders although that that e-commerce key space is there already so in order to connect successfully we need to make sure that all this is filled out so i'm going to go ahead and grab my astra token that i saved off and that is going to go right here so that's been pasted now if i go back to oh where was that here we go if i go back to my dashboard um what you'll see is i can find my database id and that is actually one of the next yeah one of the two remaining items that i need so if i go back to here and then let's just go to go to aster and if i look at my workshop you'll see i have this database id and i have an icon where i can copy it so now i've done that let's jump back to gitpod and we'll paste the database id in next as i click into my database itself you'll see that it's going to reveal the region which you also need to be able to connect so let's do that so if i click on workshop here you'll notice that my region is us-east one so i'll copy that go back to git pod and i'll paste that in all right now in gitpod when you're modifying a file in their their ide in your browser you don't need to worry about saving it automatically saves for you so that should be very very simple um next you can scroll down and the last thing we really need to do here is source in that dot env file so that is what i'm going to do next okay um and now just to make sure that took i'm going to um run the env command to show me all of the environment variables then i'm going to pipe that to grep and i'm going to look for astra underscore db because that's what all of these environment variable names are prefixed with and if i hit that you can see that i have all four of these defined so we should be in good shape okay and really then we can jump all the way from step six to step nine which is run the application and all we really need to do is just enter this um just basically hit the start dot shell uh script which if you look is right here and really all that does is oh that already does the the source env so really we don't need that step but essentially this runs the um the website itself so let's let's go ahead and do that just like that and i can hit enter now let's watch it run and you'll see a lot coming back here oh now you notice i have this thing came up that said the pop-up was blocked so what i'm going to do is first of all i'm going to allow pop-ups from this particular url which is my unique gitpod url and i'm going to say done now unfortunately i have to break out of that and i have to run that again but the good news is that this should go faster and it should actually bring up a browser tab um showing the website so let's see what we got here oh there's our tab oh look at that we have our featured datastax products how about that huh specifically two i can click into oh let's let's go with um let's go with hoodies the same example that we did in the presentation so if i click into hoodies you'll see that it comes up with two you know we've got our our mvp hoodie and our data stacks black hoodie which i'm actually wearing presently so if i click into this one you'll see that hey we have it um we have four sizes i can go ahead and i'm a large so i'd click large and um i would add that to cart if if the shopping cart was working it's not right now but you'll see that too it's coming back with a price of uh 35.99 um so this is this is working um let's see if i go back i can look at t-shirts um oh you know yeah we haven't we have an image that didn't work out um hey here's my um apache cassandra 3 contributor t-shirt um which i actually hold very dear again you know i could i could pick large and you can see that it's uh 13.99 um if i needed a a 2x large a double extra large that would be 17.99 so you can tell that i'm pulling back different prices here which is which is good this is this is all working um so yeah you know i suppose one last thing that we could have that we could go over here would be to show you where the code is if you wanted to look at how to do this the actual spring boot code here let me increase size a little bit to make it make it easier to see and let's do that and maybe make that terminal window a little smaller too and we can even we can even quit out of that we don't need it running at this point but um if i look in the back end directory under source main java and then go to first of all i can have a look at this ecommerce application java which really well let me let me close that which really is where spring boot takes over and runs this thing and and sets up like a like a mini web server to host it if i go ahead and look at service you'll see i have my category directory featured product directory my price service directory and my product service directory if i were to go ahead and look at um oh let's see here i think it's the yeah price rest controller you can see this is where the mapping for the restful endpoint is set um you can see where where it sets that default store id to web um and it goes ahead and um you know we'll go ahead and do that that select star from price where product id um so so really if if you wanted to you could follow this down and actually look at things like on this price repo find by product id so if i went to the price repository again what we're looking at here is is just a simple um interface that that's extending out that cassandra repository um it's very very simple um this is actually the first project i did in spring boot and uh you know um it was good for me to get caught up on on with more recent java because my my java certification is like is like 11 years old but uh i i digress but anyway the point is is that um you know building things out with spring boot is is super easy all right so now that we've done that we come to the homework so for those of you who would like to earn a badge for this uh for this exercise here um the homework we have is is pretty simple it's um it's add your own product to the website you can find details on how to do this in step number four actually in the readme um but essentially make entries for your own product in the product category and price tables and then add an image into the slash ui slash public slash images directory and if you take a look in that directory you'll understand the naming convention and how that has to match up with the product id and uh you should be able to uh should be able to figure that out but anyway hey get that added and then submit a screenshot of your product being displayed on the site and you will earn a badge all right thank you to those of you who stayed with us and we'll see you all next time",
