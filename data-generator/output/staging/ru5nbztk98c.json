you know anything we're gonna talk about today uh you know i've had to make some decisions on this uh for ourselves as well uh we also talked about uh you know the general strategy and roadmap to get to uh serverless um and we emphasized you know having devops in place having data operations in place and then after that starting to transform the services and apis one at a time and then eventually the actual front ends so we talked about the strategy today we're going to talk a little bit about the uh you know how do we actually decide what to transform and how do we which technologies do we use for transforming an api or the front and in the in the second session we covered different migration patterns so we talked about uh offline uh data migration uh we talked about two ways of doing online data migration one using dual rights in real time and another one again real time dual rights but using the event sourced architecture we talked about how if you can't use if you can't have any downtime you can do an offline migration but in most cases you're probably going to be in the middle here or if you already have event source architecture you may be doing a real-time dual right uh this link bit bitly slash casino data ops has references to a lot of the different on offline methods for moving data in uh and around cassandra um cql copy obviously uh comes with cassandra but you know how to do it with a spark job a spark script using a spark migrator compiled job an ss table loader and of course my favorite ds fault now we're at the current time today's session as i mentioned is about how to think big about business platforms for the longer term as gartner mentions it digital business technology platform um there's a really good paper called building a digital technology business platform by gartner in 2016. um this is one of my favorite uh white papers on explaining what a business is today uh doesn't matter what business uh every business is an i.t company now and uh every business has a lots of different types of platforms that make the full uh business platform so info systems what end users sorry inside the company use you know if it's for back office uh customer experience is what all the end users customers use outside the organization uh data and analytics platform uh kind of sits in the middle it talks to everything it's with data management integration we're going to talk a lot about that uh and then there's obviously iot for companies it's not a new thing people think iot is like a wildly new thing it's been around it was called telematics before and other people used it may not have had the internet ip address associated with it but the physical devices were always there in in big companies that have factories and fleets uh and now there's a there's a standard way of doing it today um and then ecosystem platforms you know api management so that people can connect outside in fact inside the organization all of these things together make up a business platform so when we're talking about transformation of an organization not just an application a transformation of a business we have to think about all of these different things and uh transformation is uh it's a long journey it's it's not something that happens overnight um if you think about uh these different types of uh platforms they all kind of converge as you may imagine on data and analytics well because every one of these other platforms has data and data and analytics brings things together you know and that organizes things and unifies things and moves messages and moves data around for these other systems so of course data and analytics is the most important area of the business platform uh i think that's what we focus on as a company um but these platforms uh they are catering to different things data analytics generally uh doesn't cater to users it caters to the systems themselves that's why it's in the inside inside the business platform itself if you add uh all the different types of business platforms uh they're really you know as i mentioned these are areas of business platforms um this is just categories there's a category for let's say business intelligence or there's a category for let's say algorithm engines right these uh are just categories of software so any uh sufficiently mature organization is going to have hundreds hundreds of applications um sorry did somebody have a question no no no no no all good we are good all right great um yes hundreds of applications hundreds of platforms that can be categorized in general into these kind of software types and then these software types and then categorize into these platform types um i don't want to scare you but if you're going to go start a company that's going to grow eventually it's going to have a lot of systems or if you already work for a big organization you you already know this uh because you work with these different systems on a day-to-day basis what companies want to do if they are already doing it is they want to become a real-time business platform a real-time business platform meaning that users can interact with the company and whether that's an employee or a customer in real time you're familiar with a lot of them right uber uh doordash right you order something you're told when the food's coming it's connecting users together in real time that's what everybody wants now how do you get to that get to that with some of the technologies uh that data science has to offer uh and uh they uh get to it with technologies like spark and kafka but that's just you know a simple uh an explanation of how to get to real time but real time uh business platform is more than just a technology it's the design of the company and um you know companies it doesn't matter what it is like this is a kind of an example from a form of an airline company um an airline company has lots of different things that are going on that are creating data and uh you know uh if you're gonna go buy a ticket for example and somebody's uh already been you know given a seat if that data is not synchronized in real time the next person that's gonna buy that seat or reserve that seat may double book it right now they may do that on purpose but um that's just one example of why it's important for the whole organization to talk together in real time what does this have to do with serverless transformation well before serverless technologies uh people would run their own messaging engines they would run their own databases and they would run their own uh uh you know uh platforms uh all the way to the virtual machines right and it was possible to do a real-time business by doing all this by yourself but today serverless technologies are available to everybody so you can create a really scalable business scalable application by using 100 serverless technologies if you haven't read the reactive manifesto i would highly recommend you you read it but basically talks about um you know what a reactive application is now you can think about a reactive application and then you can broaden that into what is a reactive business platform so reactive application is elastic meaning it can grow as the user base grows as the stress increases it can grow automatically not with somebody pushing a button it can just happen magically um resilient uh it means that it never goes down uh it's uh the way it does it is by being message driven and uh you know i'm not gonna go too deep into message driven architecture but event driven message driven um they're kind of related but the reason uh things can be elastic and resilient with a message driven architecture is that um each component of the platform is talking with itself using asynchronous messages rather than synchronous calls that's the reason why we can scale the value that this provides is a responsive application a responsive application that is uh really fast for end users uh it's also maintainable and it's also extensible um microservices can fall into this somewhere it's not the thing that makes it responsive it's just one of the things that can make a reactive application we're gonna come back to this picture uh later on but read up on the reactive manifesto uh i bet you if you're using an application that doesn't crash like facebook uh oh wait they did crash yesterday uh if you're using an application for the most part uh you know these days large-scale uh end-user customer facing applications they're built using these principles do we get there well making an application uh reactive whole business uh reactive and you know expandable uh fast and resilient uh we can look at the the platform on a layer by layer basis um and before we do that we can think about the business as a journey right uh most this is the by the way this is from that book i mentioned uh i think last time or the or the or the in the first session uh you know enterprise architecture as a strategy um where every business is gonna go through this journey regardless of what point it starts whether it started 20 years ago or whether it started yesterday most businesses go through this journey and what that journey is is that they all start with different silos of applications that people are using everybody starts oh and we're going to use slack for this and we're going to use zoom for this and we're going to use google app suite for this and and so on and so forth and we're going to use salesforce for that right all businesses start to use different technologies sometimes they make it sometimes they buy it but they all have silos eventually there's so much chaos that the business decides let's standardize that standardization could be at any layer it could be we're going to make all of our apps using react we're going to do all of our apis using docker uh don't care what programming languages is you know maybe 20 years ago people would care if it was java or net maybe in certain religious companies in the sense that they get religious about technology um they're like oh no we don't like python right or we don't like java it doesn't really matter with docker right so let's just say standardizing what the software runs on standardizing uh basically everything so that when there's something new there's a way of doing it there's a process of doing it then this standardization of the platform actually is related to the devops it's related to a little bit of the data operations most companies stop there most companies cannot make the jump from having a standardized platform to having an optimized core and an optimized core is not just the data that connects the whole business together but things like apis and what the optimized core allows the business to do is things like machine learning if you don't have an optimized core of data you can't really do machine learning right and uh that's a different conversation but once you have an optimized core then the business becomes modular it allows the organization to grow create new units buy companies and integrate these companies uh in a much easier swifter fashion because acquiring a new business or starting a new joint venture with another company is a matter of following a set of procedures that connect to the optimized core and you know um this you know this deck will be available made available um the phase five is uh what this book talks about is called business to business modularity so beyond the modularity inside an organization how can businesses talk together right and that is the future and that's already there now but in terms of you know a lot of organizations collaborate using sas tools uh like slack they can connect their you know slack teams but it goes beyond that it's how can we connect our um commerce engines together right so that type of modularity is more available today than it was when this book was first written but it's still just because the technology is there doesn't mean that you don't have to go through these phases right you you have to go through this uh standardization and optimization process to get to business modularity within before you can have modularity with other businesses now how where do we start and uh you know this is this is from our own knowledge base and our our body of knowledge in our company um and you you've seen some variation of this in a lot of uh you know enterprise architecture uh frameworks but you have to start with people you have to build the business or the platforms for users for customers not for the people maintaining the application of course you have to make applications that are maintainable but uh not for the server uh you know administrators right uh we're not making applications uh for anybody else except for end users right when you take a look at this picture right customers partners and employees right those are the users those are the people we build applications for uh and of course things are connected to it but who use the things people use those things those people then have jobs or they have goals and those are processes that the business helps them execute um you know i have a lot more experience in business to business than in the consumer world but uh ultimately every user is going through a customer journey right and the uh information that is stored on your system uh is what allows them to to to go through that customer journey um so people are at the top but it's systems that really make this all work together and today uh you know i would say uh since the beginning of the internet which is i would say 40 40 years of the public internet um this isn't this isn't different than what it was 40 years ago people were still people people still had uh their you know general goals there was information stored on uh you know big tape drives that was not connected and they had systems today the systems are different uh but you know a lot of this other stuff hasn't changed much well what's a system a system is um you know consisted of the database the data the software and the interface and interfaces are for people software runs the business rules databases of course stores and saves information and when i say systems they're self-contained it's one thing that has all of this together and today it's smart to buy and not to build why because there's millions of software out there that somebody has already made that does something for you um there are also cloud providers that have basically taken the commoditized systems and they've offered it to you um interfaces right nobody's going to make their own user interface framework today unless you're google unless you're facebook then you make your own and then you give it out to people and everybody uses it so why rain with the wheel right so there's interface frameworks you can use there's software frameworks of course we are familiar with a lot of these um in addition to this there are serverless frameworks and i'll talk about that in a second there's different types of databases relational and non-relational right we don't create a new database today because we want it we just pick one and we use it and you know today we don't even want to run it on our own vm we want to just pay somebody to run it for us but systems have evolved from you know the traditional on-premise right managing your data center and all of this stuff all the way to software as a service in which the only thing that your organization is worrying about is your own data the rest of it is really managed by somebody else uh data as a service a database as a service um you know somewhat fits into this area um but there are other as a service right there's authentication as a service there's desktop as a service you name it there's something as a service um people will just say something as a service and say that's like you know groundbreaking um but really it's just a service it's an online service you know nothing special so where do serverless functions fit right where does the software uh where does the serverless platform design fit um in all of this well before we figure out where it fits let's think about what is out there today right that's what i was talking about this this is an old picture but you'll see in the next picture there's so many different things out there that do something for you that if you don't understand what is out there today even if you use serverless code on a serverless database you're behind right you're behind because you're wasting your time making something that somebody has already created so it's important to know what is out there and there's a lot out there um for example uh this is a little bit more uh you know modern kind of stack of infrastructure storage platform data functions and software as a service uh you know we're gonna look at a few of these uh we're gonna obviously talk about you know database as a service what are the platforms of the service out there all of these things are all eventually sitting on somebody else's data center so serverless functions are also eventually running on somebody else's data center and it's not just the functions it's whatever applications you use if we go zoom in to just data in data alone there are tons of platforms as a service and software as a service things out there one of which is faster we're going to talk about that as well so if i can tell you one thing about transformation um it requires a lot of knowledge of what is already out there because if you can find the best fit that is already popular and it already has a good user base and is a relatively uh you know modest cost it's always going to be cheaper than building it yourself trust me um and you can tie those things together with other code that runs on serverless platform but nothing beats saving millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars creating something something that somebody else already has so speaking of which astra is one of those services that uh does a lot for us and i'm gonna have alex give us a little bit information about astrodb yes um do you have the next slide for us bro right thank you yeah exactly so uh this all of these cloud transitions migrations and many many benefits what cloud gives to us one i like the most is the availability for serverless databases one of the best nosql databases such as cassandra apache cassandra famous it's being used and developed by apple netflix instagram rated many different companies well-known companies basically if you read through a fortune 500 cassandra is used by most of them uh but cassandra also brings a lot of implications and you need to really understand what you are doing in order to operate it and astrodb is a cassandra as a service in the cloud that we as data stocks take care of all the headaches and you just use it as a service exactly like rahul recently discussed it for database as a service it's a managed solution so we take care of the maintenance operations and everything you don't need to know it's free to use even for small production workloads and it's definitely free for your students learners whatever small startups products you want to do with that it's serverless so it scales as you need and it scales globally multi-region so following all the famous apache cassandra features there is no operations or actually there are operations but they're hidden because of from you because we are doing them and there are so many other options uh what very important uh for our customers and for people who wants to use cassandra but can't handle uh manual installation and maintenance and i do not judge them because there is quite a lot of things to do uh so the idea the foundation of peace is open source apache cassandra with some tweaks of course uh to work better in multi-tenancy in the cloud uh and then there is a second layer which is also very important which is stargate.io stargate.io is an open source project so you can run it on your own with your own cassandra deployment and on astrodb it's already installed configured and ready to work from the very beginning this stargate api is a very great it's a great api data layer which gives you ability to work with the data stored in cassandra using different ways to retrieve or store this data for example you can if you need flexibility of schema ls solutions like you can store your documents with node predefined schema in uh just the way uh throwing documents into the database without a need to create a schema for them you just create collections and put documents exactly like you could do with for example where's the graphql api so you can access your data before the power of a graphql and by the way if you don't know what is it we have a special workshop introduction to graphql and i do recommend you to attend it because well graphql is a very powerful tool to when you play data and sometimes you need just something simple simple like rest you uh store your data using typical you retrieve your data using http call get put pause delete all the normal things with http rest calls and that's again possible and data is storage in cassandra and stargate is this data proxy layer which does this job for you so uh that's the main thing about starting right yep yeah and i'm gonna talk a little bit more about uh the the stargate layer and why that's an enabler for transformation um and we talked a little bit about it before but uh it's uh it's a game changer and there's more coming so we'll talk a little bit about the preview stuff too um so when we're talking about transformation um i think the easiest uh you know thing to transform is well my experience is the interface layer uh and how you build it and where you host it uh and then the interface layer these days primarily is the website or it's an application and the uh the web the website uh could be uh you know mobile uh responsive uh database uh application uh that's all backed by you know could be backed by your data center it can be backed by a server it doesn't really matter it's mobile and responsive so you can look at it on your phone or you can look at it on the web if you were to move that interface layer to a serverless platform the end user wouldn't really know the difference it doesn't really make any difference to them in fact they would just maybe see a more snappy interface um there is one layer below that um which you can host in the api layer 100 so your all your applications are talking to the apl here uh or you could have some what's called server side rendering so there's lots of options to take your your interface layer and and move it uh to a server's platform um and you know there there's a lo there's a lot um and i've kind of mixed them up together because it's hard to distinguish between uh what you know uh is a content delivery network where you just put your static assets right html css javascript and then those things talk to api layers or api gateways um and those same services are now offering serverless uh you know server-side rendering uh of of node or python uh and um also the way that they do that is is through serverless functions so some of them actually say this is a serverless function as a service so what's like what does that mean well creating a service function to to render some job you know some javascript into react uh on lambda is non-trivial it takes a lot of effort but if you were to use it with let's say netlify it would be a lot easier um but this is a fairly modern list of you know what is out there for hosting your in your interface um and some of these if you dig deeper do more than that they can they can run your dockerized api layer for you at scale so that you don't you know you don't necessarily have to have your own kubernetes cluster uh you just say here's my docker container and they will deploy it and they'll give you a url uh and it'll just magically scale and that that stuff has been around uh i didn't put it on here but you know google app engine was one of the first ones that did that and then azure web app is another one but amazon has their own um and amazon's first one was called elastic bean stock where you just said here's my machine type here's my code and it would just it would create new virtual machines for you now they just create containers for you a bunch of these also have built-in ci cicd uh which is a subset of devops which is continuous integration continuous delivery so in order for you to deploy your application at scale uh you just have to have decent dev uh you know get ops meaning commit code connect connect whatever you know netlify or purcell to your github repo and upon the commit if you say you know dude from this branch or this tag it will pick it up and it'll automatically pull it for you um this is a no-brainer i i highly recommend uh you know if you're if you're running your own customer experiences um even if you're using something like you know like adobe or or sitecore eventually those uh engines are good for managing the content but they're not necessarily the best for serving uh you know millions of users or thousands of users simultaneously these systems uh are built for that they're they're they're literally built for taking your applications front end and maybe you're a little bit of your middleware and and putting it out on hundreds of thousands of servers and so that you don't have to worry about that scale issue and they'll take care of the load balancing they'll take care of a bunch of cool stuff for you um highly recommend you look at some of this my favorites uh you know we use netfly and purcell we've used firebase a little bit for firebase functions uh as well as uh you know firebase pages uh github pages we do a few things on there the next most important layer is beyond the service level server side rendering which is logic you know business logic you know you're not necessarily going to run um you know some complex uh you know e-commerce transaction um on the server-side rendered page that's hosted on xjs you could but you wouldn't necessarily want to do that um and so in the software layer there's really a it goes uh from all the way close to the user to all the way close to the data depends on what you want to do but when we're talking about the software layer it's what is taking the inputs from the user doing something with it and sending it to the database or it's taking something from the database doing something with it and sending it to the user right it's the middle it's the middleware um plus some business logic and there's lots of things out there for that right serverless is not just all uh available on uh amazon uh aws lambda there's google functions azure functions cloudfare has their own cloudflare workers uh there's a framework capital s serverless which makes it easier to use aws and i think they i don't know if they've dropped support they used to really advertise that you would write your code in one framework and it could deploy to all these three um but it adds a few more bells and whistles to make your life a little bit easier um now if you have a concern with the timings and slas of these uh serverless functions as a service you can also consider running your own containerized serverless framework uh not on a kubernetes cluster that you're managing but maybe on a kubernetes as a service like gke or azure you know kubernetes service because kubernetes is now basically available on a serverless basis as well and what this does is it gives you 100 control um in terms of what type of software uh is being allowed to run on your platform um you know all the firewalls that you may want to put in there um you may want to use a different uh messaging engine than the ones that these use over here so even though this is not uh you know the easy way out it's still serverless it still gives you the ability for ultimate scale it's just it's going to require more work and some of these are open open source open fastest open source i think all these are open source you can take a look at them they all run on kubernetes and most of them run on docker and some of them run on mesos uh and then what i put down here is managed serverless um what i meant by this is that you could write a function or you could write an api and use their devops to wrap your code so netify runs serverless functions for you purcell runs service functions for you and puts a monitoring layer around it and um and it's it's transparent you don't even know that it's running on some clouds serverless function technology but it's actually running on let's say aws lambda uh and there's probably other ones out there but we use these on a day to day we don't even bother with this stuff here right we're just like write the code push it out and this thing's going to take care of it for us if you look at aws lambda right there's a benefit of using idios lambda and that is that it allows you to bind to the events coming from aws native things so that you don't necessarily have to make your own message queue that the function is going to bind to and do something for you right um that's what i like about aws aws is also used uh everywhere and most companies that even use azure they use aws for their digital stack meaning their their customer and and end user stack um so you know more likely than not you're already using it you know uh amazon um so aws lambda uh has good connectivity to the stuff that's at amazon but once you're in the amazon ecosystem you can also have an astra database in amazon that it can talk to um you can also use other other things like aws amplify or aws fargate and we'll get to that in a second azure on the other hand um you know similarly has its own functions that you know cloud functions they call it azure functions and they have probably apples to apple services that kind of you know do what amazon does um and i think that there they have different um terminology for example in aws or something called step functions in azure there's something else called durable functions um but any type of complex logic that you may want to do you can do it in azure or amazon or google for that matter they all have some serverless function technology and the benefit of using these on that particular cloud is that it's natively connected to what else is what is already out there right so if it's already out there and you're already using one of these clouds it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to then go try to bring up your own cubeless or open faz you know you're probably better off just starting it with one of these and over time you may decide to move away from it but if you write your code in a standard you know programming framework uh more than likely you can take the core of your code and move it between these serverless frameworks it doesn't really uh the service frameworks give you essentially how to get the message quote unquote input to your function um and then what to do after it right that's what the serverless framework is doing for you the code you still have to write the code inside it right so um it doesn't really matter if you start to use something like serverless you're going to be better off switching between these um but at the end of the day if you write your code in in frameworks and libraries and you organize it properly you can move uh seamlessly between these things database there now um shamelessly i'm going to plug one database uh layer uh today there are lots of them out there and uh you know the database for me is not just the database or the data as a service it's also potentially the message queue um and you know as we were talking about making a reactive application a reactive frame reactive uh platform uh it's it's these reactive platforms are built with message cubes um so what do we want in a database layer you know if it's serverless what can it do for us and you know up until i would say graphql when it came out and was publicly available and people were using it you know i would have wanted both the rest api access to it as well as the database direct access to it but with technologies like graphql and document apis that make it easy to just you know get and retrieve data or get data in a certain way um we don't necessarily have to make that code anymore graphql does cool stuff for us now um and then of course in the message as a messaging as a service or a message queue um you know these days uh it depends on what you're trying to do but if it's together if it's connected then it's even better so if i want to just send data to a queue and have it processed into a database if some system provides that for me that's even better a data platform is made up of a lot of different things so when we're thinking about transforming the database layer it's really thinking about the whole data platform and data platforms generally include a database you would expect that they have they have a non-relational database they may have a relational database they may have a data warehouse uh they may have a lake house which is just you know a data lake with a bunch of stuff on it um there may be an internal queue there may be some stream problems so there's a lot of stuff basically the goal of the data platform is it takes incoming data in the form of badge stream or api requests does something with it and then it sends it out in the form of reports data or events all right and uh this is oversimplifying it but any input going to any output um the data the data and analytics platform has to do a lot if you remember that picture of the business platform then an analytics platform is smack in the middle of four other platforms and it's connecting all of them together so it has to do a lot right so it's not just a database you can't have a data platform with just a database you need to have more than that and you know i when i look at database our messaging layer or a data platform i'm looking at maybe three things at least what i didn't put in here was stream processing but um a way to uh you know send data and get it asynchronously so a queue lots of different things out there uh data stacks uh you know recently uh put out their astra streams which is uh apache pulsar uh as a service uh an apache pulsar is um uh is uh similar to apache kafka but it has some other cool features and you know but if you're already on one of these other clouds you may want to check into using the ones that are already out there confluent cloud is basically kafka as a service um distributed storage now non-uh uh this is not that important if all of your data is in a database and you don't have any files like images or sound but eventually uh you may have word documents or pdfs you don't want to really store that in a database right so where are you going to put that stuff well you know there's lots of big hard drives out there like amazon s3 azure data lake these things are really useful so having the strategy for where your files are gonna go uh is important and then distributed data uh you know having a single data fabric that scales um i think cassandra by far uh is one of the most popular databases that allows a company to have an infinite scale database um this is why as alex mentioned cassandra is used by netbook you know netflix amazon i'm sorry not apple netflix spotify walmart maybe amazon uses it probably do they just don't tell us um but astra is cassandra as a servant so if these big companies are using this ultimately infinite uh scale database to do some cool stuff why shouldn't you consider it and you know before [Music] astra there really weren't good um you know services that allowed you to quickly create a database and use it in a serverless fashion so the fact that you can do that today is massive uh you know empowerment if you're starting off fresh um especially if you're in a startup and you're building some some application that you hope to grow really really large um astra is backed by cassandra which all the big companies use so why don't you start with it so my favorite part about astra um is the fact that it has stargate and stargate as alex mentioned has a rest layer has a document uh you know api layer it has a graphql layer has native cql access and uh the grpc which is uh in general or generic remote procedure call also known as google run procedure call which uses protobuf that's i think it's in the code it's not documented up there and eventually i think we're going to see integrations into other systems like you know pulsar or kafka soon but this layer of stargate is giving us a serverless api platform without us having to build it out a lot of apis they take input from the user they do some simple transformation maybe even on the client side javascript and they send it and they store in the database there may be some more transformation um maybe on the read side but that could be uh done using you know an api layer that you build in node or java but most data is coming from the user as json from from the web right um now the the cool part about this is that we're going to go into each one of these is that you can be using one api on the front end for the users and you can be using another api for analytics for doing reports and understanding what the data is behind the scenes that's very powerful because if you were using a pure back end as a service right where they just give you a rest api or they give you just a graphql api in order for you to do massive analytics on that data you you really wouldn't be able to do it without calling it via graphql or vrst bringing it into your system doing some analytics cql will allow you to do that faster that's why well cassandra allows you to do that even if you were hosting it on your own right you could have one data center for transactions and one for analytics um with stargate it's more than that it's you can write using one way and you can read using another one and if you if you think about it a lot of times that would have required an etl process so from a rest api perspective um you know you can create a table and basically access it or you can use the rest api to actually create your tables and create your indexes and everything can be done using rest api um so in that sense you know this is it it mimics the back end as a service right so i want this object and i want these fields and i want it to be done like this and it's all using uh you know http rest and so if you're used to using a backend as a service if you're used to using uh rest you know apis you don't have to learn cassandra to be able to start using a very very very scalable database you just need to know learn you need to know uh rest and a little bit of cassandra schema stuff ql is much more powerful than that graphql has uh at least on astr has two modes which is you can use cql first where you can create your schema and it will generate your graphql endpoints or you can create your graphql schema and then it will generate the tables for you in the backend if you're not familiar with gafql watch that workshop that alex mentioned graphql is very very powerful if i were to like you know give it a very simple one two three why is it why is it important why is it cool um in in for example in rest if you ask for one object you get the whole object unless you have a different endpoint right you get all the fields in that object with graphql you could say i just want this field from that object uh with rest if you wanted to get many um uh object details uh you would have to go to each url to get the full detail well that's the recommended you know you you don't have rest apis that give you a billion objects you if you have it it's it's for a special case but with graphql you could say i want this there's my filter criteria and graphql will go and fetch the data for you and then i'll give it back to you as one payload and the reason people made graphql the reason facebook made ql was you know their front end was interacting with so many different rest apis to fill out different parts of their pages they thought well can we just have one interface that asks for exactly what we need and then get everything and update what we need right and every now and then do another that's why they made graphql standing up your graphql server to do what you need to uh is a lot of work um i would recommend at least trying the astrographical layer because it's going to give you more flexibility than just the rest api it's going to give you much more i think nimbleness in building out an interface than than just the rest api and then finally um it if you have a schema related with fields uh in the graphql schema um it gets those things for you as well how you query it but it's kind of like a join i don't know i guess it is a join but if you have related objects it will get that for you in one query call and that's powerful uh normally in in cassandra world uh you're doing client-side joins or you're doing it in your own api well if graphql layer can do it for you great so between just the rest api and the graphql api or and the fact that it's backed by cql we're getting a uh tremendous uh um you know empowerment tool for building scalable systems so if you take every one of your apis and you ask the question do i need to do any special business logic on it and if the answer is no you can literally port it to astr if you take a look at your graphql apis and you take your schema and you just you know create the schema on astra and you test it out and you can manage all those objects for you on astra so those are simple use cases to transform over why would you do that why would you take whatever you're using now and move it over to astra the reason is back what i said earlier the reason is once you put it into astra you can then query it using cql you can do reports on that data you can do analytics on this data and you can do it at speed if you connect to something like connect to it with something like spark for example the document db is um you know i wouldn't say it's something that you know um i i find that useful personally uh but that's because a lot of the stuff that we you know deal with generally has a schema and it has it's strongly typed but i do know that uh in certain use cases um like user preferences or uh you know personalization uh you know factors um the schema for what is representing the user or what is representing the personalized content changes a lot right and having to create a new schema every single time for that doesn't make any sense and you know if you're already using mongodb you already know that this is an amazing uh feature of mongodb you just kind of like add stuff and it just creates a field for you um but the other thing about document api which is i think understated is that you don't need to create or think about a schema and think about how to partition it you just send it data and it gives you an id and that is what can be used it can be used for a lot of things you can use it for a cache right you can use it for uh um storage of of uh you know let's say um pre-rendered content so let's say you have a process that does a lot of crunching to create some document that needs to be served up to let's say millions of users and you have some asynchronous process well you could pre-render that content and dump it into the document api and then on the user endpoint it will just fetch that document and that's it right so document api for me is a way to materialize information uh and store it for fast access from other other users other interfaces and then of course all of that you can access using the database api um this is where i think um if we were to do any type of comparison between other database as a service ultimately this this part is where it's the hardest to compare with astra which is you can do all these and you can do the database api so you could think about a transformation where you have a cassandra application right now and it's using cassandra api to talk to a database and you're running your own apis and over time you can start to take your front ends and start talking to one of the other api layers while you maintain an existing uh you know cassandra backed api and eventually your whole friend could be backed by extra astra apis of course it's backed by cassandra but at the end of the day it's one less thing you have to worry about so we talked about you know layer by layer transformation uh of an application we talked about the front end we talked about kind of the middleware the software layer how do we what are the things out there how do we do it um and we talked about the database layer with a little bit of bias but all you know what what we really need to think about what if we can move one application to a serverless platform that's great if we move 10 applications to service platforms that great that's great too but the question is you know what what is the big picture look like not just now but 10 years from now five years from now i think it's really hard to even think three years ahead right so when we think about a reactive business platform take the reactive application right resilient elastic message driven responsive um you know expandable maintainable think about that and apply that to the business that's what we want for a business because if a business grows it should be elastic you should be able to scale you should be resilient it shouldn't be you shouldn't be crashing you know one system should not necessarily impact the other um so you can move everything to serverless here's an example of a 100 service architecture uh the company serverless has a blog on medium where you can check this out just i think you just google 100 service architecture and it everything that you do is is going to be some serverless service and some lambda functions right but this is just one application right this is just one application so becoming a hundred percent reactive business platform doesn't start with just moving technologies to serverless platforms but really thinking about the overall architecture and asking the question what is it that we're going to get out of it right what is the biggest thing that we're going to get out of it when we talked about what devops does what data ops does right this this saves time and money because robotic processes are being done by robots by not being done by automations rather than human beings um but when we think about a 100 serverless architecture that type of transformation requires a leap of faith and the leap is that this is just going to magically run all right we're going to put that code out there and it's going to magically run the question is well what happens if it doesn't what happens if something breaks what happens if this particular function is taking too long whatever what happens if this algorithm for the state machine is not functioning as intended at scale well like any distributed system you have to do a lot of testing right but think one step above that think beyond the technology and ask the question you know if we get to phase four which is business modularity and if we get to potentially going to phase five which is business to business mindfully what is it that we're seeking and what we're seeking from a business perspective in a reactive business platform is platforms can be added and removed so integration with new software as a service platform as a service integration of the service okay the company can grow and integrate new acquisitions so if like uh your company buys a new company they need to add uh all the systems to your uh you know current systems does the is the business modular enough to do that today well if you think about a database like cassandra and a service like astra it's a no-brainer oh yeah we can add the data right maybe there's some schema changes but you can easily see an existing database that's let's say a non-relational database coming onto astra even relational databases you could transform with some with some work but the easiest way to move uh you know the whole business is to look at the api layer and one by one move them over onto astr when we talk about business to business modularity that's really when we're talking about businesses talking together so let's say there's a joint venture between your company and another company um and you are collaborating on data you're creating some data and they're also adding to it well it's pretty easy to take something like cassandra uh even without astra's you know operational layer and make another data center and say here you can access data center um but in this case we would say okay here's a new api that we created on astra put all your data there we'll also put the data there and we can both do read and write on that data and having not only the access via apis rest apis graphql apis document apis each business can also be accessing that data using cql and if if a company is doing lots of things with data you're not doing analytics by calling rest api right you don't do that you bring the data as close to you as possible whether it's a csv file or a json file that's on disk or you directly talk the database so having that dual access cql and apis uh rest in you know graphical apis allows you to think in a business to business mindset as well and as the business grows and as uh the business starts to talk to other companies partners customers um and starts to install new software eventually the data analytics platform has to support more and more data even though these other software as a service have their own databases even if the platform as a service have their own databases in order to do analytics you have to bring that into one place you cannot do analytics on your whole data set while the data is living in other people's systems you have to bring it you have to make your data warehouse and there are way different ways to do a data warehouse but if you think in terms of a scalable distributed database scalable distributed data storage and streams you can connect all of your applications right message driven through messages so that any change in the business gets not only uh processed into the third-party system but also saved into your astra database or your cassandra database and that mirroring of data whatever transactional system is is doing its job the processor of the stream or the message will make that happen and then whatever is happening uh being saved in your local uh quote unquote local in your cassandra or your asset database that's there for analytics and it'll be kept consistent and if you happen to run your apis on that same astra database then there's no need to replicate that information right most people want to just run their business ideally they want to get the customer deliver the value and get paid so this picture is from 2017 this is just a picture of all the little logos of marketing technology companies right all of these things out there all of these things out there uh have apis this is the uh i think a screenshot of just infrastructure automation companies just one category right so what we were talking about earlier if you're gonna be doing a big transformation it's it's kind of a given that you're going to be using other systems other technologies other software as a service other platform as a service it's a given what you do with the data in those systems to run the business or to run the application is one part of it the other part is what do you do with that data for you to be a smarter company and the only way to do that is to keep a copy of your data in a fast database in a scalable database and how you do that it can be done with different technologies it can be done with different serverless technologies different on-premise technologies but if you go to the service a serverless route uh this idea of having an archive and having a data warehouse of your own information regardless of where the events are coming from whether it's a software as a service an api or a platform as a service having an archetype of your own data allows you in the future to do other things like visualization searching that information sending uh uh doing some predictive or prescriptive analytics on it and sending it as an event back to some other system so how do we do that right it's a big ask how do we do that um so in any transformation the first thing is that you have to have a curated list of systems you can't just use anything out there you have to go through the due diligence of what are we going to use for messaging what are we going to use for documents what are we going to use for the database or the messaging layer right so a lot of the the decisions that we think about from a software perspective they are eventually tied to the enterprise's business software needs right they're going to be using things like dropbox we're going to be using things like uh ibm cloud they're going to be using things like firebase so having that that clear idea of what is a system look like now and then what is it going to look like in the future um you have to have a clean curated list of of systems and then of course you have to work with different experts um you know there's zoho experts that can help you with specifically with zoho integration there's probably salesforce experts you know you're not going to have all that that knowledge in-house um but that connecting it all together is um is a hard uh thing to imagine but if you use everything serverless if you use everything software as a service if you use everything platform as a service and you don't have a central optimized core of the data that is getting updated as things are happening in the business then you don't really have consciousness about your whole business but if you do keep everything you know available uh then you do have consciousness about what's happening in the business and ultimately all this stuff what is it doing it's providing users a way to find analyze and act on that information right that's all we do with information technology all the apps we make people are looking at information they're acting on that information they're either analyzing it because there's some report or they're looking at a document and they're saying i'm going to do this with this right this is why data is at the heart of a modern business no matter where the data starts from eventually the data needs to be brought together it needs to be processed it needs to be organized it needs to be analyzed um so that can be of value to the business as a whole sometimes that value is then distributed back to the users and that requires platform thinking platform thinking is thinking about the business as a platform thinking about the business as you know i always ask clients you know if google was building your platform how would they do it right if facebook was building your platform how would they do it if they were going to be building this application how would they do it so they think big they don't think about 100 users they think about millions of users and so platform thinking requires us to think at scale it also requires us to think about external systems how do we connect with external systems how do we use other platforms and eventually what we want in a modern enterprise is that it is a platform it is a platform that allows people to work together whether they're employees or customers or customers being serviced by employees or if it's a marketplace you know two different parties collaborating on a process we want people to be working on a platform uh because honestly if if you're not thinking towards being a platform company um i think most most people would agree um that that is the way of the future if you're not thinking about being a platform a company then what you should probably consider is being on top of somebody else's platform right using somebody else's platform to do what you need to do so if you're in the game of making software today you're making platforms that run on other people's platforms that's all i have for today uh alex um i don't know if anybody has any questions but the goal was to get people to like look outside right look beyond what they've been doing today and think that yeah and i believe you made it uh thank you so much i don't have any active questions and chat um at least every all the questions we had i've answered already and if there are no more questions coming uh then we are done for today and thank you all so much for attending that was great and thank you so much first of all uh rahul for doing that that was very useful and i found many many important points i will review or reconsider based on your talk it's very fruitful thank you uh there is a question uh adrian farrow asks how do people uh find the best uh people best find for serverless utilities not sure i understand the question sorry so could you repeat that again alex uh how do people best find for serverless utilities i'm not sure i'm ready to answer sorry yeah i don't understand maybe you can rephrase that yep we are global we have people from all the world as we noticed that last week so um yeah maybe if this one can be rephrased we can do better sorry um but ah okay yeah that's better thank you where can i get more information on best utilities uh i mean like i believe cloud tools serverless and so on and so forth so adrian my answer would be i would recommend to take a course on aws or google cloud platform or maybe azure that's the idea of cloud providers is the same and despite different name names and different approaches their services are very often very similar uh so uh even understanding of one single cloud provider it will be enough for you to get a basic understanding and for me i i worked with cloud services for really really long time um for me uh that certification i took for google cloud platform as a professional cloud architect really was a very good course for um how to say to rethink restructure uh the chaotic data i get before and put it in the more structured way so first learn how any of the main major cloud provider works and then therefore maybe raful can suggest something oh yeah no that's a great great start good suggestion about you know starting with one cloud vendor and just you know taking a look at it in fact i would say the reason you want to start with maybe aws lambda is that um they were the first to offer it like the you know the function as a service and then um you know azure start started to offer theirs and then there were these open source ones out there um they have probably the most um usage in terms of like the public internet you'll see that you can find a lot of good examples on github for aws lambda uh there's also good articles on medium for aws lambda and um yeah i totally agree uh so you know beyond the the classes um look on github for examples look on medium or just you know you can google but medium you could just look for aws lambda and the articles on on medium are really really good um the other um kind of way to get into serverless is that serverless framework with a capital s serverless framework it does a little bit of work for you but um it gets you into the kind of the process of writing the function and even though it's doing a lot of the devops stuff for you it's um it gets you into the ecosystem a little bit quicker i would say um but yeah good question uh definitely good question yeah and if you speak russian i would suggest you my own course on amazon web services but well i'm afraid it's not a good match in this case adrian but thank you for a good question yes that's a really a nice point nice to mention uh then i have a question by rahul um as for road 53 service i always see by lagging on some changes and copy to it is any way i can push in far into road 53 so take a look uh yes uh one of the primary uh benefits uh of any kind of a cloud for me is um the ability to manage and change it in the any way i prefer and very often it's not the web interface but api and aws offers incredible api incredibly complex that's total it's not really easy to manage uh but use yes you do can configure route 53 as any other of their services with the use of aws api with the help of their api command line interface with the help in many cases i use terraform to help and configure services the way i need basically now everything what i'm using and what uh we are doing for the workshops infrastructure for example is done with terraform and that's great tool uh which may deserve your attention in the like configuration as a code approach it's incredible i just really like infrastructure as a code approach is great thing uh big help for us okay uh ladies and gentlemen i'm afraid we are done for today it was a great series if you missed it first to talks when go and watch them they're publicly well published and available on our channel i think we will make a playlist for this series so you can find all three of them together uh do we have anything else no i don't think so we don't have new questions so thank you then so much we are done for today a little bit of music for you it's tuesday so there is still a long week ahead go do something great and thank you rahul for being with us and see you again i do hope to see you again next time thank you for having me appreciate it and uh yeah i'll have to brainstorm about what the next series can be so thanks everybody for coming really appreciate it great okay so uh see you all next time thanks alex bye bye bye [Music] the same page [Music] [Music] [Music] you",
