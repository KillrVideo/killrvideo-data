    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show I'm Chris Splinter I'm the product manager of developer solutions at data stacks and this is the host David Gilardi he is a developer advocate and I'm doing the intro because he's been struggling with this aspect of the video today we are going to be talking about Spring Framework and spring data Cassandra and also our job a driver and how those two things play together from data stacks this is the distributed data show we see now more and more people who are using spring with data stacks right so Chris blender can you let I want to talk about this like what are you what are the kind of trends you're seeing you know what are you seeing as far as spring usage data sex yeah it's a good question I think March 26 so I'm safer also you know spring is here very much is and all the conversations I were having with customers I just spread right through that job but that's why they want to use spring is because the spring is here quite literally no so it is a framework that makes boilerplate things a lot easier for developers and we've seen especially with our enterprise focus that a lot of customers they've standardized on the Spring Framework and whether that's spring boot or spring clouds Spring web we see in almost I would say the majority of accounts that are using Java that they're Java shops yeah they're using some pieces of the spring framework so we've been thinking about on the drivers team you know what can we do to make that experience a little bit easier for those users now do you see like do you see this more an enterprise folks do you see this like there are there any particular trends are you just see it all over the place like the spring usage and such I think it's both typically within enterprises you do get more of that we've standardized on this versus startups and smaller companies it's kind of just choose the technology that best suits your needs okay but I mean pivotal has done a great job and if you look at spring there's a huge list of various components that can help with a lot of those boilerplate tasks that you would otherwise have to do manually okay so what what kind of things on you you're talking about how you know we've recognized his days text we've recognized that okay spring is here people are using data stacks right we want to help make developers lives easier with it so what are the types of things that we're doing to to do that thing to do that very thing yes so it's easier that's what I wanted to say lives easier what are the types of things we're doing to make their lives easier that's all we're trying to do right is to make the developers lives easier see how I got that out in one and what is very good I wish I could be you so what we're thinking right now is this face approach where we want to start by just making it easier to plug in our Java driver into the Spring Framework okay so what that means is bringing the configuration of the driver in line with how you would otherwise configure things in spring so let's say that you're using spring boot to bootstrap an application right and you can just go ahead and configure as you normally would for your application using your application yamo or if you want to do it via the the java beans or if you're still using XML you can do it that way and then have those properties pass through to the Java driver so that everything is in that one location and then that'll also give you just the regular access that you would be used to if you were just using the Java driver by itself so we're calling that the spring thin wrapper oh and really I mean in essence what it does is like I said with the configuration but it just is an easier way to auto wire that into your spring application so that's where we're starting okay I mean and that's kind of just to get the feet wet you know and then really what we want to do as part of that what's the end goal right where you pushing it to yeah so the progression you know we're gonna follow a natural progression where once we do release that first piece you know we might also do something like a spring boot starter which pretty much just packages it'll give you like the palm with all the dependencies and packages everything together there for you again we're talking just bootstrapping applications and so and that's something with then we would just like make available to developers or whatever so they use that yeah and their own application it would be something like it right like something very close so they could just get that to get going right it would be more or less like a module or a package that you would either host ourselves or pivotal is actually a technology partner of ours so we'll probably look to reactivate some of those connections that we've been a little bit faster in the past and not so much lately so maybe we'll reach out to them and get that interaction going again just to make sure you know maybe we'll host some things on their site maybe it'll be on our site but that sort of talk ok I think should be had whether or not we even end up doing anything but yeah ok and then like all right so that right there sounds like that is gonna help developers when working with data stash because Sandra be able to get their applications up to speed a lot faster yeah right what about testing right I know I know you did some work that's going on with test harnesses like what's going on there yeah so I've been talking to specific customers about this and we do get questions just like hey is this version of spring does it work with the latest version of the Java driver right and we don't necessarily have the internal tests internal today to stack's tests in place right now to run through those matrices and make sure that everything spring for spring yeah we have nothing that we have too many tests so strictly the Java driver but we want to make sure that we're validating those two technologies coming together ok and through that process I think we'll also really build up our internal knowledge and expertise around spring so that not only can we point to tests that were running on a nightly weekly type basis to say yes those combinations work together but we could since we're familiarizing ourselves with spring and we're already the experts for the Java driver increasing that knowledge of the Spring Framework I think I'll help us help those customers that are already using those two pieces together okay so do you envision then you know once once we've got what we need as far as test harnesses and that can ideal in places that's something that whether it's configuration or something you see us may be releasing publicly as well like again just as like a starter point like for others other developers out who might want to be able to put a test harness in place or um I don't know it's too early to decide what we certainly will do though is make sure that we advertise you know those different versions that work together okay so like will you probably put that on our own website it again spring has been doing this but sometimes like when we just released a new version of the driver driver and we know that that for spring data Cassandra that's going to take some time to upgrade that on the spring side to this new major so again it's more just kind of just joining the pitching in to help or that relationship of those two technologies spring in the java drive okay now you just mentioned something a moment ago yeah that both of us have a history with with regard to spring dating Sandra right so I know in the past I have said many times I've been actually taken aback but I've said many times like alright if you're using spring data Cassandra with data stacks or with Cassandra in general right generally speaking like there's so many like anti-pattern like hard edges like you know things that like fine dolls my favorite example right if you want to go ahead and perform a full scan across your cluster you'd find all right that's but and I know we've talked about this before right and and that was something that I feel like we were both kind of on the same page but that's kind of changing now yeah and I think our stance on spring day to Cassandra is changing not that it was ever bad it's just that it wasn't originally I would say it wasn't really Julie built with say the how do I to put this they wasn't really originally built with Cassandra in mine right it's not where it came from it came from the relational world things are just different there yeah but it sounds like things are changing so what's going on yeah so I'm publicly walking back on my stance before which was very much like don't use spring data Cassandra if you're going to be doing like really fine grained things with our Java driver because I mean it's a data abstraction layer and it it can be familiar to those who maybe were using a relational database they're new to Cassandra but they were using spring with that really databases not work very similar that jdbc type access will look very similar for accessing cassandra right but as we know those are two very different scams right and Nexus patterns aren't really the same right and if you don't know exactly the queries that are happening underneath yourself in some drug I say there's dragons there and yes Big Game of Thrones fan but I mean yeah we've and this is also customer feedback right like we've gotten feedback that you know developer did this all of a sudden we have this huge tombstone problem which is kind of inherent to whenever you use a mapper type object yeah you can you know whenever the queries are being generated for you unexpected things can happen right but it's also fact that spring data has made a lot of progress specifically spring data Cassandra okay okay like that the stance that I had went back a few years and they've really done a good job of patching up a lot of those sharp edges I mean there will still be some that exist just like when I'm when you use that data abstraction layer and aren't truly getting down to the the Java driver itself you you aren't fully going to the length of understanding exam you still need to be aware of what's going on to some right under the hood right right I'd encourage everybody who's using spring data Cassandra to make sure you do the due diligence to find out exactly what is going to happen when I do a save or you do an insert or you know you you're using a batch and is that log door unlocked like that's something take the time to understand exactly what's going to be happening in the Cassandra context right but so along those same lines we've accepted that customers are using it okay you know we've cautioned against it but you know people are using it anyway yeah and there's good reasons right exactly I mean I know we've talked to developers tons of developers at various enterprises and in various places around the country and such where you know you kind of alluded to this earlier where they may have already had spring spring data in well before their Cassandra databases were in place applications that have already implemented this stuff for years they have new developers coming on to the locations they're not just gonna chuck it all because we said he used the Java driver exactly right like they're there they're gonna use what's in there and whether ecosystems already have you know right and we know I mean a lot of people use the Java driver but it's not the most popular API in the world people are used to the JDBC stuff yeah and that's what spring data looks like and so we're walking back that stance both from gang-like just having conversations with people advising people things like that but then through this after we do this you know the spring boot stuff and bringing the Java driver in line with the spring framework and then the tests hardening internally to data stacks for spring like we want to use those phases to potentially craft some sort of a spring data DSC or at least help address some of the sharper edges that are still there in spring data Cassandra and okay again a lot of these plans are just that right now you know we're formulating these plans we're not we haven't actually hit the ground running with any of this stuff and we're still doing a lot of investigation just to make sure we go in the right direction by this is just what I've been thinking about you know well and it's so to that last point there right at this from what you just said what I'm just about to ask maybe a little bit too much crystal ball right but like if you take certain calls like find all are we are we looking to say mitigate the anti-pattern inherent in something like that underneath and and how the DSC driver is handling what spring data is doing or are we looking to actually get in there and make changes to spring data Cassandra and and change how you would access the data I'm assuming it's the former because there's already this is these established patterns right so do we do we already know do we have an idea of like millions of changes no not yet no that's what well it's Chris I have some you can off the top of the head but I don't want to put you don't want to knows if it's realistic or not a nice using that findall example it's like sure do you want it you get one query you want to chop it up and query by specific partitions to a certain limit yes I don't know it's not done enough of ID but maybe there's something that does some type of optimization underneath the hood so someone uses you're not gonna just totally clobber it I would say that's certainly a possibility I see I see but another priority there is making sure that whatever we do do supports both DSC and Cassandra okay because that like right now there's things like DSC authentication and other DSC specific features that you might be using that might not be fully documented on how to get to if you're using spring data or just the Spring Framework yeah right now so we also want to help our customers and people who are using DSC to do those sorts of things either via documentation and examples and things like that as well okay awesome so for those of you guys out there who are either looking at spring to use with your applications and data stacks and Cassandra spring boots bring data Cassandra we've got all sorts of things that are coming your way and if any of those go wrong you mean Chris yeah I accept all blame all right thank you so much Chris really appreciate it thank you you",
