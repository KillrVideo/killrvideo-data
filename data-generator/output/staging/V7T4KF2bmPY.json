    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] welcome to 2018 the distributed data show is back for another year of talking about distributed systems and hopefully we'll have many news and developments and surprises in store for you in this new year I'm Jeff carpenter I'm live in the studio today with Luke Tillman is remote no friends and also joining us from across the nation it's David Gilardi hello well okay so guys new year new possibilities new technology I want you to put your prognosticator hats on I don't know what a prognosticator hat looks like but it looks it might look something like what David is wearing right now and put those hats on and tell us what you think I just want to point out the only one actually wearing a hat I'm wearing just a metaphorical hat so yeah with that being said I think we should maybe let Luke have the first shot at what's on your mind for 2018 so I'm gonna do my best to try and not embarrass myself on this episode first of all I just want to put that out there so we're making technology predictions for 2018 so the one sort of two related things that that I kind of see as trends going on first of all sort of the continued rise of the service mesh so this is kind of a technology that's been around for a little while now has really started to mature you know if anybody's out there listening you don't have any idea what I'm talking about if you want to go kind of do some googling and and kind of like see a couple of examples a couple of projects linker DS been around for a while that's a Scala project kind of built on finagle and some other stuff from the Twitter folks and and then you have envoy which was sort of a C++ project I think from the folks that lift engineering and so that's I think over the last year or so leading into 2018 seen a big uptick in adoption you get a lot of kind of cool things you know patterns and things like circuit breaker and kind of stuff that you would normally see in a micro services deployment along with service discovery and all kinds of other cool features and so I think you're gonna see a continued rise of that of that sort of technology and adoption of that technology and maybe even a little bit of like some service mesh Wars going on like so you kind of saw like somebody had on Twitter called it the service mesh Wars the other day and I was like I don't know that there's really a war going on but so you did see like a brand new one towards the end of 2017 get released from I think the organization was called buoyant and they had they have a new service mesh written in rust called conduit so like you're still seeing alternative projects kind of come up in this space so that's sort of an interesting thing and it's gonna be interesting to kind of watch how that plays out I think over the next write my conduit with rust is because you know those two words the play between them I think it's a little funny it's actually rust is a whole other topic that we could spend a little bit with like with Firefox like you know and like Mozilla inventing that programming language and now like Firefox coming out and being such a big deal and like you know be interesting to see what happens with rust as a programming language over the next year applause and as a random aside by so so I think service mesh and then I also think I think you guys probably touched on it in the Year in Review episode for 2017 so you've seen sort of kubernetes kind of I don't know win for for lack of a better term said that yes did you so so kubernetes has really seen some pretty widespread adoption as far as the orchestration space goes and so you kind of started to see these these technologies kind of converge or win or kind of you know like people like some of the larger companies kind of settle on okay this is sort of the way forward in these various spaces and so I think what you're gonna see is sort of a the search for the higher level abstraction above you know these lower level building blocks for micro-services architectures and micro service deployments so a good example of a project I think that's trying to do that right now is sto there's that's is T i/o if you want to go and Google and look them up and they're kind of trying to fit these different pieces together so you know you've got maybe kubernetes for the orchestration piece and envoy as the proxy and you know you need to use say common thing like certificate rotation of your of your SSL certificates and and kind of trying to fit together these kind of lower-level components into a higher level abstraction that people can use to actually build micro services deployments kind of make it easier because you know while we've kind of settled on some of the lower level building blocks I don't think you know kubernetes is gonna be the be-all end-all sort of control plane for this or you know that kind of thing so I think you're gonna I don't know if this vo is gonna be the thing or if it's gonna be there there'll be some other projects that come out but I think you're gonna start to see this trend towards you know okay well what's the next level up because you know as as developers and engineers we love we love abstractions so sometimes sometimes they're even useful and not just for the sake of abstraction yeah exactly I resemble that nice and I think what you're saying is true Luke about sto I had sort of seen that start to emerge in the later months of 2017 as kind of like an early leader in that category as something that really kind of fit that space in around where at what kubernetes was giving you with in terms of scheduling but then you know there's still this component that we need with respect to ideas like circuit breakers and also traffic routing which is a great enabler for being able to do a/b deployments and you know more kind of continuous delivery types of solutions and then this conduit project popped up and I was like oh okay so we may have a little bit of you know give-and-take so this would be fun area to watch yeah and and you know it's interesting because they haven't you know while there while early on at least with this tio they've kind of kind of settled on some of the leaders in the space you know they do kind of mention that that they're meant to be an abstraction and so you know for example if you don't want to use kubernetes if you want to use something like missus as your you know sort of orchestration or resource management kind of layer you know you may see you know you may see plugins and things to support sort of other underlying you know other underlying kind of pieces of that that ecosystem so a pivotal Cloud Foundry for example you know as you're sort of as you're orchestration framework instead of instead of kubernetes although they do even pivotal it's like they have little kubernetes service so good burnett ease is really like eating the world as far as that space goes so yeah yeah there really is sort of this mix-and-match type of behavior going on and I think it's even really interesting how the cloud native competing foundation is accepting multiple projects that do equivalent functionality they're just kind of letting it all incubate and seeing what rises to the top and you know maybe there is a place for multiple of these frameworks all right so I'm gonna take a turn here and talk about a 20-18 trend that I see emerging and we started to see the beginnings of this in 2017 in terms of companies adopting not just one cloud provider but multiple cloud providers and of course we've historically had a lot of companies keeping certain things on-premises but now we are seeing companies that are clients of multiple clouds and the different cloud providers are differentiating themselves based on what kind of more value-added services on top of the core infrastructure that they're providing so one of the things that I think there is a big need for is if I if I do make this choice let's say as an Enterprise Architect that I'm going to deploy and I'm going to deploy my services in multiple clouds and I'm going to make use of managed services for multiple cloud providers how am I really going to stay on top of all of that and really understand you know where all my data is and where all my business capabilities are and which of them are up and sort of managing the relationship between all of this stuff it might be easy for me to say okay I'm gonna run all my operational stuff in one loud and then you know dump a bunch of data I'm on AWS I'm gonna double a bunch of stuff in s3 buckets and then I'm gonna use maybe google's AI machine learning kind of stuff on top of that and maybe that makes sense but the dividing lines I think or the boundaries aren't gonna always be so clean yeah I think it kind of ties in even to the point we were just talking about like you know like sort of that next layer abstraction you know like what are what are people that don't want to standardize on a single cloud vendor you know or don't want to do vendor lock-in you know and want to do multi cloud you know what's gonna be the piece of technology that sort of enables them or like what are the pieces of technology that are gonna enable them to do that and I don't have a name for it yet maybe we should make one up you know there are some stuff out there you know that kind of cloud multi-cloud abstractions but yeah I don't know what it is that's gonna win well you know David I know you have some thoughts about this area as well oh you know my mind really get into you know going to the question of what are we gonna do with like all this data right some of the emerging trends like some of the stuff we've had some pop movement this year with regard to like machine learning and that some of the machine learning algorithms are particularly data hungry and and now right that we've had this this emergence of all this just huge amounts of data um that has kind of enabled that to kind of move forward and that ties into AI like for decades for decades we've been talking about AI always AI but it never really has started to emerge and now you see a lot more complex algorithms for machine learning that are that are coming out a lot more use of machine learning in all sorts of different areas like I'm thinking automated cars for one you know army to driving that can ideal there are other areas lots of the conferences I've been to this year I've seen almost always there's there's some talk on machine learning somewhere right I think we've finally hit a threshold where that that's actually gonna really start to take off more than than what we've seen before and then something that's kind of related to that or will be potentially in some for the future and part that gets me like really excited quantum computing hmm um so for the longest time this has been theoretical totally theoretical stuff right it is happening it is absolutely happening there are a whole set of vendors right now that even have like you know Hanteo qubits processor that they processors that they have and was kind of funny as a lot of them right now the processors are really really tiny but they have like a whole room that looks like some of the old supercomputers it's all for the cooling Abi's a lot of them are being cooled now to almost absolute zero but all of that the whole point is that it's actually happening there are real quantum computers that are starting you know that are that are being produced that are being used and that capability is look is looking in 2018 to like really jump from having maybe a handful of qubits to having maybe 20 or 50 or something like that as a single processor so that's I think another area that's gonna be oh so nice well we haven't given you a chance David to share kind of one of your own I know you were just kind of riffing off of my idea before so what's a let's blow you to start from scratch the field is green it's 2018 what do you think the big trend of 2018 is well let's see if we're gonna start from scratch 2018 well this is gonna sound a little old an old hat maybe and and I'm I'm a previous operations guys so this is kind of like one of those things that you know I have a kind of a kindred relationship with if you will I mean you know for look for a while now we've seen you know the emergence of you know containers and in things you know container a services and such like that things like docker and you know not only that you have you have things managed cloud services right where you know there's a lot of these white fluff services that are essentially they're gonna manage all of your cloud needs for you and so on and so forth and what's it what that's done is it's kind of taken I think the pitch I've heard anyway a lot of businesses is you no longer need operations right you don't need you don't need these folks will do all this for you hmm but I think I think what we might start seeing is I think that's gonna start to move back and I think we're gonna see some of the need for operations and operate people come back because at the end of the day and I know this at least for me personally and the things that I'm working on as a developer right it's great to have these systems where I can just spin up you know a whole surface implementation but I still need to be able to see what's going on when I'm coding when I'm testing when I'm trying to you know you know kind of improve or enhance performance things like that I still need visibility I have to see what's going on I've got to have some uh knowledge of what's going on there in the operational levels so I actually think we're gonna see like kind of a a push back to may be old hat operations type needs but stacked on top of the tech the new technically will ya know I think you're right David I think that the nature of what those operations engineers are doing is gonna start to change and it it's not gonna be on the level of managing individual instances so much anymore we've already started to move away from that quite a bit but more it's like you're saying to kind of seeing what the overall trends are just at a higher level of abstraction once again thanks rocky you know and to that point what you were just saying they're about no longer being on like the level of managing individual instances I think I think you're absolutely right um you know there are more and more services out there now where we are talking about hundreds or thousands of devices that may be clustered or something like that you can't possibly go and you know manage every single one of those individual devices or nodes or whatever and the scale at which these are starting the these are really you know starting to push into um is just gonna change I think you're right it's gonna change the nature of operations and what that means I think the name of the game though is probably like just to refine your point a little bit like not the co-opt your point but these do but like I think like you the key word you used was visibility and and I always like to say observability right like I think that's still gonna be the name of the game and you know hopefully that's the trend we see is more and more sort of observability so as a developer or as person you know whether I'm whether I specialize in write writing code or or whether I specialize in systems the system side of things or whether I'm somewhere in the middle you know like observability is the biggest thing you know what's being able to see what's going on on my systems right you for make my point better than I did and like observability and just to unpack what that what that really means or at least were what I hope we're I hope we're going is really that ability to correlate cause and effect of you know different symptoms that we might be observing at different layers of our stack and to really tie those all together and really say you know you this slowness that you're observing on the website well the root cause of that is threefold and three these are the three factors that are really contributing together to produce that slowness just for for an example like if we can get to that really to that level of observability so not just looking at log data but again beginning to apply some of this machine learning technology to really you know the last time you had this problem it was these factors that were involved you might want to again look in these areas that's gonna be really super helpful one of the things that that we tend to do this being the distributed data show is that we do talk a lot about the data tier although we've spent a lot of time today kind of pushing up into that service tier of our applications but let's open up the aperture a little bit what technologies are out there that are really coming to the forefront in 2018 all right so I'm gonna jump in and I want to give I'm gonna give the front end side of things a little bit of love because they are absolutely part of when you're building a distributed system the client totally counts right oh yes it's one one thing that I think is really interesting to watch and kind of exciting is so towards the end of 2017 you finally saw the browser vendors standardize on web assembly so web assembly if you're out there listening and you don't know what I'm talking about you can think like assembly language like you might be familiar with you know sort of a binary format you know from your server-side code days but this is one that can in a browser right so this is one that can run in any of the major web browsers and so the idea is to be able to take you know C or C++ or rust right now also is another rust came up again here but the those three languages are kind of supported for sure right now and be able to compile those into assembly that can then run in a web browser and it kind of opens the door to all kinds of super interesting you know kind of native like you can actually get sort of native performance in a web browser so it opens the door to all kinds of super interesting like visualizations and and CPU intensive tasks and you know things that essentially you couldn't do with just JavaScript before in a web browser it's you're basically going to be able to call these native modules you know from HTML and JavaScript code and it really opens the door to all kinds of interesting possibilities maybe more native type experiences so I know a lot of people have been kind of predicting maybe this might be the the beginning of the end for the for the native app you know mobile app experience because the web the NIA the mobile web will actually maybe be able to compete finally with that sort of fluid experience that you're used to getting from a native app so it'll be really interesting to see I think you're going to see a really big explosion of sort of new uses and and new maybe frameworks or something it'll be interesting to watch and see if you see other languages come come along so right now you know you can do C C++ and rust it'll be to see if you if you get maybe cross compiling from other languages that already have a VM so for example Java with the JVM or C sharp with the CLR you know whether or not you'll you'll see them do some sort of attempt to bring the bring the VM sort of along into the into the web assembly world or if you'll see some sort of compatibility shim where you can write you know code in the language but but they don't they don't actually bring the virtual machine along they figure out some sort of compatibility shim that kind of gives you the same thing when you're running in in Chrome v8 or whatever so yeah it's gonna be a really interesting space to watch with the web web assembly stuff I didn't even know this is a thing until you just started talking about it I feel like I feel like some we've come full circle now and we're gonna be at conferences again with guys talking text to each other right just it feels like it feels like it's just I think we've made some kind of like tech loop that has spanned decades or something in it and it finally just looped back in itself I wonder if this is the this is what we're the repeats gonna be so yeah my conspiracy theory because because it is a one of these preview episodes I feel like I need to throw in a conspiracy theory so what do you think about webassembly as a major enabling technology for crypto jacking I'm thinking I have even less ability to see what this code I downloaded is doing in my browser now that it's all this binary webassembly stuff what's it really doing is it is it mining digital currencies who knows I don't know what it's doing well you know they do say that one of the one of the things is being able to essentially do the same thing you could do now in your browser and do a view source and be able to see all of the all the code you know so there's but yeah I don't know you're right I mean people are already we're doing that with with like mining Bitcoin and stuff in the browser's I guess that's happening with JavaScript exactly and so guys I just want to throw this out there as one more one more prediction because I know we're getting ready to wrap up I think this is finally the year of Linux on the desktop I know we've been saying this three years I thought you were gonna say something about the Browns I was gonna be about the Browns you know you know it's funny though the year of Linux on the desktop is happening because Microsoft started really putting a lot of effort into windows subsystem for Linux and so the year of Linux on the desktop is actually when you have a Windows machine and you're running all right when a Lichtman comes back and it's on all of the different OS platforms I'll agree nice well I can tell that we're about to by a lot of control so this much time for us to bring this episode to a close we're interested in your thoughts about what do you think are the big trends of 2018 so make sure that you can follow up with us in comments on YouTube or join us in our data sax academy slack we have a distributed data showroom all set up there what are the topics that you want to hear about in 2018 help us help you thanks for joining us and until next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think you can also find us on the data Stax
