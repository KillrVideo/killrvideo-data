    "text": "[Music] now let's talk about our final type of index an edge index which is another form of vertex centric index again unlike vertex indexes which are global indexes edge indexes will be beneficial along the traverser route edge indexes are going to be useful when traversing through a specific vertex with a large number of incident edges you'll have to know the name of the edge label as well as have a property with specific values or ranges of values again edge indexes are implemented using a specialized version of materialized views within apache cassandra let's take a look at some example queries that would take advantage of an edge index for example you can find how many users rated a particular movie with a known rating or you can find movies rated above a certain threshold by a given user id let's look at how to create the edge index as well as use it here we see the index two users by rating so we can see that a vertex centric index is specific to a vertex in this case movie we call it two users by rating and we index the in edges to movie by rating let's take a look at how we can do this with movie m267 let's get a count of the users who rated this film with a rating of eight next let's find the movies rated by a particular user with a rating over seven first let's take a look at how to create the schema for this index we start with a vertex label user we add an index and name it two movies by rating let's take a look at the schema creation code for edge indexes the index is based on the user vertex and we index the outgoing edges of type rated by its rating property now let's take a look at how we can use the index to find movies that user u1 rated with a rating over 7. we can take a look at what we've created with a general schema.describe or list the schema information specifically by the movie vertex label and like our other indexes we can drop each of these edge indexes as a final step now that we've covered edge indexes let's go back to our notebook and go through an exercise",
