    "text": "all right so hello everyone welcome this is week six of our uh i believe eight-week series on basically building an app with cassandra a cloud native application um this week has me super excited this is where we actually start to get cloud native with it um we're basically taking everything we've done so far and we're saying hey how do we actually do this with containers and kubernetes and all those good things that actually make it kind of a modern application so super excited today hopefully you guys can all get some good good info out of this and then um of course we will have all the homework and everything as well so a little bit of housekeeping before we get started i'm joined today by the team uh basically everyone you see here we got a bunch of advocates we've got some community people and as you can see we're all global everywhere from the u.s uk australia and even france and uh germany yeah well yeah he's in germany but he's got the uh all right so um my name is eric zeitlow um i'm right there uh eric utilo from america and i'm joined here today by cedric say hi cedric hi hi i'm pretty happy to be here with you yeah awesome with a back session again today yeah yeah we'll see if we can get through it i'll try to be on time for y'all this week um you know we'll try to make it through the content um one thing i will mention is if you want to stick around after the session we'll take a five minute break at the end and then um we'll actually come back on and kind of have a bit of a ask me anything uh session for probably about a half an hour or so um after the session so feel free to stick around ask questions get some info you know just sit around and chat with us it's all good so all right so week six uh our app in kubernetes last week we covered cassandra in kubernetes now we're kind of putting it all together and we're spinning up this entire thing in kubernetes so we're going to do some cassandra we're going to do our application and it's all going to be you know in kubernetes running so really really cool stuff all right housekeeping um lots of things you're going to want to have available one of them is the live stream you're either watching this on probably twitch or youtube we get by far more viewers on youtube than we do on twitch but they are both there and available for you uh we have our discord which we can post the links for the discord in the chat right now um discord is basically a place where you can interact with us yeah especially throughout the week when we're off uh off of the live stream or offline we are accessible on discord i highly recommend you check that out and of course comments in the uh the chat windows on either twitch or youtube we can also interact with you there materials are all up on github and we'll cover that kind of as we're going through the the live hands-on portion but the github has everything from all of the weeks it's all pretty easy to navigate it's all right there at your fingertips so i highly highly suggest checking that out um i do have a couple of word here if you don't mind eric so uh first last week we know that we ask you to run pretty heavy process and workload so if you were running on your laptop yes sorry about that it was a lot of resources needed you know like 8 gigabytes of ram and a lot of stuff to download so don't worry today it will be less less demanding less resource consuming yeah and just another note on that um different from last week we're not going to actually have you guys work the hands-on portion along with me i'm going to work the hands-on portion and interact with you guys um and then we'll actually give you cloud instances if you need them or if you have the laptops you can do the homework uh portion we're assigning it to you as homework instead of kind of do it along with me here so yes exactly so uh last week we tried to just postpone cloud instance provisioning just for you to see what's going on instead of try trying to understand all the commands and we feel that it works uh very well so here you can totally attend what what we are doing and later during the week do the exercise exactly awesome so with that um one last thing i'll cover here is data stacks community highly highly recommend you check that out that is another way you can interact with us we got eric ramirez on there all the time giving answers bettina is also um you know just an absolute champion on that so check it out uh if you haven't seen it ask questions get involved and let us know what you think of these sessions we we love feedback we love talking but about these things to you guys so hit us up all right we have a mentee i'm gonna pass it off here yes better take it away yes you do and you know speaking of mentee and just posing here i will wait you uh to be ready just please thumb up so today we're doing the two hour session as usual and we will do a pose five minute pose and then we will be together again for 30 minutes if you want and this is ask me anything question okay me and eric reading all your questions on discord um and on youtube trying to figure this out as much as we can okay we we try that today something new let's see how it goes awesome all right so we're going to dive right into it here there's going to be a bunch of review from the last couple weeks that's okay we'll blow through it real quickly and then we'll get into that like kind of hands-on live demo portion of this so just stick with me through this and we'll get there all right so quick recap containers versus virtual machines containers are essentially the a very similar concept but they don't have their own os they're running their whole it's not a whole computer in a box it is a bit of a computer what you need to actually run your application it essentially allows you to have a much lighter um resource i call called entity um but still keep things uh separated and keep uh nice buckets to store everything and keep all nice and clean so containers are a good thing docker docker is used for a lot of container management these days uh docker is kind of the the one that everyone has heard of um or most people have heard of um there are other things out there but by and large docker is is the big one on the block um images versus containers we're actually going to work with both of those today so i'm not going to dive too deep into that here but just understand that images are basically the template and a container is the the actual object itself it's the thing that is running that you are doing things with all right so docker commands uh you should be pretty familiar with these at this point uh we are gonna be using docker build today we are going to use uh we're not going to use docker run we are going to talk about docker run um because it is basically the way you would actually run a docker container inside of docker we're actually going to be running docker containers inside of kubernetes today so that's kind of where we're going to diverge a little bit and there's a lot of other things you can do with docker as well all right so applications in containers um essentially the container itself is like a application in one sense from the operating system standpoint it's a it's a um thing that lives within your operating system on the host machine uh it gets to take resources from the host machine it gets to use different parts of the host machine to do its thing but essentially it is this little self-contained application that's running in its own little environment out on your machine cassandra docker this was last week got a couple slides here on this one um wasn't actually very hard to set up once you understood what was going on and you'll even see when we get into the hands-on portion we're going to set it up again but it's going to be really really quick it's going to be like you know a slide and a half not going to take long at all um basically once you get a couple config values down you can just spin this guy right up and you're good to go all right kubernetes what is kubernetes kubernetes is that thing that allows us to manage a wide variety of resources across multiple actual servers as a resource pool and run our containers in that resource pool really really useful it also does a lot of provisioning stuff it allows you to do scaling it has some self-healing features and then there's a whole bunch of service discovery stuff that it can do as well it's really really cool and it takes a lot of those what historically have been more complex operations problems and it puts them into a very manageable context for us to work with so really really cool tool and we'll be taking advantage of that here today okay kubernetes infrastructure we have our control plane this is basically the thing that manages our kubernetes cluster uh we have our worker nodes the worker nodes are essentially the things that are actually running the stuff so that's where you know our app is going to live that's where our cassandra is going to live it's all going to live out on the worker node today we're only going to do an example using kind and we're going to have a single worker node just so that we can basically not overload anyone's laptop but if we wanted to we could go out there and have you know a hundred worker nodes and they would all be managed by the kubernetes control plane all right so um not gonna dive too deep into this one but basically just understand that kubernetes is not just a single piece it's not just a single uh thing it actually is made up of a lot of building blocks itself it's got fcd for its back in store it's got a scheduler of course the controller manager um and then it's actually got an api server that the rest api server and then i believe cube ctl is also uh connected in there to let us interact okay we've got a whole bunch of terms here the main one i'm going to be using today is actually pod we've covered all this before um the pods are basically what we're going to be spinning up in our kubernetes and these pods will contain our application or the various parts of our application and we'll actually go through and view some of those what while they're running and view what kind of they look like yeah the other thing we're going to be using a lot of today is the namespace now again we covered this uh last week but a namespace just for a quick recap is basically a container that you store uh different pods in it's a way to differentiate um different things that you're running so this week we're actually going to be running um our cassandra over in one po uh namespace and our application in another namespace and we'll we'll show you what that looks like but essentially it's a way to divide those two pieces up into their own little safe sections and we can interact between them yes and it's all logical nothing to do about the infrastructures the namespace run across multiple workers don't don't think about that but the best practice is having a namespace for each application this is what we will do yeah i see a comment here namespace is like a virtual subnet kind of if we think of it in the non-networking term yeah it's basically a different set of buckets just like a subnet would be it's different set of buckets that you can store different things in and keep track of those buckets so yeah that's actually kind of a good analogy okay so we have storage now this again is from last week where we were talking about storage classes and how you don't want ephemeral storage and non-persistent storage if you're storing stuff in a database now for our application that's totally fine because we aren't actually storing any local data we are we are doing database requests and that's all being stored in our database so we don't have to worry so much about creating persistent volumes or anything like that because it's not something we're really gonna deal with essentially our containers are running in ram so if they go away that's fine we spin up another one and they have access to the database with all the same data we were using so really really good thing to know i'm not going to affect us too much today but um it is there so just understand it all right yeah uh just with a good question about storage uh you know we tends to say uh to get better performance with cassandra you need to use local attached disk you know don't leverage on sun or any replication let cassandra do the replication for you well in cloud providers you will see multiple storage class and some storage class are really you know um pretty pretty fast you know ssd maybe not attached but that's still pretty uh yeah pretty good for for workloads so we are not very afraid about running higher workload against uh kubernetes you will scale out anyway right right that's an excellent point yeah and the whole thing um cassandra and sand has been a topic i think since day one of cassandra's existence um there's a ton of blog posts and stuff on that if you're ever curious about why that's a bad idea uh you know bring it up in the ama if anyone wants to hear it um lean dive in or there's blog posts if you want to search those out yourself but it's kind of an interesting topic okay so this basically is what our cassandra setup is going to look like yeah this is what we did last week yeah and yeah just because we will everything that you show will be just a small piece of the of the schema later on and you will recognize what we are doing right and all of this is basically going to be obfuscated today under i think it's like five different commands and it will yes and we are doing a single node okay we don't want to crush your laptop today right absolutely no probably use neither graffana so see the big stuff is now on the on the top uh hand corner cast operator is its own namespace and today with the namespace my app will create pod for backend frontend exposport and provide a config yes and all of that will run through all those files what that all looks like but essentially from the the person who's managing this standpoint we want it to just be a list of you know a few commands they have to run to scale this or to update this or to to kind of make any change here should be very very easy for them kind of taking most of the operations out of that and letting kubernetes do the heavy lifting for us so okay if we were to go out and we were to build this out and deploy it in a production environment it would probably look something like this with our application having multiple instances we have a load balancer in front of that um we have uh the cassandra out there we kind of have this huge huge construct um you're probably not going to run that on your laptop so what we're actually gonna do today is a little bit um a little bit easier than that um if you did want to connect this to astra it would look something along these lines where we have our application running and you can have your connection going out to astra and i'll cover how you can do that i'm not going to do this today but i did want to bring it up just so you guys can be thinking about it and then what we're going to do today is we're going to set it up so that both the cassandra and the app are running in kubernetes and you know what i just realized with this slide we should put nice little name space boxes around these so that we could see more clearly how things are differentiated but essentially it's just two namespaces and we're actually going to be running our cassandra right next to where our application is running all right so what you're going to need to actually do this is your laptop or a cloud instance now as we said before please don't do these exercises while i'm doing them uh please interact ask questions be involved um you know while i'm doing the exercises and showing you on screen but if you're you're work trying to work along with us it's probably you're probably going to get less out of it so please that's your homework for this time is to go out and do what you see here today so i believe we have a cloud is it a cloud instance registration form if you need one of those is that correct setter yep exactly so below the video there is a form to request the cloud instance and we will launch all the provisioning let's say tomorrow morning perfect wonderful and then you'll be able to use those to do everything you've seen here okay now we're getting into it so i'm going to run through the slides show you all the commands because talk about them a little bit not going to dive in too deep but just kind of give you a little bit of a precursor and then we're actually going to get hands on and we're going to do it so let's let's get to it all right so running your application right now you basically have to do something along these lines where you go in you're going to set up your env file you're going to do your install your run start for your ui and then depending on if you're doing python or java there's a list of commands you'd have to run to actually get this application running that's basically running on bare metal there's no containerization there's nothing special going on it's just hey look i have an application running there's you know here's where the ui is here's where the the back end is it's all talking it's working now if we simplify this with docker and kubernetes it's going to look more complex but what's actually going on from a management standpoint once it's all set up is going to be very very easy and you'll see that when we actually just kind of boil it down it ends up being a very short list of commands you have to run it to get this whole thing you know deep revision provision scale updated it's just super super simple so we're going to get into that all right docker files docker files are essentially the template instructions for your container they are what your if you're using docker or if we're doing the kubernetes they are using these docker files to determine how is this thing being built what is it going to be running what are the dependencies it needs what is the environment it needs notice like right there in the python we have that very first line from python alpine 3.7 is setting up the python environment for us we aren't having to go out and do that do all our configuration get that running it just does that if it's a python environment is what this will be running in and it understands that we set up our working directories right there with the copy and the working directory and then you can even see we're running our pip install off our requirements.txt exposing our port and we're basically good to go and i just realized i got ahead of myself here so picking apart the python docker files so again setting up our environment setting up our work directories running our dependencies exposing our ports and actually running the application so basically command python boom calling whatever that entry point was which in this case is our getting started with astro.py file and our application is up and running okay how do we do that well it's quite simple we run a pseudo docker build and what that does is that takes that docker file and it creates an image and that image if you remember we mentioned this before is a template it's an instruction set that can be consumed to create a container so we're going out and we're building that image then we do a docker run and that will basically take that image and it will turn it into a container it will use it to build a container so really really good to understand the difference between an image and a container the building of the container uses the image and the the building of the image uses a docker file just a nice little progression okay so we have that up and running great but what about kubernetes we said we were gonna do kubernetes yes okay so if we had our docker uh running our containers that's that's on one box that's not really across multiple servers it's not you know a really cloud native solution that's simply living on some box somewhere and running these little containers in this box but what if we have this gigantic resource pool and and that's what we're actually trying to run our application on so we have say like 100 servers up in aws so we're trying to do an at scale production application well this is where kubernetes shines because we can set up everything as a giant kubernetes resource pool and use what we need to spin up our apps and scale things accordingly um right so to get basically last week up and running and you're going to see i've said it was super simple it's these commands literally all we're going to do today to get our kubernetes up and running is this small set of commands you guys believe it took us two hours to cover these commands last week yeah but and now hopefully having gone through that you understand what they're actually doing i i i'll touch on it very briefly but i'm not gonna you know if you're if you're curious go watch week five it's all there it's good content and it should explain pretty much everything here yeah we're boiling we do have time we can go back and explain things and for non-native english speaker we will you know slow down try to speak not too fast sometimes we just rush everything let's go for it okay yeah i'll try to slow it down a little bit oh you pick my little dark secret message in there right sorry i get excited about this stuff i talk fast oh back to this slide okay um yeah we did that last week yep just showing you see there's our configuration and what that sets up again is this right here what you see we got a node we got all of our cassandra configuration we've got all of that stuff that you need to make the cassandra cluster run we've now condensed down into like six commands so really really cool all right building and loading your docker images now we talked about docker build um docker build is still a step here we still need to take that docker file and build out our images and then what you see here um there what you see here is that the last two lines the kind load docker image is it's literally going out it's grabbing that docker image and it's putting it into our kubernetes now you'll notice the uh docker build lines they both have this dash t and then they have that astra dash ui colon my image we are tagging those images with an identifier that kind can take as used to pull that image so you see we're actually calling that tag where we do the kind load docker image and then we have that that tag listed out and that's how we are we're kind of doing the handoff series all by these tags so really really important if you did just a docker build and you didn't put that dash t on the end it would actually work it wouldn't error out on you but you couldn't then just go and take kind load docker image and load that image so make sure you're taking your images make sure you don't miss that stuff it's critical yes okay so yeah so um with docker you build the image so remember this is a template so the template is now on your machine and what you want you want to upload the image where kind can find it this is what we call a docker registry and the most famous is docker hub but yeah we won't download from docker we are creating something custom so docker build create custom image for your app locally and kind load upload those image to the kind cluster so it can take a bit of time you know depending on how much library you need to make your app running so for instance the java backend is a spring boot application with a lot of dependencies the image we are creating is about said 700 megabyte so we take a few seconds maybe minute to make this image upload into the kind and when it's in kind it's pretty easy to start up from you know the instantiate the image to create containers absolutely and and it's important to note here one of the nice things about us creating these local images is then we don't have to wait for the network to catch up when we actually go and do our our stuff here because we don't have to pull from docker we eat enough your networks i guess yeah you can thank us later yeah all right then what we're gonna do after we've set up uh ever we've loaded those into time we actually have some configuration to do it now this is all very kind of meat and potatoes for this week this is stuff that we've gotta we we really need to understand what's going on here so the first command you see there the cube ctl gets secret and then we have this you know super user and the name space dash n is always name space and kubernetes so we're going to cast operator name space which is the one we're running cassandra in and then we're basically spitting out a yaml um what we're doing there is we're actually trying to get the operating password for the database because we need to be able to connect to this database and since this database actually spins up a pretty much randomized password we need to be able to retrieve that so that's gonna actually spit out a very long file but the the part we care about is that data tag and then obviously we see password and username in there for the more astute view you might notice that that is looks a whole lot like a base64 encoded string and you would be entirely correct which means the next step is going to be a basically decoding that string and that will spit out our password so we're going to use the command right here with obviously base64 dash d and then we will get our string back yes okay and depending on the base 64 version command line somebody told us that sometimes you need to do dash capital d but yeah yeah and i'll actually run into that today when i'm doing the command um because i believe it's the version of base64 i'm running on my mac um is looking for the capital versus the lowercase so we'll we'll definitely hit that today okay yes all right then what we do is we got to set up our schema because the database is no good if we can't use it so we're going to go in to the actual uh kubernetes node you can see there the cube ctl exact and then we're actually going to go into the a bash terminal just like you would on any linux box should feel exactly the same and you see there at the end of the command the bin bash that's basically what we're saying is gonna be a bash terminal um and then we're going to see qlsa chan and we're just going to straight up paste our schema into sql osh because why not you know we can do that we could also write something to do it for us but there's really no point we can we can do it very easily by hand um all right so all this comes together in the configmap.yaml because sigma.yaml is basically the file that says here's all of our configuration here are all of these things that are you know environmental variables all of these individual values that our application is going to need to run the way we want it to run so your configmap.yaml may not look the same as myconfigmap.yaml and it probably won't because your your database password will be different your you know you might have named your key space something else or your connection points almost certainly aren't going to be the same although we'll get into kind of a cool little thing we can do with connection points in a few minutes here um the one thing i really would like to point out you guys is you notice that use astra uh value there we've set it to false for today so if you wanted to go through and you wanted to set this all up and use after kind of like we have in previous weeks you could just change that to true and then most of the other values that are in that file you wouldn't actually need to put there because they will just you know it'll it'll just not look for them it'll use astra you do that whole um drop your secure connect bundle into the ui thing that we've done a few times already and it's good to go but for this week since we're doing everything local we're changing that default and then we gotta fill out our connection points and usernames and passwords and all that stuff so okay so at this point what we have is we basically have two namespaces and we have our configuration now we don't have our app up and running we don't have any other pods living in the same space we just have this configuration in this name space that is saying hey i'm a config i'm available for any pods that need me and we'll get into how we connect that those pods to that config here all right so then we have two yammels we have the back in the ammo and the ui yellow now the back end is obviously our back end that's the java or the python process that we've done in previous weeks and when we go and we build that docker we do the docker build command you'll notice that under containers and the image we have that peg we've we've actually we're basically pulling that by tag um and and it's linking up with the yaml there we've also exposed our ports so we don't have to do that manually in our our process here we're going to expose some ports from kind out but these these ports on these images are actually being set up in the ammo here and then at the very very bottom this is kind of a secret sauce sort of thing but not really secret we have our ian's from and we're referencing our config map if you remember we named our configmap actually i'm going to go up to it just so we can see uh under the name we named it env config and we're referencing that and since we're spinning these up in the same name space they're gonna be able to see that it's gonna be available to them and they're gonna pull everything we have listed out there in variables they're going to pull those all as environmental variables for those containers so super super cool super powerful when you're actually trying to run this app maybe in different environments or maybe with different back ends or however it is you want to do it super super powerful there okay so then excuse me goodness then what we have is a namespace we now have our config we have our back end running and we have our astra ui running so everything we need to have a working app is now in the same space pretty cool and it was only basically three configuration files we had to set up to do that all right when we actually create that namespace it's it's a really simple command it's the the cube cto create ns or namespace my app and then you'll notice all of our following commands where we're uh applying these ammos we're doing that dash and my app that's saying use the same space and apply that you know the configmap.yaml the ui and the backend.yamls we're just going to apply them in that namespace and kubernetes knows what to do with them it actually goes out and spins up all the resources and spins up everything it needs to have those things running and we didn't have to do any of that configuration it just does it for us again kubernetes makes life simple not more complex yes and in the yaml file we did not define the namespace and as there is no namespace in the yaml we can deploy these resources so in kubernetes we talk about resources in any namespace so these commands say please deepline everything you find in completemag.dml into the namespace my app yeah so we don't have to call it my app we could call it you know pretty much anything we want as long as we do the create the name space then we reference that you know that same name in our commands and we're actually applying things absolutely okay last step is going to be forwarding our ports and this is literally just saying hey namespace my app we gotta forward some ports open so we can hit them from the outside uh our browser we're actually gonna go in and we're gonna hit both of these once we're done and you're gonna see the back end running you're gonna see ui running boom good to go awesome all right so now we get to go in and we actually get to do what we just talked about if i'm talking too fast slow me down guys i will super excited all right so i'm going to go over here to my ide now what you're going to need if you haven't already done it um you're going to want to get pull everything from this week so just most of you have downloaded this repo at some point um you know get check out um just do a get pull and get everything current because we were literally making changes up to the last minute to make sure it was the best content possible so make sure what a disclaimer i don't want to watch you anymore now [Laughter] okay so demo mode with last minute edits totally fine with 3754 people watching so yeah good luck yeah so they'll get to laugh if i mess up all right so we're gonna go into week six here and you're gonna notice uh we have actually i should expand this so you guys can see it a little bit is that big enough for everyone there can they all say all right this one in the youtube comments let me know um for me it looks big enough but uh waiting for people to just see if the font is big enough okay yeah uh well i'm not seeing anyone in youtube complaining about it so i know it's good okay yeah we should be good yeah all right okay looks good we got legs good let's working like java everything is good until you got an exception right all right so we're gonna have uh the java backend here which has its own folder we're gonna have the python backend here which also has its own folder and then we have the ui which again its own folder you'll notice there's a sneaky little other folder in here called cube files which wasn't there in previous weeks this has all of our kubernetes ymls in it everything we need from for our cassandra everything we need for our application and these are what we're going to be editing today to make the kubernetes work the way we want it to so you'll notice they've got numbers on the front these are steps so you start with one move to two three four five six seven and we have our app so basically seven steps right there's a little more to it than that all right so let's go over if you're looking at the github you're going to want to be in the datastax academy cassandra workshop series uh github and then go down to the week 6 apps in kubernetes folder we're going to go ahead and click on that now the readme here has all the instructions and that's what we're going to be using today to go through each of the steps so you can read along with me or you can just watch but again please don't actually do the exercises while i'm doing them because you'll be asking questions and and we'll try to make this a little more interactive and you can do this as your homework all right so first things first we actually have to get into our working directory since all of our uh yamls were in the cube files directory i'm just going to start there it's kind of an easy starting point you don't necessarily have to be in this folder um to call any of the yamls but it's just a much shorter command for me to type instead having to type out a full pack i do have a question for you rick is it git board or your environment that's totally look like git pod that's actually a excellent question so i am actually using vs code and yes you are a hundred percent correct it looks like git pod i think they actually use uh very similar uh elements i think it might actually be material ui or something there is yeah and and it functions very similar as well um there's there's not a lot of difference but yes this is visual studio code this is actually on my my local box and at the end here when my fans are going at 100 and my boxes crying and weeping from all the things i'm trying to run on it um you'll notice that a couple of the commands will get very very slow so so that's definitively your laptop right yep all right so we're in our uh cube files directory i was bad and before i got on i had already navigated there so i'm sorry for that to anyone who uh who noticed the uh error there with the no such follow directory yeah all right so we gotta go ahead and we gotta create our cluster now this literally is i'm gonna talk about it while i'm running command this literally is going out there and it's provisioning resources or i should say it's taking the resources that are provisioned for it and it's creating this pool it's creating all those things that we talked about that kubernetes does that allow us to run these containers inside of it so you'll notice there except starting up the control plane the control plane again going back to the slides we had talked about that was the master node that's the thing that keeps track of resources delegates things it handles all of that complex work so that all of our stuff can run very simply with very little effort so we're starting up the control plane and in a moment you'll see a couple more things happen and then the workers will also see joining worker nodes so we're actually setting up our worker nodes right now now i will show you guys in the cube files we have our nodes defined here and i could put a whole lot more worker nodes there if i wanted to right now we're doing two mainly we're trying to uh manage our system resources in a way that's not going to make my laptop crash so that's yours yeah so there is a single worker so the reason why we put five workers last week was really to have multiple nodes of cassandra it was a constraint from the operator but hey single worker is totally fine to have cassandra and uh more stuff running in a single machine absolutely now you'll notice it says you can now use your cluster with this command and you'll notice that command is all listed out there we also have it listed in the uh github here so we're just going to copy that over and what we're doing is we're just setting up a context nothing too crazy you see there it says kubernetes master is here two dns is running over there basically here's everything you need to actually interact with the cluster we just spun up yeah so question about if you go back to the yaml about the api server port so that just you telling uh kind to expose you know the control plane api on this port you choose which one uh which one so we tend to use very large number not adid the one we tends to use that's not random that's fixed but if you are running multiple kind please remember to change the api server part because it would be bind yes that's an excellent point there all right so now we're going to go and we're going to create that first name space so again this is the bucket that we're going to store all of our cassandra in so all the different pieces that need to run to run cassandra live in this bucket so we're just going to do cube ctl create ns again ns stands for namespace and then cast operator and we're going to go ahead and do that really really quick takes no time at all that's created then we're going to go and we're going to configure our storage class and i will go into the storage class in just a second i'm going to run the command here first yeah maybe you can make this terminal a bit bigger if you or no you know just maybe hiding stuff on the right part you know you know what i will also jump on screen so wait a minute [Applause] okay here i am now we can go okay hopefully that's a little better for everyone there um awesome all right so yeah i'm close to the camera i'm i'm good there yeah there you go uh the storage class is right here basically again we're just defining what our storage class looks like for our uh for our cassandra nothing too crazy nothing out of the ordinary here um we got our provisioner our i mean yeah really really simple stuff okay now we are going to go ahead and set up our cassandra operator so go do that and that's done and i will go into the ammo here really quick this one is a whole lot longer um reduce size there this one is an incredibly long yaml file i'm not going to go through it there's no need to run through it all but basically all of those individual things that i could change uh about my cassandra this is where you do that this is where you go and dig in and actually make changes yeah maybe a word on that you can see that in a single yaml file you can create multiple resources and look at the first very top of the file you are actually recreating the namespace it's existing so you will get just namespace already exist and then you define others uh others eat them and you specify the namespace so i probably don't have to add dash and to provide the namespace there yeah totally correct um we do it just to be super explicit but yeah yeah you don't necessarily need to there okay next we're going to actually create our single mode and that's what i will walk into as well sorry i'm going to keep expanding different windows and stuff just so you guys can see i increased my font size is um much larger than i normally work with so windows are small all right so there we go we got our node created and that is actually not not that crazy of a yaml we have our dc defined so remember in in cassandra a data center is a logical grouping of nodes and you need to define that so that your node can know basically which one to uh live in in one sense you could kind of picture it as a data center is kind of like a name space in cassandra in some ways there there's a lot of similarity in how that grouping happens so not exactly the same thing but again kind of a rough analogy um we have our storage you see there that we're defining that um and then some java heap settings and various others yes so you could override the default cassandra.tml to provide your own stuff right right all right next up we're gonna actually go and i did a little bit of cooking show magic over here and i have you'll see here i'm running this watch commands the watch cube ctl section cap operator get pods i'm running that and right over here we can see that i have one uh my test operators okay now i'm again in front of the screen so okay let me go down yeah boom okay you're gonna be jumping back and forth okay no problem so uh you might have noticed this just changed from zero to one of two and we're gonna wait a moment until that changes to two of two ready which should take you know a couple seconds here maybe a little bit longer than that we'll see i don't know if you guys can hear my fans spinning up on my uh my mac but they just uh started worrying pretty much don't tell that small yeah you know small footprint today it's still casanova right and technically we're running a whole nother application on top of arkansas by the end of this so it'll be fun um let me scroll down here i you know what i actually i'm going to talk about this real quick well that we're waiting for that to go um these are the docker files we showed them in the slides uh these are the files that are in the repo they're what we're going to use to build our images um they're also here if you just wanted to you know pick through them nothing too crazy in them again it's just all basically the instructions for this is the environment we need these are the dependencies we need these are working directories and ports and all those things we're just defining all of that and saying you know go forth and do when we actually do the builds and then the run okay so in a moment here you know what i can do this at the same time it's totally fine because that will spin up while i am working on building out our app so we'll come back and check that in a minute um i am going to do a docker build on the ui image so you remember over here we have our ui folder and i have this docker file in the ui right here that defines its node it's version 12 working directories does that my npm install my port all that i'm going to come here i'm going to change the directory and then i'm going to run this docker build and notice that dash t i'm taking the image as astra ui colon my image let's do that real quick and boom it's built all right and then we have to make a choice i can go java try and go python for the back end you don't really want to do both and you're going to end up in with some port conflicts if you were to try both out do um just run with it um i'm gonna do python because i'm a python guy and i've done all my uh my personal practice with python i am not really that into java so we're gonna let this run and this will also take you a minute oh wow that was actually really fast i might have had something cashed there don't tell anyone oh okay i won't send anybody now if you want to test this i'm not going to do this part today because i've been through it a lot and you can do this on your own if you want to verify that these things are indeed running because essentially we just did that docker build stuff right we took the docker file we created an image if you want to do in docker create the container you can actually go through and you can test and you can hit on all the right ports and it's fantastic just so i don't have to do any clean up and mess with ports and mess with uh trying to unbind things i'm gonna skip that and i'm gonna jump down here to step four c where you see the kind load command and again i'm taking those tags that i defined in that earlier build step with docker and i am going to go ahead actually i'm going to do them both as a block and i am just going to load those images into kind now you'll notice there it says image and it has the tag there with id uh not yet present on the node loading so it's going through and this one actually does take about um it can take as much as you know five six minutes to complete uh sometimes it's a little faster it kind of depends on how busy my uh my mac is with other things so we'll see i've never tried this while streaming uh on a skype before so we'll see how long it actually takes um we can go back here and we'll notice remember how i said we would see that this would become two of two it's done it so our cassandra is up and running we are good to go there and actually what we can do while we are waiting for these images to load in uh in my kind is i can actually go to another terminal and we can do some prep work for the next step so setting up our environment this is most of what the hands-on portion is actually going to be today is setting up the environment so we're going to do this command right here which is going to spit out the a yaml file of our secret the cast operator is using or the the uh yeah the cast operator is using a secret to uh sorry i'm just gonna have it up there to store uh important config values now you'll notice remember that data tag right right down here data with a password and the username and their basics before and all of that loveliness well for my cluster here that is going to be my password and what i'm going to do again a little bit of cooking show magic i had this command sitting over here previously um i'm going to copy that value in and again the command i'm using is just this command right here it's just that um i'm just taking the replace me and i'm throwing that string into the replace me and then i'm just going to run this command so do that real quick here come over here and pasting that command and remember cedric called it out and i still fell for it that's happening uh and and again that that is only because of the version of base64 that i am running locally on my machine yeah it worked with minus d on my end yep yep a lot of you it will work just fine so then we have this this is our actual password it's our fully coded password i could log into cqlsh and i actually will in a in a little bit using this password yep exactly so what i'm gonna do and what you'll see in a moment here instead of further step i'm just going to go and instead of pasting it into a like notepad file i'm actually just going to go to my config map i'm going to go to this value password and i am going oops i want to paste the command i did not copy it i just highlighted it so one second and change that change me under password to that string and now literally all that's done is when i go on to one of those container nodes it will have an environmental variable that is password of that string and it's going to use that when it logs in the other thing we're going to need and this is where some of the really cool stuff with services in kubernetes comes in is the if if i go down here and i run okay yeah i'll just run the command and show you instead of talking about it so i have my kubernetes um cass opera or what do we call it the namespace it was it was cast operator and it has some pods running it has some stuff running in it and here i can actually view what's running and you'll notice cluster ip now if i wanted to specify a direct ip address as a connection point i could however because we have this nice uh service um that we can reference that's running i can in my connection points i can actually specify this essentially dns name it works to basically reference whatever ip is currently being used by the nodes of my cassandra cluster whatever they have defined it will go out it knows that it and it will map that to the server so i'm just going to put the service in there so that i can reference them even if they change if i were to like have a node go down i need to reprovision something and contact point change i don't have to go reconfigure everything it'll just work so that's why i'm doing it that way and you'll notice that we've actually called that out in the github as well it it does work to go put a direct ipn i will i will say that but the moment a node goes down you're going to need to do a whole lot of reconfiguration so better just just start it right off um just a question so i know you are using vs code but did you add any extension to make that workshop or is it the default setting of your code oh goodness um asking me if i've added extensions to vs code is uh uh yes i've added a lot of extensions oh okay so you've played formatting yeah they're all formatting i try to i try to not add anything in it that would make it any different from a base install functionally speaking like there's no auto complete stuff or any of that um really going on it's just also it says nice text highlighting in the right colors um so yeah yours uh depending on if you have a yaml extension or not yours might just be all one solid color all right okay yep okay so um let's go over to our other terminal and just see how it's doing real quick you remember we were loading in okay there's the ui it's going still so this is taking again i'm hiding the comment so let me go close to you today up on top i like moving here and there okay so you are still loading the image yes so no surprise you are uploading the image which is whatever megabyte up to maybe you can do docker images just after that to see how what is the size of your you know oh yeah absolutely after after the load yeah and now we're loading the other ones that one completed and we're actually uh since i did them as a block or on to the next one this one should be a little bit faster it's still going to take it a minute probably but um shouldn't take quite as long as that first one so okay um see do i want to go past that step yeah we can load schema we'll wait all right so you remember i said we could actually oh wow it just completed okay well let's do that right now you said uh what command was i running docker images yeah yeah look at images okay and created size we have astro back end is 130 meg and yeah see that's why it took so long 1.11 gig for the aster ui so obviously took a little longer than the the much much smaller back end and i think we're pulling a full um yeah we're pulling a full install of node in that there is an alpine version of node that you can pull in your docker file if you want to um alpine is kind of a minimal version but you'll notice in there we're not we're not finding like alpine node or i think it's actually node colon alpine and version number um we're just using straight up give me the full node install go for it which is probably why it takes so long there all right so now we're going to actually basically do the equivalent of ssh'ing into the node and you'll notice there i did the cube ctl exec uh dash i t dash n cast operator basically defining where is this so it's the cast operator name space the actual thing i want to be going into there and then of course bin dash so i am now using a bash terminal like you would on any uh any box and what i'm going to do there is i'm just going to see qlsh remember i said before we were going to cch into this i am going to do that and i'm going to use username clustersuperuser or cluster1-superuser now you'll notice i also have cluster1-superuser up here and you'll notice that when i did that whole uh spitting out of that yamo and there's all that basics before encoding i did not actually decode that the reason i was able to do that is i know that that is what the cast operator uses as its default username so we have that all preconfigured um just kind of you know a little bit of hand wavy magic but i am going to need to copy my uh password there and notice the dash p and the password hit enter on that and i am in cqlsh all right so now what we gotta do is we gotta take our schema um which i have here in the github i also actually have it at the root of week six um we can open it up and that whole schema file is there as well take it from whatever place you want i'm just gonna copy it out of the github for it so no surprise this is a schema we use week three and four yeah yes all right so i'm gonna go ahead and paste that and that's gonna take a moment here while it goes through all of its steps and we're done okay and i'm actually gonna leave this terminal open because i'm gonna come back to it later so i'm going to switch my other terminal here and we're going to keep on going all right so we have our schema loaded we have our uh yaml our config ammo is now configured with our password and it has all contact points the the service we're using it's all should be good to go we have our key space name there in this case i'm using what we've been using for the last few weeks the killer video key space if you used something different and you wanted to set it up differently you could obviously change that key space theme um you know that's kind of a up to you and then of course use astra vault being the thing that's saying no we're not going to go out and use astro we are going to try and reference something locally okay so now we get to go create that bucket for our own app so we have the the name space the the cast operator namespace and now i'm going to create the my app cases cube cto create ns my app just gonna go do that space created awesome then i'm not gonna do this just yet because i want to actually show you these yammels so we took a brief look at these essentially this is the back end diameter we're exposing some ports we've got our image and again if we go back to the the docker images that the tagged image or the image tags are going to be exactly the same and that's literally all of the referencing we're doing from end to end is done with these tags so again not optional make sure you you take things correctly and use it accordingly okay i'm going to go ahead and copy this let me make sure i'm in the right directory here because i don't believe i am on this terminal i am not so i'm going to cd into weak sticks and i actually need to be in okay and you saw what i did right there it was so fast you might have missed it i did uh three commands and boom my app is up and going and what we can do is we can come over here and look at that we got a back end running we got a ui running and the command i did to to view that is basically just the the watch on the cube ctl dash and my app get pods um really really simple and our whole application we've got our standard up here we've got our ui we've got our back end last thing we've got to do is we've got to open up some ports so that it's actually accessible i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do that and it again it's just a cube ctl command to open up some ports um we have the there we go first one and boom all right our ports are forwarded now if we've done this all right we should be able to go over to our ui here and i'm actually going to see refresh this because this is actually there from a previous run i did so if it refreshes uh correctly we will be good to go and so um there are two back ends you know you can pick the one you like but uh basically you can you only use once one to do the demo did i do the wrong password authenticate bad credentials did i not save my config map before i applied it i will bet you that's the problem oh fun yeah that's demo time no big deal yes it is all right so i am actually going to need to go and remove that pod i want to remove the whole name space okay i need to get rid of the port binding which is actually the harder of the the problems here i think i need to create the quickest way to do it here i might just destroy the whole kubernetes cluster and rebuild it really quick just so i don't have to untangle things it'll take two seconds so talk amongst yourself give me uh give me a moment here you'll notice we are getting all of the uh lost connection to pod which you'd expect i'm basically spinning everything down and you'll notice over here oh no we have no connection to any of our stuff for our watch commands that's because i literally just dropped a nuke the whole thing's gone later and i am going to do um basically take advantage of the fact that uh kubernetes is super super easy to use i'm going to go all the way up here and there we are all right i'm just going to copy these commands and run them one by one comparing our nodes and i'm not going to do any of the docker build stuff because if you remember docker the docker build stuff was running outside kubernetes so the only thing i nuked there was kubernetes itself i i basically said hey everything you got running just wipe it clean um but those docker images still exist i can show you that if you're curious in a second by just running a docker images command here as soon as this is done which will be a moment because i have to start controlling now it is going to i am going to have to reload those images because i essentially removed again in kubernetes that removed all of everything so none of those bindings none of those things we imported none of it's there all going to any worker nodes almost done there we'll set our context as soon as that is up come on we're almost there oh i just missed one part are you just creating everything what again yeah yeah i uh i figured instead of trying to go through the whole port thing it would be easy yeah i got the same question yeah you know you could have simply update the config and redeploy i guess um so actually not oops i did have some issues with the ports staying bound in uh a bad state earlier and that's purely a problem with me that's not a problem with kubernetes but okay and this is really easy to do i mean it is just a few commands the hardest part is just gonna be setting up the config file but it's already set up except for the password which i'm gonna need to re-poll but again that's takes a moment to do okay we got our casa operator and now if we come over here you need to wait for the pot to be there you know and there it is it's setting up okay cool that's going to be running and i am going to go ahead and start the loading of my images because that is what i'm going to need to take the timeline that's the longest step here and notice i just skipped all the build stuff again because i don't have to rebuild those they're built i just have to load those the background over here yeah so during the time is loading and everything so yeah you could have simply updated the config map re-deploy the config map and simply doing that i'm pretty sure that the pod for the apps would have been restarted because we did explicitly define a dependency between config mac and the pod so if you edit the config map i expect the port to restart yeah yeah that's fair okay so we are going to come over here and this probably isn't going to work for not fully up and running but we're going to try it real quick because we want to and hey it did sweet i am going to go ahead and i am going to take that command and i'm going to get my password here okay so doing so i'm taking the question about certification and kubernetes and docker so um as of now no the kubernetes and docker question are not part of the certification for developers and for admins they are being reworked but i guess for you it won't be there either but you know before the end of the year it will be there because that's the futures as we told you but no need for that for this certification coming in september okay and this is going we should have the config map working perfect cassandra's almost back up i'm going to run these last few commands here and create my namespace i'm going to reload my schema too i forgot about that and that's not going to be happy with me because i didn't greet myself yet okay and everything in the wrong folder all right then the password now let me drag the uh character there we go um password all right and give it a moment james will be in cqsh now try connecting texture feature we're not up yet oh we're not up yet okay yeah yeah yeah so i bet people got this issue during the homework of week five yeah this is what happened when the pod is not two of over two running running the service is not there so by the way one over two um this is what we in the kubernetes world this is called probes so there are two probes uh liveness and readiness liveness means your pod is starting but the service is not there yet and readiness the service is ready to take response and how kubernetes just monitor is using some api available in the pod and as no api is provided by customer at the cast operator level we added what we call the sidecar to expose an api for kubernetes to monitor liveness and readiness of cassandra node right i'll take another moment or two probably not very much longer and okay loading still okay yeah you're totally right i could have probably just reapplied but like i said i did have some issues earlier and i didn't want to oh no problem i'm not judging this were in production that's definitely what i would have done my green screen just fell over yeah my green screen just totally fell off my chair give me a moment here awesome that's funny now you're half transparent totally funny oh yeah i love it oh now all the magic about their pizza just now just go down yeah we aren't really living in the computers guys [Laughter] sorry it's gonna be uh oh that's blocking out some of the text okay give me one second i'm going to fix this yes i guess your body is still one over two for six minutes now seems like quite long pay no attention to the man behind the screen yeah you know what let me hide you yeah nobody's nothing happened nothing happened now i will stop moving because just people complain about me moving on screen all right yeah i'm the guinea pig today yeah just so comment here okay um so your body is still one over two that's bit weird yeah six minute thing that is taking a little let's while this over here and uh okay i know why it is it is very very slow because i am very low on system resources so it's actually taking a while to load my uh my stuff as well but luckily we do have time oh yeah yeah i actually uh i spoke way too quickly early on so i bought myself quite a bit of time here if we uh if we do need it but hopefully there we go two of you we are good there and i am going to come over here and i am going to rerun that and that should get me into the cql sh prompt and again yeah this is running super super slow so just bear with me we're gonna copy in our schema and there we go there that's gonna truck on through much slower than last time hopefully my laptop doesn't start on fire because that would make this a very interesting stream for me in a very dull stream for all of you [Laughter] all right so our scheme is loaded i'm going to leave that prompted up because i'm going to use it in a minute looks like our image loading is not quite done it should be almost there yeah in the meantime we can actually go get our password and all that goodness uh actually we already did that so nope we're good there the config map i'm going to make sure i actually save it this time we are indeed saved amazing what a little command s can do for the difference between something working and not but okay and this should go it should take a minute or so hopefully not more than a minute and i will need to reapply cube files and reload my port yeah here we rebind my port all right yeah you guys are all getting to see how the sausage is uh made here yeah all right here we go so now i'm going to apply all of those if i come over here i see my stuff is starting up i'm going to bind my ports really really quick and there we go forwarding forwarding that's good and that's good and hopefully if we've done it correctly we should have in a moment once this actually loads hey congratulations take a note people save your config files before you apply them okay and we're going to reload the ui here just because it is a stale instance i have up uh as we can see everything is running we've got 101 on all these and then our standard is running i'm going to expand this just so that it formats nicely for now but to show everything you see it okay and this is really taking in a moment meaning we are probably at basically 100 cpu and ram usage okay i might just hardly reload that actually [Music] can okay well we'll give that a second instead um i'll cover this just while we're waiting for that to happen um to clean everything up at the end you can actually do this you actually delete your namespaces and then delete your cluster um when you spin down any one of those things like if i were to just do the command i did which i just ran the delete cluster command um basically what it does is it wipes out everything but just trying to do it as gracefully as possible delete your namespaces it'll send down all the resources it sends out everything associated um and then of course you know delete deleting your cluster actually deletes the kubernetes cluster um the other thing here i'm going to do it slightly different than we're doing here if you wanted to get test output from a journey you would be able to run this command in your command line now this is just a one-liner i'm going to do all of these commands individually but you will notice at the very end of this one i have to change me you put your password from before the same one we put in the config map you need to replace that change me with your password yes so um a couple of questions because we do have time so first about why did you redo all the steps so again we could have simply update the config map deploy the config map and so i i think as there is a dependency between the pod and the config map the pod is restarted by kumantes or if not just kill the pod and it will be uh respawned by kubernetes and yes and also another question about por forwarding if you can just show the comment again i i think so the command command is you know i'm just gonna show it over on the oops there's another one uh right over here so what we're doing um the ampersand at the end is not required that just runs in the background um the the meat and potatoes of the the command is this part right here which literally all we're doing is we're saying port forward again name space name space port forward pods we're referencing the actual pod we've created there or saying port 3000 within that pod goes to 3 000 externally really about as simple as you can get from a port forwarding standpoint so uh and then again we're doing the same exact thing for the back end that answer the question yep i think it does awesome all right well hopefully screening the question yeah keep the question coming so remember after the two hour session we will do ask me anything session uh just to see to get all the questions ready um because we tend to have sometimes the same question and again and again so if we can have them on video would be nice yeah and this is really taking a moment let's see if it actually times out nope it's going in okay and that is purely because of low system resources if you do a bigger box that will be very very quick also you might notice that the ui has been updated so now it does not ask about the secure clone bundle anymore because it will simply invoke the backend and the backend is directly connected to customer correct so now i'm going to launch a journey and that should run here and this will take it a minute to do but the insert was actually very quick so we can actually already go and check that everything was inserted so i'm going to come over here and uh oh looks like we got kicked out so i'm just gonna have to reconnect [Music] really it does that when it does that sometimes when the system resources are inadequate so probably since we're loading data i'm going to give it a moment to finish that and then i'll try it again yeah on the the instances we're spinning up uh for you all that shouldn't be this slow if you're doing it on a local laptop highly recommend at least 16 gigs of ram that's what i'm running on uh 16 gigs of ram and then an older i7 think it's the fifth gen i7 um and you can see how it's struggling so you just make your choices in life accordingly all right let's try this again right nope still it's gonna be the authorization error too it's kind of funny it's not actually an authorization area it's that the authorization it's not enough resources to actually authorize me but yes so eight gigabyte of ram should be enough for today so i think um the castle renault need about one gigabyte and the application you know both front-end and back end should also need all together one gigabyte probably less so yeah i'm pretty sure that with four gigabyte we are confident you can run this demo easily yeah i might be cpu bound to i didn't actually check that i should probably it is probably cpu that's the model right here yeah oh so i we got again some question about certification so i told before there were two certifications developer and admin and you know what uh just chatting with everyone i see that we will give you the venture for the dev and if you succeed the dev will also give you the voucher for admin okay okay we're going to do a quick describe just to make sure everything is where i think it is and no tokyo and kubernetes are not part of the certification as of now next year it will okay yeah so we're getting an unhealthy warning basically liveliness profile so our cassandra overloaded and restarted defaults yeah it looks like it's up kubernetes did that for me okay cedric do you have the expertise on this one because i i can troubleshoot that that would probably take me too long okay readiness profile container did you did it yeah it was a resource issue we exploded resources and hit an unhealthy state and then the tubelet restarted i believe okay that don't talk to me authorization you are click click on variables create resource so can you do the get pods to see how is the pod going from from the java yep get buds and it's running yeah running running so there is no reason why the readiness prop would fail except it just been running right now yep and it just i could spin that down and back up again i suppose but we're already that's the resource usage what i'm trying to show you guys just for reference here is i'm trying to show you the data actually and um it did but i don't want you to take my word for it yeah i bet you know i didn't see the the ui complain or your back-end complain about just yeah no launching the journey so yeah that all went through i just want to show them the table itself and uh you know make it an actual select but yeah it looks like we're gonna have to maybe do a little bit of troubleshooting on that okay so shooting and or actually yeah that's working yes actually right here so we actually are getting try one more time and then we'll just have to say okay you'll have to try it in your lap yeah yeah i'll just say looking at could describe no no no to see all the container in this pad yeah it should be yeah you could try that to see the statues of containers in the pod but yeah which i mean what you did is just you try to bash and you get er when you try to bash right in the container all right right and even then the bodies say raining running that's pretty strange behavior yeah i've got a couple questions here in the youtube chat um one of them is when you run get pods you see the namespace running and the cluster don't they run in the same pod no so the namespace is the container that you put pods inside of um let's see here what else do okay yes the main one for us here a couple certification ones i think those are being addressed um yeah okay cool all right well given that that's the case i'm gonna go back to the slides we're gonna cover the rest and then we'll move on yeah all right so as i covered before cleaning up is actually really cool everything okay no no that's just i'm just moving on the screen again so don't worry about that yeah yeah move on all right so uh you basically just delete your namespaces delete your cluster if you were to just delete your cluster it would go through and wipe out your namespaces anyway but just so you can get you guys can know the um the commands to do so all right wrapping up here homework we are going to basically say everything you just saw do it um set up your app set up your cassandra get it all running in kubernetes again everything is at the github under week six um go check it out the readme is there it's got all the instructions if you follow the instructions you should do it hopefully at this point you guys understand what the different files have why they're important and how to configure some of them um i really did try to kind of deep dive on that for you all and uh yeah yeah we also and so you can yeah you can do the homework on your laptop you know four gigabyte of ram or in docker should be enough this time but yeah i think eight is totally comfortable and below the video there is a form to request a cloud instance for you to do stuff kind is already installed the instance will last 24 hours by default but you can extend a little bit these uh by typing the command extend um i think you can do that three days okay but you we cannot make you know 1 000 instance running during one week so we will run what you expect and anybody don't eat extend command we'll get the instance dominated yeah simply awesome yeah all right and then next thing do you want to talk about this one yeah just a reminder about the asta abstract atom that is going we didn't get a lot of submission yet so remember the end date is august 20th so you still have plenty of time we are here to answer your question even before submission you know and just also remind everybody that we will do a huge ask me ask you anything session like week nine now the one week after uh the series just to announce who are the winners and just answer any of the questions and also announce what content we could make during the next season yeah awesome",
