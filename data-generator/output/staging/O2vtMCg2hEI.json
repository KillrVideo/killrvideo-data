    "text": "now that we're ready to go uh please once again welcome Giani thank you guys I'm Jenny Mata I'm so excited to show you what we have worked for the for one year ATL with Gen okay so a very brief introduction of third space learning we are an ed company and our goal is to overcome the attainment Gap in the US and the UK our main problem is schools doesn't don't have budget for us well basically for nothing especially here in the UK and we are there to support this disadvantage children solution well let me introduce Sky our AI monor there's a place value grid showing 0.7 and 0.5 Alex says the answer is 0.12 what mistake did he make he he just had did seven five think about how we add tents together what happens when we have more than 10 T you you go to the ones that's right when we have more than 10 t0 we need to exchange 1010 for one her so does a one key excellent job that's correct okay so this is a tech talk so let me dive in in the architecture behind our ma AI tutor this very complicated diagram is um pubb based architecture uh where all the components are decoupled and communicates with a global event um a few components in our stock we use longchain to build a agent a model agnostic agent we can swap open AI um clo 3.5 sunet um llama 3.1 or whatever model we want uh all the components are actually abstracted so for for example for now we have a dip gram for the speech to text but we can use a whisper for example whatever other model the hardware is abstracted so we use pulse audio for virtual microphone and speaker we use a selenium to let the our agent to join the classroom and we use of course ASB otherwise I won't be here for shter memory and to store data because as you can imagine data is very key for us and well this for any agent actually uh open AI for LM and for the textt to speech probably you recognize the voice and a for realtime messaging so we are in phase one we have built this agent for one year now and our goal is to demonstrate that the mats AI tutor can work and of course we can sell it the technique we are using for now is prompt engineering and I'll give uh deep in in a moment so what were our requirements the tutor cannot make any mistake so 9.8 accuracy is not acceptable because we are teaching children so if the tutor is making a mistake the children are very prone to accept the mistake and to interiorize the mistake the latency has to be less than 1 second uh the video you have seen is quite good but it's not the final version has been taken like a few weeks ago uh solution proactive agent instead of reactive agent it means it's the tutor that drives the conversation instead of just replying to any question the student is asking and the data flow optimization to stream audio when a sentence is completed instead of waiting for the wall text to be generated evaluation me meod and test this is really really important for the first requirement 100% 99.8% is not aceptable of course there's a lot of manual QA with adults and children and we have a spec based automatic Qi system to evaluate the success we use l lung Smith uh to trace and also we quite we use quite a lot the playground to test our slightly change in the prompt we have a very strong data pipeline uh all the events from all the components go to RB and then to our uh business intelligent system where we we can query for example the correctness level of for each question so if a question is not right probably the correctness is too low and so on and so a brief history I'll be really really brief here September 2023 we tested on Judge upt if we could try to get the LM to teach an entire lesson it kind of worked so it g gave us some confidence level to go ahead with the project on October 23 uh I prepared a full working voice in voice out demo it was just react based prototype type not integration not integrated with our platform December 23 uh the agent was integrated in our classroom uh April 24 we started the testing in school and now well next Monday we'll start officially the pilot in schools so how uh I said we are using prompt engineering how the prompt is structured so we have few sections uh the first section is who the tutor is and who the student is this information are retried from our platform and so the system prompt includes information about the tutor and the student and it's something like this uh where is it yeah I'll show you that piece of code in a second uh yeah system interaction probably to small probably better who you are you are sky a dedicated primary math tutor who follows strict guidelines your student you are teaching a UK people name it the Marquee or whatever name is who is a year five student profile Mar teacher at the dis comment n well teachers are usually more proactive than us testing and Market the the working level as meeting this information should guide you tailor your approach to teaching and interacting with Maris okay uh guidelines this is quite important because we have teaching children for more than 10 years so we know how a good online oneto one math session looks like the guidelines establish rules for the tutor to follow the best practice for good tutoring online session this is research based guidelines so we worked with UC and we have like a very large uh system prompt uh with each rules to follow for our llm but the core actually I can show you a quickly if this helps me yeah so this is a section of our guidelines so always perform instruction okay use Clear age related concise language and friend in Friendly manner to convey information without requiring immediate feedback prioritize creating a positive and supporting learning atmosphere and so on and so forth this is a very brief section we have something like 1,000 token just for guidance but the core of our llm our agent is the current task so we started in the first Les in in the first version asking the llm to teach a slide and uh it kind of worked and the prompt looked at something like this it was text based with some action say something ask something check the answer uh we added what the correct answer was it worked it wasn't perfect we had an aage Laten of 5 Seconds and as you can imagine children are not exactly good at waiting uh AI for 5 seconds but the correctness was around 78% this value was measured with the QA automatic system I mentioned before that wasn't acceptable so we moved to the second version and the second version was more structured so the promt instead of of being just chat based H sorry text based for the W slide was splitting uh smaller chunk for each step and it looks something like this adjacent with something to ask uh something to write highlight because our I can interact with our propretary classroom the correct answer where the correct answer is and so on this approach improved the latency to to less than 1 second and the reason is if we want uh our agent to say something we don't need to wait the llm to generated exactly the same content we just play immediately and the correctness was even better 85% again not acceptable but a bit better so the final version and is what we have now is using structured output to force the L to think step by step and this step by step I guess it's something you are very familiar with so the performance the latency has increased slightly because there's a step in the middle but the correctness the accac finally is roughly 100% And when I say roughly is really really near to 100% so how does it look I have a longchain trade to show you and uh so this is how it looks like we have a task and the task is extract the answer provided by the student evaluate the student message he invoke the check answer tool sending the proper correctness tag and related optional fields in this case the question is the number show this is the correct answer so let's now look at a place value chart to understand how multiply and divide by shifting digits can you first write down the decimal that is this place value chart is showing us we have a visual aid a place value chart with the hundreds Grid in the ones column a road of 10 in the 10's column and the student answer is the number shown is 1.2 so the expected answer is infered by the correct answer the given answer is infered by the message in from the user and yeah it's correct and the response is well done you have correctly identified the decimal number as 1.2 but the student can makes mistake for example the number shown is 12 We Run The a the agent and yeah Incorrect and we have a hint remember to consider the position of each digit in the place value chart to try to identify the one number and the tens separately and we have the acknowledgement we have a few business logic that runs in the tool and the tutor will give two hints and uh and then it will reveal the correct answer uh I have less than two minutes but I can show you quickly the code and as you can see there's a lot of prompt engineering going on here and that's the reason why we want to remove all this code by fine tune our small language model and this is our long-term goal why because we want to reduce the latency further so using our reasoning model and how using a reasoning model like the reent O2 uh sorry o1 O2 is probably next year one preview to generate synthetic data combined with our real data to create a data set also we want to use asmo language model to reduce latency imagine something powered by Gro for example uh as the second long-term goal is to improve actions interactions uh the tutor interacts with our classroom and the classroom is us so we can do whatever we want to improve the interaction and finally scyp content uh we have produced 40 learning objective out of almost 800 and Spanish is another goal for us in the US and that's it for us thanks for watching and uh if you have any question please reach me out after this you thank you wo",
