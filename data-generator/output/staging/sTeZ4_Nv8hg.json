building large-scale distributed systems [Music] welcome to the distributed data show today in studio I have David Harding know you're live today yes I'm yeah I'm actually real yeah you're not a Florida you're here yeah survived a hurricane okay it's true yeah it's true good mostly is that why you're here no I mean I'm sleeping I've got a cot okay good all right so at least you have a place to stay yeah we don't want our distributed agente to show people homeless and minimal thing we do have a topic we have a new feature in killer video which is online github we'll put the link in the show notes but it is a reference application that we have provided and you do work a lot on you just did a new feature and what is that new feature recommenders recommenders okay well those that's a hot topic now there's a lot of ways to do recommenders how did you implement this recommender well this one we implement it with graph whoa okay dad you're coming right for it because graph is cool well yeah it's really cool now there's there's good use case for it but yeah it's cool so this is a pretty all right this is a good use case for graph we had Denise on a few episodes ago talking about bad use cases for graph and she was pretty passionate I will say about that but it's good because we need to know what the good in the bad is so this is a good use case for graph and can you explain how its how its setup how does it work well yeah so we've got the we've we've actually we've exercised the graphed ESL's which might be going a little bit too far into that part but this is in the java version of killer video and we so the graph data model though is your your trap what are you tracking in the graph database why use a graph database and not use just regular Cassandra well because going back to the whole UK use case thing there is in recommended recommendation engines in ours in particular there's really a focus on the relationships between data right finding the relation yes right yeah okay so with Kassandra data model you need to know what the relationship is already building out of materialized view essentially yeah but with the graph how does the data get inserted into the database or what is the data model there well in the case of the graph I mean the the data model itself in our particular case is like an in killer video it's based off of users and videos and the interactions of those users with the videos and such so there is an explicit relationship between users and videos things like users upload the videos and users rate the videos and so on and so forth so our overall model is essentially based off to form the the relationships between users and videos and their videos and tags so it just it just fits the model really well and so we were able to as as as users are interacting with the system right and we're finding out who the user is what video they're uploading all the kind of dia goes with it that we're pushing that into our graph and so that's what we're using to actually populate our graph database so why why a graph and not something I mean I think classically you think of I say classic we're in a classic era of ml now right yeah not really yeah but we have this classic notion of machine learning recommenders things like that being more of a Duke spark type workload batch analytics okay really yeah so you didn't do that no and why well let's see so in our particular case we are a requirement to what it was to have a recommendation engine that was near real-time results getting him near real-time and we wanted to base it off of the data that was coming into the system real time so if the dynamic it's the thing happened and I need to change my recommendation not tomorrow after the batch run exactly yeah exactly yeah so so it is really based off that near real-time requirement right how so how dynamic is it I mean so I always think of like well you're starting to put a lot of water in the pool so to speak and and if you have a lot of interactions with the system is it pretty reactive I mean can it change my recommendations if I start watching like a lot of jean-claude Van Damme movies yeah no absolutely so will it judge me if I do that oh we have a little new judge icon yeah we totally set all that up I would hate don't don't track me bro no it's no it's definitely dynamic if you have one set of recommendations and then you go in and you rate other videos now highly right right you know there depends on which ones you rate and how you rate them because we have a certain scale and I'm not right now we're not taking to account like low ratings if you write a bunch of videos with a rating of one I don't care about that as much I think so all right let's say I do that let's say that you know Timecop five stars yeah right but in bloodsport for okay that's yeah I'm with that but up there so those I when I rate those what is it traversal looking for in that case yeah so in the case of our recommendation engine the one that you see on the site itself the one that's currently in code it's actually a very simple engine so it's gonna take the videos that you've really liked right and our rating scale zero to five so we're looking at those that are four to five and then it's just gonna simply look and find other users who have rated that same video or videos in that same range and then it's gonna find the videos that they really liked also in that high rating so in this case it's simply enough going okay I like stuff you like stuff and now I'm gonna look at the stuff that you like so it's gonna recommend those things that the other users liked and then it's gonna exclude anything I've already watched because we don't want to recommend the things that you just watch right that wouldn't be much of a recommendation oh so if I I won't get a recommendation to watch bloodsport if I just recommend it that's right yeah yeah good to know cuz I mean I'd sure it's an easy one that's a softball but I'd give me some hard so based on like the interactions of other users so I'm just making sure that I understand this so if your user watching videos and you rate them and it's only on ratings it's not just on usage right right right now we're making an assumption that if you rate a video you've watched it right we're not factoring in how many views or anything like that so if you've rated it you're watching right okay so I've watched a video I rated it and somebody watched similar movies stuff that I've rated four or five and they've waited four or five yeah and they're between the two of us it's almost like you're creating this this distinction between here they make it movies that I'll that they have not watched but I liked that's right vice-versa yeah that's exactly it so we're kind of sharing yeah without knowing each other yeah yeah in in going back to what you're asking like how dynamic that is so if you were looking at the recommendations you get right now right and then if you have say other users in the system who while you were looking at some video they're rating something else or maybe you rate something else the next time you go you'll most likely see a difference right you'll it'll recommend something a little bit different to you really depending on that interaction but it does take the it takes users in the system actually doing things and rating things in order for it to change right so if no one reads a movie then it's gonna be pretty bleak yeah matter of fact if you are if you if you go to the site right now if you're at a live site and I mean we've got hundreds of thousands of you know edges rating edges in that kind of deal and so it's a good amount of data but if you were to go there right now and not write anything you'd get nothing oh because there's nothing to recommend until you've actually highly rated something well sure that makes sense and you don't want to give like fake ratings yeah because I'll get a movie I will not like I'm sure I'll get you because your algorithm sucks you're like I didn't even know how do they how do you know yeah I do not want to watch hope floats that's a horrible movie I want to watch blood sports so that's that's really interesting but then I think of volume in this case and how you're you're trying to keep this as close to real time as possible and there it's got to be a limit to that how do you how do you manipulate that or what's the strategies what would normally be a strategy for manipulating that yes so there's a couple different ways that we're currently handling it right one one strategy is by simply limiting the results limiting you know how many branches essentially that you kind of allow the dorsal yeah the depth of how far into it you're going right sure and there's there is a trade-off there because the more I limit my depth the less accurate overall it's going to be but right case like this it's it's maybe in this simple recommendation engine it's not that big of a deal so that's one way we definitely do it right we put a cap on on how far and how far we're looking into our graph essentially is what it comes down to the other part is a timeout right simply setting a timeout and it's actually something that generally speaking like when I'm working with traversals new traversals or anything in graph it can be you know sometimes depending on what you're setting up you could potentially set up something that takes a really long time to come back or maybe something that doesn't at all so I tend to just as a normal practice I will set timeouts and that way especially my application if something takes a little longer and I expected maybe you know maybe something we did went viral and all sudden we have you know our graph explodes in size and stuff I haven't really controlled for that so that way it gives me a little bit of protection there so it's just a couple ways that we currently like game the system if you will well I don't think it's gaming we I think it's more of a realist in like knowing your data model knowing your application I that's how I see that the timeout is it's not you know fail it's yeah I'm giving you this much time just find as much as you can yeah yeah that's it because that's what's important to me yeah it's like eventual consistency so I wanted high consistency or low consistency based on my use case now if I was doing an analytics workload and I didn't care that it ran for a minute or two right I just let it fly that's it yeah yeah yeah but if I'm waiting if someone was on a webpage you want to think about that right yeah waiting a minute is not okay right so we generally try to keep it within a second or you know could be a couple seconds to return on that part and again that's easy for us to kind of manage and and update as we so choose but that's yeah it's a really cool feature now is it can you say that there was also a case for a batch in this as well yeah like so it's actually one of the areas that we're looking to eventually push into is for one not only say taking off the constraints let's say we really want that recommendation engine to be a lot more accurate right take off the constraints right that's a great case for a batch sure you know and let that like really just go through everything that we have or maybe we want to bring in external data like right now we're only basing all of all of the recommendation engine is based off of data core from the application just the interactions in application there's nothing external coming into place so there might be some data sets that makes sense to pull in that would also say nuance or influenced the recommendation engine but that would be a case for for something more along those lines sure like the most good batch is is about the the larger use case and synthesizing as much information as possible you'll get an outcome and it's interesting especially inside DSC with graph I know that you can also you can do batch analytics inside of the graph as well yeah there's there's you know this multi-model world we live in yeah yeah you do have these use cases and and they seem to blend pretty well in this case yeah and it's actually again that's something from from the OLAP standpoint right right with with the graph piece is something that we're looking to push in it's on the plate right because it exercises that very multi-model thing that you're referring to right so that's yeah that's a it's a perfect kind of use case for if we start to branch out right so okay so that's that's how it's implemented so now let's talk about or that's the use case yeah and the data model that how the how you actually program this I think there's an interesting story there as well so you use Java for this yes right yes yes yes okay so tell us about a little how that worked out right so and just to mention from from the killer video standpoint right reference app we actually support multiple language variants so we have C sharp nodejs and Java the reason why we chose Java well other than that most everyone else does there is that there is yeah there's that part of it and it happens to be no surprise here like my core language but then it also supports graft ESL's right and so it is part of the whole process that radius L being domain-specific yeah I could probably mention what that means yeah it means busy I like your network provider yeah no yeah so it was actually a process of originally starting with both the fluent and string api's without dsls mostly because we're we're exploring right right and exploring what that would look like and what direction we want to chose choose and then ESL's were released yeah and took a look at them and and ya know it was its it's night and day difference as far as I'm concerned anyway because um you can take these huge potentially traversals and sometimes pretty gnarly complex traversals and you can encapsulate them and much more human readable right you know easy easier chunks of code to deal with and that kind of deal sail so dsl is in general maybe we can talk about that just for those of you don't know about dsls yeah the the domain-specific language what what is the advantage what are those typically used for yeah so one of the neat things you know that if you look at the definition of like how DSL czar defined in that can the deal it is there to encode your Kremlin in a language that is specific to your domain right so it's like okay what does that mean right and the example like to use like in killer video our particular domain is videos right so if I look at say the underlying gremlin traversal is that we use to power this thing you know you might have like G dot V has whatever some ID and all these other steps that you go through where the traversal the DSL traversal right Mike just like killer video ad uploaded so all that stuff that video ad uploaded is now essentially that's the language of our domain right so I our domain is graph rein gremlin and the language is it's using your defining what you want that to do right so it's like a big almost like a macro or something in that kind of frame right yeah you're shortening things up making it easier to consume yeah absolutely exactly so so it is so it essentially just helps us kind of if you will hide the gremlin part of the implementation right and just put it back into a language that is is specific to our particular domain and that could be anything it doesn't have to be video right it could be medical or could be you know whatever and it just it's interesting because as I the way you're describing it sounds very close to something like like an embedded procedure like a procedure call yeah is it similar to that yeah I think it could be yeah like people in oracle world is here's a bunch of business logic that with a call that has something to do with the data yeah no I think that's fair I do I think that's fair because at the end of the day underneath right even when you're reading out the DSL mm-hmm all the gremlin all the traversals are still underneath there right right and you just it's really just an abstraction layer that you put on so I think that's fair like if you will take the PL sequel standpoint and you have all of this logic that's encapsulated within that but then when you're calling it right you're just you're essentially just calling that one function and that function has a logic within it so all you have to worry about really from the implementation is that function and whoever's who's ever executing on the PL sequel all they have to worry about it's a particular function yeah it sounds very interesting for the folks that are doing large-scale development graph so like how let's let's talk about some of those advantages for like an agile shop or somebody a large development crew that's doing a lot of work inside a graph what are some of those advantages yeah so this is where okay so this is one of the one of the areas when I started getting into DSL with this I got like really excited I started like yo I did get a little excited yeah I was going nuts all over the graph slack rooms and another thing because what it was is in if you have somebody let's say you have somebody's like a domain expert like an analyst or something like that but maybe they're not the core coder or they're not extremely familiar with gremlin or you have developers engineers that are coming into your project and again they're not really well versed in gremlin or even just from a min standpoint I mean I'm the one who was responsible for writing this stuff in here so I had to understand the traversals and everything and that's fun I actually like that kind of stuff but when you when you look at how complex some of the traversals get especially when if you think about in the Kasich Euler video I just give you an example when you add a video right once once you upload a video then I have to add the video vertex I have to check is it there or not then if it's not I have to create it at all of its properties I have to create the Edge's from video and user and video tag and do all these little things and those themselves are not terribly complex but when you start to build them up becomes complex right so if you take a look at the the base gremlin traversal you need to do those types of things and you just threw that at someone who's trying to come into this code base and be effective there's a learning curve associated with that right but if you instead you have things encoded inside the DSL then you can give them this language that's extremely simple and not just even from a maintenance standpoint I found that once I had my DSL is defined and I had that in place writing the code to handle all of my like crud operations and handle the recognizer engine it was really pretty actually right and it was it was just so easy it was just it was much easier so would this be a situation where you would you would have say a library in a jar file that has commonly used ESL's and those dsls could you know for instance for this application here's a here's our application - DSL a gremlin DSL jar and it would have all of those in there me as that and I think of things like this is like a library where I would distribute this to all everyone that's writing code say hey if you need to do this you need to do a recommender your here's the call that's interesting take on that I mean you could you'd have to make up some new yeah yeah you have to at least generally do yeah so so I mean like you'd have to make an assumption though that it is important that the the DSL is there going to be defined with a particular schema right right so you have to ensure that the graph that you're interfacing with does match right a schema that you've defined the DSL store library at something doesn't yeah yeah yeah so as long as you're good they're totally right I mean if you had an organization that actually had some established graphs right and you in you know you had these schemas out there then as long as you knew that was gonna kind of stay and you didn't have to worry about I mean you can always update the DSL later if you needed to but as long as you have that and you can make that base assumption you could probably do something like that yeah yeah I think we're just gonna work it through a new feature now yeah maybe yeah there might be some zeros after this well this is I mean this is I think gonna be a great boon for anybody who's working with graph especially you know in a large-scale environment where there's gonna be a lot of repetition yeah and like one person if you're developer we're gonna graph you can encapsulate and shortcut a lot of stuff with this yeah and you know and to add to that it's separate from the DSL definition itself right there are some nice capabilities that come with the library so when you added in they have the gremlin DSL annotation right obviously this is just for Java Ram but it generates all the boilerplate for you so all you have to do is focus on the DSL template and you write your DSL and it will handle all of the unreal yeah and if you actually take a look at what it generates you'll you'll notice that oh this is all the work I would have had you have done but I no longer have to do that so that by itself is like a huge time saver now has this have anything to do and when you said annotations it made my ears perk up like object mappers is this close I mean is this create the same similar situation as an object mapper you know I'm I'm I'm gonna say yes but I'm also gonna I'm also going to you map an object with the DSL now no I you know honestly this is something I haven't I haven't I see mmm this one you pushing them pushing the yeah yeah I haven't thought I've got me thinking about this is like mmm as a programmer what would I want but I don't know if I want I'm not a big fan mostly of object mappers maybe I'm a little burn from hibernate yeah yeah this isn't that yeah every time I talk about object mappers I always think of hibernate and the hell I went through there like here I'm gonna take that perfectly fine SQL you wrote and rewrite it into the worst possible SQL and trust me it will be the worst yeah I remember some of the output from some of that stuff and it was pretty messy yeah it took like an hour to query it I mean there just to parse the query horrible so yeah it doesn't sound like that though that's great well is there anything else we should know about dsls here or just go do it no go do it I say go do it because I've in a matter of fact I'm gonna put out a shameless plug here for Stephen let's blogpost even though we should provide the link yeah it he gives an excellent overview of what DSL czar right when to use them all sorts of examples in that kind of deal and I find it's a great resource yeah and no I good one-two punch yeah and if you're doing if you're doing gremlin in Java then I highly recommend checking out the DSL yeah cool that's a great way to end that well thanks everyone for joining us today this has been really interesting on dsls go check them out go click on the links read the blogs and we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the
