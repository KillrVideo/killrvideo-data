    "text": "foreign [Music] hi everyone my name is Khushi Sharma and welcome to this walkthrough in this video we're exploring more on Stargate apis along with that we'll also see how we can use the officials Target Cassandra Postman workspace to share and collaborate on Stargate apis Collections and environments so let's get started with this video let's talk about what is Target before diving in deep into the postman collections Stargate is an open source data API Gateway which turns Apache Cassandra into web apis it is deployed as a query coordination proxy in between your apps functions microservices and your database now what do we mean by developer Freedom of Choice with Target let's understand that now we can use Stargate to integrate Cassandra scale into our apps functions and services as web apis over HTTP using both diver connections and HTTP connections Stargate presents Cassandra SQL as several popular web apis including grpc graphql rest and document API let's understand more of that the Json document API supports both schema less and Json schema driven approaches for documentdb workloads with Cassandra however grpc and graphql provides near to near native performance for app function or service integration graphql is fast and it helps avoid the over or under fetching of data which is typical in rest systems rest is great for front-end JavaScript charm stack developers or even when you don't have a supported driver for grpc client for your language you can learn more about how to choose the right API for your project in the blog post link below in the video description now let's start with the postman collection firstly let's go to postman and here let's search for data Stacks Target as we can see here is this target Cassandra collection let's click this to expand more details and here we are this is the official Stargate Cassandra workspace available on Postman uh the link for the same is also available in the description box below now before we go ahead and start testing this let's also do a quick walkthrough of the whole Postman workspace please note that this is the admin view for now moving forward we'll see how to actually use it now we can use this Postman workspace to share collaborate on Stargate apis collections environments this workspace also provides the nosql database developers with white column document and key value database models using Postman Apache Cassandra and Stargate here you can see we have different collections available including specific examples of the document API graphql API grpc API and rest API as well each of these collections also consists of specific requests which will explore further and please note that the document API library is an active development so for now we'll just use the document my world example now we also have another section for environments now an environment is just a set of variables we use in our Postman requests we also use this to group related set of values together and we can also manage access to Shared Postman data now it's very important to select the correct environment because it will consist of a specific set of values which will be used by the postman requests pertaining to some specific examples used in the collection for example here we have two environments Astra API environment and the OSS API environment for this workflow we will only be using the Astra API environment although here the default values will work but we can even overwrite these values if needed for any certain case we can ignore the other environments for now the only other one we'll need is this target OSS API environment and that only if we want to runs Target in Cassandra locally otherwise we will be only using this target Astra API environment in this walkthrough now to move forward we would have to Fork these collections into our own workspace now just in case if you are wondering how to create your own workspace let me show you how we can do that we'll go to the section named workspaces and we'll click on create workspace now here we can put any name to the workspace I'll put data Stacks Target test and in the summary I'll just add this is a text collection run with respect to visibility you can choose who do you want to access this workspace I'll choose personal for now which means only I would be able to access it you can choose accordingly and now we'll click on create workspace and now as you can see my new workspace is created and this is personal which means only I would be able to access it now let's get started with the postman collections now we are back on the Stargate Cassandra workspace let's try forking these collections into our personals workspace that we just created to do that we'll click on the three dots here and we'll click on create a fork we'll let the fork label be Kushi sharma's fork and we'll select the workspace as the new workspace that we just created which is data Stacks Target test now we'll click on for collection and now as we can see I am in my personal workspace and this target document API collection is forked here with the label Kushi sharma's folk now since the postman collections can be accessed in the Target Cassandra workspace hosted on Postman we can either run the collections and Export them to use in our own application or we can run them from here right now I'm on this target documentation link this will be available in the description box below and I am on the section tooling resources now we have already folked the document API collection using the postman workspace this time let's try forking the rest API collection we'll click here which says run in Postman make sure while you are doing this you are selecting the button which says with Astra environment because for this walkthrough we will be using only this let's click here now we are redirected to a different window which says folk collection into your workspace let's click on folk collection just like before we'll let the fork label be as it is and on the workspace we'll select the personal workspace we just created which is data Stacks Target test let's click here and as we can see we are again in a personal workspace and this time this target rest API has been forked now with the rest API we have also got this target Astra API environment fogged here in the environment section we can also do the same from this target Cassandra workspace following the same method we use to Fork the document API now that we have forged all the four collections that is the document API the graphql API the grpc API and the rest API collection API environment we are good to go with the next steps of actually running these collections now it's important to realize that Stargate runs alongside a Cassandra cluster in between our application and Cassandra database we highly recommend using Astra DB since Target is already set up and it runs as a managed service Postman environments are also provided for us in order to run on Astra TV in the team space so let's try using this as a service on data Stacks Astra DB where both Cassandra and Stargate are automatically set up for us to move forward we'll go on data Stacks as to our dashboard you can easily sign up or login on data Stacks Astra using the link mentioned in the description box below once we are here on the dashboard we'll go to the databases section and we'll click on create database we can enter the basic details including the name and the key space name a mix will have to select a provider and a region you can select a region accordingly I'll choose Asia Pacific Mumbai India and as you can see I am on the current plan which is free for now let's click here which is create database and now what database has been successfully created it's in the pending state which means the token is getting generated for now here are our database details now we can download this whole CSV which will have all our secure token details now let's go to the database by clicking here now it's still in the pending state so let's wait for it to get active and we'll move further as we can see our Stargate database is active so let's move further now in order to set up access control for the new key spaces we'll go to our Astra DB console and we'll select organization settings from here from here we'll click on role management now we can see we have custom roles available according to a databases in our case we just created a Stargate name database so we'll go and edit this particular role we'll click on select all which will select all the organization permissions now here we'll click on apply permissions to all databases in this organization which will again select all the 45 permissions let's click on edit role to save please make sure that this is strictly for development and instructional purposes and this should never be used in production now once we're done with that we'll again go back to our database and we'll create a few more key spaces according to our Target collection to do that we'll move over to the key spaces section and we'll click here on ADD key space now let us create a my world key space and as we can see we have successfully created a key space named my world now similarly we have created three more key spaces named ks1 users key space and Library we'll need all of these in our Postman collections now that we're done with this let's go back to postman now that we're back on Postman we can see that in our Stargate Astra API environment we have to update some variable values let's do that first now with respect to Astra DB ID we can get this value from our Astra DB console so let's get back to our star dashboard and here in the databases section we can find the database ID on the side of our database name in our case our database name is Target and this is our database ID let's copy this and let's change this value here please note that both the initial value and the current value would have to be changed with the value that we just copied please make sure that you copy the database ID and not the data center ID which is available on the database detail page the dbid would only be available on the dashboard where all the databases are listed now with respect to the Astra DB region we would be able to get this in our database detail page on the dashboard this is a database region so let's copy this and paste it in our environment now auth token is the same token that we downloaded when we were creating a database so in this case you would have to open the downloaded file and we would have to copy the auth token from there this was the file that I downloaded when I was creating the database and as you can see this is the token label and this is our token let's copy this and let's paste it here now if the workspace you're forking into is not private if it is another team or public workspace make sure you are maintaining your database access token under current value and not initial value so that you don't expose the value to others in a team or a public workspace once we have updated all our variable values let's save our environment now let's start with the document API this target document API it modifies in queries data stored as unstructured Json documents in collections now because the document API uses schema less data no data modeling is required with respect to document API we're using the my world example for this particular collection now let's start by running the document API now this particular collection has different folders each folder consists a group of specific requests for example the authentication folder here has a post request to create an auth token however the authentication folder and the create schema folder both of these are specific to Target OSS only so we won't be running this instead we'll try running the retrieve schema folder here we can see we have a namespace named as get all namespaces now this is a get request and this is how the request looks like make sure you have selected your environment here as this target Astra API environment we can see we do not have any query parameters we do have the headers for this request and we also have tests for this request now to run this we'll click on this button which says send now this sends our request and we would be able to see the response here now as we can also see the test results worked fine which means this request is working just fine in our case now let's try inserting some data now here we can see we have a post request which is named as post nonsense stuff and this is how the request looks like let's try sending this request and let's see what response do we get here we see now that we have inserted our data and the test results also work fine let's insert some more data let's tie a put request here let's send this request because the test results work fine we are able to insert the data Joy now let's try retrieving this data let's try running the request get document Joey this is a get request and now we'll send this now as we can see we're able to retrieve the data related to document ID Joey that we just inserted in a last request similarly we can delete the data we can also delete this schema however delete schema is also specific to Target OSS only now that we have an idea of how document API collection Works let's try and run all these requests simultaneously to that we'll go to this target document API overview page we'll click the runner here which says run now here we can customize the running selections we'll untick the first three requests which is specific to Target OSS only we'll do the same with the last one also now let's click on runs Target document API my world and now as we can see in the first iteration itself all our requests have worked fine because all our tests has passed now that the document API is done let's start with the rest API this target rest API example is named as users key space it contains a sample schema in queries for stargate's rest API using the key space as user's key space and table as users now in order to use the rest API we should create schema that defines at least one key space and even one table that will store the data so let's get started with that again we have different folders We won't be using the authenticate request since it's specific to Target OSS only let's start running a few requests from the create schema folder let's see if we can create a table users this is a post request and this is how the request looks let's try sending this since all our tests are successful the table users has been created now similarly we can create a different columns we can create different table indexes this is with respect to create schema only let's start retrieving schema so what if we try a get request which says get a listing of all tables with defined columns here also we do not have any query parameters so let's try sending this and this is the response that we get if we get the data of all the tables defined with the specific columns here we can see a table users that we just created similarly we can retrieve other details we can retrieve columns we can retrieve table indexes now with respect to this folder we have different requests in which we can insert specific data and we can retrieve that data as well and the next set comes up is deleting data and schema now we'll try to run all these requests collectively we'll try the runner let's click on run Stargate and here also in the first iteration all of our requests are working fine all our tests have passed successfully which means the rest API is also working fine with respect to the example now let's start with the graphql API this target graphql API it has two modes schema first and SQL first the SQL first approach it directly translates the SQL tables into graphql types mutations and queries whereas the schema first approach it allows you to create idiomatic graphql types mutations and queries in a manner familiar to graphql Developers this target graphql API is implemented to easily modify and query or table data using graphql types mutations and queries with any Cassandra deployment now let's get started with the collection let's send a post request which says create a user defined type called address this is how the request looks like let's send this and let's see what response do we get here create type is true which means this particular UDT has been created now let's also try creating two tables book and reader this is also post request since all our tests for this request are also successful now we have created two tables book and reader we can also create indexes we can also create tables with a map and patch now let's try retrieving this schema let's try getting all these tables that we created now this is the response that we get which is the data of all the tables that we have created now let's try inserting data into this table let's try running this request which says inserting reader with user defined type now here we inserted a reader named Alan Ginsburg successfully with the UDT let's try inserting a book Jane Austen now this request was also successful that means we have successfully inserted our data now similarly we can retrieve some data we can delete data and we can also delete the schema now we'll run the runner now for the graphql API as well all our requests work fine in the first citation itself we have been able to run all the requests successfully now that we are done with the document API rest API and the graphql API let's move to a last bit for this walkthrough which is this target grpc API grpc is a modern open source remote procedure called framework it enables client and server applications to communicate transparently and makes it easier to build connected systems this target grpc API is implemented to create language specific queries using SQL with any Cassandra deployment now since this is still in beta a few extra steps will be needed to run this particular collection let's start running our grpc API now once we hope this API to our personal workspace it's possible the protobub definitions will get lost so when examining a specific test for example create table we look for The Telltale which says select a method here there are already some predefined methods but we'll try to change the service definition now from here we can choose to import a DOT Proto file these protophiles are only linked in the blog post mentioned in the description box below we can just download these files locally or we can also use the URLs in Postman let's click on import a Proto file we'll choose a file which we downloaded locally as you can say we successfully uploaded this target.proto file from our local system we'll make sure not to change the file names or dislocate them in different directories as there are import statements that cross reference the two files we'll click on next now this will prompt us to create an API which we have typically named as Stargate grpc let's click here which is create a new API now we have successfully created our API let's move over to the API section and yay now we have got a Stargate grpc API in the definition we have two files Stargate Proto and query Proto let's move back to our collection let's move back to our test now we'll simply choose our methods from this API we'll choose the execute query method I will also make sure to click the lock icon as TLS encryption does need to be enabled now that we're done let's click on invoke and let's see if this is working and this is working just fine now since this is not a collection we'll run tests individually now we'll move to our next test which is insert data let's try selecting a method here we'll choose the execute query method and will again click on invoke again this is working fine we're getting the OK code now let's try inserting batch data now when we're inserting batch data we won't select the normal method that we were using till now which was insert query we'll use the execute batch method at times the postman collection Runner may need to be reminded of which service definition from the grpc protobuf a given test call is using so we can associate them and accept the default Association Also let's invoke this and again we're getting the status code AS okay which means all these methods are working just fine and that is how we're also done with our grpc API with Stargate it's easy to integrate your applications Services functions to tap into the scale reliability and performance of Cassandra over http Star Gate modernizes building and managing real-time applications with Apache Cassandra by offering developer SQL over familiar web apis like grpc rest and graphql it also provides developer with schema list Json document API that transforms Cassandra into a document database it also improves the cluster performance with independently Deployable and scalable services coordinator and Storage Target is easy to deploy in Dev mode which Auto configures a Cassandra cluster for desktop development it's also Deployable to Bare Metal VMS Docker jkey eks Cassandra data Stacks Enterprise the fastest way to get started is Astra DB which sets it up for you automatically on the 80 gb monthly free plan so this was it for this particular demo thank you so much for watching this walkthrough in case you have any other questions or doubts please feel free to
