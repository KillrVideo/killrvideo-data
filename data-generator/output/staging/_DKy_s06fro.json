  "description": "In this video you’ll learn how to build create an application that connects to your DataStax Distribution of Apache Cassandra cluster on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using available drivers. Take advantage of this production-ready database supported by DataStax, the Apache Cassandra experts, that is 100% open source compatible. Your cluster will also include a development virtual machine allowing users to quickly realize the benefits and power of running and managing your data on GCP.\n\n \n\nGet started with DataStax Distribution of Apache Cassandra on GCP:\n\n8x5 Support: http://bit.ly/ddac_on_gcp_8x5\n\n24x7 Support: http://bit.ly/ddac_on_gcp_24x7\n\n \n\nCheck out our docs for more detailed information: http://bit.ly/ddac_on_gcp_docs",

    "text": "hello and welcome to another video in the getting started series for the data stocks distribution of Apache Cassandra how to build an application and in this video we will be writing an application that can send requests to antigua cluster the ability for an application to communicate with the Cassandra cluster it will rely on the driver and the language that you write code to do so data sex has created and maintained some number of drivers written in different programming languages from Java to c-sharp C++ Python nodejs Ruby and so forth I first want to show you where you can find a list of these different drivers and their corresponding documentation I'll start up a web browser to go to the development VM that was created with my D cluster you can find the URL for the development BM within the GCP deployment manager on the right hand side of the detect deployment window on the first tab here what is d dak I'll click on a link at D dak on GCP documentation scroll down to the session topics area and click on the link building an application for the data stacks distribution of Apache Cassandra on GCP on this page click on the link drivers for Apache Cassandra on this page the first table lists all of the drivers the leftmost column contains the DSC drivers and the middle column contains the Apache Cassandra drivers only the Cassandra open-source drivers in the middle column will work with DTAC from here you can click on your driver of choice to go to the documentation now I'll do a short coding demo to build an application using the Cassandra Java driver don't worry if Java is not your programming language of choice their driver concepts that I'll be explaining are similar across all of the drivers once I've opened my IDE I'll create a new maven project for my killer video application since my palm that XML is already opened I'll add the Cassandra Java driver to the dependencies needed for my application I'll then create a new class file that will be where I write the code for my application connecting to a cassandra class it begins with creating a cluster object this is generally the same across all the various drivers and we can add the information to the cluster object needed to connect to the cluster we can also use the cluster object to your de treat metadata about the cluster itself if it is able to successfully connect this metadata could be the cluster name or a list of the notes that make up the cluster their IP address current state which is whether they're online or offline and so forth for Java I'll use the cluster builder helper class to build my cluster object here I'll add the contact point which is the IP address of a node in my D cluster I'm using the public IP address of the node if you did not turn on public IPS for your deployment then you'll need to set the contact point to one of the internal IP addresses of a cluster node and run your application from your development VM you can find the internal IP addresses of the cluster nodes in the Google cloud platform console use the hamburger menu in the top left of the console and select compute engine finally I will call build which will build a cluster with my specified contact point there are a ton of other options you can set for the cluster such as user name and password yet the cluster as authentication turned on default query options the load balancing policy and much more the next step will be to create a session which is when you use the cluster object to actually connect to the database when this happens Apolo connections is generally created and maintained to each node in the cluster we instantiate the session objects by calling the clusters connect method here I can pass in a default key space that I want to use when executing statements which will be killer video note that both the cluster and session should only be created once and used as often as needed there is generally no need to create more than one instance of the cluster a session object and doing so will create more connections and consume more resources especially if you are not freeing up the previous objects with my session object I can now execute statements on the database using the sessions execute method I'll run a simple query to retrieve a row from the videos table return from the execute method we'll be a result set object which contains the rose for my query results if any since I'm only expecting one row in my results set I can use the method one to retrieve my row object I can then extract the column values for the row using various get methods if I want to grab the value from the name column for example I'll use the get string method since name is a text column the method takes in an argument which is the name for the column you can see that I'm also printing a sound so we can see the results when we run the application you the application prints off the name of I queried which is getting started building an application let's try a slightly more complex query where we can expect multiple rows and the results here I'll be querying the latest videos columns return all the videos for a certain date since it's possible to have more than one row I'll need to iterate through each of the rows in the result set which can be done with a for loop again I'll print out the name of the video for each row when I run the application the executed query returns more results with the name of the videos printed out to the console you saw that I typed in the column value directly in my query string which is not a particularly secure thing to do the driver does support the use of placeholders so I can set that in my query string and then bind the value for the placeholder afterwards there are two more objects I want to show a simple statement and a prepared statement a simple statement represents a query that can be executed using the session object what's new about the simple statement is that it allows options to be set for how that particular statement will be executed this includes the query fetch size the consistency level the paging States and whether to execute the statement we're tracing here I'm creating the simple statement with the previous query and using the object as the argument for the session execute method the last object is the prepared statement which is a very useful construct when a particular statement is executed many times in the application the statement will be pre compiled on the cluster and only the bound values for the statements are sent by the driver when executing rather than sending the entire statement itself each time you execute here I'll create a prepared statement query - which has a query with one placeholder note that the prepared statement itself is not executable as it always needs to have the bind method called the Byron method the bounce statement which can then be passed to the session execute method I did not show any examples of an insert update or delete here but they all execute just like a query a result set is returned but you generally do not need to process it any errors with a write request will usually manifest as an exception instead that's pretty much it for the driver the basic steps are to create this cluster in session and then use the session to execute statements which returns a result set and then iterate through that as needed you saw me typing it earlier but once the application is done it should close the session and cluster object too close to node connections and free up resources we have barely scratched the surface of the capabilities of the Cassandra driver but I hope you have enough now to get started if you're interested in learning more check out the documentation for the drivers there are a lot of great features like asynchronous execution load balancing and much more I'd also like to point you to the killer video reference app which can be found on github here you can find the finished version of killer video with implementations in Java note jeaious and c-sharp and as always check out data stacks academy for free courses blog posts and even a podcast for all things cassandra related",
