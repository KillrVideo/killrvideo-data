    "text": "good morning good afternoon or good evening welcome we're here today to talk a little bit about how to use spring boot to connect to an automatically generated rest api for your apache cassandra database this database is hosted on data stacks astro our managed cloud that is built on kubernetes prometheus envoy and other cutting edge database technologies so it's pretty straightforward and only takes a couple minutes the fastest way to get going is to sign in with google great so very simple you just select a free plan let's deploy on google cloud and you pick a region that's proximate to you and say configure database now let's use we just need to feed it four fields we give it a database name we'll give it a key space name called spring rest key space nothing fancy and we'll give it a username and password for the database nothing that would pass an it security check but just for the purposes of demonstration and click create database now this will just take a couple minutes to spool up it's pretty fast awesome we've got our database active we can connect to it via a number of different ways we can go directly to the cql console and type in native cql which is fine but part of the point of this is that we want to be able to use a native rest api that we're already familiar with and not have to learn cql we'll come back to this later so if you come to the connect tab here you can get environment variables that set that get set and show you how to connect to the database and astra uh via a number of different apis so what i'm going to do is i'm going to grab this database id dynamically generated database id which will come in handy later in the tutorial so basically i'm just following along these instructions here in the github repo and at this point i've done all this stuff uh and all i'm doing you know is now uh after cloning the github repository now i'm just opening this in gitpod uh which is a browser-based ide uh and over here in this window and what i'm going to do is i'm going to call a shell script that sets up sets up our database using the astra devops api uh and that's just called github gitpodsetup.sh and that will ask you for a few different pieces of information if it's the first time you've connected it'll ask you for your database name and this is the stuff you just typed in earlier to the console oh whoops just a second this is actually asking for the database username hold on so that's that yep now we're giving it the key space name of spring rest key space [Music] and let's get that dynamically generated database id that we were talking about a second ago it comes in handy right here now on the free tier we always deploy on google cloud so and in this case we remember we chose usc 1. so it gets an auth token uses the devops api that's already available on astra and creates some tables for us great so all that remains is we can compile and run the spring boot application so let's call our gradle wrapper and call the task boot run okay there we go fantastic so that compiles and what happens is it outputs some json to the spring boot console which i've highlighted here let's see if i can make that a little bit bigger yeah and it spits out some game of thrones uh actor names or character names excuse me so what we'll do is uh let's do a little quick code review and look at the astra db rest spring boot application basically the interesting part here is that it's using the rest template dot exchange method which is a slightly lower level method than the normal annotated spring methods and it'll the reason why is it allows you to set some custom security headers with the connection information and then it calls a get method here and passes in this http entity that you've populated with the custom headers and then specifies the javabean class that the results will get mapped to and then logs it out to the console so with that let's wrap up the demo like any rest api it's pretty easy to use spring boots rest template to work with an apache cassandra database on data stacks astro other automatically generated api endpoints for graphql json document api and more will be covered in future videos so we really look forward to your feedback and i just want to say a quick thanks for your time take care and hope to see you in a future demo soon",
