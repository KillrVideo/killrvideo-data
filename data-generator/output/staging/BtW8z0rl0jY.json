    "text": "hi this is Jeff Carpenter Technology evangelist here at datastacks and I'm live in the studio with David gilardi we also have on the phone Luke Tillman from Denver Colorado hey guys hello from Denver hey what's up hey Luke so we wanted to talk a little bit today about killer video the application what it is why it exists why you should care so Dave's going to kick us off with our our first question we have a few questions for you Luke about how this thing came to be all right yeah let's do it all right so Luke hi Luke so why why did you create killer video let's start it off with something fun so so the uh the history of killer video is actually kind of interesting so you know when I joined data Stacks maybe about three and a half years ago at the time um I was coming from a software engineering background and our uh Chief evangelist Patrick McFadden who is our bosses uh one of all of our boss uh he he said you know hey why don't you come and be an evangelist and uh and I said well what's an evangelist first of all and uh and after he kind of described it to me and whatnot I said you know I don't really have a great background you know at this point I had had some experience with Apache Cassandra but I really hadn't had any exposure to data Stacks Enterprise and you know I said to him well if I'm going to go out and I'm gonna try and teach people how to use Cassandra and how to use DSC it's something that I really need to like first of all ramp up on and then I gotta believe in it you know because I want to be effective as an evangelist you know it's a piece it's got to be a piece of technology that I actually believe in and so he kind of suggested that I go off and I build a real application and and at the time he had these slides uh from a talk that he was giving on on this demo kind of like you know kind of uh I guess Made Up application that he called killer video and the idea was you know it's um you know it's basically like YouTube and the nice thing about that is that that's kind of like a business domain that everybody sort of understands because everybody's kind of spent some time uh you know on YouTube at this point in their in their careers and so um we decided it would be like cool to actually go off and really build this thing and not only in the process would I get to learn what it's like to build a real application on top of something like data stack Enterprise um you know I would also then be able to take that code and turn it into something open source and hopefully other developers who maybe are coming from a background a software engineering background like mine which is relational databases um you know they would understand you know through example kind of what it is you know how it is you work with this thing how it is you build a something real on top of uh data Stacks Enterprise you know after all this time of working with killer video and and like talking a look about this I never realized that Patrick was the actual start of it I always thought the killer video thing was your brainchild and I already I already hold you in such terribly high regard but it's now it's knocked you down just a slight Notch is so he actually you know he actually owned like he he thought that this was going to be something someday it was just slides you know and I can and I can even give you guys a copy of the of the slide deck from you know Circa maybe 2014 or something like that that he was using but he even registered the domain name and this is killer video without an e you know so like he thought this was going to become a thing he even had the foresight to like register the domain name at the at the time so very good yeah so this is a great app and it's a great learning tool for for somebody who's getting started but but where do they get started I mean I let's say I want to jump in and I want to learn how to use data Stacks Enterprise using the killer video I mean how do I even get started and jump into it Luke well um so you know now nowadays um we have some pretty great documentation now so when I first put this together you know three years ago you know documentation was lacking and it was a very different beast at the time and I think um you know at some point we may talk about you know kind of what it was originally and what it is now but um but there's some really great documentation so we have a github.io site killervideo.github.io and you can go on there and there are docs for how to get started kind of how to jump in uh and you know kind of find out well where does the actual you know if I'm if I'm trying to learn how do I interact with DSE you know what are the best practices for interacting um with DSC how do I do you know how do I do a query how do you know how do I do queries in parallel how do I do you know all these different things um you know it kind of will direct you to where the interesting code in the project lives because at the end of the day this is a full-blown application so it does have some you know kind of cognitive overhead of you know being a you know having an application stack that you may or may not be familiar with also so hopefully that documentation will point you to some of the more interesting Parts where if you just want to see kind of the DSE related stuff um you'll know where to go look yeah perfect so that's yeah and I've been there I I had to go when I first started working on the app I had to go like where's the meat okay so where's the actual queries and it's very interesting because there's a you know a pretty narrow slice of the application in in the service implementations where all that DSE interaction lives and it's honestly you know a relatively small percentage of the overall code base so um that being said it this isn't just a way to learn uh DSE and interactions with data stacks and Apache Cassandra I mean it's a legitimate distributed application multi-tier web application on top of microservices Etc so that's because Luke rocks yeah yeah that's why he just he just spins Magic [Music] so I want to talk a little bit about some of the other technology choices that you made because you know once you had selected your data tier that's just the beginning right everything else that you had to layer on top of that so how do you how do you come to make those choices yeah you know it's like anything in uh like it's funny talking about technology choices like it's like any technology choice that you like make it and then some of them you regret later are we going to get into the regrets right now we can totally talk regrets one one in particular but so um so I guess first thing we did you know when we kind of we had we had an existing application that I that I did you know maybe three years ago and um and we were trying to get to more of a microservices architecture and so we had some kind of boxes that we need to tip we need needed to tick um so one of those for example was you know what do we want our service contracts how are we going to do contracts for our services knowing like that the goal is that our our actual Services themselves our micro services on the back end are going to be implemented in different programming languages now you know for us being a reference application um you know it was because we want to do the full Suite of services that are that are in there in each programming language in a real application you know though that's a problem they have as well you know so you know you might be a primarily Java shop or something like that but you're like you know you might decide that all of a sudden this other service that you want to do oh that would be great to do and go or that would be great to do in node.js or you know oh man you know F sharp is such a great you know functional language and this is like a really great functional problem why wouldn't we do this in F sharp with DOT net or something like that and so people end up you know whether through technology choices or sometimes acquisition right so like at the last company I was at the we had that problem all the time of like we were one acquisition away from you know going from uh primarily.net shop to a.net and Java and Python and all of these other kind of Technologies so it's a problem people have in the real world as well so we needed some way to kind of do those service contracts uh in sort of a universal way that could uh give us you know kind of uh typed apis you know in these typed languages and and worked across multiple programming languages and so you know we kind of looked around and there's some there's some players and things like that um you know Thrift which people who know anything about Cassandra will will know Thrift was actually the original way that you used to interact yeah that's right but it's also you know a kind of a way of doing RPC you know but uh you know if you're going to kind of offer micro microservice uh vrpc uh we could have done rest endpoints with HTTP and Json um we kind of ended up settling though on grpc which was this brand new framework it was in beta at the time when we were looking at it that let us use protocol buffers to Define our our contracts and then uh consume those or generate service code and whatnot in multiple programming languages so we have that um you know on the front end we had things like react and uh and uh an Express node.js backend because we wanted a reusable kind of uh web server that uh that could be reused by multiple you know microservice implementations under the covers um and then we had to figure out how to spin up infrastructure as well so Docker right is what we ended up settling on as far as the way to you know we've got these other dependencies these other things that we need Beyond just a node of data Stacks Enterprise um how do we stand up like a full application stack for a developer to like try out as quickly as possible yeah as quickly as possible and as simply as possible right you know we didn't want them to have to follow 10 or 12 steps and install 16 different things and you know like that was just kind of a barrier to entry when we really wanted them to be able to be up and running as quick as possible and you know be able to jump in and throw break points in their editor of choice and and really kind of Step through code and see what was going on so yeah yeah and in all honesty too from that standpoint from the ability to be able to get things stood up quickly for an end developer who doesn't know anything about the the front end the microservices architecture any of that stuff right now what you've got actually what you created on it's going to sound like I'm just totally beefing him up but um it it serves that purpose because I've actually been going through and we're going to talk about this I know in a minute but I've been going through you know deploying this all out in the data sex managed cloud and everything and having to account for those services in a more real world setup compared to being able to contain an alt and Docker and stuff huge huge there's a huge amount of stuff going on in that app right uh you know it's a it's a real app so uh so that's real all right oh yeah real real totally real but um I mean you know I could download the thing in Docker and have it running in two hours you know easy so it's yeah no it's a big deal sorry I was gonna say we so we mentioned technology choice that I regret which one is it Luke which one so one thing that um one problem that we needed to solve was how do we how does our um our front end like our react app single page app that's on uh you know running in a browser how does that talk to the back-end web server and then that back-end web server then fans out to the various micro services that we that we were doing with grpc and so what I ended up doing um was I chose Falcor which is a which is a library from Netflix and it provides a client component that kind of sits in the react you react uh UI and talks to a web server on the back end and then it has this router component that sits on the web server and can fan out requests um to various micro services and if I had it all if I had it to do all over again I'd probably um would have chosen something maybe like graphql from Facebook which actually came out right around the same time as Falcor they both kind of got open sourced right around the same time and they were both kind of trying to solve a similar problem and the reasoning being you know Falcor just hasn't seen the uptick or uptake I guess in you know kind of Interest people actually using it out in the wild that you've seen with graphql it's gotten you know a lot of adoption a lot of people embracing it in fact in a in another project that I'm working on now we're actually using graphql for that purpose so lesson learned that we'd like to bring you back in to redo our front end the Luke now I could just retool the whole thing thanks yeah all right I mean that's not you know you can definitely get value out of the killer video app without going and learning falcore it's not that's not a prerequisite to being able to engage with it but that being said it's also a legitimate example of a real world application perfect example for you to look at yeah yeah yep the the web UI all runs in Docker and you don't even have to think about it when you're trying out the microservices implementation but if you wanted to go look at that code it is all open source yeah you know I was going to make a point similar to that I totally cut you off Luke sorry you're done now no no I was totally gonna make a point about that because I mean throughout the killer video project right I've had to look at all the different language implementations you know C sharp node.js Java and what's awesome about it is you know from what you just stated there I didn't have to touch the web UI I didn't have to do any I mean it just it's all fair it's seamless and that's yeah that's actually quite powerful that's that's been that's good stuff so so overall I guess you know once once now uh you know you got killer video out there you've got these different language implementations you know I know you guys uh you have documentation um you know there's been some you've I think you've done some talks and everything like what's been the response and you know and that you've gotten from uh killer video you know once you uh once you get it out there and that kind of deal it's been uh I mean I would say it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience so you know there's there's you know the cool thing of you know having an open source project um you know at the time it was we didn't have a killer video organization on GitHub so the original implementation that was just in C sharp lived you know under my you know my personal account on on GitHub and you know over time it started getting forked and it starts getting stars and you know that's kind of cool like you're starting to see people like show some show some interest you know cloning the repo and and trying it out so that's been really cool but um really like it's led to some really cool things so for example Cassandra Summit a couple of years ago uh you know we got my my colleague at the time John Haddad and I got to go on stage in front of like 4 000 of our closest friends and uh and we're there you know on stage with Scott Guthrie from Microsoft who's like a long time nerd hero of mine so like that's super cool anyway you know because I'm because I was a.net background guy and we um you know we got to like present as part of the keynote um about this project and trying to get people excited and and you know the feedback from that was overwhelmingly positive and then also you know going around and just doing training events things like Cassandra days that we used to uh that we used to do all the time and now the data Stacks live uh training events like the nice thing about killer video is you know partly that domain that business domain of like you know it's kind of like YouTube you know and and it's given us a you know kind of Freedom with some of our training materials to go off and play in that world and do things and at the end of the day be like and if you want to see real code for some of the stuff you can go check that out and and there are so many people that learn uh you know that way they want to see example code and so you know for them to come up and and be able to say like wow that really helped me like I I had a guy come up to me once and say I took I took this one function out of your app and I just copied and pasted it modified it a little bit and was able to like do exactly what I wanted to do you know just based on your example code and that's pretty cool that people are going out there and stack Overflow of cases but that's pretty cool you know that somebody took took something that I did um to try and help them learn and you know was able to like put it in their own product or use it in their own uh you know use it in their own application yeah no that's that's very cool so so I know we've kind of touched on some of the areas you know you've given this kind of like a history of where killer radio started and where it's where it's gone to so what kind of things have changed over time I think at one time wasn't it deployed up in Azure um you know and and I mean like I said you've already kind of hinted it somewhere some aspects um you know can you give us kind of like an overall timeline what things have changed over time yeah yeah the biggest change was like I just mentioned uh before like we were part of the keynote at Cassandra Summit and when we were on stage talking about killer video at that point killer video was a you know it was only available in c-sharp it was a.net application we had some um some kind of azure specific Parts because we ran a live demo of it in Azure we were for example using Azure Media Services um to allow for users to actually upload videos into the UI and then Azure Media Services would take that Source video and transcode it into all these other formats that could then be you know kind of played back on the web and it was very much like you had to watch all those videos for quality control [Laughter] that's funny you say that we did we did at one point have a problem with people going onto the live demo site like span spamming like borderline inappropriate working homes like yeah borderline inappropriate videos and we were like man what are we gonna do like do we have to actually put content like filters in place and wow that's like a whole other thing but really yeah that question here again soon actually yeah yeah be be wary um but so so people um you know with at the time though it was very much sort of a modular monolith we had Services you know in the.net version but everything ran and processed together and um and so really it was after that keynote that you know we sat down and and we kind of were like you know we really need to get this into other programming languages what can we do uh you know to to have a Java version you know to have a node.js version things like that and so that's when we really made the move to okay let's you know we kind of got these service contracts already defined in the.net version let's let's go and look at some other pieces of Technology let's you know kind of make this not.net specific what what are some ways that we can do that and how do we get ourselves to the point where you know a developer who wants to learn can learn in the programming language that they are most comfortable uh with so that's kind of that was kind of the impetus to moving to things like grpc and and a reusable front end and and that kind of thing and so and now as as we're speaking you know we've got I think three different uh language implementations which is awesome um so you know we definitely got there eventually it just took some time nice so this has been a really good I think overview of the history of the project of killer video and you know where we've been um I think in our next episode after this Luke is going to turn the tables on us um he's handed over the reins on this application his baby he's turned it over uh to David and I I'm sorry Luke we've wreaked a little bit of Havoc with it so we're gonna give him a chance to hold us to account for things that we've been doing to you the killer video application so stay tuned and in our our next video we'll we'll talk through some of where killer video is going thanks",
