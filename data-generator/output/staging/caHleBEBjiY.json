  "title": "Cassandra Data Modeling Tools | Ep. 101 Distributed Data Show",
  "description": "In this episode Jeff and Adron have a quick topical discussion of some tools they're using to get work done with CQL and databases in general. Adron discusses using JetBrains DataGrip and what it's been enabling him to do, then Jeff interjects with some additional thoughts and asks the question, is Cassandra not your only database? Where Adron elaborates on how DataGrip works with many other databases, so when one is approached with work across a wide spectrum of sources they can tackle that work with DataGrip. Then both Jeff and Adron get into what they'd like to see in next generation IDE's and what they'd like to have tooling around to get the job done!\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "on this week's distributed data show we want to talk Kassandra tooling because that's a narrow topic right yeah I immediately my head just exploded thinking about all the possibilities well you know what let's just let's unpack this a little bit at a time okay talk through the wide world of what's available and some options and then our wish lists that sounds like a plan from data stacks this is the distributed data show cuz I can I can tell you a few of the tools that I've been using recently okay um a lot of what I've used just kind of hacking around to do sample cql and get some things put together to show customers and to work through questions of my own okay I've been using data grip a lot data grip okay yeah so that's it that's JetBrains basically like a data IDE and it's in the IntelliJ family of that okay and one of the cool things is to a lot of the capabilities in it such as the autocomplete around cql things like that it's available in IntelliJ or goal and/or webstorm or whatever so I can try this out okay yeah you can add the plug-in but data grip itself is solely focused around working through cql queries and and also a bunch of other databases that are based around sequel okay so like you can bounce back and forth within the same project and write up your queries and just just keep working at it it kind of brings all the little pieces that you need together from your connections to your you different syntax like it does the highlight and all that stuff for you so it's it's a pretty great tool but that that's the one I've been using the most lately okay so data grip was that giving me I'm trying to think about my Cassandra development process start to finished right I want to think about my application what are my what are my access patterns gonna be any queries I'm gonna design a damn model for that then I'm gonna be actually maybe testing out writing some cql queries to sort of actually get the feel for my table can I insert and get data out in the way that I expect then I want to write application on top of that right then I want to find out how my cluster is doing am i killing it do I have a bad data model like yeah so I mean there could be tools at many points along this spectrum where does it where does the data grip fit in exactly so the way I kind of see data grid I'm not even sure what other other people might use it from a different perspective yeah but like what I have been doing with it is I'll actually start a project saying goal and or IntelliJ or some other editor like Visual Studio code yeah and I'll get the base of the project but then I always have a schema migrations library where I'm like alright this thing is going to be what builds up the data structure for the tables and whatever other else that I need to work with and then it might put in some like initial data for testing or something like that but from there I don't really use the IDE that's specific to the language I'm writing with yeah so I switch out to data grip to write a bunch of the other queries where I'm like trying to work through individual things where like I need to figure out how to sort this and how should this work with this ring and just a lot of create and destroy ie you know you're saying that your honor is not your only database and you use other okay no it's reality right Cassandra the perfect perfect database for every use case right so okay so this part of your and you're developing in multiple languages right multiple databases so the exact this combinatorial yeah and so you're saying data group is kind of your go-to a lot of them for the data portion right exactly of your application and so often a lot of time when somebody else gives me a problem they're like here's the five databases I'm using and trying to collect something from write easy way to do that pull out data grip okay like I can get into all of them right one place I don't have to like have five different tools up so that's that's great for that but still as I get back into the app dev side I always roll back into like the goal and write editor or one of the other things it's more specific to like the language and then I kind of mix and match between the two okay so this is one of the dilemmas that I want to ask you about right we all know that because modeling is different and when you approach data modeling for Cassandra you need to be thinking about your queries and designing tables around those queries what I always I'm afraid of and like using more of a general-purpose data access or data modeling tool is that it's going to try to enforce it's gonna naturally want to lead me down some relational mode yeah of thinking and then it's not gonna be designed around right Cassandra data modeling so I've seen a couple of different tools out there for Cassandra data modeling like there's a KDM tool that is built based off on our friend arts and tobacco's kind of his methodology for lysander data modeling that's a pretty cool tool it tends to be like a forward engineering it doesn't really do reverse engineering but it's kind of like one-way access pattern table with that out at the other end but then there's other tools like I've seen hackle aid which is a little bit similar to data grip it does a lot of the similar things mm-hmm my I have maybe have this bias but I I'm like can a general-purpose data modeling tool really get Cassandra data modeling right that's that's a good question because even in data grip when I'm doing it there's various elements of it where it's very clear that it's kind of a sequel first thought yeah for instance when I create a key space you go in and you have to know that you click new database hahaha it's like it's a broken paradigm but it still understands cql enough that it gives me the key space yeah syntax to create the key space which is correct but it's just in the editor certain pieces just aren't going to change because they're modeled around a relational structure so that is a little weird it gives me the central tool but it's still frustrating whenever I break out of the relational paradigm and even like if I step into say trying to get into some graph queries or something like that you don't I still have to leave the editor right because there isn't that like central editor where I can get into any aspect of say data stacks Enterprise where you get graph analytics or whatever right so that's that's a little bit of a growth point right so yeah I understand we don't necessarily even have like the one unified data modeling tool even for the different languages that we support query languages that we support within our our own product and that's really because some of the paradigms are so different right I'm not even sure it would be possible to build a tool that built me a graph schema and a cql table with like kind of the same structure and visualization of things gremlins would talk about head exploding yeah and you know and a lot of ways to I wouldn't think it would be even ideal to try to bring all those things up or spit right right if anything it's you still really kind of need to have those notions completely broken apart right because you you need to be in a different headspace you need to think from the data perspective of a completely different way then when you're say writing some go code or something yeah graph data model is not the same right like a standard data model exactly so okay let's talk a little bit about wish lists I would love it right I I've definitely seen tools that do a good job of visualizing tables and relationships between tables right um but then how do I know if I'm actually designing a model that's a good data model that's gonna perform well it's scale see the way that I know that do this right now is well you write a test program that inserts a bunch of data into that table right and then does a bunch of queries and kind of sees how that performs over time we're we know we know we know Cassandra stress right it does that there's some improvements over time people are building better tools than that to be able to do things but I mean shouldn't I be able to look at a table and analyze it without having to do a stress test and throw a bunch of data at it and I want an expert system agent I want an expert system that looks at my table design and says you're gonna have a wide partition there be careful and it and this right now I don't know of any tools that you can sit down besides pencil and paper you know the math on like well what's going to be the situation if I dump 14 terabytes or petabytes of day in this cluster right that's that's even tough to do the math on but otherwise you know you just say you have to set up a test environment to start figuring out some of those things it would be great to have an app that could do some of those calculations and determine because we do know the math I mean the math is removable in a lot of these scenarios we're like well that table structure is gonna break once you get to say sixty billion of whatever in it right you know like there's measurable things so having a application that can give us some baselines would be great but speaking of nice to have on top of that you know give me your wish list I went off on mine so it's only fair I've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart for user experience design yeah largely because I've seen more than a few apps myself and thought uh how do you how do I even use this like wireframes yeah kind of wireframes but just the thinking of what what does the application actually need to do yeah before I even get way down into the data right it would be nice to kind of piece together some basic understandings of what I do have like I have this this data so far and then I had this domain idea and like I kinda I'm gonna need this data to like sell a ticket to someone to do this thing right well I had these pieces I would love to be able to put that into a system and it starts to kind of show a piece together architecture really right where I can build from that and even then maybe push code and push cql to build that out for me well I would love something like that and I've seen piecemeal stuff especially for like some of the like 40 year old relational databases they have like code first for whatever yeah but even then it's so it's so tightly coupled to the notion of how our relational database works you can't break away from that very easily right right so like science fiction man it does start with user experience design first and then actually derive data and application design well we're talking about I like your wishlist man yeah nice to have yeah I mean I'd love to talk to the computer and say computer please you know Earl Grey hot right get that but I still don't have that computer ok well in the absence of that I think there there is currently no substitute for best practices for understanding what you're doing and creating data models yeah thinking carefully about how wide your partitions are gonna get for thinking carefully about how you're gonna use that data model so that you're not designing something that's gonna rely on doing lots of lots and lots of deletes and creating lines and tombstones until we have that automated system that asks you all the right questions I think there's no substitute for best practices and experience so yep keeping a list and checking it twice exactly awesome ok well you know maybe next time we could talk about your your visions for application development in there in the next century I like that yeah ok you look look forward to that future awesome ok until next time",
