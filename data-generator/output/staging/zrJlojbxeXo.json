  "description": "Welcome to the Intro to Cassandra Crash Course! In this video series, we'll go over the basics of how Apache Cassandra works and get hands on with implementing a basic Cassandra Database in the cloud!\n\n💻 Create your Cassandra Database:\nhttps://astra.dev/cassandra-course\n\n📥 Workshop Materials:\nhttps://github.com/DataStax-Academy/Intro-to-Cassandra-for-Developers#2-create-a-table\n\nLearn more about Cassandra at Apache (https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/)  and DataStax (https://docs.datastax.com/en/landing_page/doc/landing_page/cassandra.html) documentation websites.\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\n\nAbout DataStax:\nDataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandra™.

    "text": "well already i hope you liked that previous video giving you a little bit of primer on tables and partitions and some examples and uh we're gonna get in now creating a table in our intro to cassandra fort developers crash course this is video four of seven uh again there is a link in the video details all we're really doing notice that hash to create a table we're just leading you to the anchor right um but if you didn't see that all you need to do if you remember we were over here before we're just going to section 2 create a table now this point our killer video cluster should be nice and active right our database should be active it should be ready to go so here's what we're going to do first thing is you want to go to your database so we're just going to click on it i'm clicking on kill the video cluster and we're going to the detail page for that particular database now i want to go to cql console right i'm going to click on that that's what we're talking about right here it's going to automatically log you in boom now you're ready to go okay so the first command that we want to issue here and by the way you can just copy these where it says command execute you can just pop it right off the page i'm going to put that in here we're describing our key spaces that's what that means we want to look at all the key spaces that we have in our database now remember we created one called killer video so it's right there ready to go now if i were to start just issuing commands it wouldn't probably do me much good at this point what i want to do if i scroll down and go to the next one here is use i'm going to tell the console i want to use the killer video key space i want to put the console in the context of the killer video key space now i can just start issuing cql commands against it i could have technically done that without the use command and fully qualified all of my cql commands but we're not going to really worry about that i just wanted you to be aware of the use keyword and what it does okay so let's go ahead and go down to create or step 2c create the users by city table now this should look a little bit familiar because if you've been following along in the crash course you would have already come across this particular example so what we're going to do now is we're going to grab this and we're going to create our table so again remember using cql this is create tables so we're going to say okay i want to create a table if it doesn't exist called users by city here are my fields here are the types right so these all happen to be text and then i'm going to set my primary key set my city as the partition key last name first name and email are clustering columns now if i describe tables right because before i didn't have any oh look now i have a users by city table because we just created it and that's it i mean the exercise is pretty simple from that standpoint right i just wanted to get you a feel of using a little bit of the cql and what that does so now you've gone you've described your key spaces you've used the killer video key space you created a table and you used described tables to show you any of the tables that you have that is the end of this particular exercise so go ahead go on into the next video and then we will see you back here to execute some crowd operations",
