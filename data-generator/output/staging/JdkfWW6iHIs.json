    "text": "hi and welcome to the getting started video on writing and querying data for the data stacks distribution of Apache Cassandra in this video we'll be going through some of the different write and query operations that are available with Cassandra query language or CQL in previous videos we learned how to connect your cluster and set up a key space we've also created two tables that will store data for our application one called videos and another called latest videos let's take a look at some useful commands that you can use to see what key spaces or tables exist in a Cassandra cluster the describe key spaces command will show you all of the key spaces that exist in the database besides the killer video key space the rest of the key spaces here are automatically generated by the database and you most likely won't need to do anything about them the next command is describe key space without the S if you specify a key space name this command shows you the schema definition for both the key space the tables and the other database objects within the key space here you can see the key space definition for killer video and the table definitions for videos and latest videos next is the described tables command which gives you all of the tables in each schema if you set a default key space like what I'm doing here then describe tables we'll only list the tables within that key space finally the describe table command with a table name displays the corresponding table definition ok now that we are familiar with the tables we've created let's start by adding some data the write operations we will look at are the insert operation the update operation and the delete operation if you are familiar with the structured query language SQL you will find these operations to be intuitive the insert operation uses the insert into keywords followed by the table name and then in parentheses add the column name for the corresponding data at a minimum this needs to include all of the primary key columns for the case of the videos table here that means we would need to include the video ID column here I'm only going to include the video ID at a date and name column Kassandra has a sparse storage engine so all of the other table columns that you don't specify will not take up any space so don't worry if there isn't data for every column in the row you are inserting next I use the values keyword and then add values for the columns since the video ID is a UUID column I'll need to add a 128-bit UUID value like this it can be hard to remember the exact formatting for a UUID but cql does have a function named UUID that can automatically generate a UUID if it is a time column we use the now function instead to generate a time UUID value note that in cql strings are enclosed in single quotes our added date column is a timestamp column but you can insert the value as a string formatted as iso 8601 or as a unix timestamp integer with a string similar to the one I'm using here Cassandra will truncate the smaller units like hours minutes and seconds okay that's an insert command in a nutshell let's turn our attention to an update command here we have the update keyword in the table name we want to update followed by the column name and the value that we want to set then we need to specify the row we are updating by including a where clause that includes all the primary key columns we'll set this to the video ID value that we have just inserted the last right operation is the delete operation we use this to delete rows or delete individual columns within a row for this example we will delete a single column named location from our recently inserted an updated row note that if we wanted to delete the entire row we can just write delete from I'll add a few more rights here to populate our table so feel free to follow along okay now that we've written the data let's see how to query the data we begin with the Select keyword followed by the specification of rows we want to retrieve just like SQL the column specification can either be star which retrieves all of the columns or we can enumerate the individual column names we want next we add a from clause to identify the target table in this case videos now if we end the statement like so this would cause a full table scan that would retrieve all of the rows in the table this may not be bad right now since we only have a few rows but in a production system where you might have millions of rows this type of a query would not be performant instead let's add a where clause here to specify the video ID which is the partition key column this retrieves only the row whose video ID value matches the specified UUID value if you are querying a table that has both a partition key and clustering columns then it is possible to retrieve multiple rows like this query here you'll notice that the results come back in sorted order based on the added date column since at a date is a clustering column well I've said that you may primarily query data using just the partition key it is possible to include the other columns in the primary key as well you don't have to specify all clustering columns but if you do specify a clustering column you must also include the specification for clustering columns that precede the clustering column of interest for example let's say that we want to retrieve only a specific row in the latest videos table we have to provide a value for the partition key but why not just add a condition for the video ID as you can see this query results in an error since the query does not include the added date column in the where clause if we add in the remaining clustering column at a date the query succeeds and we get back the resulting row the query here works fine since both ýÿ ýÿ mmdd and the added date columns are the leftmost columns of the primary key there are some things you can do to modify the results of a query you can set an order by clause to change the sorted order of the clustering column you can also set a limit to limit the number of results the query returns if you have experience with SQL cql writes and queries should feel intuitive however there are many things that Cassandra is doing under the covers that helps these operations to be performant and it is a good idea to know a little bit about how Cassandra works one important concept is the way writes work in Cassandra cql differentiates inserts updates and deletes but in the end cassandra handles all these mutation operations in a similar manner this means that you can actually use an insert operation to update an existing row and an update operation to insert a new row cassandra does not check if there is an existing row with the same primary key values before doing an insert or an update here we execute to insert operations that use the same video ID value there is no error with the second insert instead if we look at the resulting row we see that the second insert has overwritten the previous columns values and has added values to the columns that previously did not exist in the row we call this behavior an upsurge it's because of this special property of Cassandra rights that we stress the importance of designing your table primary key properly if the primary key does not ensure uniqueness then it is possible for new inserts to override existing rows with no warning or notification one last thing I want to discuss is the way deletes work in Cassandra rather than physically removing data when executing a delete Cassandra writes a record called a tombstone which indicates that the corresponding data is no longer valid and should be ignored during queries this method serves two purposes first it makes deletes just as fast as an insert or update and second the tombstone serves as a marker when syncing data across different replica sets eventually in the background Cassandra will remove the deleted records along with the tombstones but this may happen several days after the delete if an applications write pattern contains too many deletes this may lead to a problem too many tombstones can accumulate and significantly slow query execution since Cassandra must read through all these tombstones as well as the actual live data some of the topics in this video are complex if you would like to learn more you can check out data stacks Academy at Academy data stacks comm where we offer free training courses that cover these topics in more detail some other topics you may be interested in include bulk loading data performing range scan queries lightweight transactions the Cassandra right path and read path and compactions the content on data stacks Academy is very helpful and it's all free",
