hangout um q a time before we get started just wanna welcome everyone let's hang out ryan let's just hang out yeah just hang out together this is the best what do you guys think if you guys can hear us and see us um let us know in the chat give us a thumbs up yeah let us know that you can hear us and then we will start to answer your questions we see a bunch of questions that have already been coming in both the youtube and the discord chat which is why we do these all right i see at least one thumbs up there we go hello everyone awesome hello excellent all right so i don't know what do you think ryan i've already seen a set of questions i feel like we could um answer one that i've seen a bunch i've seen it here asked and i've seen it more than once do you need any knowledge to build this please let me know so you know the way and this actually ties into another question that i saw from somebody just a little bit earlier um we actually have a couple parts to what we're going to do today so the part today we're actually going to give you essentially the built netflix clone right it's going to be a netflix one and it's already built we're going to focus on some of the graphql aspects the the api and how you actually use things like graphql in javascript to talk to the backend database and do things and then focus on some of the jam stack portion of publishing and pushing um the netflix clone to production and being able to do this globally with you know all free and everything like that right from javascript right so we're going to focus on that piece now if you follow that you don't actually need to have any prior knowledge to do this if you follow the steps that we have in the repository you can actually go through everything right so this is going to be a lot from an awareness standpoint now the question i saw earlier was are we going to build this from scratch no however however there's a different part to this we will give you these resources by the way when we go through the session but in the repository at the very very bottom um there is a link to one of our friends anja cabal who uh is a uh youtube uh influencer i guess she's she's real heavy into the in the coding world creates all sorts of wonderful like getting started like how do you how do you build this kind of videos and we partnered with her in this and so she actually if you want to build the thing from the scratch from the ground up then we suggest you take a look at the anya video and then what we're going to do here is we're going to take that you know once you've once you've done that part i mean we're going to already provide the completed app but once you've done that then we're going to use that to kind of hook everything up and push it into production so if you do want that if you want that experience we really suggest you take a look at the ania kabab video that we've provided in the materials but to go back to the initial question if i'm coming at this new will i be able to follow it i think so um again if you follow the instructions and go through the stuff in the repo you should be able to do all the things that we talk about let's see um yes this is recorded so once the session is complete today then that the the link you're using right now to watch um will be available indefinitely so you can go back and watch at your leisure at any time i've seen a ton of can we get a certificate so for the workshop itself we don't offer a certificate just for coming today however we have badges we're going to talk about the badges and we actually as part of this the series that we're doing um this this last month actually you could even get a golden badge um to get a badge though you need to do the homework so we do have homework for you again we'll explain all that in the repo all right ryan what are you seeing i just we get this question a lot and i've seen it a couple times already um are there any prerequisites now we we walk through everything that that you need to set up um during the workshop however uh if you want to get started on some of those things that is uh that is great we can post the um the link to the repo that we're going to be using and all of the instructions are in there some of the prerequisites like they're not really prerequisites but some of the things that we'll be doing is setting up um different accounts for different free services such as astrodb netlify um github if you don't have a github uh so those are some of the the accounts that will be needed to complete everything uh they are free uh the main one that i'd say is would probably be the most useful is uh astrodb if you want to get that account spun up uh there are instructions in the repo for what the database name and key space will need to be because it will prompt you when you sign up for astra it'll prompt you uh for to create a database right away uh so that would be the only thing that i would say again we're gonna go through all of that during the workshop we'll walk through anyone who does not already have a a astra account um on how to do that uh but if you want to kind of get a jumpstart on it that would be my suggestion that's right and i see i see a couple questions are we gonna use any back-end applications this is actually something totally cool um about something that we're doing today with what what i mentioned earlier briefly just jam stack and nullify um so traditionally when we're talking back in right especially if you have like a javascript your client is in some kind of javascript usually html javascript css and that kind of deal um you use that to you know to form what the user is going to interact with and then traditionally you'll have some type of backend whether it's in java or c sharp or something that you talk to that handles the interaction with the database and all that jam stack changes that a little bit um and we're going to talk today about serverless functions so we are going to use serverless functions today the cool thing about it is you know for those of you familiar with servers functions you might be familiar with something like aws lambda or whatever and say okay well then there's my back end but with jam stack you can actually implement your serverless functions in javascript or typescript right there technically in your front end code when you deploy it they'll be deployed as serverless functions which then act as your back end um so we're gonna actually have the whole the whole end to end piece in this today all in javascript yeah and that's a question to preet which language will we be using javascript yep pretty much javascript um what kind of database are we going to be using for this clone we'll be using a nosql database we're using astrodb which is built on apache cassandra which is a very powerful distributed database [Music] i will be using the uh graphql api as well in in using astrodb so we'll be going over a lot of of how to use graphql and how to um manipulate data entering data creating tables all that kind of stuff we'll be going over that that's right and harsh can we follow along if you wish absolutely right um and i'm glad you asked that question so we do build our workshops to be self-service so if you want to just watch right we kind of we kind of usually have the recommendation that if you're absolutely brand brand new to stuff maybe you've never coded or worked with any of this kind of thing before it might be good to watch and then go back and it's this is all what we're gonna do the repo the work we're gonna go through is actually part of the homework anyway um so if you're gonna be if you're gonna do the homework you're gonna you're gonna go through it but if you want to follow along follow along we do try to pace the content in such a way that everybody can kind of keep with us right so so feel free to do that um can you use vs code funny enough uh gitpod the cloud-based id that we're going to use in fact uses vs code if you want to use your own vs code locally you can one caveat i want to put with that um we do in the repo put the um hey saham please don't spam your questions we will try to get to all of them okay um so just just ask once we'll we'll totally try to get to it um but if you want to use your own local ide you can but you will have a couple prerequisites essentially having things like npm and node installed we do recommend though that if you're kind of new to this use the gitpod ide that we're going to give you it's all in the cloud so if you do if you follow the instructions that we have in the repo um then you should be able to you just need a browser right if you're going to do it on your own locally you do have a couple of requirements for your you know to have the right version of node npm installed we'd have that in the um and the faq the faq section of the repo and we'll we'll talk to those yeah oh hi there black deuterium and yeah yeah do triumph do you trim black dutrimo hello i can say hi hello did i say that i wanted to say deuterium but it's not i don't think it's deteriorating i think there's a knee missing uh there yeah exactly vimal asks uh are we using react so the the app itself is built using react uh we won't be doing uh much front end stuff in this workshop we do have the in the repo there is a link to some react basics if you're interested in learning more about react we have a separate kind of repo for going over the very basics of react um so check that out in the repo um why get pod over firebase those are different things getpod is our cloud-based ide firebase is a database we're using astrodb for our database how to create a security token we will walk you through how to create a security token if you're trying to work ahead um the instructions are in the repo um but you're going to create a token uh through the organization settings in astrodb so um and i think one more and then we'll get started um i see from harsh uh vardan do we need any membership or pay something for the deployment part no um you will need an account at nutify and you will need an account in astra and such but all of them are free everything we're going to do here today are all in the free tiers of all the services we're going to use um so the most you do is you you'll sign up for one of the you know like for the various services but yeah there's nothing that's going to charge you ascent yep and we're using react.js not react native this is a web app today so all right yeah it is about that time so i'm going to play a real quick video to get us in and then we'll start the workshop so we'll see you in just a bit [Music] on the same page [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] five [Music] hello everyone welcome uh oh i think uh i lost david hold on oh what'd you do to me ryan well there we are all right i see how it goes yeah i see what's going on i tried it i tried to get rid of it through the video tried to leave them in the dust all right hello everyone welcome to uh week three of our app dev learning series our summer series uh we are finishing up this uh this series with our final app we're going to be doing uh a netflix clone building your own netflix clone that is uh this week um we have previously done for those of you who are joining us uh in the last week we have previously done a very basic getting getting started with react building a to-do app and then uh last week we did a tick tock clone where we went over using the document api and the document oriented data structure this week we'll be doing netflix and we'll be using a graphql api we'll be going over in detail on how to use graphql to create tables insert data all that kind of stuff i am ryan welford i am a developer advocate here at data stacks and i'm joined by david gillardy hello david hello hello hello uh but we are not the only ones who are with you today uh we have a whole team of people um that are in the chat they're ready to answer your questions um so say hello to them as they pop in and out um but yes we are supported by a really awesome team here uh at data sex so just want to do a really quick recap i guess i kind of did this already previously in this series we built our first app with javascript and node.js creating a to-do app very basic to do app but got up and running with our create react app starting point and then last week we built a tick tock clone and we focused on document db or document api uh and getting that up and running it was a lot of fun and for those of you who are coming back uh for week three uh going for that golden badge uh welcome back so uh we'll do a little bit of housekeeping here um this is kind of our agenda for today i'll start with some housekeeping we'll do some astrodb reminders for those of you who are returning and for those of you who are new we'll be going over how to set up our database account um and then we'll be working with graphql creating tables creating our schema uh adding data and all that kind of stuff then we're going to take our netflix app and we're going we're going to deploy it to netlify which is our global cdn hosting service that we're going to be using it also allows us to use serverless functions it's really cool and at the very end we're going to do the swag quiz which is a quiz kind of a game that is your opportunity to win some prizes and then we'll go over some resources and we will also be doing a q a session uh after the whole workshop uh after the two hours uh so if you have any uh more questions we'll stick around and we'll answer some of those live for you uh so youtube and twitch is where we are streaming we monitor the chat on youtube um for questions we don't really monitor the chat on twitch so if you're watching on twitch why don't you come over to youtube ask some questions um or you can join our discord and our discord is now 14 000 uh users strong members strong um it is a great place uh to ask continuing questions um and get uh just get involved with the with the community that we have based around uh cassandra and it's it's a really cool place so if you want to join that that's kind of where you can ask questions outside of the youtube uh streaming uh workshops because you know those will go away after the workshop is done so uh that's a really good place so uh for games you know i mentioned that we're going to do a game at the end we're also getting going to do a few questions yeah uh it's always exciting uh we're going to do a few questions here i'll you know throw ryan off by just you know shouting things out really into the mic at least this one was relevant to what i was talking about [Laughter] uh no we're going to be using mendy.com for our um for our games it's kind of a quiz website it's uh really easy to use you just go to the mentee.com you enter a code and uh and you'll start playing the game uh so that's what we'll be using we'll be doing that here shortly just for some intro questions um some of the things that we'll we'll be using there is nothing to install i've seen a lot of questions of like what are the prerequisites what is the software that we have to install nothing is required to install we're going to do everything in the cloud uh we have our github repo which i'll link in the chat uh this is the repo that we'll be working out of all of the instructions all the things that we're going to be doing today are uh in that repo so if you if you fall behind uh trying to you know if your connection like craps out and you are not like watching the latest and greatest of the stream follow the repo it will get you through the the whole thing so if you have any questions check the repo first and make sure that you know it's not answered right there and then obviously you can ask in the chat as well but yeah github is is where our repo is stored git pod is our clock cloud-based ide that integrates with github it allows you to load up that whole repo in a cloud-based instance and edit the code right there it's really really useful it's based on vs code so if you're familiar with vs code you'll feel right at home if you want to work locally with your own ide you are welcome to do so we uh we have designed this workshop around using something like git pod so our ability to troubleshoot may be limited if you are working locally but we will certainly do our best to help um astrodb is the database that we will be using uh it is built on apache cassandra which is a nosql distributed database it's very powerful we'll be using uh the graphql api that is provided by astra db to to use graphql in manipulating our data and finally we'll be using netlify to deploy and host our our netflix clone this is a really good really cool global cdn that allows us to host our our site and use serverless functions so that we do not have to maintain any back-end infrastructure which is awesome all right we are in our last week of our series um for those of you who are new how does this series work uh you know we have um uh these three weeks that we've done that i've kind of gone over already um if you attend uh one of the two interactive live stream workshops uh each week which is wednesday or thursday we do the same workshop wednesdays and thursdays and if you do your homework during the week which we will uh talk about later um we do home we provide homework every week to kind of further your learning um you and you get your badges so if you do your homework you get a badge so we have the to do app badge that we've given out already the tick tock badge uh that we've given out and then this week will be the netflix badge and if you're new don't fret we are still giving out those badges if you're doing the homework uh if you want to go back and do them real quick you can get your swag if you complete everything if you do all three weeks and do the homework you can get some swag and you can also get the golden badge for doing all uh three sessions and then there's also a surprise um for if you complete all those things and we'll talk about that in just a bit but first let's go to mentee.com and we'll do a very short uh quiz little some questions just to get to know you and uh see where you're at it's mostly to see if you are a returning viewer from the previous week while we're doing mentee real quick just a couple things um pre asks is this pre-recorded hey pre no it's live it's not pre-recorded at all does that answer your question and and i actually saw a bunch of questions coming through about do you need a netflix subscription to do this no no we are just building a netflix clone that is not going to be linked in any kind of like netflix account or anything like that so no you don't need a subscription to that yeah all right so go to menti.com enter the code that you see on the screen i've also posted in the chat uh and we'll get uh we'll get this very short quiz it won't take very long at all um but if you want to press the thumbs up when you get in uh we can you can see how many people are in here have all the little thumbs kind of floating away from my head up here yep i actually should say from up here let's see if i got that right yeah there we go hard to do when you're inside of a window right now there we go awesome yes lots of people entering in i'll give it up just a few minutes i want to make sure we get um a good amount of people and then uh we'll get started it's just going to be a couple of uh a couple of questions rahul i don't see a quiz over here uh go to mendy.com and enter the code that you see at the top i'll also bring up that other screen that has it a little bit bigger and you can use your phone you can open a new tab uh lokesh i'm new to react can i continue absolutely yes we will we won't be going over uh react specific things in this workshop um if you want to learn more uh you can watch the recorded version of our to do our week one series or week one session uh and we go over a little bit more about react basics um in portuguese mentee means lied wow that's good to know hey we didn't name it all right awesome i think we have uh a good amount of people in feel free to enter uh to jump in um uh whenever you want these are these are not for the prizes so don't worry about don't worry about that so just a couple very couple quick questions here yeah were you here last week for the tick tock app workshop we just want to know how many of you are returning and how many of you are new looks like most people are new oh wow yeah wow look at all those new folks well hello yes and and for those who are joining us from yester last week awesome to see you again you should recognize some of the things we're doing but we're going to do a little bit differently as well yeah yeah especially the the deployed netify stuff we did uh it'll be very very similar to last week actually it'll be pretty much the same as far as deployment goes uh all right thank you uh did you do for those of you who are returning did you do the week one or week two homework oh yeah this is the real question right here yeah this is where i get my shane bell out do i need to get shane belt yeah jim bell okay so to be fair a lot so many probably answering no because they weren't even here that's fine okay exactly but for the what i see what 37 people have said 39 people have said yes right yeah i think that's probably you're doing the homework the majority of people that were here last week or previous weeks uh have probably did the homework it looks like so i can tell you from the amount of homeworks we've graded we know that a lot of people have done those homeworks matter of fact oh did we cross the thousand badge mark yeah we did yeah we did that's right we had a thousand and one that's right so we crossed the thousandth badge mark and by the way i've seen the question a bunch right and people asking do you get a certificate for this workshop or whatever we don't give a certificate for coming to the workshop but we do have the badges that um ryan will show you here in a second and those those badges are if you complete the homework right and that's a way to show that you've come you've actually done the material and everything so you get credit for that but i don't want to say anymore because ryan's going to say more about all of that yeah definitely cool thank you very much for answering those questions we just wanted to kind of get an idea of how many people are new and make sure that we um don't assume too much but we're glad to see some re some some some repeats what am i trying to say return return viewers yes whatever my brain is blinking out that's fine however you want to say it right all right thank you for answering those questions um i'm going to stop this music all right so we have a little surprise right i mentioned there was a surprise if you attend all of the um sessions and do all the homework now for those of you who have not attended the live versions of the previous weeks you can still go back and watch them and do the homework and still be eligible for this uh for this special prize right we're giving away three 500 amazon gift cards and uh what you have to do is go through exactly what i said before you watch the the sessions you do the homework uh you get the badges you get the golden badge and then you fill out this form and uh let's see david's head is in the wake so let me turn off david's head oh sorry sorry about that i know my big head uh so we'll get the uh we'll get this link in the in the chat as well i don't have that uh typed out so maybe one of our moderators can get that in there for me uh the dtsx.io summer series game is where you can fill out the form um and show that you have completed all of the steps and you can get several entries into the uh raffle or whatever we're calling it um but yes we are giving away three 500 500 amazon gift cards um kind of as a a prize for attending and doing all the all the homework and um it would be awesome so entries are to be submitted by august 1st which is coming up pretty quick but if you have not watched or done the homework of the previous sessions you still have time so make sure that you uh if you're interested in in getting some of these prizes that you do that before august 1st and i think we'll be announcing it on uh august 18th i think it's a plan um and yes we'll be announcing the winners live on august 18th all right so with that i want to make sure there's a ketar 500 that's half of my gaming pc budget uh graphics cards are further that's expensive to get one right that's incentive to do it all right with that i'm going to hand it over to david and we'll get into our content so we have a mission for you do it yeah let's do our mission what's our mission what's the mission ryan your mission is to deploy a netflix clone to production over a global cdn using a nosql database with paging and infinite scrolling and you have about an hour and 45 minutes now because we spent 17 minutes blabbing so good good luck yep we'll come back in about an hour and 45 and yeah we'll see how see where you are at and uh and that's your homework so we'll grade it and you'll we'll see how it goes no obviously not uh we're not gonna leave you hanging like that for those of you who have been uh in our previous sessions we do that joke a lot uh you probably surprised yeah that's true it's okay no we'll walk you through it um it'll be pretty cool it'll be fun and uh yeah all right it's all you david or do you want me to go through these all right so no that's fine i can see it on the screen there all right so now building it up and i've seen some of you or are just like chomping at the bit like let's let's get into the thing let's actually start building stuff so let's pay attention for a moment here um so from the app you know we kind of talked about this in some of the questions this is a react app right built on node.js using javascript this netflix clone um and just to kind of like build up kind of the basic web app structure right as you see there on the slide at the the very bottom where the user interfaces um where you know the client is gonna react with it right the part that you go to and the website but then displays the videos and does all that right that's where react is gonna be now something i actually wanna point out and i'm gonna show this to you when we come off the slides and go to my screen we're going to get into the repo if you're not familiar with react if you've not done anything with like you know you're not familiar with direct components and how to work with them you'll be fine today but if you want to know more about how to do that and if you want to get some experience there we actually have some resources that i'll show you right off the beginning uh it's another repo that will bring you through a whole starter app and you can actually build a react app from scratch um so for those who are not familiar i really suggest taking a look at that but so react is going to power our user interface um and then you see the graphql piece so it's part of with with datastax astra right yes it's built on apache cassandra but astra um has a whole set of apis rest graphql document api so on and so forth today we're going to focus on graphql right so graphql is a language um it's native to javascript for one so it's really nice for front end full stack developers because you can just code right in javascript and you don't have to worry about um bringing in any other drivers or anything like that and graphql actually allows you to connect to multiple data sources um right there in the in that one language which is really powerful especially if you have a case maybe maybe you have operational data going in one place maybe of analytics data going to another or something like that or maybe you just have multiple disparate data sources that you want to bring in data together you can do that with graphql now are we doing that part of it today no we're going to use graphql with a single database um but there's a lot of power that's under there so you've got the user interface the part that the users are going to interact with then you have the api that's responsible for how you're going to talk to the database we're doing that with graphql today and then underneath the hood you actually have your your database right and that's where astrodb comes into play okay we can move on from that all right so the first thing we're going to do then um is we're going to get your astra db accounts going right so let's go ahead and drop um drop the link let me go ahead and get that for everybody this is going to be unless ryan beats me today i got it all right oh he's got spam spam spam there we go oh i didn't mean the ass really directly i went to the reaper sorry i can do it can i beat you this time there we go here we go okay see see the link that is coming that is being spammed by data sex developers right now that is the repo and if you could switch over to my screen ryan yes and then that way we can get everybody on the same page there all right hopefully everybody is seeing the repo so this is where you want to be right you want to be here in the repo now this is for those of you who are going to follow along um that question did come up a bunch before yeah you can follow along we will try to paste things so you can but you can also just watch at like i said before these workshops are built to be self-service so you can come and do them on your own that's kind of how their homework works anyway totally up to you so a first couple things thank you oh thank you for spamming the links everybody okay so first couple things i want to point out um you know i did we've seen a bunch of questions for folks asking hey can i do this in my local vs code ryan did talk about that we recommend that you go ahead and do this in the gitpod id will provide because we're handling all the prerequisites for you i just want to point out though that if you are going to do it locally that we do have some pre-reqs here notice node 15 and npm 7 or later if you don't have those if you click on that link that'll bring you to some resources to get to them um everything is free like we said there's nothing here that you're going to be charged for and all that deal um one thing i do really want to point out a couple things actually one the homework so for those of you who are curious hey how do i get the homework what's the instructions for the homework for the badge right here you go to the homework section you follow the steps and everything you need is there when you're done you submit the homework with this link it'll submit it issued directly to the github repository for us um as we go through you know after the table of contents we're going to go through this this part and get astro going this is what i want to point out for those of you brand new to react if you want a refresher go to the react starter not right now this is for later right um this will have you bring build up a m react app from scratch using mpx one of our previous workshops the to do app that was actually week one of this builds on that right so if you really want to get into like react ui components and all that kind of deal um do that okay can we zoom in a bit on the repo there we go how about that is that better yeah i think that's pretty good all right let's let us know if it's big enough for you guys yeah let us know if it's not big enough i'll zoom in more just let me know okay so first thing we want to do is go to step one this login or register to astrodb and create database notice this big orange create astrodb button now markdown doesn't allow us to put a target blank so if you just click on this it's going to use the same browser tab so i suggest you either middle click or right click and say open link in new tab and that will bring you to your astra interface now the first time if you've if you've never registered or anything like that you can use your uh github account you could use a google account you can just fill in the details that only take a moment again it's free if you've never created a database or anything like that you're probably going to come to a screen that looks like this a bit more okay yep i'll zoom in as much as i can now when you get to the screen this create a database piece right notice here we filled out for you database name and key space we ask that you use these values because for the rest of the exercises we're going to be referencing these values so please use these so the database name you want here is netflix workshopdb so i'll just put that in the database name or i'll hit the wrong commands and there we go for the key space by the way the key space all it is is a container of your tables if you're coming from the relational world this is like a database or a schema right um so the key space is just going to contain your tables that's all so we're asking here that for database name use netflixworkshopdb and for key space name use this netflix underscore key space now for the rest of this the select provider and region this section down here um all of this information you can choose any of these providers it is totally up to you you do not need an account in any of them or anything like that astra handles all of this right this is just flexibility so you can pick any of them i'll pick azure today um pick a region close to you i'm in north america i'm on the east coast so i'm gonna pick something close to me that's all you need to do once you've chosen a provider in a region you'll see create database lights up go ahead and click create database thanks all in one yeah thank you for coming today yeah nian this is this is totally possible for beginners um as again like i said before if you follow the instructions through you you should be fine and if you are a totally beginner to um to react and such those are those resources i was talking about okay so vamal i see how to find the crate astrodb option please let me know so in the repo that we dropped maybe we could drop those links again yep um then you'll see this right in the very first part of part one this number one create ask for to be just click that button and by the way you'll notice that in the repos we have these little show me's right so they'll actually give you like a little animated gif kind of showing you what to look for okay so now once you've created the database notice it might be impending or initializing that's totally cool if you get here give me a thumbs up let me know you're here with a thumbs up that you've gotten to the point where you have the database and pending or initializing it could be active already you are spinning up a full-fledged apache cassandra um you know cluster here uh so it does take just a couple minutes and that's fine um but once you get to that point let me know um so real quick i would like to there are a few people have asked about the cost of astro astrodb um it is free uh the the plan is called pay as you go uh because after you reach the limit of the 25 a month credit um you have the option of continuing on by by paying for for what you use however there the free tier is you will get 25 of credit every single month um for free and you don't need to enter a credit card at all to get started um and even if you reach that 25 it will prompt you but you don't have to enter it you just wait for the next month if you want to i have never reached uh my twenty five dollar limit uh and i don't have a special neither buy and i usually have a ton of databases i mean it's 40 gigs it's yeah storage millions of reads and writes you for all the stuff we're doing here and even for like you know prototype apps even small production apps you'll never go past the the free tier okay so it looks like i saw a ton of thumbs up coming in wonderful so once you've gotten to that point the next thing we want to do is go to this create a security token now i'm going to show you how to do this right um you can also follow the instructions there's also this show me that'll kind of show you what to do if you want to go about it like that as well okay wonderful thank you vivan all right so now regardless by the way of what status your database is in it doesn't need to be active it could be pending or initializing what we want to do is we want to come up here to the top left hand corner of the aster ui where it says your organization and click on that go to organization settings in there you're looking for token management what are we doing by the way here why are we going to this this token we need to create a security token and i should just explain that for a second so if you think about it anytime you connect to a database or anything you know you're probably used to having to supply like a username and password or whatever that's one way to do it it's not as secure really as using things like a security token and such but when you are creating a database like this up in the cloud in order for you to be able to access it you need to have it needs to be publicly accessible right you'll find out that any of the cloud providers do this if you go to aws or gcp or whatever they will all have this kind of authentication method so this is the way we authenticate against the database we need to create a token right so what we want to do here is once you're in the token management section for for today just use database administrator and say generate token now this screen that you see here is only ever going to be shown one time that's for security so i highly suggest you download the token details right when you do that you'll you'll want to download that as a csv you're going to reference this later in particular this token right this one with the astra cs this is the one when we ask you for the token later which you're going to use you want this one you don't want the client id and client secret but you should download them so go ahead and download those hit the download button i'll give you a moment to do that um i'm gonna i just want to show something to clarify a few things there are still some that is it is it diego's question yeah diego's question on yeah the stopper asks for payment so here is the creating the astra account and you'll see you know i would put in you know my database my database name whatever whatever when you select your provider it has these prices right this if you look up here it says free tier up to 25 a month right we're going to give you 25 in credit every month this is just showing what that provider usually charges because it's not free for us you know we are paying this uh but after the 25 this is what it would cost to run so that's just what these prices mean it's not asking you to pay you can just create the database you're not giving them the credit card at all this is you get the free tier up to 25 a month and that's refreshed every single month so that if there's confusion on that i just wanted to clarify um that when you see prices don't freak out that is just what it is costing us to provide this that's right it's more of what it's costing us yeah and and if you were to eventually go past the free tier and if you decided that you wanted to to do more with it then that's part of the cost that gets rolled into to what you see but yeah that's that's essentially what it's costing us okay so if you've gotten to a point because this is important where you've gotten your token details give us a thumbs up let us know you've gotten here that you've created your token because this part is important because we're going to need this for the rest of the stuff that we do by the way while we're waiting for that i saw a question there from cs gaming can i do this on android funny you asked that um we're working on some native mobile content right now we don't have it just yet but we are working on that can you do this yeah you could totally do this on android um but you're gonna use something like react native or flutter or whatever that's a whole different subject um so definitely um definitely something to keep an eye on let's see okay cool i think diego's good now diego let us know if you're good on that i i think you got caught up there i want to make sure yeah because you shouldn't have to pay a thing the role is database administrator um oh and if and if you mean can you go through the workshop and android that's a great question i'd be i don't know i've never tried yeah all right i see lots of thumbs up and everything all right excellent excellent thank you everybody so let's go ahead and move on now to step three which is create table genre with graphql so now we're going to start to use the graphql api why because with graphql right i do need to create my tables i need a schema right i need to start to create the structure that i'm going to put the data in for our application so with that if we come back over to astra just click back in the top left hand corner here this will bring you back to the dashboard that we were in earlier there we go now once we're here and by the way all the instructions i'm going through are in the readme they're all there right i'm essentially just walking through them but however you do it it's fine so what are two ways you can do this remember we created the netflix workshop db you can either click on it here in the ui or it'll be on the left hand side under databases i have so many of them that you know i've got to go to i got to open it up but if you just click on that you go to the detail view in particular i want to go to the connect tab up here at the top so click on the database and just go to connect yeah pro pro gamer it's okay if you're lagging um the uh you'll catch up in the video no big deal once you go to the connect tab you want to go to graphql api and then from there you're going to see this spot that says launch graphql playground this link this link is specific to you right again you want to middle click or right click say open link in new tab and you want to go to your playground this is specific to you in your database now the first thing you might mention or might notice is that it says it's got this error why because we can't authenticate yet this is where that token comes into play okay so at the very bottom of the playground you should see this query variables http headers in the section with populate me now be sure when you go to put your token in there i'm going to show you this here okay i'm going to grab that token remember the one that has aster cs so this is what i had asked you to download that csv right so you want to take your the token which is the third value that asked for cs1 and you want to populate that right here notice though i still have my quotes put it in the quotes notice i did not replace all of this right just where it says populate me and then when i do that i'm no longer getting the error because it's now able to authenticate oh no worries pro pro gamer if you missed where the playground is i'll do it again so if you go back to your if you're in your astr ui dashboard either on the left hand side or in the view here just choose the database in this case it's going to be netflix netflix workshopdb and then the connect tab from the connect tab go to graphql and right there you'll see this graphql playground just click on that that'll launch your playground and if you missed it you want to first go down to the very bottom where it says query variables http headers it'll say i've already filled mine out but it'll say populate me just replace that with your aster token that is the one that starts with astro cs and then you should look like this now the first thing we want to do once we get into our playground is like i said we need to create some schema we need to create some tables to put our data in for application to talk to so notice here this mutation so in graphql when you want to um when you want to write something you're going to do what's called a mutation so i'm literally going to take i have a copy widget here you should have in the markdown or you can just copy this but you're literally going to take on it step 3c you're going to take this mutation notice what it's doing it's saying create table it's saying netflix key space remember we created that key space earlier key space is just a container of our tables in this case this table name is going to be reference list so these are going to be the uh let's see what these are in a second the genres and stuff we're going to use so we're creating our table i'm going to hit the play button right there what i want to see is where it says reference list true it's saying hey i created your table you're good to go connect button is there it's not active if everything is coming red when you copy the mutation um if you're talking about like here let's see if i invalidate something um or i wonder if it is a case where you're not authenticated properly if you're seeing an error if you see a server error that's over on here like what is it a 404 i believe or something that probably means you have not properly filled out your astra token make sure you have the quotes make sure those are there and that you have the whole thing that big long token with astro cs and everything yep uh would you be able to zoom in um is that a little better maybe maybe one more yeah okay um there was a question i'm not able to open the token file so it downloads some browsers downloaded as a just a file without a without an extension you can change that to csv or txt and just open it in a normal text editor and you should it should be just fine yeah it can open with notepad or textedit or yeah whatever awesome thank you them all good yeah push when you say i'm not able to take token um are you saying you're not able to copy the token in here um i i would say just what ryan was talking about um a moment ago just to you know for some reason when you downloaded the file just open it with a notepad or wordpad or some kind of text editor so you can copy it out okay all right all right so again you should take this first command this mutation that creates the table reference list that's the one we're creating and then when you execute it you should see this true now scrolling down a little bit now we have a table now we need to put some data in the table so what we want to do here is notice when we created the table we have this graphql schema tab that's for our schema right that's where we're going to create the actual object but when we want to put data in it we need to change over to the graphql tab notice this other tab now here's something to note when you go to the other tab you still need to put in your token right so one way you could do it if you want you could just copy it from here or you could just copy it from your file however so i'm gonna copy it from my file i'm gonna copy over populate me and put the token in place just like i did before now something different here notice that i still have this server cannot be reached here's why right i need to change the end point to point to our key space and it's right here in the instructions so if you take a look at the instructions step 4a it'll tell you right now not only to change the graphql tab but to change the url then from system to your netflix key space so when i copy this i'm going to put that right there at the end right now i'm pointed to my netflix key space i have my token and look it's no longer giving me the error all right so the next thing i'm going to do at step 4c now notice this mutation now i'm going to insert i'm going to insert a bunch of data i want to insert a bunch of genres right because i have some movies i want to insert a bunch of genres notice too that this the way it's the syntax insert in the reference list reference list is the table we just created a moment ago right so i'm going to insert all these in the reference list and i should see something like this yeah no problem so in order to now go from the schema where i created my table to the graphql to insert data i'm going to switch over to the graphql tab i'm going to populate my aster token just like we did before so i can properly authenticate against the database right and then right here notice this endpoint you have this endpoint that again is specific to you it starts with system it's going to start by saying system you want to replace that with netflix key space because that is the key space that we're talking to that's where we want to insert this data and then i'm just going to take the code that you see here i'm going to copy it either with the widget or i can just copy the whole thing and paste that in to my query section hit the play button and you should see something like this okay we have a uh an error um mutation is undefined at create table um make sure you are in the correct tab for creating table you should be in the graphql schema tab yeah for create table you should yeah this one here just like ryan said graphql schema and what kind of language are you using for that code we're using the graphql yeah language yeah this is crap okay ann yeah i saw that yeah and one more time i do see some folks um some folks here getting tripped up on and i i totally get in this spot right here um so once you put in your token again we're at the graphql schema you'll notice at the very end if i just go ahead and do it your initial endpoint look like this right but what you want to do and it's in step 4a you want to grab and replace system with the key space where you're using which is netflix key space then in step four c here is the action mutations you just copy this over paste this in place again in the graphql tab the whole thing and then hit play and you should see something looks like the right hand side okay then finally right we want to retrieve so we just inserted stuff we created a table we inserted a bunch of genres right because this is gonna you'll see how this will support our app soon but now we wanna we wanna make sure it worked so we want to go ahead and query for those so notice this time in this query i'm not doing a mutation now i'm not writing data i wanna get some data so i'm gonna get all the genres from the reference lift reference list table right now i'm going to spit out what the genre is right so i'll copy this again i'm in my graphql tab i didn't quite we're getting some requests for more zoom more zoom huh it's big man i'll try it i'm running out of real estate for zooming i know but it's always more than you think yeah right all right so um so here i'm just pasting in again the query from 5a i'll hit play and boom so this is good if you get to this point give me a thumbs up if you've gotten here because at this point you know that you have your genres right you've got your genres in place all right wark says that they're getting multiple errors token is entered correctly um if you want to uh give us like some of the specific errors that you're seeing we can maybe help better and if if you want to head over to the discord and we can even post screenshots and we can help you um more specifically i'll post a link to the discord um yeah we'd love to yeah look at that one yeah okay so we'll yeah go to the discord that's definitely the place to do it um especially for those who are thankfully putting in screenshots and such um we see you work and we'll have the team kind of help you out there okay wonderful so i did i see a bunch of thumbs up and don't forget to you can always pause the video you can go back in the video um if if you're getting maybe too far behind or whatever that could be frustrating just watch for now right this is part of the homework you can always go back and do this later all right i see a lot of thumbs up still coming in so i'll give people a moment to do that and desmond can we get a documentation of all the steps yes that is what the repo is all the things that we're doing is described in the repo so i'll put post three points yeah if if for some reason you don't have the repository we're not expecting that you're just gonna be able to memorize everything i'm doing here yeah it's all in the repo um maybe we should drop that oh thank you yep don't beat me to it okay all righty excellent okay wonderful all right let's go ahead and move on so now that means that we have our references table we've inserted and mutated a bunch of genres that's what you see here action anime so on and so forth and now we've read them back out using graphql right so we've been able to kind of actually do a set of cred commands all right so the next thing we want to do is move to step six okay so we're going to create the movies table so we started with the genre reference but now we need a table for our movies so we want to go back to our graphql schema tab so notice anytime i want to create the table i'm going to go to the graphql schema tab but when i want to add data and stuff i'll go to graphql so i'm going to go graphql schema just like you see up here and then i'm going to copy this mutation again notice the crate table again our key space netflix key space or table movies by genre right and this is we're going to set up the table and you notice we have fields like things like genre the title the year of the movie so on and so forth i'm gonna go ahead and just paste that over what was there and then once it's ready i'll hit my play button and the same thing notice that it says movies by genre right true it means okay i created the table that was successful right yeah venet if you're seeing a server cannot be reached it tells me your endpoint is probably incorrect um or that the token is incorrect so you just have to ensure um that again that the token is good um or if you're in the graphql tab that your um that the endpoint is actually correct it's the netflix underscores key space now if for some reason earlier when you created the database in the key space if you use different values from the ones that we provided so if i go back real quick in the instructions i'll scroll up to the top if you remember here if you use something different from these you will also have to reflect that in your endpoint right because we're telling the endpoint we're going to the netflix key space that we created earlier but if you created something else you'll need to use whatever that was um or it's not going to know what you're talking about so i wonder if that's some of the ones we're seeing okay so hopefully you have your movies by genre table and now we're going to go through kind of a similar format right where okay we've got the table and now we're going to insert some movies so notice i'm doing a mutation i want to write some data in the database so i'm going to mutate the data i'm going to insert movies and i want to insert into movies by genre and notice the values here genre year title synopsis those match our table right we created a table with those very fields so we're just saying i want to put some data into the table using the fields that i created earlier and all of this matches you know um you know if you notice the genre is going to match something out of our you know the genre table that we created um you know the title is just the title the movie synopsis is the description of it so on and so forth so again since i am inserting some data into the table i want to go back over to my graphql tab and i'm going to replace what i have there and paste this in and again hit play ryan brian did you have something i heard or oh uh so there was a question i just wanted i i typed it out but i'll address it um okay as well low cash asks um or it says that they're not getting anything in graphql window in values after step five a um so when we move on to step six we are actually moving to the to the graphql schema tab so you have to make sure that you're in the correct tab doing the each um each command so i think david you you specified this but graphql schema is for our um you know creating tables our ddl right we're defining our schema we're creating tables we're um you know getting the everything laid out and then the graphql tab the the second tab there is for our dml our data manipulation um processes we're inserting data we are querying data you know updating things so that is what the difference between the two tabs and you need to make sure that you that you are in the correct tab uh to do each thing that's right and now him it uh so schema is to create and graphqls to enter yeah pretty much now the graphql isn't just to enter data you also read data there you update data there right but it's anything working with the data is in the graphql tab when you're creating tables and stuff your schema yes that's in the schema tab correct yes and you're correct yeah that's the idea okay so last thing then right uh step eight here if you then inserted the movies let's go ahead and retrieve those back out right now notice again we're not doing a mutation this time we're doing a query we want to query the data that we just previously mutated into the table again it's our movies by genre table right and we'll take a look so i'm going to replace everything that's here i'm going to paste it in hit play and if all is good right i should actually now be seeing a set of movies that are from my sci-fi genre so notice what we did there right so when i said my query i want to get movies by genre and i'm giving i'm telling it this value genre is sci-fi we put in multiple genres but we just want to see the sci-fi ones um we have some ordering in here we're ordering by the year and then here are the values that i want to display and that's what we see displayed here on the right hand side so if you've gotten to this point give us a thumbs up let us know that you're here yeah and you actually answered a question i was going to bring up hey there asks during insertion in the table inception comes first but while running query prometheus comes first why uh because we are ordering by the year descending so prometheus is the most recent movie and with the year of 2012 so it's going to be at the top um an interesting thing we actually didn't have to put the order by command because uh this is a little peek into how cassandra works we are we have the clustering columns um with year as one of our clustering columns ordered by descending and so it's actually stored that way uh on disk so it will be retrieved that way even if we did not specify the order by um just a little tidbit if you want to learn more about cassandra and why it does that we have another workshop called introduction to cassandra that goes into all that kind of stuff but it's really cool but yes the order by year is why it's coming out uh in a different order than we entered it that's right and just a couple quick questions to answer gunny can we directly paste step 8 and get to the point where you guys are in no you do have to do all the previous steps because if you just go to step 8 and you try to get but you didn't actually create the table or you didn't insert the data you're not going to you're not going to be able to move forward um and you know um uh dhruv or devroove uh says you know following the steps i'm i'm with you and everything is working so far but i'm not really understand you know i don't really understand what's going on just yet and i want to address that because i see some questions um just to make sure that we're all on the same page so we first started by creating the database right that's what we did in astrodb when we created the database um and now we've got this this full um you know apache cassandra cluster that is up in the cloud ready for us to go but at that point okay i've got my database but then i need i need to set up some type of structure i need to be able to talk to it and have it store data right this is where the graphql piece comes into play um if you're familiar with relational databases right um you may be familiar with like sql uh doing things in you know uh you know simple query language or whatever where you you're creating a table you're inserting data we're doing the same thing here we're just using a different api called graphql in this case right for those of you familiar with things like rest or documentdb's you could be using that as well but for this particular case for the netflix one we're using graphql so the whole point here of graphql is the language that we're using to create our tables our schema to insert the data and to query that data out this is the same language here under the hood that in the netflix clone is actually being used in the javascript to interact with it and do things and and you know get things out of the of the database so when you launch your clone you can actually see all the videos so this kind of data here this is going to start to show up in our app right so we're just setting up some of the back end and getting the data going i i hope that helps explain a little bit more but graphql is just the language that we're using to create our schema and then set the data in the database okay let's see yeah um it's on bob so in this case you're doing a copy-paste kind of thing right to get all this going and get this launched in production um this is the part i mentioned the very beginning that if you want to build this thing up from scratch we have resources at the very end with the anya cabal video where you'll build it all up right so there's really kind of two parts to this you know we have one focus here and then if you want to build it up from scratch you'll do that with the anya stuff these two go together all right let's go ahead and uh move on harsh that i'll answer what's the difference between schema and a database they're essentially the same thing it depends on the database unfortunately if you're talking relational databases some will call it a schema some will call it a database it's essentially just where you contain your tables and in cassandra it's called the key space it's just the container of your tables that's that's pretty much what that is okay so let's see i saw a lot of thumbs up now i want to move on to 8b here because this next section is important and this is for paging right why is this important right now we're working with a you know pretty small data set um i could actually say pull out all of the movies i have for the sci-fi genre and i've only got four but in a real data set i could have millions right and when you're working in your application you don't you know if you're if you have your web app and you want to display things back to your to your page where the user is you don't want to just put all million things right there in that page right it's probably not going to work so we use something called paging to then be able to step through the content right so cassandra supports that graphql does as well so we're going to page the next one so again we're at step 8b so now we're going to stay in our graphql tab and we're going to query i'm again i'm going to copy the data here we'll go ahead and put that in and i want you to notice something notice this option right here where we say page size right so now we're telling it hey i want to go ahead and page size i want to i want to set how many results i'm going to return to my page and i want to return the page state because if you think about it if i'm going to page through if i if i have a million results and i don't want all of them right i want to do two at a time like we're going to do in this case then i'm going to step through and then the next time i want the next page like the next two results i need to know where did i leave off what's my cursor where's my hold you know my placeholder that's what page state is so if i execute this notice what happens oh look i've got two movies now not four or five or whatever in there but i got this page state down on the bottom because we told graphql here we told it i want to return that page state okay so then in step 8c all we're going to do it's going to look almost the same but the difference now is we're going to apply the page state by the way this would be the same thing imagine in your web app you have your screen and like you have like um like a little forward button right you want to go forward you want to page through the data that's on your page you would return the page state like we're doing here just like you see here and then when they hit that button you're going to apply the page state on the next query so we're going to do that so by the way as a tip save this whatever your page state is copy that out put it in a text editor and save it right because we're going to use it here in a moment now from step 8c i'm going to go ahead and paste this in but notice this here now we're saying hey i want to pass in the page state it says where it says your page state i want this value all right so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to copy this out we're going to paste that in there i'm going to copy the whole thing over right that's my page data it's the cursor that tells me where am i going to start from i'm going to hit play and now it's the second two videos aliens and blade runner not um i'm just uh yeah prometheus thank you i just forgot totally blinked on that right so so you can use this in your code as you're stepping through going from page to page to page you just use this page state that gets returned and you just pass the screws of value now this is all in the code and everything this is just kind of showing you from a rudimentary level how you would do that in graphql oh is it their hair there that's actually kind of funny all right so if you've gotten to the point where you've done the paging give us a thumbs up let us know yeah pedro you can totally do that dynamically we're just doing it here in more of a hard-coded fashion um just to kind of step through it so you can see it here in the graphql playground in your application you would absolutely be doing this dynamically where if you're going to use paging you'd be returning back that page state and storing it and then as you go through subsequent pages you'd be applying the page date every time to get the page you want oh lots of thumbs up from edgardo there there's more thumbs up than i've ever seen at once keep those thumbs up coming and again if at some point you know if you've if you've gotten stuck or whatever that's totally okay i would say just watch for now you can go back this is all self-service you can go back and you can redo all these types of things i actually find it useful uh to go back and kind of play with a lot of these commands the page state um naren when you first did the query that was in 8b okay notice if i do this again okay notice we're saying i'm on return page state oh did i okay oh i i think i just did that wrong didn't copy that in properly there we go at the very bottom you'll see the page state just copy that value that's what you need there you go uh and and yes jimmy the the page state that we get we can use to then get the next page that's that is correct yeah and hawkeye you're correct in both the graphql and graphql schema tabs you need to have your token there at the bottom yeah all right all right i saw tons of thumbs up awesome so then what we're going to do here is move in to well what do you think ryan as far as time i want to make sure you have enough time we don't technically need the loaded cbs csv data set for this to work for everybody um but that'll be good for the homework um but i want to make sure you have enough time to get through the section that you need to so it can deploy to production i think we probably have enough time i think we're doing pretty good on time um okay you want me to go through the data set piece yeah i don't think it'll take too long okay all right survey asks why are we creating the db first we're doing that because um in this particular case you know that's actually a really neat question if i was going through like a normal application development phase right and i was building something from the ground up i'd probably start with like a local and storage thing maybe um but in in this particular case um we're we're actually going to deploy this out to production um using jam stack and a global cdn and that's where netlify and everything comes into play um so we're actually setting up the database so when you run the app you actually get the video you can actually see something happen you get some data um so that's kind of why we're doing that but part of this is also to explain you know the graphql piece and and what we're doing there again if you want you go to the anya video and you'll build the thing completely from scratch right so these these kind of go hand-to-hand all right so we're going to go to step 9 here load a csv data set if you're not familiar with csv that has comma separated values so it's a it'll be like a file called a csv file um i would say the download data set button if you just click on that you're just going to get a bunch of data so right click on it and say save link as there it goes and then some like again my mac wants to save it as a text file um you can just tell it b dot csv it you can just rename it it's not a big deal um but what you want to end up with is something that looks like this it'll it'll be a csv file that's local you see that dot i can't can i zoom that actually oh i can't yeah right well kind of whoops but you'll see something that'll look like movies by genre csv right so that's what you want to see there um now this is a huge this is going to be a much larger data set we just used graphql in line to just insert like you know kind of like a dozen values but this is going to be a much larger data set right so what we want to do is once you download the data set right let's come back over to astra and notice in the top right hand corner you have this low data click on load data you can drag and drop the file you can click in here and i want to grab my movies by genre.csv file my data set i'm going to add it here and let me try to zoom in on this too so you can see that a little better hopefully that's a little better all right once you do that you'll see the next button light up so you this is our data set so i say next now the next piece this is going to show you a preview of the data right it shows you it shows you what columns are here it shows you what type they are and you know and then you actually see a preview of the data this obviously isn't all the data but it lets you know kind of you know what does the data look like and how is it being how how's it being parsed um when it when the tool picks it now we want to take this data these are our movies our movies by genre right this by the way if you remember a moment ago we were inserting data just like this right so now we're just pulling it from a csv file we want that same table that movies by genre table we're going to put that in the table name and for the partition key now this is the in the instructions um but i'll tell you what it is here we go this will be in step 9d um the partition key this is what we're going to partition by this is like our primary key if you want genre just pick genre that's all you need to do right so the table is movies by genre and the partition key is genre that's it say next then the last thing is you want to tell it what's the target database and the target key space remember earlier we created a database called netflix workshop depth uh workshopdb and then we want netflix key space that's our key space that's the one we've been working out of um benjibath69 uh pick database administrator for now that'll work for your token all right so i want netflix workshopdb and netflix key space say next and it'll say hey i'm going to go ahead and load this you'll get an email when it's done right um it shouldn't take too too long but it's now going to take that and it's going to in the background it's going to load that data up and it's going to inject that into your database and at that point yeah go ahead ryan um so there's a couple of people who are saying they can't download the csv file make sure you right click that link that button yeah and save link as and then it'll if you just try download open it you're going to get something that looks like this it's just the data right that's not going to be helpful um yeah so what ryan said is right click on it make sure you do save link as and then you can change it to csv that's right it's unfortunate that regardless of what the actual file name is so many os's will be like no i'm going to rename this to what i want to so a lot like my mac will try to put it to txt you just need to rename that if you're not if you're not familiar with it by the way here let's just go ahead and do it for fun because if you're not familiar so notice the default format will be text movies by genre i'll save it okay great it saved as a text file but what i really want is i want to come over here and just rename this to csv there's a bunch of different it's going to yell at me if i try to do it because i already have one um but yeah you just need to rename it that's all oh awesome good vengeance i'm glad that worked all right so see right we should be at the point that hopefully you have an email that says that hey um we've loaded your data for you and then that is it for this section i guess i'm going to show my email is that dangerous is that a bad idea yeah oh there it is yeah it should see something like this right and i'll say hey once it's done it'll let you know now the cool thing is for the time being we can move on right so while everybody's data is loading in the background we can totally move on and do the next piece so if you've gotten here though um where you've at least loaded the data give us a thumbs up let us know that you've loaded the data even if it's running in the background all right oh honey nice honey patel i like that all right i'm seeing some thumbs up that's great yeah awesome keep him coming no name um so uh prashanthi uh asks after doing work should we stop running or something so not so as not to reach 25 um so let me just give an example i have been doing these workshops for uh several months and i have never ever ever run into the limit of 25 a month yeah so yeah you notice how many databases i have and i've had plenty of others that i've deleted that had a lot more um transactions than this i've yeah i've never even come close to hitting the 25 so for all the workshops everything we do if you're experimenting you'll probably never hit the 25 credit and that again that rolls over every month um again it at 40 gigabytes of storage and many millions of reads and writes you could even have small production workloads and you'll still be free yeah yeah um virgin asks about clustering columns that's a little bit outside the scope of today's workshop we didn't worry about them because we didn't have to um if you want to learn more about clustering columns uh we have the workshop introduction to cassandra which talks in depth about them um it's basically a way to sort our data on disk it's it's pretty cool but all right i will take over now i see a lot of thumbs up which is great so we have just gone through the process of setting up our database and getting some data in there right so this is our first step of getting this clone up and running we need to have a data set to work with so that is what we have done so far now we are going to work on deployment and we're going to be using netlify now for those of you who are coming back from last week this is going to be very familiar the process will be pretty much identical but for those of you who are new netlify is our host solution hosting solution and it is a global cdn which means it's hosting the site not in a central server but on the edge of i don't know how do they describe it it's just kind of the on the multiple different sites regionally um globally distributed so that the site is closest um to the end users um and it also allows us to use serverless functions so we don't have to worry about backend infrastructure and to edit some of our code and to get kind of a dev site running we're going to be using gitpod which we've mentioned is a cloud-based ide that will run directly from github which is really useful if you're working locally that's fine um it's we just there's a lot of prep stuff that we added to gitpod to get everything up and running some like node versions npm versions that kind of stuff so all the all the details are in the repo so if you are working locally make sure you read that and um and make sure that you have the right um race f so we're gonna have our our uh our code hosted on github which will then sync to netlify amplify i'm putting emphasis on weird points now if i will we'll connect with our github repo and anytime that we make changes like in gitpod to our our repo those changes will be pushed automatically to netlify it will run the build um command on the repo create the latest master you know the the latest build and automatically host it um on netlify and uh have the connection to our database using the serverless functions so it's a really useful kind of turnkey solution for our hosting so let's go ahead and do this i'm going to go over to the repo so the first thing that we're going to do uh is we're going to click this deploy to netlify button now obviously you probably uh don't have a netify account if you are uh if this is your first session if you are coming back from last week you probably do have a netfly account that's fine we're just going to connect it to a new github repo uh so i'm going to click this deployed notify button and what this is going to do is ask me to connect to github so this is basically connecting netlify to my github account i'm kind of logging in through the github and it will uh allow me to create a new repository based on our repository right so we have our repository that you're working through this is going to create a copy a clone of that of that repo in your own github account and connect it to netlify so everything is uh working great so click save and deploy it'll think for a little bit and you'll see this site deploy in progress uh jimmy is this process totally the same as tick tock deploy yes it will be pretty much exactly the same yeah um okay so site deploy in progress you can see that uh it is working if i click on this link hold on let me zoom in if i click on this link and then i scroll down you'll see there's a build happening right now it's currently in building state if i click on this i can see that actually happen right i can see all the things that it's running um it's running the build commands blah blah blah so we can watch this work and what we're waiting for is for build complete basically a successful build and if it gets to that it will also create uh the repo in our github account and push the code to our repo that's what we're waiting for and looking for confirmation for it should be it shouldn't take too long um but while that's doing that if there are any questions we can uh handle that medal uh shaman asks can we get a recording for the session yes all of our sessions are recorded and they're available at the same youtube link so if you want to bookmark this page and come back to it later it will be available uh later [Music] uh no casey uh you hit the notify link from the provided repo that is fine that is expected what it's going to do is create a repo uh when you connect with your github account it's going to create a new repo in your github account with the same code it's going to clone the repo and then you'll navigate back to your repo when we work through git pod later so you're good can i do the project later after watching recorded sessions absolutely yep absolutely yep and you can always reach out to us on our discord channel at any point if you ever get stuck or if you need help or do you have questions just come out to discord and come talk to us we're we we kind of have a follow the sun team because we have folks all over the world on the on the team so we'll have someone eventually help you all right authenticating failed due to the following error we already have a registered user with this email address login to connect to your github account uh okay is that um will you or were you here last week did you do that i was going to ask if it was with us before yeah yeah i'm wondering if that uh so we have seen that in very rare cases uh because someone had an account a netflix account not um associated with uh github and then it was you had there was an issue there's a workaround we have a fix for it but it should work yeah it should actually you should need to authenticate against it let me ask stefano uh he went through that this morning actually yeah all right so as you can see i have netlify build complete and then if i scroll down to the bottom you should see pushing to repository and it has my my new repository that it created for me so that is what we're looking for and if uh if you are successfully get to this point uh give us a thumbs up and we'll be waiting to make sure that everyone is caught up yeah adit um stefano is uh is helping you out anyone else that has that error um uh stefano is going to walk you through the the workaround it's a very rare occurrence um hopefully adit is the only uh one that is facing that um but project demo where am i checking logs so in netlify i came in uh to where did i come in site overview uh there would be a build in progress here it'll be yellow you can click that link um it's not there for me because it's already done but i can go to uh deploys and then this will say building if it's still building mine says publish because it's done but if you click this link right here that will bring you to the logs all right uh how to download the data set uh that is step nine in the repo you can follow that if you don't if you uh if you want to wait on that that's totally fine you can do this part uh that we're going through right now without do without downloading the data set so i would probably recommend follow along with us where we're at and then download the data the full data set later uh you do not have to do that first uh do we need to install the netlify github app uh no i don't know i'm not sure what that is uh no you should not have to you're just going to connect notify to github correct correct victor i ran a gate clone on the repo before the session and just linked to netify from the console is that okay yes that sounds like it should be just fine netlify is a kind of heroku question mark uh yes it is very similar heroku is more of a general app hosting service netlify is is more focused on web apps and provides things like serverless functions and uh that kind of stuff i know heroku's is similar in a lot of ways but i think nullify is a little more focused in what it provides so okay so i'll move on i see a lot of thumbs up um so okay cool yes little cache if you don't have a github account you will need to create one to continue and again that should be free as well yep yep definitely free all right so i'm gonna move on i see a lot of thumbs up um i'm gonna move on so if i scroll back up and i go back to deploys you'll see i have uh my app now right so i've got an app that is being hosted already and then it has the github account that it's linked to and this is my personal uh repo now instead of the one that we started with instead of the data stack steps one this is my personal one so i'm actually going to click this link i'm going to open it in a new tab i'm just going to move this window over over here so make sure that you are navigating to your repo now that is has been created by netlify by clicking this link right github.com your name slash app dev week three graphql that is where you want to go next right don't go back to our repo um because we're going to be starting to work in the repo and you want to work out of your own one so let me go back to where we were so we're on um step two right now we clicked on that github link and we're going to launch git pod ide now we have a few warnings and this is basically making sure that you are working out of your own repo so i want to make sure that it's stated several times make sure that the repo that you're in is not the data stacks devs repo but your own personal repo okay and then we're gonna launch gitpod and you can get the getpodlink by dropping down the click here section and clicking opening gatepod now if you're in uh safari or brave uh this link won't work uh because they don't allow referral links if you're in chrome or firefox this link will work just fine um so we recommend using firefox or chrome just for this uh part um just for ease of use there is a way to uh get uh braven and safari you can like create the link yourself um actually hold on i want to open this in new tab so i'm going to open github pod in a new tab move it over to my other window and i'm going to continue with github skip is also going to log in with your github account and it will start creating a workspace akash how do you open a repo on gitpod uh so i we have a link in in the repo in the readme that you can click to open it gitpod also has a browser extension um i know for for chrome for sure probably for firefox uh that it will add if i scroll up you can see um it'll add this button right here but you can click to open the repo in github it's kind of cool okay so we're launching in get pod um all right so when git pod starts up there are a few things that it had that it does at the beginning now uh this is one of the reasons that we recommend using gitpod rather than a local ide um obviously you are free to do so if you'd like but uh there are a few scripts that run in getpod um for one npm install which will install all the dependencies that are needed for the app and it will install a few other libraries um i think are we installing netfi cli right off the bat yeah yes i believe so so some of the netlify connection um libraries by cli is automatically installed as well it's basically just setting up the entire environment um to work right out of the box without us having to do anything so that's what it's doing right now if you are working locally you will have to run npm install at the very least and we'll actually mention the cli thing in a little bit as well so we're just going to let this finish npm install tries to download the internet uh download the internet it's a joke it doesn't actually but it takes a while kind of get i know [Music] all right yes and kirsten is um putting in the ch in the youtube chat the requirements if you're working locally the requirements for this app is that you need node 15 uh and npm seven so if you're working locally make sure that you have those updated those versions cedric uh can you please wait for two minutes i had to switch chrome for break yep yep we'll wait yeah i have to wait i have to wait for npm anyway um data loader vimal for the data loader um for the keys for the uh partition key you want to choose genre and you can leave the clustering columns blank idit are you still having some issues i know stefano was assisting you oh with step two and step three um so if you have more uh any further questions um it's probably you know we've got about a half hour left before we're done with this workshop i'd suggest going to discord joining our discord and being able to you'll be able to ask further questions there um i can't really uh go back to step through uh oh oh sorry step two and three of this uh part two that we're on right now okay sorry yes i will address that so step two um you want to make sure that you're in your own repo right so if i go to netlify where i've where i've started and after the build is done it will push the code to a new repo and it will give us a link to that repo here so i'm in the deploys section actually i think site overview you can also click on this link too but this gives us a better url so this is uh the repo that it's coming out of and if i go there it'll open our personal repo and that's what we're working out of and then for connecting to get pod in your repo the readme will still be there and when you launch gitpod you can twirl this down and you can click this link right here open that in a new tab and launch kpop um the link will only work in chrome and firefox if you're using safari or brave you'll have to create the the referral link yourself which uh david just put in the chat you can see um it'll be getpod.io slash hashtag then the url to your github repo is basically what it is oh and it works in edge as well okay well that makes sense basically chrome all right so i'm still waiting for git pod to finish up but if you guys are also waiting for git pod uh give me a thumbs up so we can get a a sense of if people and if you guys are done if your get pod is already done i'm jealous uh let me know all right eddie looks like you got it that's awesome glad i could help survesh what is david typing um i'm typing all of you his novel and he works on yeah oh you oh we didn't talk about the novel i was writing that's true yeah by the way git pod with git pod the first load always takes more time just because you got to download all those dependencies and and stuff on subsequent loads when you're actually using is ide it tends to go a little faster and just to also um a question that came in earlier about git pod because somebody observed this they noticed we are clearly installing like npm and node and stuff for them yes we are that's actually part of what we do with the gitpod setup we pre-configure it if you're curious you can take a look at the dot getpod.yaml file that you see in there and that'll show you all the things that are being installed for you these this is how when we have you launch gitpod um this is how we're handling all the prerequisites instead of having you do it manually right that way we can start you off kind of on a happy path if you will but if you're curious yeah just take a look at that file all right cool mine finally finished um next time you open git pod one of the things you should do again to run the app um it will probably if the workspace is still active it won't have to go through this whole thing that we just went through where it installs npm and everything or nvm install all the dependencies it shouldn't have to do that again and you can just run the npm start which will or i guess netlify dev is what we're going to be running but we'll go through how to start the app here in just a little bit sparsh npm still installing yeah that'll take a little bit uh can we change the repo name you can though netlify is expecting that repo now so you'll have to change it yeah i wouldn't suggest changing it after the fact yeah yeah yeah i'd suggest not either if you really wanted to you'd have to make sure that you change it everywhere its reference which would be netlify yeah at the very least yeah um uh metal shaman can we share links for a week one and week two sessions yeah we'll get those links in the in the chat here in just a bit of one of the moderators do it um okay so just to make sure one of the first things we want you to do is type in git remote dash v and this is just to make sure that you are out of working out of your own repo and not the data sex devs repo so when you type this you should see your name your username here not data stack steps so just one last check because it does not work if it's not in your own repo so i'll show you actually you've changed the repo name you think you're in trouble well let us know how it goes you're on your own yeah yeah that's what i was just typing like however that goes let us know but you can always the cool thing about any of this by the way right you can you can wipe out the repo you can wipe out the device you can do this as many times as you want um i have in nullify alone i mean we don't own network or something we we just um use them as a jam stack global cdn stuff and they're wonderful we doing these workshops i've probably created hundreds of sites and i'm still on the free tier and i've deleted and recreated and deleted and recreated so if you really need to you can wipe out all of this and you can start again and you'll be fine yep victor sherman says that he that he sees his but also see data such as upstream i'm assuming you're working locally uh and have cloned the repo locally uh if you want to confirm that that will be fine because you're still working on on your local stuff um uh but if you're in getpod and you see that then something's sums up yogish i'll drop you a link um we're gonna drop it at the end as well but at the very very bottom of the repo you will find the anya cabal section where if you want to start it up from scratch watch her video and build it up that way but i'll drop you the link as well and vimal asked about uh use a different repository name instead of the default if you are still in the netlify part where you're where you're copying the repo or like connecting it to netlify you can you can change the name there for sure and it'll create the repo in your own account with that new name that's fine um it's it's if you've already done that and try and change the name in github netlife is gonna freak out probably and you'll have to change it there too so them all to answer your question you can use whatever your name you want when you are actually setting it up in edify the first time and it should be fine okay all right so yes get remote dash v just to make sure that you are in the correct uh repo um if all is good then we're going to install netlify cli now gitpod should uh do this automatically but if you are working locally um this is a good thing to go over and it does not hurt us to do it again so i just copy oop now i have to allow so i'm going to copy paste you have to allow it so i'm going to do npm install best g which means globally netify cli and so what this is going to do is add some uh netlify functionality to our local and obviously in git pod it's in the cloud but this is our local uh code right so it's actually going to let us spin up a local site and a local netlify server that will serve up on our serverless functions and all that good stuff without actually pushing it to notify yet so it's kind of a first step it also gives us some really useful commands for uploading environment variables to netify without having to do a bunch of copy-paste stuff so uh yes akash i i just installed so i just installed notify while you guys are doing that uh it shouldn't take too long but i'll add or i'll answer some questions uh amber homework done wow you are fast uh if you have not done the homework of the previous weeks um go check those out and get your gold badge and enter to win that 500 gift card how to change the dark tweet it's dark theme that's a good question i don't know why they defaulted to the light theme recently they used to do yeah i'm not sure why they did that either that's unfortunate yeah they do they just made a recent change they used to use thea and now it supports vs code i mean it has for a while but all of a sudden one day it just went and like went to the light theme yeah i don't know there is an option you have to find it i'm not going to spend too much time looking for it but i i feel yeah it's actually easier for to for people to see on stream when it's not dark theme i don't have to zoom in quite as much so that's good uh anyakuba is a netflix engineer uh no she had a netflix engineer on her video right they actually went through her clone and to be clear that the clone is you know it's it's not all of netflix or something like that right um but it is it's kind of enough to get you going especially from some of the ui components but they did have a netflix engineer or she did have one take a look and kind of give the thumbs up right yeah yeah it was really cool but yeah she is not a netflix engineer she's a youtube um coding youtuber influencer what not yeah she's wonderful anya cabal is great um she has if you're if you're looking for like getting started stuff and you want that that base explanation she's got a ton of wonderful videos where she will just build it up from nothing right and that is the video at the end of the repo that's exactly what that is and that's why we're saying in the beginning that what we haven't what she's done we've we've paired together right so it really kind of goes hand in hand it's kind of like two big parts yeah and the deep comments about that they wish we would have created the ui uh yeah that's the the anya's video goes through all that again we have two hours in this workshop we can't do everything and we wanted to focus on um the graphql part of things and getting the the data um the data modeling all worked out um it's kind of a part that um is kind of it's it's really complementary to anya's video i think is a is a good way to think about it um okay can we expect more webinars from you in the coming days we do uh workshops every single week so we'll we'll talk about that later uh let's uh let's move on looks like sarvesh has the the fix for dark mode so if you guys want to do dark mode follow his instructions oh wonderful thanks all right so we've installed notify cli now we need our application token right this is how we connect to our database so we need to get that again um if you have uh your tokens the csv available go ahead and grab that token again um i'm going to i have my windows still open so i'm just going to copy it here we're also going to need the graphql endpoint and we'll show where to find this uh it can be some sometimes a little tricky it's the one if you still have your playground open it's the one that's this url in the graphql tab not the schema tab it's this url up here so you can copy that but i'll also show where to find it in astrodb as well so we're going to need our token and our endpoint and we're going to create our environment variables now what are environment variables um they are um basically our our sensitive information right we don't want to have our our token or our endpoint necessarily exposed to the outside world so we don't want this stored in our github which is publicly available people can see our github account and all the code there we don't want to have this stored there so we're going to store it in an environment variable which is not copied to github and this is basically just a place for the app to reference um that information and not have it be hard-coded in anywhere so what i'm going to do is we have this.env.sample and i'm just going to copy env.sample.env right so this should just create a copy of that file and call it env so this is what our file will look like and in our application token here and just highlight this make sure you get those brackets as well and you paste your token and then we're going to put our end point here now i'll show you where to find that endpoint if you have already closed um playground so if you go to your database right so mine is named different because i had one that is stuck on terminating for some reason and you go to your connect tab and then you click on graphql api right just like just as if you were going to the playground right and then you scroll down and go scroll down past the graphql playground pass all these images and right here so under the write data section this url right here which should end in netflix key space right here this is the url this is the endpoint so i'm going to copy that go back to my ide and paste it here all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna save that i'm gonna leave this up for you guys so that you can kind of find it this is in the connect tab in the graphql section what was the command for env file so i typed uh in the terminal i typed cp for copy and then i typed the dot env.sample which is our sample version of it and then i typed dot env so it's basically just copying the dot env.sample to a new file called env if you want to use the gui you can also just right click uh maybe you can't do that you could create a new file as well called env this is the best way though yeah cedric also has a command touch.env will just create a new file called.env you will have to make sure that you add the astrodb application token equals part and the astrographql endpoint equals part before the stuff that we've copied elsewhere uh avinash we will um we will go over the homework basically what we're doing now this whole process is what the homework will be it's successfully deploying the app to netlify um and adding your own unique movie data is what the homework is uh so if you're following along then you will have pretty much 90 of it done you'll just have to add your own custom movie if you're just watching that's a really good way to just like get an idea of how to do everything and then when you go back uh and and do it for real it'll be easier um divi could not type in the terminal what to do it might still be installing stuff npm installing uh stuff so make sure you wait until you see the the get pod slash workspace you know this thing with the dollar sign at the end that means that it's ready to to type in if it's still doing something it uh you won't be able to type okay so once we're there once you have your env all ready to go you can make sure you save it and we're just gonna run a real quick npm install this should go really quick because i'm pretty sure everything else everything should be good this is just to make sure that all the dependencies are already done all right so we're good so now we're going to run the application netlify dev will spin up a uh basically a network server locally uh using the notify cli which will provide us our serverless functions and we'll be able to see our app start up uh how to save i just am typing command s uh or i guess control s if you're on windows yep all the all the shortcuts that you would normally use in an ide ide will work in getpod oh cedric uh mentioned that autosave is enabled so that's good too i just i'm used to saving like every two seconds yeah i'm like i'm an avid saver as well [Laughter] yeah autosave should be on but yeah okay all right my window is a little small but we can see i have the app right here i'm gonna just refresh real quick hmm you can click this link on the top right that will pop it out into a new tab so it's a little bit bigger now mine does not have the movies are not populating that's weird let's see if we can figure it out all up ryan seriously i don't know it's just oh do you have let's see your env this is someone was i can't it's actually too small on my screen let's see wait do i have to zoom in um oh and you used the example i just added today no it's my screen that's my fault on that one okay um which one is that is that your local that doesn't have any movies yeah it's my local um let me run mine again yeah so my env file must be uh malformed but let's see so i'm going to go back to my manage database uh my connect page it's a graphql api and there should be some connection variables maybe it's baby application token that should be right let's see live debugging it's always the best you know if um check the end of your uh graphql endpoint is it pointed to the right um is it on the right endpoint for one and is it going to netflix key space yes and you have to okay okay yep and i i copied this out of the astra account as well so did you try turning it off and turning it on again let me try so i'm gonna stop the server and try it again you know i'll be curious i'll just give you mine and be very interested to see if it makes a difference or uh let's see where do you want me to put them you want to put in your slack yeah okay i'll put them right directly to you oh oh hold on it's working oh oh i just i turn it off and turn it back on you were right that's too funny all right so if there's no data try uh stopping the server and restarting it control c in the terminal is to stop the server uh and then you can start it again so not sure exactly why uh that happened but we're good so now we can see uh we have our netflix clone running right and all this data um you know the the title the description even the the link to the thumbnail which is the the movie playing in the background all these things is data that we entered either through our graphql playground or uploading through our csv and is being retrieved using graphql right as you can see all these things autoplay when we hover over and then when we scroll down the next sections will load in so this is the infinite scrolling paging you know it's not it's not loading everything at once it's only when we get to the bottom that will start loading uh the next section uh sparsh and uh sarvesh if you press control in your in your uh in your terminal here where it's it's running if you press ctrl c that's how you uh end the process all right so uh real quick and we have just a few minutes left we have it locally but we haven't actually deployed it to production so let's do that real quick it shouldn't take too long i'm going to end the process ctrl c right so we get our terminal back and i can type and we're going to type in netlify login and this is basically going to let us log into our netlify uh through our gitpod and here's the deal [Music] this won't work in a simple browser we have to cop actually can i can i open it with this yeah so if you click on the in your simple browser that it pops up on the top right of that this this uh open in browser it opens it in a new tab click on that and it will bring you to the notify thing right and then you click authorize and that means we've granted access if we go back to gitpod we'll see that it successfully you are now logged into your nutify account that's great uh and now we type in netlify link and what this is going to do is copy all the environment variables which is just the two the token and the endpoint copy those from our environment variable or env file and copy them up to our uh our site so what uh it asks us a few questions how do you want to link this folder to a site the first option should be what you want uh the default is just whatever repo that we are currently using uh and it should be good and if we go to our site if we go to our site settings on netlify and we scroll down uh oh we have to go to where is it say access control no build and deploy that's what it is if we go to build and deploy we will see environment variables now if we refresh oh no did not do it is there another command that i was missing ah yeah there it is i mean i i did not do this command yet so netlify env import.env this is the command that will actually upload the environment variables mybad there we go now it should be good if i go to our netlify and i refresh here we should see that netlify now has there we go our environment variables right there our application took application token and our endpoint all populated there we didn't have to do any copy paste we just ran a command which is awesome and now if we do netlify build this is going to create uh basically builds our our app and then we're going to run the uh the deploy script uh netflix deploy to production uh and that will push it to nutify and be all up on our live production site project demo thank you yes we put a lot of effort in getting our github readme files as complete as possible so that it is easily followable you know on your own they're designed to be self-service so we appreciate the the kind words we put a lot of work into them all right so the notify build completed i'm going to run netlifydeploy production and this should push it to production and we should be able to open our live site [Music] all right and so we can run this now if i open site if we want we can also if we go to netlify scroll up to the top go to site overview and click this link right here netlify.app right it'll be a random name but this is actually live this is accessible by anyone now and you can see all of our data is there awesome so give us a thumbs up if you have successfully deployed um to production and we will now i think it's time for our quiz for some prizes awesome lots of thumbs up perfect very very cool all right so with that i just make sure that we are on to the next thing yes all right so it's time for our quiz let's win some prizes what do you think let's do it all right who wants to win the prizes i did i did see somebody asking earlier about the uh the apache cassandra shirt and how do you buy one you don't buy one you win one so if you want i believe it's actually the shirt i don't want i don't have one oh i know i know i don't have i have a whole closet full of them [Laughter] but i don't think anybody wants the one i've been wearing right yeah no i want a fresh one um all right so menchie.com enter the code i post the the code in the chat also you can see the code at the top of the screen i'll also bring up that that big screen uh so a few things to note about uh this quiz uh speed in answering not only getting the correct answer but but speed in answering is um affects your score so uh the recommendation is watch your phone or the tab that you have mentioned not the stream because the stream has a little bit of a delay so if you're waiting for the stream to know what the question is um you're going to be a little bit late on the jump there so watch your phone watch the other tab that menti is in and answer as quickly as possible to get the most points so mentee.com enter the code 6279-3278 you'll see it here it'll also be at the top of the screen uh up here as well we'll get a bunch of people in here uh looks like we have a few yeah we got a good amount i'll give it just a few more seconds before we get started i can actually move on to the next screen and see all the people's pictures it'll probably auto populate a name for you i think you can change it after the first question or something like that um something while we're waiting for that um you know i see a lot of people were hoping that we would do more of the react stuff right and i totally understand that uh react is something i love to do so it's a little bit of a bummer that we couldn't fit into this workshop however we have um if you go if you re-watch the to do app which is week one uh from a couple weeks ago uh we do a little a lot more react in that one we also have a um react basics uh workshop um that we have put together it's just a github workshop right now it's just a a repo that we go through kind of the basics of getting started with react and getting a create react app uh started up so that would be a really good thing i think we can get a link to that as well um but yeah definitely want to do more uh specifically react things in the future and hopefully we'll be able to do that so all right so i think we have enough people in here let's get started all right first question remember answer fast to get more points what is astrodb it is manage cassandra in the cloud it is a local in-memory database it is a movie with brad pitt it's a gateway to the stars uh-oh cool yes it is manage cassandra in the cloud that is correct yes you got that correctly all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like let's see who the fastest one was looks like scientist exactly that's an interesting name i was the fastest congratulations it's pretty close though all right question two all right answer fits to get more points in graphql which operations do you use to edit data query edit write mutation or pencil no options showed on my screen oh no that's that's a bummer are you on your phone or are you on uh a browser that sucks i'm sorry all right yes it's a little a little tricky because graphql is probably new for a lot of people but mutation is the operation you use to edit data query is used to read data and edit and writes were just uh gotchas the pencil is just a jig all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like all right fastest was rakesh congratulations bumps them up at the top uh and rnj is in second and ramya is in third still very close game though it's anyone's game all right question three just as a note we are going to stick around for q a after the session so for some of your questions we will we will get to them all right what can't you do with graphql auto discoverability schema list federation response customization now this is gonna be a really tricky one because uh we uh we didn't specifically talk about it but you probably can glean from from what we did talk about that uh it's one of these let's see how many people get it right i know it's a little bit of a tricky one all right so the actual answer is schema lists you cannot do schema list with graphql you need to have a schema for graphql um federation uh and auto discoverability and response customization are all things you can do with graphql um i know that one was definitely a tricky one so let's see what our leaderboard looks like now all right let's see who the fastest was rakesh is still the fastest congratulations right on the heels is ramya and rnj is now in third all right question four what are the terms used for paging we talked about paging and how to get that to work in graphql it's paging size and paging cursor page number page size and page state or book title and bookmark ah cash selected schema list because of the song in the start of the video i was just about to respond to that yeah so lucky so lucky because it has nothing to do with it page size and page state is correct yes yes this one a little tricky too because we have some similar named things but yes page size and page state is what we use in graphql for aging all right let's see what a leaderboard looks like all right the fastest was still rakesh increasing the lead romney is still very close though and rnj holds on to third all right question five what is netlify it's a platform to build and deploy web apps it's a java application server it's a code review uh code review tool little typo there uh it's a software to calculate your tax rate all right yes pretty much everyone got that correct a platform to build and deploy web apps that is correct awesome all right looks like rakesh is still the fastest it's impressive ramya is still in second and rnj is still in third it's still pretty close though things could change with the last question let's get to that question six what is the main benefit of using serverless functions now we did mention this we didn't go deep into serverless functions in this one if you want to learn more about that tick tock the week two we definitely dive further into that but we did mention that we can talk about talk about it more than the q and a session after two yes definitely yeah the q a can be on any topic so keep it coming all right let's see what it is all right yes most people got that correct no back end infrastructure is needed is the correct answer let's see if that changed anything in our leaderboard all right for those of you who are our top three winners which it looks like is rakesh ramya and rnj congratulations take a screenshot of your screen of your winnings uh screen make sure you get that screenshot and you're going to email that screenshot to jack.friar datasacks.com we'll get that info in the chat and we'll have a slide for it too and that's how you're going to claim your swag and we deliver swag worldwide doesn't matter where you are we will get it to you so make sure you get that uh screenshot uh but we have one more question it's not for the quiz we just want to um get a quick survey on what we should improve for next session um what is something that you would like to see us do differently just you know we're continually trying to improve um our uh our sessions i'll leave that up for you guys to answer um but yeah actually that thing that happened before it was my slides crashing which is yeah and rahul the question um from the past workshop yeah we don't change the questions all the time for every workshop and uh rowdy it's not because it's pre-recorded it's just because we don't change the questions for all the uh workshops yeah yeah so if you if you were here from last time and you got all the answers because you knew them same on you for cheating just kidding um i need to get hold on i'll get my slides back you happen to have the slides up david oh uh i can yeah mine crashed earlier hold on i think i can get it up uh just the last few slides [Music] um yeah for like homework and stuff yeah homework and stuff all right swag winners okay i got it we'll start with that one cool thank you yeah got it got it um alright so for those of you who are top three winners congratulations if you want to email your screenshot to jack.fire at deus.com um that is how you can claim your swag so we have that up we'll also um i think we can get the link in the chat as well um so make sure to take a screenshot if you want take a screenshot of your win so you can send it on absolutely um okay so homework so like we said we have homework every uh every week for our workshops um this is how you earn your badge and if you get all three batches from our series you will get a gold badge and eligibility to win the uh the 500 amazon gift card that we mentioned but for the homework for this one it's very simple it's basically what we went through today in the workshop we deployed our uh app to production to our netify uh site um but we also want you to import a movie of your choice into the db uh with graphql so if you reference step seven uh in part one that's where we were importing some of the uh the movies uh you can kind of go through the same process to import your own movie now for something like the the uh the thumbnail where we are linking to i think imager videos feel free to just reuse one of those it doesn't have to be the actual trailer from the movie that you're adding uh right we don't expect you to upload your own trailer to image or anything like that you can just reuse one of those but honestly if it you know funny enough from a grading perspective it's actually easier if you have like wonky data in there because we'll know it's we'll know it's yours right yeah so if you have like the the movie from the the thumbnail from prometheus but the movie name is you know um coffee mug or whatever then we'll know it's clearly one of the ones that you did um so yeah don't even worry about that it doesn't have to all match up or anything it's it's really more to kind of illustrate to us that you're understanding how to mutate and you know how that works and such um so put in whatever you want there really yep and then we have an optional part of the homework this is not going to be for the graded for the badge or anything but we really recommend watching that on your video and that's linked in the repo yeah at the bottom there um and then yes so as we said our our github repo is always available uh even outside of our workshop times and you can go through that and reference that for your homework and also for the links to the video excuse me sorry all right so for submitting homework so we have a little process uh if you go to the issues tab of our repo and uh you click on issues you can also select uh the the new issue and we have a template that we use for homework so you can click the get started button on the right for the homework assignment template and fill in the uh the information there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna collect some screenshots from your um from your homework from your deployed app and uh and submit them uh to that uh that issue make sure you enter your name and your email um because we use that to issue the badge so if you want your badge uh make sure you enter your your name and email uh for the screenshots one thing that i want to just mention um is the only screenshots that we really need are your final app kind of with your with your url your netify url displayed um and also uh make sure that you include a screenshot of the custom movie that you've entered uh if you want to enter if you want to submit screenshots of your graphql playground and how you you know the code that you use to enter it that's fine just keep in mind that the graphql playground has your token your astra token don't paste your token yes don't don't take a screenshot of your token and paste that in because these issues are publicly available and anyone can see them and if you if you do happen to we're going to delete the screenshots and let you know to delete your token it's kind of a hassle so just make sure you don't take a screenshot of your token just want to put that out there all right one other thing about the homework by the way um why there it is there's a homework section in the repo you can see that here right notice the last step submit your homework here that link will essentially shortcut what ryan was talking about with creating the issue you know if you just click this link notice by the way we're back at data sex devs you want to you want to submit this to our repo it'll fill out the template for you you just fill the stuff out and put your screenshot in and you're done right hit submit so you can just use the link there as well yeah and those angled brackets uh make sure you remove those that's just oh yeah this these are just placeholders yeah all this yeah make sure if you put a name in here you're replacing those completely you don't want the uh the little angry stuff in there all right exactly um all right so we will be grading those uh homeworks in over the course of the next week um we do it all manually by hand so it uh it takes a little bit so just be patient a little bit with us um as we uh go through what is probably going to be hundreds of submissions so just to let you know uh so some resources that we have we have academy.datasacks.com which is a place that you can go to learn more about uh what we do here at stacks we work a lot with cassandra so it's going to be mainly cassandra based um uh courses um we also have datasacks.com dev which is a place another place that you can find some some courses and and further learning um uh based on cassandra we also have the community.datasacks.com which is kind of a stack overflow type place to ask questions about cassandra about datastax and the community will answer uh those questions really cool resource there and of course our youtube channel which you are on right now watching this stream we have workshops every single week sometimes multiple a week multiple different workshops a week and we have a very large backlog because we record every session and we keep them around so uh take a look at our youtube channel subscribe if you want to learn uh if you if you want to be notified of when we go live and check out our our past workshops um and hopefully you guys can learn uh learn a lot more and and enjoy those all right so certification so we are going to be giving out vouchers for completing these uh three sessions uh if you're just joining us for this last session that is totally fine um uh and casey yes this is the last class of the three week set uh what will come next uh well we have we'll give you a link on on what to see is coming next i think next week we're doing introduction to nosql just to answer that question uh yes uh yes i believe next week is intro to no sql yeah so we will get so we are we're giving away vouchers for our uh certifications which is a cassandra certification uh we will get the link to that form in the uh chat here in just a second um i don't know if i i personally do not have that link i wonder if uh cedric or houston have it um but that's this uh the voucher registration uh will be open for uh just a few minutes during the end here of the of the workshop um but these vouchers are good for two attempts which are usually 145 dollars each and they're good for any of these three courses we have the developer certification the administrator certification or the kate sandra certification which is uh the cloud-based um kubernetes-based cassandra certification um this is a really good way to uh you know amp up your resume and and uh kind of add more skills um uh to to your capabilities um and we actually have on um data stacks academy i think uh the next line has our um our courses that we have that we provide on uh oh i guess we placed that slide anyway we have those three the three paths basically the administrator developer and keith central paths and you can go to datastax.com or academy.datasacks.com and all the courses required to to learn uh enough to go through these certifications is available there so if you want to go to that link that we have on the screen dtsx.ioslash workshop voucher you can also scan that qr code you'll be able to claim these vouchers as well now one thing that i do want to show because we get the question every single time is what will be required for uh getting these vouchers is your cluster id or your site id i think it will ask for i'm gonna just share my screen quick so what it's asking for is if you go to your astra account right you created your netflix workshop db right right here this cluster id this is what it's going to be asking for right so this is this is uh when it asks for that cluster id this is the the thing that you can copy you can use this little widget to copy it and that's what it's going to be asking for so it's just in your dashboard of your uh database that you've created in astra all right yes we've got the link there in the chat all right all right so um we have our uh little contest or lottery uh we have three amazon gift cards we mentioned this at the beginning um if you have completed all the homework for all three uh sessions that we have in our summer series right so this one last week's was tick tocks two weeks ago with the to do app to complete all the homework uh and you get all the badges and you get your golden badge uh you can enter into uh the uh the lottery for uh one of the amazon gift cards so we're giving away three 500 amazon gift cards and all you have to do is do the homeworks for each session and then go to this uh site i have to turn off uh david's camera dtsx.io summer series game which we just linked in the chat and there's a form that you fill out and you can get several entries into the contest and we uh all entries need to be submitted by august 1st and we're going to be um announcing the winners live on august 18th all right and with that um someone asked about upcoming workshops datatax.com workshops this is where we have uh all the upcoming workshops listed you can also um register for them the the registered the events um there um i think next week is introduction to nosql and we might have a couple other ones um listed as well uh so that's that's where you can find out also you can subscribe to our youtube channel um and uh you can be notified when we go live as well all right one last plug for our discord uh community if you have further questions um you know we're gonna stay on for uh a while another 45 minutes after this uh to answer any questions right away but if you want to ask questions like in like in the coming days or weeks or after any questions about homework or something discord is a place to go we have 14 000 people there now um and it's it's really where we can answer questions um kind of further into the future so recommending in uh joining that with that thank you so much for joining us uh this week uh we hope that you learned a lot i know a lot to digest um and you know it can can be kind of a uh a wave of information that's um hard to digest but session is recorded and you can always re-watch it uh later but we hope you learned something and had a really good time uh i certainly had a good time uh yeah so we will be back in just a couple minutes gonna take a short break we're gonna take like a five minute break right and then so the session at this point is officially done we'll we're gonna take a five minute break and for those of you if you want to stick with us for a little bit um we'll help answer some questions help you get through the rest of your homework you know get get a little bit more into the code or something like that um and we'll we'll play around for about 45 minutes yep all right so we will see you in just a few minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right we're back welcome back everyone looks like we have a few people who stuck around which is awesome uh so this is gonna be a very free freeform session ask your questions if you have any like clarifications that you want we can you know share screens and show uh some stuff if you have if you need something yeah i've got one right off the bat for diogo over in discord saying hey i can't find my cluster id can someone help me and i don't know whose screen you're on at the moment ryan but uh it doesn't matter either way um one of us can show diago how to get the cluster id uh yeah uh so hold on let's see if i do this one uh so yes the cluster id is so in your astra um dashboard right you have your netflix workshop if you click on that you'll have this window open and this is your cluster id right here yeah there should be a little copy widget like ryan is shown right next to it where you can just copy it and that'll be good for your form i assume you're looking for that for your form oh and shreyash is asking about the site id after netlify link what do you write there so it should um prompt you so let's see if i can find my where i have that hold on so it should prompt you and it should ask you a question it should how do you want to link this folder to a site and the default option will be use current git remote origin and that one should be sufficient um because that'll just connect to the uh uh whatever whatever netlify site uses this github repo that's basically what it's saying is use whatever netflix is using this repo and it will connect it uh if it's not popping up this question uh try refreshing your they might be uh hung up on something all right i see um i see one in particular i'm actually gonna i think let's see it's titled yeah no i've got that wrong uh mr roma forever asks does using jam stack and serverless functions eliminate the need for a back end altogether hmm that is an interesting question that is an interesting question and then yeah technically to answer it fully is there is still a back end it's just being provided for us right netlify in this case is providing that back-end infrastructure for us um and then providing dynamically providing endpoints to the serverless functions that we're giving so uh it's not eliminating the need for it for a back end it just eliminates our need to do it ourselves if that makes sense um and i'll say and i don't necessarily have an example at top of mind but there are certainly uh cases where you'll want to do your own back end right there are probably there are certain apps that will you're just not going to have enough flexibility using serverless functions that serverless functions necessarily at this point maybe in the future hopefully as someone who hates doing back-end stuff but uh for a lot of for a lot of apps you can use serverless functions and it's a it's a really good way to to get um ahead sorry not to worry about back-end stuff so hopefully that answers your question i think yeah and i think if you're coming from like traditional um doing things with traditional back-end right you know funny enough we we've had these conversations within our own team um because a lot of the times in your traditional back end um as part of that back-end code and those apis and those interfaces you're going to be you know you're usually going to have some kind of authorization layer in there you're going to probably have some code that's wrapped around that that doesn't just let people execute say any commands or whatever those types of things to hold true the difference though is that when you're doing things with serverless functions for jam stack you can just write those functions right there in the javascript right right on the front end code so it kind of blurs the lines a little bit so i can understand some people who are say traditionally back-end developers which is what i've done that that's been the most the time i spent coding was back-end um might make you a little uncomfortable because all of a sudden it's removing right some of the control that we've had to control those types of things um whether or not you want to use it for back end i think it really depends on you your application your your deployment and you know the types of things you want to do can you do it yes and you can totally put the same types of things in the serverless functions um you know that you would in the back end the big difference though being is that serverless functions by design should be extremely lightweight right because a serverless function other than just being this like amorphous backend thing that's out there it needs serverless function needs to be able to elastically scale up and down very quickly um so if you happen to have a case where you have a ton of requests that are coming into a particular function it needs to be able to scale up and not only that they're they're stateless i mean netlify will actually uh you spin up like when you push a jam stack app to something like nullify and you've defined serverless functions nullify actually does have some level of caching in there right but you should kind of you should pretty much code it in such a way where you want to ensure since they're stateless that if that serverless function just got spun up a thousand times then it's not sitting there waiting for 30 seconds for every single one of those right it needs to be it needs to be very very immediate um so they do need to be lightweight you don't want them but too much of the business logic back there um and again it depends if you're used to doing things in microservices or monolithic apps how you go about it but you can you totally can and that's actually one of the really cool things about serverless functions um and if you take a look uh you know at the both the netflix code um and the tick tock actually all of the apps we've been doing in this series they all have serverless functions and you can get some examples there um i don't know if ryan if you've got yours up or um um i can i can switch over to you yeah if you want yeah matter of fact where is my netlify let's take a look at this yes cool i've got it up yeah so by the way who asked that question uh that was mr roma forever and um oh i got it i'm mr roma forever i see yeah yeah even for real production yeah so check this out um so if you go to the code and we didn't really talk about this here but now we can um so let me blow these up a little bit if you take a look in here now when using netlify there's something called vanilla phytomole so in the phytomole you you just give it some configuration one of those is where are my serverless functions in this case for saying i want my service functions in the functions directory so in my functions directory here notice i have these two these two functions get genres and get movies um so this is these are my functions right now so by defining uh by literally putting my js files in the functions directory how i define it and apply tomo uh and then using this exports.handler like this the way you see this set up this now will tell nutellafy gives it all the information it needs to say hey this is a serverless function so this code is going to be executed every time this thing loads if you take a look at nullify notice that when we deployed it we have both get genres and get movies these are now exposed as surveillance endpoints right and what's really cool going back to the question about um production and all that kind of deal is you know netlify not only will push all of your static content to a global cdn on its edge network and everything the benefit there being is instead of being on a single web server right it'll actually distribute out all the the code and everything like that around the world um so you can have that code as close to users who are accessing it as possible but at the same time it exposes the functions that you've defined as these serverless functions that are their own endpoints this is actually how you make a static site dynamic right use things like react and such in the static code but instead of generating all of your html through some back end code and pushing that down to the front end your front end is just static but then it makes calls back to these functions these can scale completely independently right so let's say um you know for whatever reason the app get movies was just getting hit like you know a ton compared to genres get movies would scale on its own independently as needed and then would come back down uh you know once that once that need kind of went away um so it's it's actually really awesome so you can totally use this for uh production deployment and that's what this is intended for that's exactly what netify is about and that's why when we kind of talk about we're saying okay we're going to deploy this to production i realize we're glossing over a lot but this is what we're getting at right that you can take a javascript jam stack app and you can actually use a service like netlify there are others like it and you can actually push it this way for production usage in a production app i hope that long-winded explanation kind of gave more information there or useful information uh and miss aroma forever also asked are what are other platforms other than netflix that could be used as uh a cdn uh there are several different cdns um i don't know off hand if they all [Music] do the exact same thing as far as like providing timeless functions and stuff i know heroku is a pretty popular hosting platform i don't know if it uh allows for serverless functions necessarily um nutify is kind of our favorite that's what we use it works really well yeah you know a really good place to go by the way for that uh i want to say is jamsac.org um this is a really great place to go you'll notice that there are there are a bunch so here i'll drop that for you jamestack.org yeah i would take a look here and this will explain the whole thing about jam stack and what they the app is using um but it's it's definitely kind of a newer a newer stack and it really takes advantage of a lot of the the serverless um the serverless wave if you will a matter of fact astra when you created your astrodb today that is also serverless right so again serverless meaning it's elastic and it's dynamically elastic so it can scale up and down as needed dependent on load so both between the way you deploy the app here using a jam stack and then having the backing database be astra which is also serverless and elastic from a production standpoint it essentially gives you the ability that if your app were to go valuable scale up then it can scale up and scale down with you and triash asks can i build mobile apps using notify yes we actually have something that we're working on we might have something in the works i have something that works that deals with that uh so stay tuned um there's another question can we actually add some videos which would open after using the play button if uh if we can how so you certainly can um and i would challenge you to figure out how um it'll get into like creating a new page uh some more react components if you need uh primer prs yeah if you want to if you want to go for that experiment by all means pr back in that'd be wonderful yeah um it is certainly possible to store actual video files in astrojb that's going to use up a lot more data um right now we just linked to external sources um but if you want to play around with it again keep in mind that it's going to use more data keep an eye on that 25 credit um just make sure that it doesn't go uh crazy but uh it is certainly possible uh and i would challenge you to figure out if you want um to get a primer on react because you'll need to do some react stuff to you know get some of that working um we have the uh the react basics course that we have um and there's plenty of of more advanced resources out there as well you know um i see um a set of questions coming from um where is it and i don't i'm trying to find the questions from them all um i don't i know them all you need help i don't know with what yet i just see terminal um so if one of you two can give me a little bit more insight we can try to um we can try to get you some help only ones can you please make a quick video of making the note for this clone well if you go down to the bottom of the repo and i'll drop the link for you there's this anya's netflix video i believe that's what you're looking for it's two hours long this was on a quick one yeah yeah it's you know i yeah exactly you know it's um if you think about it uh building any app um even even what we did here today we we didn't technically build like the components in the ui and stuff like that the actual app but just even going through the deployment process and building it take it two hours easy but yeah take a look at that video um and let you do it by the way newport um in discord i think the problem in your graphql looking at it here is that your query is you wanna okay yeah your query you want to get movies by genre but you're referencing a reference list right so if you're trying to get movies by genre reference list was actually the name of the uh table that we use for the genres let's see is there a way to edit in netflix clone we did yeah um if you're asking how do you insert a video right how do you insert your own custom video here's the here's the trick really if you go to [Music] yeah if you go to the section step 7 where you're inserting the values in movie table you can literally take one of these mutations modify it right um just modify it and then apply the same steps you did with the graph ql library or the the sandbox um the playground is what i mean to say and and that's it so you can just you know matter of fact easy for us uh you know for the titles especially if you change the title and you make it something very obvious right um and and stuff you could even create the same thing but the important thing here is why we ask you to do that is it's one thing to deploy the app it's another thing to be able to at least basically understand the concept of how do i go and mutate how do i change some data in the system right um because that's exactly what you would use in the application to then effect change that's kind of the what we want to leave you with so yeah you can literally just copy one of these change the values you could even leave the thumbnail if you want or go find a different one um and then when you submit the homework just make sure that you've got that in your screenshot so we can see it okay see i think i see more from the mall here and chavendra um do you have anything while i'm reading there uh ryan uh no not anything that you haven't um addressed already i think um and ask about the homework uh and what screenshots to get the only screenshots that we really need are of the website the final website and then yeah the new movie inserted make sure you include your uh the url to your netlify site so that we can make sure it's unique and we can go there and check it out um and i'm reading the error that shivendra is facing and are you so first are you working locally or through getpod would be my first question luckily okay um oh okay yeah so our our ability to troubleshoot is a little bit limited because you are working locally i'm trying to think of why it would let's yeah error out though because it shouldn't i mean it should um just fine are you running netlify dev or are you running npm start that's another thing because if that's a good question you need to run netflight dev for it to have the environment for it to even know what to do with some of the stuff that we're giving it so you'll need to install npm install netlife cli uh and then run netlife dev is would be the the steps to normally take so if you if you have done that yeah okay so npm start will that's that's the issue um so yeah you need to install the netlify cli network cli and what that does is it basically allows you to run the netlify environment on your local machine because the netlive environment will provide the endpoints the dynamic endpoints for those serverless functions all those kinds of things and then once you install that nullify cli you'll be able to run netlifedev which is just one of the scripts for nilify cli yeah definitely try nullify dev and just to add on to what ryan was saying um so something really cool that netflix does for you and why you need to use netlify dev right um remember we were talking about these endpoints earlier before our serverless functions what's neat about this is let me see if i can't find an example for you in the code i know for a fact where exactly where it is in the tick tock one um maybe i'll bring up the tick tock one i'll do that because i know i know right where that one is uh app.js are you looking for the endpoint um no i'm looking for maybe it is app.js i'm looking for where and you might know this one better ryan in the netflix app i'm looking for where the dot netify endpoint is called yep app.js is it it is here now oh here it is perfect thank you yeah okay that's where it is in this one so here's what's really near really really neat i think it's really neat anyway um notice the end point here notice that i doesn't matter if i'm local or if i've deployed up a netlify or anything like that um what's gonna happen is netlify makes the access to my serverless functions seamless regardless of the environment i'm in so even when i'm deployed locally when i use netlifedev i can access my serverless functions the same way i would as if they were actually deployed in production so from a development from from my standpoint it makes my process the same right um it makes my access the same um so i find that to be like a really cool piece of functionality because i don't have to remember or do anything special or have some special code that says okay well if i'm local do this if i'm in prod do this um so that's that's really neat that's part of why we use that notify dev um let's see we'll see if that works okay this actually by the way for the native the folks are actually about native mobile app development this is something that's coming up that's kind of interesting because we've been noticing that um the different environments like android compared to ios kind of use networking a little bit differently and uh matter of fact brian that's exactly what we're working on the other day uh trying to figure that one out so it's kind of a pain but we'll figure it out yeah uh cluster id yeah sorry go ahead right no uh anushka asked for the cluster id and where to find it again uh so your astro account you go to your astra account you click on oh it's gonna it's gonna totally reset on me isn't it okay oh i've actually got mine up too if you want uh and you'll have your if you just just your main page for your uh astro account you have your netflix workshop db it's this it's this key right here uh it's also i guess in this column it's called database id that should be exactly the same as the cluster id right yeah yeah yeah so it's just this guy right here all right feedback for that i don't know why they're different names yeah that is a little confusing i think someone else asked before i i basically remember someone asked if cluster id and database id were the same they are the same okay uh is there a way to edit in playground of netflix phone we've done today like changing movie name before framework uh so yeah you can this was this ass already yeah i think so so in your playground so when you add your own custom movie you're going to use a playground like we did uh to add the movies in the first place so you know we mentioned step seven of part one is uh what gosh i hate the scroll on max um step seven insert values so you can just uh use one of these as a basis um for or how you enter stuff in so if i'm in and remember you want to be in your graphql tab and this is how you're going to insert movies and you you'll use the playground uh just like we did before you know just change these stuff are you referring to padman's question yep okay okay cool so yes so yes use playground that's uh not only a good way to do it shiva in discord is asking how to get the golden badge once you complete all three badges from the three-week series for the to-do app tick-tock and netflix um then we will we will be issuing those golden badges right so you just need to complete all three badges and then we will be issuing those there's nothing more you need to do um ryan if you wouldn't mind popping back over to my screen i see somebody has stuck with the no referer found so i can show that one yep cool all right so shiva shiva i see what's going on chances are um that this is the git pod button only works in chrome or firefox and you'll notice in the link if i just copy the link address if i could only there is so if i try to do this but i'm in brave right uh brave this doesn't this from referrer won't work so what's gonna happen is when i try to go here it's going to say hey no referrer found here's what you do right um so if i go to open this up you'll notice that it has this hash and then an address this address is actually the refer it's trying to get the the link to the repo that you're in right so what you can do there is you grab your repo link and from the hash on just pop that in there manually like that and that's it that'll be enough to do it right um so even if you're not using one of the supported browsers again just grab your repo link paste that in there after that dot io and your link that should do it oh nice anushka cool thanks for saying so yeah thank you stefano stefano yeah did that as well all right how are we doing on questions i feel like we've gotten questions answered up uh jewel the the golden badge will be automatically provided uh if you have all the other badges so yeah you don't do apply anymore i got you and diego yeah i actually took um i took that as a thing of feedback because um there is kind of a thing where at one point it stays a database id and then you see cluster id some screens have changed so we'll get that we'll get that fixed up thank you for for making the point all right um yeah if there are any other questions let us know uh yeah i do see devon and discord will you teach this also or it's the end here so oh that's right yeah move on yeah it's the end here right um so it you know if you're looking to extend out the capability of the netflix clone you want to do more you want to use this for a basis for your own project go for it right matter of fact if you feel so inclined to um you know if you want to extend the capability by all means do a pr uh pr back the repo uh we'd be happy to take your pr um you know so it's it's it is one of those things where as we're just building it up and you'll see especially if you go through the anya video um that's down in the repo um even getting to the point where the app has the basic functionality that it does now with a lot of the mocks and stuff it's a it's a good amount of work um you know so there's there's definitely significantly more that can be done that that's up to you but you're right it is and we're at the end here with what that app does uh ann asks how do you save new changes to netify website so the netify site is connected to your github repo so anytime you make changes to your github repo and commit those changes so like when we're working in git pod for example you know we're working in this like local virtual environment that getpod creates we would have to commit all those changes to our github repo which is commands for and then once it's committed to like the master branch of uh of our repo those changes will get migrated to netlify automatically um and if i will detect those changes rebuild the app and redeploy um are you um who's screen are you on i'm on yours okay so yeah this is actually really really cool um let me do this real fast i gotta re-log in because i sat there and did nothing for a minute this is another piece from the um from the five piece that i think is really really neat so once you've linked your workspace once you've authenticated and linked your workspace like this um then as ryan was saying and i'll just make sure those are there so when we do this step here this nutlify env import emb what are we doing we're taking the values from our env file and we're injecting them into our netlify site environment this is actually a really important step and why it's important is because you never ever want to take these kind of values and store them out in the open you don't ever want to check these into your github repo or anything because this is how people are going to authenticate against your database and they could do really bad things right so you want those but you need to get them up to the serverless functions you need to get them today so they can be used um so what's really cool about this little command right here is in your site you have environment we didn't put these in here this command injected them in there but these are protected and safe these aren't accessible publicly um so then this gives the ability now for our app up in production to use them but there's more to it right so that's one part of it the other part is this um when you do this build now this is one way to do it by the way there's actually a whole we have a whole another workshop that goes really into a lot more detail where if you want to use like a cicd pipeline with like github actions you want to go through your testing harness and everything like you should before you know pushing the prod then what you could do is as ryan said when you commit your changes and then you you like pr them up to uh your repository then netlify will actually do and i'll show this here real quick i'll just do it without the prod um let me build it though yeah just because i'll do it that way so you can kind of see um so you could do it one of two ways you can either have netlify build stuff um or you can do it locally and then push it it's either so when we first pushed it if you remember when it first copied the repo and um ryan had clicked on the deploy and you get those logs that come out this stuff uh from here um that was actually netlify went and built the whole thing right this time what we're doing is we're saying hey i'm gonna build this locally but then i'm going to deploy it now we cheated for time actually we use this dash dash prod but if you don't do that and you say netlify deploy what it's going to do this is actually i just love this functionality let's see check this out it doesn't deploy preview right so it doesn't just push it to production i could do this safely and if i really wanted to then really get the end-to-end thing going i would use github with github actions and anytime you make any kind of commit as ram i'm saying back to master what your main is then it will automatically do a deploy preview of your pr and go through the whole test harness it's it's really freaking awesome then once you're all green and you see you passed out your test and you're all good then you can promote it what we did here by using dash dash prod is we said i don't care just take my code that i built here and put into production right now this is literally going to take what i built and it's going to jam it right up into production um right there boom so that's why it doesn't have all this build it just takes it and puts it live right um where the safer way is probably to do a deploy preview and everything but again i pre-built this um if you remember when we did the first first one i didn't we didn't pre-build it and it had because it built it for you so there's a bunch of different options here uh depends on what you want to do really but it's it's actually nullifies awesome honestly i love using it um it's it's really neat and if you do it right then you can you can without even having to set up any of your own jenkins your own sites or anything you can actually have a full fully testable end-to-end pipeline all through mostly free services it's actually really great all right it's anything in your mind nope just invited people to join the discord for uh to ask further questions uh because we're gonna wrap up here in just a bit um so discord is definitely where uh you can ask questions and we'll be able to help you further um and you can upload screenshots and all that kind of stuff like it's a little bit easier to help in that environment um it's like stefano is in uh discord answering questions i don't see any more questions um in youtube chat at the moment okay all right well again thank you everyone for uh joining us for this workshop um we uh we hope you enjoyed uh our summer series um and if you haven't uh watched the other the other sessions of the series we really encourage you to go do that and uh get those work those homeworks done and uh apply for that that uh raffle for the for the amazon gift card would be really cool what's up we'll give you free stuff yep all right thank you very much for joining us uh have a great rest of your week and uh we'll see you next week for our next session all right see you all right see everybody thank you bye-bye and as always don't forget to click that
