    "text": "glad to be here I wanted to give this talk because I know that there's a lot of kind of low-level stuff going on way down in the guts of Cassandra that's all really important you know we want the committers and the guys writing the code to be able to get down and have those conversations I'm not a committer I'm a developer I write applications on topic Cassandra that's my that's my main concern it's always been my main concern yes I work for data stacks now as a developer advocate but before I came to data stacks I built a large reservation system using Cassandra as the primary data store and skinned my knee a few times as you can see here so a lot of this talk comes out of real-world experience and not just being data sacks fanboy so I just wanted to let you know where I'm coming from and what my perspective is and also set the expectation level this is this is a breadth-first talk so I'm gonna hit a number of high points point you to some resources and just some things that you can go and have a look at for more information and most especially I want you to come and talk to me afterwards I'm gonna be hanging out at the data sex table in the lobby during lunch time we brought 25 copies of Cassandra the definitive guide I did the second edition of that so I'll sign signed a few copies of that so come on over and say hello and ask me your hard questions and if it's really hard I'll find Jonathan Ellis and then we'll it'll be good okay so here's the kind of the top point I'm not going to bury the lead here so here's the top five points about getting the most out of Cassandra right here this is what we're gonna go through for the rest of this talk okay so first of all don't try to use Cassandra for everything know when to use it not when to use it second get your data model right it's super important can't say that enough third get smart on application development I'm gonna share some anecdotes from my personal experience and the experience of others of people who have made bad implementation choices which make life harder for everyone else especially on those who are responsible for maintaining those databases so I'm gonna talk about getting good at ops or outsource it and the final thing is really to give something back so there's ways that you can contribute to the community even as a developer not as a person who's a committer or fixing jiriz okay there are ways that you could participate and give back and then my little Kota here with any time I have remaining is really just to share kind of a catalog of resources that we make available to help you improve yourself get better at developing with Cassandra so this is where we are headed I've put my my Twitter handle at the bottom of the slides that's always on there so you can remember that and interact with me and when you take a picture of the slide if you choose to do that and share it then you will remember to reach out to me so okay when I was a choice I did a talk and actually it was two years ago this week at strata in New York City I did this talk about how we design a system our reservation system for choice hotels where I was working Brande reservation system in the cloud running an AWS mostly on top of Cassandra and then the spark was I guess a little bit more of an aspirational thing at the time so yeah we were kind of building up into that and I what I presented was how we did a micro service design of using domain driven design principles from the famous Eric Evans book to derive the different domains that were part of this hotel reservation system and then drive the data models for each one of those and then put a Cassandra database underneath every single one of those that was wrong it was a mistake and I shouldn't have done that and I had a really good reason for doing it at the time which was operational simplicity if we're building a new reservation system I've got what originally started out as two dev teams which quickly grew to about 10 or more dev teams four of which we're working on like the very core guts of the reservation the kind of the booking and scheduling algorithms and then there was a bunch of other teams that we're doing integrations around the edges of those four core teams I had every single one of them dropping all their data into Cassandra tables as I've kind of matured and grown as an architect over time and realized some of the mistakes that were made there yes there was it was true that there was some operational simplicity that came from only one running one kind of database in production and yes we did reuse clusters and and share the workload so that all those different data types were actually on a single cluster so it wasn't like we were wasting vast amounts of resources however meant that all those teams had to learn Cassandra had come up to speed some of them were really enthusiastic like the first two teams and then the next two teams after that were like what is this that I have to learn I just why can't I just use Oracle right so there was some organizational challenges that came there but architectural II what I realized was it wasn't the right database Cassandra wasn't the right database for all those data types so where did we really need it and what drove us to using Cassandra or thinking about it in the first place as we went to the cloud it was the large volume where we had lots of writes and a really high volume of data so this is thousands of Oto's multiplied by many many days of inventory let's say two or even three years out into the future and all the rates for all those different types of rooms etc that that that many five or six thousand hotels worldwide at the time which was what Weiss was targeting that's a lot of rate and inventory data and there was also a lot of reservation data high volume of reservations so we really needed the scale that Cassandra provided for that what we didn't need it for was the hotel catalog the descriptive catalog information for 5000 hotels there was no need to put that in Cassandra and in fact that would have been a really awesome fit for a document database and that's what I should have done but I did we put it all in Cassandra so the same thing with customer history that's a great example of a graph use case that we could have built toward and that would have been a perfect application for a graph database like DSC graph or one of the other products that's available and then we had some really extremely low volume like reference lookup data tables like country codes there was a there was an actual we wrote a service this is a definite classic example of a micro service emphasis on micro write a country service that all I did was look up country codes and translate one to another there's no way that that needed to be on Cassandra ok so more balanced approach is let's use Cassandra for the things that it's really good at and and not waste their time on other stuff ok so I want to use Cassandra when I know that I'm gonna have large-scale when I have high availability requirements and most especially when I know that I want to operate across multiple data centers or even across multiple cloud providers I'm gonna do another talk that's a little bit later on in this same room this afternoon where I'll talk about some experiences that we're working on right now it data sacks on the developer advocate team to take a reference application that we have and run it in a multi cloud environment so we definitely have some lessons learned and some things to think about there so I'll get more into that side of things a little bit later on a couple other things that are good indicators of when to use Cassandra or not to use Cassandra if you are have a situation where you're gonna be doing totally ad-hoc queries like you really have no idea you might want to query your data along any axis that's gonna be a little bit harder to do with Cassandra because you know it does it you want to lay out your tables beforehand this is the data modeling topic that we'll get into a second you want to lay out the tables to support the queries that you're gonna have you can support a little bit of some kind of ad hoc search kind of capability and I'll talk about how to do that later on but it's not based on just the core cause standard by itself and then if you really do have very strong consistency guarantees and acid transactions that you really need consistency across multiple tables and really have to lock that down then Cassandra probably isn't going to work and be able to handle that and could be a source of frustration however I've been in a lot of situations people made claims of needing to have to have that super strong consistency and as we kind of walk through the different cases it really became clear that that wasn't as strict of a requirement as maybe people thought and I'll give you an example from the hotel world we had this reservation system that we were building and there were claims being made that we had to have super strong consistency where the inventory counts had to be in lockstep with the reservations in other words I needed an acid transaction across the inventory table and the reservation table that was the assertion come to find out that in a hotel world you have a central reservation system and then you have a system on property in each hotel the source of truth of what reservations in inventory are at each hotel is that hotels on premise property management system not the central reservation system therefore if I had six thousand hotels I had six thousand sources of truth and one central reservation system that was subservient to what was on each property so I could definitely try to enforce very strong strict consistency guarantees on a central reservation system but I have six thousand external sources of entropy that I'm integrating with so my I called into question at that point how important is it really the upfront consistency when I can and in fact I'm continually doing consistency checks with these external property management systems so that's just an example of pushback on these strong consistency guarantees especially when you're at scale and think you might need Cassandra okay so the second point this is two out of five get getting your data model right now if you have spent any time come trying to come up to speed on Cassandra you've probably heard this but we all need to hear it again and even when we think we're experienced Cassandra users we have to do this again and again to get our data model right okay so one of the things we are making a deal here when we're using Cassandra we're saying I recognize that I have all those attributes that I mentioned on the previous slide that are driving me toward it I need high scale and high availability I need the ability to absorb a lot of Rights and so on to do that you're gonna have to play by the rules which is designing according to good data modeling principles and you're gonna try it you're gonna be designing in such a way that you design the table that supports the query that you know you're gonna have so you're making a single query that's hitting a single partition and bringing back all the data that you need not in that one query that's your goal with Kassandra data modeling that means that if I need to store the data in multiple representations to support different queries indexed by different attributes in other words doing my own denormalization then I'll do that manual denormalization or or managing your own denormalized tables is still probably the way to go in most cases there is a materialized view capability that was introduced in Cassandra 3.0 you should read the fine print and educate yourself on the different cases I don't have time to go all the ins and outs of it here there are cases where it works and in fact data stacks has a our graph product DSC graph actually makes use of materialized views so they are not they can't be that evil if there's no case where they would ever work and then actually there are cases where they work just fine but you definitely have to be careful about how you use them so that being said there are cases where you have this tension between multiple data types so the example that I showed previously where I had hope I had a service that was managing Hotel data and I had a service managing inventory data and a service managing rate data those were different cases where I had separate services that were owning data types but the on in order to satisfy the functionality of the system I needed to have some capabilities that we're looking across both of those so for example I'm shopping for a hotel room I might need to pull some information about describing hotel and then what inventory it has and then at what prices or rates I can buy that if I were going to go totally the Cassandra way of modeling things I would actually probably a table that stored the data such that it was indexed by date and I would do a query and I might use a static column to store all the hotel descriptive information and then I would have the rate and inventory information all categorized in a single partition so I do one query and I get all that information at once however that kind of violates my micro-service boundaries that I've drawn so those things are kind of held in tension there and I don't have the necessarily the one magic answer for that but those are those are trade-offs that you need to consider is I have a service and it quote-unquote owns a certain set of data if I want to have a good micro service application architecture if that's the case then it owns all the data that's underneath it and one service might have it in Cassandra one service might have other data and then I might be in a situation where I need to do joins at the application level and that's okay you're gonna you have trade-offs some application level joins are manageable and then you may get to a certain level of scale where you just can't handle it anymore and then you have to start thinking about combining some of those data types together across services what I would say is I would let the scale drive you to that architectural decision where you have to start aggregating things just another note I want to share here too if you if you really are in a case where you you need to do ad hoc searches across multiple different columns in your table you can definitely do normalize and begin to design more and more tables however as you have more and more tables that you are writing data into to maintain denormalized views there gets to be a point where you're doing a lot of writes and that's really gonna start slowing things down now once my personally once I got up above three or four of those denormalized tables that was when I started to get uncomfortable because I had developers do it organizing rights into multiple tables using batches which we will talk about in a little bit on the other hand I was talking with Patrick McFadden yester and he was like yeah I've seen denormalized table design approaches where people were riding into 20 different tables so it's that's really kind of a trade-off that you're gonna have to figure out how to manage yourself and then you'll have to excuse my little plug I do do the occasional product plug for data sacks enterprise where I think it makes sense and I'll tell you actually why the reason that I mentioned this to you I definitely had cases that I ran into in in that reservation system that we were building a choice where I really needed to be able to do some searches that I could not there was no way to support in just core Cassander itself and the number one was the geospatial queries I needed to be able to get at where the hotels were that location information and I had no geospatial search capability that was available to me to really find the closest if I given a lot long coat a location find me you know hotels within 10 miles I had no way of doing that so I we actually built a solution that cached all that information in memory I much rather would have been able to just rely on the database for that that's a perfect use case for for DC search and that would have been a great solution for choice rather than trying to go and build a whole separate search cluster capability so there are cases where there's really a definite value out of having an integrated search capability a couple of anti-patterns to avoid with a data model definitely a lot of allow filtering is not if you've ever run a query where you're trying to basically where you're trying to do a scan across multiple partitions you'll get that allow filtering warning the thing is you probably want to heed that warning in other words don't do that that scan there are cases where if you know what you're doing and you know that it's going to be isolated to a certain level or you know that you can set paging and you're willing to take make multiple page requests to get your data a little bit at a time you can certainly live with that what I found in the case where I had a developer ignored my advice and unbeknownst to me at the time coated in that allow filtering and overrode that capability the system performed well as we were adding more and more hotels onto the system and then there came a time where things began to get slower and slower and this how did this actually turned out to be in the rates portion of the application the rate queries ended up getting slower and slower and slower and then we were pretty soon after a while we were in timeouts so we were increasing time about values and we I you know I had hit the pause button at one point and say like probably increasing the timeouts is not the right answer here this is starting to slow down and come to find out as we went back and investigated things there was a sort of a clever implementation that had been taken probably too clever that was basically the once we got up around the point of where we had like half the hotels about like 3,000 hotels worth of rates in the system things were just ground to pretty much a complete halt and we really needed to go back and look at the table design and and kind of hit the reset button on that and that was a lot of rework that could have been avoided if we would have not kind of ignored the warnings upfront about the allow filtering so real world horror story there for you and then there's a few other anti-patterns i i'm i would encourage you we have some different references on data modeling that you can go and learn about best practices and how to data model there's a few anti-patterns one of them is anything that uses Cassandra as a cue is not going to be a good a good use case and there's a there's a few others that are kind of like that so I'll refer you to a few of these resources ds2 20 the most popular course on data sacks Academy data modeling everybody wants it everybody needs it that that's that is the money course that will help you more than anything else and then there's some other things that are available you if you want to see a good example of a data model in practice you can look at our killer video reference application that's available on github so killer video there's no e in killer so its ki lor video as you see here and then I have a blog series that where I attempt to kind of go the next level beyond maybe it's the 300 level data modeling class although it's it's not just about data modeling it's also about some of those application architecture questions that I was discussing before so these are some resources and I guess the one other thing I'll mention that's just a bullet there at the bottom of the slide is the O'Reilly book the Cassandra definitive guide chapter 5 of that book is actually available for free on a Reilly's website so you don't have to buy my book you could just go download chapter 5 for free and that walks you start to finish through a derivation of a data model okay application development this is our next topic here so this topic three out of five we want to get good at application development with Cassandra you can have a really good data model and then kind of screw up your life by making some bad choices so I'm gonna hit a few highlights here we are actually one of the things that we looked at it at data stocks Academy is we don't have as many resources as we'd like to have on application development we're working on a course right now a brand new course on application development so some of this material you will likely see in one form or another end of the and a new course that we're working on okay in most cases you'll be using one of the data stacks drivers that that we provide we have versions of the drivers that work with open source Cassandra and then if you're a data center price customer there are also DSC versions of the drivers that add in the search analytics and graph capabilities so if you're familiar with the API you create a cluster object to get a connection to multiple nodes in a cluster then you create a session that is optionally bound to a key space you usually bind that to a particular key space and then you can get access to the different tables you want to the session object itself is pretty resource intensive so it's creating thread pools and maintaining connections etc it's a fairly heavyweight object you would like to have one of those if at all possible so I've seen cases and in fact the worst case scenario that I saw was a case where somebody who's was implementing a RESTful API they received a service request instantiate a cluster object service the request throw it away yeah that didn't scale very well it was a pretty low throughput service so create one session keep it around for the lifespan of your service or application and you'll be in much better shape if you are using one of the language variants not not every version of our driver in every language has a mapper but several of them do you if you are using one of the mappers the same principle applies so think if I have them if I have an instance of a mapping manager that's got a session embedded in it so same issue don't create multiple mapping managers so asynchronous operations on this is visit we had a some fun debates about this on our developer advocate team in this killer video reference application that we maintain we actually have converted that to almost exclusively use asynchronous operations and that's for reasons of application responsiveness thread management and scalability so what what I mean is where there is an asynchronous variant of a command on the driver we typically use that instead of the synchronous variant um it does make in my opinion okay isn't maybe an old-school guy sometimes it can tend to make the code a little bit less readable the fact that I'm actually implementing a callback that's getting my results from the driver but you're definitely gonna reap some serious rewards in terms of just kind of the the scalability and the responsiveness of your application when it kind of gets that load on top of it all right they we support multiple ways of executing statements in the drivers you can just create a basic or simple statement and where you're actually constructing the string yourself I like to use prepared statements whenever possible that's actually for two reasons one is the performance benefits where we create a prepared statement and we that's basically the structure of the statement is sent off to our nodes and then all we're really sending is the values that we're plugging in so that means every time we do a query we're sending less information so that's gonna that's gonna obviously improve our performance the other reason is that it's a security measure you know I've never heard of a cql injection attack in the wild but such a thing is certainly possible and the prepared statements is really a way to kind of mitigate against that okay so I mentioned Bash is a little while ago that's a way of combining multiple insert or update statements together that's it it is gonna be a little bit less efficient if you think about how cassandra does writes you you have a particular table that you're writing in to you your gonna hash based on the partition key and that's gonna go to specific notes that are meant to hold that range and if you're doing a batch then you're actually farming that out and you're you're saying I want all these things in the batch to complete together and you're actually writing to multiple partitions in different tables which could be kind of begins to be a wider set of nodes and you're actually touching more and more than notes in your cluster to do that so there is kind of an upper limit from a performance perspective of how many writes you want to put in a batch I don't have a hard number for you just know that it's going to get worse the more you put into a batch so that a lot of people when they hear that concept of batch batch doesn't mean like a bulk data loader it really just means a way of coordinating multiple writes that you want to succeed or fail as a unit some other things there's a simple example here that basically be sparse on your writes so there if there isn't a value that you need to write don't write no as this.bottom what does because that actually creates a tombstone so I didn't do that one myself but I do know people who have time to live you should definitely take advantage of this we did actually do this a lot in the reservation system where we a lot we wrote rate and inventory data with a TTL such that it would expire basically like a day we put like a grace period of a day on it so that a day after the the rate for a particular date it would just kind of expire out of the system this is a preferred way of handling deletes in the system is actually to let Cassandra handle it through compaction there's a couple different compaction strategies that you can research it look at the time widow compaction strategy and there's deep tiered compaction strategy and I'll let you research that one about the best times to use that in the interest of time all right I'm gonna skip over the data center awareness just in the interest of time for now I'll just say that I I tend to prefer operations on the local data center just in the interest of latency if you're doing reads and writes and you're waiting for responses from other data centers that's gonna slow you down and you basically the reason you you want to let Cassandra kind of do its work in the background so next on use if you really have a case where you feel like you need strong consistency use quorum on read or write if we have a consistency level of three no of three nodes that means for quorum that the quorum out of three is is two so that means I'm going to write to two nodes and then I'm gonna read to T nodes and that that way if a write completes I'll be guaranteed that I get that value you want to read I had a case where you you want to be careful before you start to relax consistency levels I had a case where we were writing through through maybe a questionable application design we were writing a rate information to a table and then immediately reading it back out so what happened was we had a we were kind of bulk loading some data and writing into a rate table and in the interest of speed we wanted to speed things up so we went from we can we changed a quorum right to a right at consistency level one and then every once in a while we would as we did this read immediately after write we every once in a while we would get the result that the data wasn't there it was because we were writing it one and reading it quorum and every once in a while statistically speaking it happens more often than maybe you would into it but if you do the math you'll you'll figure it out and we were getting data that wasn't there because we were relaxed a consistency levels so you just want to think about these things before you begin to relax consistency I already kind of made this point but the goal is you consider whether you might be okay with just using a local quorum instead of a quorum for your use case and and it's a consistency question how immediate of a consistency do you actually need across data centers okay this is my one place where I'm gonna get opinionated and I don't like to call things out very often but people ask people ask sometimes about spring data Cassandra and I'm honest with them and say that I wouldn't use it and in fact at one point I actually a team ignored me I was in architecture role so I had authority to do this a team went ahead and implemented it against my wishes and I made them go back and rip it out and here's why so there are some practices that that this encourages basically it's trying to provide like a one-size-fits-all database API on top of things and abstract out the details the the problem is that Cassandra is not a traditional relational sequel database so there are things in the spring data API that really aren't a good fit for the way that Cassandra is architected and the number one is this example of kind of like the get all command which is a full table scan you you really shouldn't be doing that in Cassandra but then it's right there in the API so and that that's not the only example there's a few others we can kind of go into the details if you want what I would say is you picked Cassandra for a reason you picked it because you needed the scale and you made the bargain that you were willing to kind of take on those database modeling trade-offs that I spoke of earlier this is a way of trying to get the scalability benefits of Cassandra without actually doing the hard thinking of creating your data model right that's that's the argument that I would make so you're trying to shortcut something that is probably not something that you should shortcut okay I'm not an ops guy I'm not an operator I will confess that upfront but one of the challenges that that I encountered in a company that I worked out was finding people that were get adopts if you're if you're Twitter or Netflix or uber you definitely I mean you have that competency and you can afford to pay people and pay for the best some other companies it may be harder in some cases to find people and to grow that competency so some of the challenges that that we ran into was sort of the classic it worked on my test data set and some of the bad implementation choices or bad configuration choices that we made with best intentions and and fully studying the different configuration options and selecting the right compaction strategy and all these sorts of things you just you don't really know until you get to scale how some of those things are going to perform so some practices that I would recommend is do testing it as large a scale as you can possibly get to if you can use Cassandra stress to stress test your data model that's great that's gonna really help you a lot from a configuration and tuning perspective we did we went through exercises where we would kind of scramble and like this doesn't seem to be working so I'm gonna change these five things in my config file that's not really the scientific method okay so if you're changing multiple configuration values at a time that's probably you you may not actually know what you're learning at that point so you there are definitely in most cases you can change change things on one note at a time if you're trying to test out different configuration and tuning settings or you in some cases you can also create like a shadow data center and just do some testing on that where data is getting replicated to another data center and then you can kind of hammer on that and see where things go there are definitely ways of isolating what's happening so that you can use you know more of a data-driven scientific method to test out your config changes or you can outsource your ops so data sacks is offering managed services we have an offering that we have right now called managed cloud where we'll manage a cluster for you and and help with some of the things like help help you design your data model and and tuning things for you we have more offerings that are not public yet that we're working on in this cloud area so what kind of watch this space for more information about what's coming from data sacks cloud my final thing that I want to do before I wrap up is mention some ways that you can give back to the community even if you're not down in the guts of the database changing code so I've many examples of friends and acquaintances who just answer they just they're on the mailing list they're not on there every day they're not the well-known person that's answering all the questions but every once in a while something comes up that's kind of in their sweet spot or area of expertise they pop on and this is not I'm not talking about data Sox employees I'm just talking community members at large that'll go on there and answer a question so for ATO releases coming out we need some documentation review we need some testing get on and hope with these things or there's a new blog that's been developed for the Cassandra community you can get on and learn about that and write a blog post about how you're using it in your case and then I'm going to a nerve close to home here do you perceive stuff like this where the the Apache Cassandra homepage and you go to the product documentation and it over it says on under overview it says to do and then every every month or to you somebody does a tweet like this have you seen this I'm sorry if if you're here are really sorry I'm not trying to call you out maybe I should have fudged that I will think about that um this person is called I'm not trying to criticize this this person is calling out something that we need to be called out on which is that we need to get improve our documentation as a community so I encourage myself and all of you that we we can definitely even even not on just people the developers and users people that love Cassandra we can contribute to this and make this better you can also help me I am looking into the possibility of doing a third edition of the definitive guide for Cassandra kind of coinciding with the for auto-release so it's Jeffrey s carpenter on github and my Cassandra guide repo I basically just have like this page this readme are this this markdown file we're on collecting chapter by chapter improvements if you don't know the structure of the book and don't know what chapter to recommend I make a change in that's fine to you I'll take any recommendations about how to improve the book or new topics that I should include but if you want to help contribute to that and help me taco Reilly in to green lighting a third edition of the book that would be great so that's that's just another way that you could help out ok I have no idea how I'm doing on time and where we're left seven minutes that's perfect okay so I'm gonna hit a laundry list of things that you can use to help improve yourself and get smarter with Cassandra or data stacks or both of those things so data stacks Academy we definitely have course material that is based on the Cassandra open source and then you can also of course learn and get smart on all the data stacks to that I won't give you the whole catalog of courses at academy but we definitely have a lot of a lot of things available we're also doing some tweaks here and there with our Academy content if it's too heavy wait for you to try to think about getting your head around taking a whole course we're trying to move things to where it's more kind of topical based so that if you just need to drop in to the middle of course and just like you're really struggling with compaction you just want to take a unit on compaction we're trying to make that easier and more accessible to get to you so we have initiatives like this learning paths and then we have another another project that we're working on to kind of make this just better and more accessible to you from opening DSE topics weekly podcasts you knew I would have to give that a plug distributed data show comes out every Tuesday so we have our whole advocate team that participates in the production of this show actually we would love to have more folks from the community on so actually if you have an interesting use case or we'll are interested in coming on the show and talking please hit me up afterwards you you might get me as the host of your episode or you might get lucky and have Amanda Arnie that's our newest developer advocate you might get Amanda as your host either way hopefully you'd have a good time and enjoy that and are most kind of edging you thing that we're doing this live coding on Twitch we're trying to do this every Thursday afternoon jump on and do some hacking some of its on the killer video reference app and some of it's just kind of like random other stuff if you have some interest in topics that you'd like to see us hack on we we're also looking for topics for those if you see Adrienne around today Adrienne Hall is another one of our new developer advocates and he's on he's on Twitter all the time doing stuff so check out killer video and I will wrap up from now so thanks everyone appreciate you",
