from sql to nosql database just chill out with some tunes and we'll get going here in a minute [Music] love that guys [Music] and hello everybody welcome to today's workshop from sql to new sql a migration path using the power clinic app and apache cassandra on astra i am david jones gilardi a developer advocate here at datastax and i'm joined by two great minds great minds here in the world i have artem djibocco and cedric lunvon if i said your names do i ever get those am i getting them right every time or am i just totally saying this wrong no i think you are doing good and i was everyone happy to be there good thank you good to be here hello hello all right everybody let me go ahead and just let's get a thumbs up in the chats uh to make sure that you can hear us uh if you can hear us and see us and everything is okay and just wait yeah yes three heads today you get three heads hey there robbie prashan this episode yes yes awesome excellent all right so with that um let's go ahead and make us a little smaller look we're smaller now it's crazy it's crazy all right let's go ahead and get into it okay so first things first just a couple housekeeping items that we have um for one most of you are most likely watching us over on the live stream in youtube over at data sex devs um we also do have a twitch option we usually kind of reserve that for like plan b in case you know sometimes every once in a while someone maybe if they have an issue with youtube stream or something like that we can always use twitch so we can drop that twitch link in and that way you can kind of use that as a backup if you need we will use data sex astra today we'll talk more about that later everything we do here in these workshops by the way is completely free you'll never have to put in a credit card or be charged for anything um it is the patrick cassandra so for the nosql examples and such we're going to use cassandra to do some of the stuff and so that's where astra comes into play um then we have our discord server which is now 10 000 strong in the community which is awesome um so we have our discord server you see that at the link in the bottom that bitly cassandra dash workshop um now discord is good even though you can chat with us on youtube and we have all sorts of folks including ourselves we're watching the youtube chats um we're also watching discord here's the difference discord the server stays up indefinitely right so after these workshops if you want to communicate with us ask questions or whatever you can follow up on discord once we end the stream the youtube chat stops right um so just something to keep in mind uh if you want to continue the conversation and then finally there on the bottom right you see mentee.com mentee is the platform we use for lots of fun swag quizzes and survey questions and stuff we're just about to ask um so we're going to give that to you here in a moment and none of this you don't have to download anything by the way um so um we'll provide everything for you up on up online um so we do these workshops workshops weekly i just combined weekly and workshops into one word there's weak shops i'm gonna couch that as a new thing so we do these workshops every week we have a lot of new content that's coming out as a matter of fact this is the first incarnation of this particular workshop um so definitely something to subscribe to if you want to uh be able to keep up on the material that we have coming up subscribe to our channel go to datasacks.com workshops you'll see all the stuff that's upcoming um and hopefully we have content that you can learn from you like and enjoy and you'll join us again in the future okay so one of the things i mentioned briefly in the beginning you saw in like the byline right of the title of this is the the spring pet clinic app so that is an app that we're using for the basis of this discussion or at least some of it um and here here's why and cedric you probably have some things you want to talk to on this um the string pet clinic app is a reference application it is made by the folks at pivotal right it's you know it's using a bunch of the spring functionality but here's what's really cool and here's where this ties into what we're even talking about today originally that app was made for relational databases right and it was made in the type of style and such that you would use for relational databases and then eventually down the line came someone named cedric who had reworked it i don't know who that guy is just his name is cedric right who had reworked it though uh to actually use cassandra with reactive but in doing so it's not just porting it's not just changing drivers going from one database to another we're talking about a case where we're going from an sql database relational database to a nosql database right and then what does that look like so we've used that transition to kind of talk about some of the various things that you need to you need to really kind of take into account when you're doing something like this so we are using that spring clinic app and what's really cool about this as well is this is all open source stuff it's out there today i'm going to show you a little bit of this later you can go to both the repos for the jdbc app and for the nosql cassandra one and you kind of see what those look like and play with them cedric is there anything else you want to add to that oh yes so the pet clinic uh i've been around since uh 10 years it was very referenced yes the reference application for the spring team okay but the spring ecosystem you know is now so big that multiple people try to fork these reference applications to try multiple direction and there is a dedicated um community or organization in in github with multiple fork and multiple flavors of of the pet clinic so it's a spring pellet clinic community i share the link here in the youtube chat and as you're told i simply do another fork where i first moved to the reactive and the spring with flux and i had to move from the rationale model and i thought that it was not documented you know we there is no real tutorial to go from one to another uh well polished and so this is where this go uh what we did to make that happen and give some high level uh ids and process to move from one to another you know to that point as well cedric i found that even working with the original jdbc app with relational i had to do a lot of reverse engineering on the on the scheme on the model and everything like that to then be able to pull that out uh to to you know to fit it into this as well so kind of matter of fact that's almost part of the exact kind of process that someone might have to go through if they were going through an app maybe it was a legacy app or something they didn't own and if they didn't have that kind of stuff available you'd have to go through that reverse engineering process there we go i by accident went back to our video it should be us now yeah all right so uh then um be remiss if we didn't mention our badges so every week for our workshops if you complete either we'll tell you what it is at the end if you complete you know some of the hands-on from the workshops or some extra homework that we give you you can get a badge right and these badges you know they'll they'll be created for you for the specific workshop um it's kind of a badge of honor right something you can put on your linkedin or whatever um so it's just a nice way to just let you know it'll kind of give you the credit for when you've completed the work and completed the homework um you can see that we have all sorts of names that are in there from the last you know the last week's workshops and such so um if you'd like your name added to this list and you want to get yourself a badge make sure to do the homework at the very end all right so first thing let's get into media let's do mentee oh maintenance all right so again you don't have to download anything or whatever just go to menti.com i will do this you should see a qr code on your screen and a code there at the bottom left that says 8887341 so you just either go to menti.com and put that code in or use the qr code you know just scan it with your phone and we will start asking some questions oh and greetings greetings i'm i'm finally getting a chance to look at the chat here oh thank you alex yeah i saw that comment about wanting to join the data sex team yes exactly i appreciate that we are a fun team why won't we oh yeah and and arcade 007 over in discord um we can drop the links i'm happy to drop the links of the clinic repos we're not actually using i'm using it to just demonstrate things and the process it is a different repo that we're going to point you to for today just so you know all right let's see how are we like we can do it okay you got it thank you all right how are we looking on numbers okay make sure to give us a thumbs up in there i see 35 how many folks do we have on all right for the amount of folks we have on we have almost 200 folks here we go let those numbers get up just for a moment and again if you need it here is the code and i think i saw that get dropped all right let's go ahead and get into we're just going to start off by asking you a first set of questions here um we want to get to know you a little bit better we have some things we want to know and then we'll leave this open later on i'll explain so which role describes you the best yes student back-end developer front-end operator data architect some something we haven't put here yet this is the first time i see the number of things increase the number of folks that are in it but no answers yet that's interesting should i go in there myself on strike sometimes there's minty on strike yeah what's going on here let me let me go on in this i've never seen that one happen before let's see yeah no the the question is there i'm just gonna say um this and submit and see what happens i think minty's on strike yeah sometimes a hot refresh is what you need to do all right let me uh let me refresh it real quick see what happens here so everyone hang tight hang tight right baby needs to migrate their app yeah probably it cannot handle the load there we go all right i just thought we did yours yeah we did us that's that's too funny all right let me go back to what i was doing with that all right all right much better much better okay so we see interesting so we have we have a lot of back-end developers with us today a lot of student almost like a it's not quite even but a pretty like a three-way split between the architect students and back-end developers today wonderful but we have a plethora of folks all right let's see if the next one uh if it works right this time so are you using sql or no sql today yeah i wonder how many are using both honestly that's why i put that in there okay oh a lot of folks coming from uh sql which doesn't surprise me right you know both both pretty popular as well so great awesome i'm glad to see menti decided to respond that time all right excellent wonderful thank you let's move on to our next one and have you attended one of our workshops before and so for people who answer no okay so we are running this interactive workshop twice a week so on wednesday like now 12 edt for people uh focusing people living in latin in latin region and the same session uh on thursday 12 30 ist for people living in in apac region and emea um and we are there every single week we could we should call our session the weekly workshop yeah we probably should or the uh the week shop right as i said before but then why are you attending today right um especially in the whole topic from sql to nosql um we're just kind of curious this one well a lot learning to improve my skills cool nice all right so we said we do we have some folks that are working on or considering migration those are always fun projects right they'll keep you employed for a while that's for sure i guess we should you know if we if we have something else we should probably give folks a forum um to put that you know matter of fact we'll ask a question at the very end where uh we're gonna ask you you know you know elicit some feedback if you have something you want to say about the something else on that feel free to put it there and uh okay we have some managers and professors excellent or folks who asked them to all right last one and this is kind of key for the way that we do our workshops um for those of you who are new to us um you'll find that we do uh tend to do a lot of hands-on we've done both and we're curious we're curious about whether or not all of you really want to do like live hands-on as compared to just a straight up lecture or if you want that as homework or or both um it's the first time we've actually asked this question so i'm i'm really curious of the results and i love that we have this like almost perfectly even split between both options and i like hints okay that's great yeah and yeah maybe just a little bit of clarification here we saw in the previous session that people tends to drop if we give too much too much enzyme so at some point we would like to understand why so maybe we are going too fast or such so in the very end of the of the session we will ask you an open question just to say what can we improve and we would love your feedback yeah agreed agreed alrighty with that thank you everybody for answering some of our questions there leave this open right because we're gonna come back to this uh and we are gonna ask you we're gonna do a swag quiz later so make sure to leave this open for later and with that let's get in to the material so the first thing we want to do here is again use the qr code uh there that now somebody was asking for the repository earlier um so you'll see you can either use the qr code here at the bottom or if you go to uh dts x dot io sql to nosql i'll ask one of the folks to drop that down what that will do is that will drop you into this repo right this you'll see this data sex devs workshop sql to nosql migration repo that is the repo that we're going to be working off of today um that'll get you started what i'd like you all to do is go to section one here create your astra instance so i want to be very clear about something so astra um astra is our cassandra as a service serverless platform right so this is where you can spin up a fully realized cassandra database up in the cloud for free and all of that um everything that is being done here you won't be asked for a credit card or anything is completely free this is perfect to get in and if you want to say start experimenting like what we're going to do today um and you know you want to be able to play around with some of these you know sql models uh things like documentdb or graphql or you know uh cql with with cassandra and stuff this is a place to do it right so go ahead and create your ask for instance do section number one here and then once you've finished and you've um you've gotten all the way to the point where you've created a database here you'll see we'll give you the database name and keyspace name to use for today give us a thumbs up in the chat let us know that you're good to go and i will do this along with you um so go ahead and create your database and i will create one with you and then just let us know when you're done this should only take by the way maybe five minutes or something like that so yeah yeah so yeah it's not gonna be fast yeah and don't mind me as i refresh some screens all right so i'm and and again i'm just going to kind of silently do it along with you um and once you get to a point where you have a pending database then you're fine we can move on yes and during the creation process astra will ask you for a cloud provider so you can see that you can use either iws or gcp and a region so i would like to ask you today just to focus on aws and us east one because database should be spawned faster there we do have anticipated more capacity there so if you want your database to show up faster pick aws and the region u.s east one and something else to point out if you notice here um i just said a second ago that you don't have to put in a credit card and this is free so what we do the way that at the serverless works is you get a 25 credit that rolls over every month completely free right that is more than enough to run like small production workloads any of the stuff that we're doing in our workshops you'll never pay a cent right so the question comes up sometimes but wait a minute why am i seeing like you know you know uh charges here or like what look like to be charges all we're doing is we're letting you know what the provider costs um in the case that you know you were using something past that 25 credit um so you'll see if you change the providers and then you ship change a different region or whatever you'll see those costs will change so it just allows you to kind of compare um you know so you know what those costs are but again for what we're doing with that 25 credit you're never you're never going to use any of that so you don't have to worry about um using that up or you know somehow getting charged or something plus you're not putting in a credit card anyway so that's just not going to happen okay so look at that how many databases do you have wow you know you know to that point and you can see that i'm usually in here doing stuff with this um and and i still have of you know i've only spent uh you know you might you might notice that when you first create it um and again this is part of the credit i already have a 25 dollar credit so i'm not i'm not spending a thing um but um you'll notice that i've only used less than two dollars and i have all these databases and doing stuff with them but really what i want you to get to is you notice how this says pending right here right um it'll go from pendling pending to initializing to active just get to this point that's all we need is get here because that way you can follow along with the exercises and once you get here let us know oh i see uh chef chupandu and discord already has a thumbs up there thank you great and and if i'm if i'm not mistaken so first we are all creating the instance let the instance be ready go back on slides to just let that initialized and come back here to do some work yep yep and mine's already active actually you can see it already popped up so it's great yeah so we tend to say yeah yes you're going now yeah yeah yellow for now just let's create a db and you know we will switch to slide and try explaining stuff if you are the type of people that like to play with stuff you can stay there and click while listening to us yeah and jt delatto over in discord asks if i have an astro instance is it okay to just create the spring clinic key space with my own database you can but i got something better for you it used to be in a previous version of this that you were only allowed a single database and you had to then create multiple key spaces now and this is a much better option you can create as many databases as you want all of these are separate databases as compared to individual key spaces so while yes you can just add a key space if you would like you can totally do that um it might also be nicer to just create the database completely and that way if you're done with it later or if you you know you've got a database that you're already working with you don't have to pollute it if you will with the data from this so this is a much nicer feature where you can just create a number of databases as you need them okay yeah naveen um once you've got to the dashboard if you've gotten to a point where you've created your database that's it for this point all right i'm seeing some thumbs up that are starting to come in yeah great seems like you are wonderful thank all right i think i think everyone gets the idea there oh cheers yes i do like that one i like the fact that it's called no if you don't know what i'm talking about duchar and discord just gave me a a cheers icon but it's actually beer in discord that for some reason it's not cheers oh you know uh great question from ion just before uh oh hey that does not database mean under the hood so we will create a three node cassandra cluster for you this is what database mean yeah yeah there's actually a lot under the hood as far as astra goes and what's being done it's a fully managed cassandra cluster right and it's one that can a service you know like dynamically scale for you know for you if you needed it to um so it can you know scale from being a 3-0 cluster up to enterprise load and back of it if it needed to but again for what we're doing um we don't need to worry about any of that today okay all right let's get in as everyone's doing that uh yeah you can create any db uh sakshi um now i will just point out real fast that and by any dbi i assume that you mean can you have like any database name or something you you totally can i just want to point something out notice here in the repo we do give you ones to use the reasons why for this is this much easier for us if if like if you're going through the exercises and you know if you're running any trouble it's much easier for us to be able to kind of troubleshoot what's going on you can totally use whatever db name and stuff you want that's up to you if that was your question can it be connected through node.js absolutely as a matter of fact i'll just show real fast while we're here um i'm sorry i meant to go to connect you can actually use um there are a whole set of apis that you can use there's a document api for storing documents just like you might in like json documents there's a graphql api there's a rest api none of these actually need drivers to work this works right out on astra if you notice here any of the languages you'll use what's called a secure connect bundle we're going to talk about that a little bit later that is something you can actually use it's what's cool about the secure connect bundle if you're connecting and you want to connect especially securely to a cloud-based database right you want to make sure you have encryption and all that kind of deal if anyone's ever here had to deal with encryption and java right you know and having fun with ssl and all that kind of deal it's it's not always the most fun code to work on we've done all that for you the download bundle that secure connect bundle has all of that encapsulated in it and it knows where the location of your cluster is so you can then just hook up you just download the bundle and you just hook your drivers up to it or external apps or whatever um so the question is no js supported absolutely along with python java c plus plus and c sharp okay um i don't know in the golang one anyone have that one no all right no no no no no but if you're already using uh the drivers the existing drivers if they are on that's how the same and we also provide now a nice api if you like to work with simply you know rest document graphql api with tools to test the api like the swagger ui and a graphql playground it's all for developers all right okay so i see alex is answering a bunch of the questions let's get into the core content that is why we are here today okay so here is the overall agenda the first thing we want to do is talk very briefly about why switch why go from an sql relational database to something that no sql world why do that right then once we do that a little bit we want to talk about some migration approaches when you're starting down that migration path what are some of the methods that you can use to then actually perform the migration going from one to the other then we're gonna look a little bit into you know just how do you date a model in sql versus nosql right what are the differences there because there are differences um they're not huge but there are some paradigm shifts and things you need to know about then we're going to go ahead and look at the pet clinic model we're going to look at the basic physical relationship you know the physical diagram from the sql model and then we're going to start to look at how do i use what we learned in data modeling um and nosql how do we use that to then start changing over to our nosql data model um and then we're going to finish up with moving some data with ds bulk ds bulk is a free tool by the way um it is a it's a i'll call it more like a tl tool like a transform load tool um well you can extract with the two now i think about it yeah it's an etl tool you could totally pull out um but it's used with cassandra right it's used with cassandra and it allows you to not just unload and load data but you can actually transform data you can do things in bulk and everything's we're going to use that with astra to take some data over from our sql system over into nosql and we'll finish up with some resources okay so with that why switch right why switch from sql to nosql okay so this one is on me okay go for it so yeah yeah so we told you we are running this workshop uh every week and last week we we did introduction to nosql databases and here is just a reminder of the five first slides of the session it's in youtube recording but here overall so you know um with a database and you start with relational database this is what you learn first at school um you work with table all right and relational labs are very powerful because they can ensure you at the same times consistency availability and everything is super effective and easy as long as you can have your database running on a single machine then if you do have two more too too much transaction per second i i would put or need a lot a lot of space to store your data at some point you cannot add cpu or a disk to your machine that do not scale up anymore you need to split the data among multiple machines so your system becomes a distributed system it's not that easy some rational database tends to be and tends to allow the capacity to split on multiple machines but um it's not effective it could be slow and the limit of the rationale base is as long as it's fit on a single machine it's super effective when when it does not well you need to think if other solution can help you so move to the next line okay so this is exactly what i stated at some point you will reach the limit of the rational database it could be single machine even if it's on multiple machine at some point because the way the relational database distributes the data among the node is not effective you will get slower and slower and this is why the not only sql database so no sql databases to stay short has come into play to cope with those new requirements those i've been thinking as distributed system for day one and they are built to cope with the new uh requirement requirement in volume so the capacity of velocity the throughput and also the variety you know that you do not want to store in your database tables only tables only raw data anymore you may want to store json binary and this is what we call the variety of the data so you may have heard about the 3v of the big data volume velocity variety those also apply to the nosql databases so those sql system are designed by web giant most of the time here you see logo from google facebook linkedin they all invited or provided paper research to create those nosql databases in a nosql databases because it's a distributed system there is a famous theorem called the caption or stating that you cannot achieve at the same time consistency availability and network partition which is you can lose the network between nodes and depending on the flavor of nosql database you will pick you will be more focused on availability or more focus on consistency but you cannot achieve everything at the same time and those are the dna of the no secret databases already awesome so hopefully it gives you an idea right like why you might do that now we're gonna as we go through this discussion we're gonna talk to more of those examples as well but yeah all about all about you know performance scale resiliency all the you know at some point relational databases just aren't going to scale um quite the same way and they don't have some of the same capabilities so now we want to move over to a couple of approaches here now i said three migration approaches i really meant 42 application we're just we're just going to step through one at a time totally kidding i don't mean that no so so no really sometimes when you're kind of going through these migrations right it can feel if if anyone here has ever played one of these slide puzzle games i'm sure they're still around i remember them as a kid right like these were totally popular but the idea is you didn't really get from point a to point b in one go right uh you have to really reason out the order of operations you might not always get the right order all the time you have to kind of go back and everything our goal here today is kind of help you get to the smiley face on this one um and understand that you know this whole process when you're going through migration right is is going to be kind of step wise it's it's there is not an exact absolute path or pattern and there are multiple options and and what we're really here to do is just kind of explore some of those all right so with that our tim let me i'm ready are you ready to go our turn yes all right so right bring it over to you and if you could just full screen yourself and artem is going to go over these uh these these different approaches yes and david and i are ready for your question yes the floor is yours okay so the problem definition will start with little bit understanding of the problem first so in ideal world you have some applications that are running on relational database and if they're running well there are no issues with them then there is no need to migrate right so uh it's the case when you have either scalability issues such as you have so many transactions that your database cannot process them so the response time is suffering and you cannot just create more and more replicas of the same data to serve those reads and and then it also can be very expensive right if you if you're going to use uh a vendor like you know a few of them it can be very expensive and another reason why you may want to migrate for global applications uh cassandra is really good for to be able to have different data centers in different parts of the world and they replicate data automatically and they serve only applications in that specific geographical location so it's it's very easy to set up to have this set up and availability in that case uh maybe a great reason why you want to immigrate even if you don't have a lot of data just to have that availability and and geographical distribution could be a great thing so um we have some issues with our uh sql applications and we decide to migrate so how do we do that in ideal world we take the whole application rewrite it parts of it essentially we will talk about which part of parts of it we also migrate our schema our data and we we happy with our new application however in the real world that's not something that you will be usually you will be able to do because a relational database can contains hundreds of tables and there will be a lot of different applications using those tables and those applications may be running different business functions or features right so if you start migrating the whole application what can happen it may take a lot of time and and during that time application requirements data requirements may change so the the application and and relational database uh evolve and your migration actually has to pick up that evolution so it becomes too complex it it's it's not gonna be a realistic approach so realistic approach is you take a small piece of a larger application and you will be able to take one for example one feature one business function that only uses let's say 10 20 50 tables in relational database and hopefully less than 50 right and you will be able to migrate it in a reasonable time and this is what we are gonna focus on so when we say we migrating a business function what do we really mean uh most likely business logic is not going to change right so for this f3 the business business logic doesn't have to change in rare cases it may because there are certain features in relational database that do not map exactly to no sql database so for example asset transactions so maybe you have to do things a little bit differently in some cases so but most of the time what will change is data access you will have to make microservices services related to data access so your data access objects will change they will have now to now will have to interact with cassandra and also you will have to of course migrate the data persistence layer which is uh schema and tables okay how do we migrate those things specifically we will talk a little bit later but in general this is what we need to do and in general there are three approaches to approaches we can actually use different tooling and all of that but we are going to talk about these three approaches the first one if is offline migration and i really like this approach because it's simple and it's the safest out of all because you can basically turn off your old system do the migration uh and and there's less chance that that things that you're going to lose data for example and things like that so you you have your time and it may work in some cases and may not work in some cases right so many applications you cannot have any downtime so in that case we will we will look at the second approach zero downtime but some applications may be okay like if you if you think just recently with cruise ships they all have some kind of systems that collecting information on cruise ships but now there are no cruises uh and they have a lot of time they had a lot of time to actually do offline migrations if they needed to right yeah yeah it's true it's a good time to do it if any right yeah they can't use the wall yes yes if you have if you have an opportunity to use the offline it's going to be simpler and safer but we will talk about zero downtime with shadowy rights as well and um this is probably the most recommended one and the second and the third one will be minimal downtime i will explain why it's minimal with dual reads and and this one has uh fewer use cases but i just wanted to um uh be able to discuss it so let's look at i just wanted to point out real quick uh sorry i attended that alex and youtube is saying offline migration is simple but boring well sometimes boring is good right yeah right yeah [Laughter] so what do we have here for the offline migration we have our old function running everything is good we start cassandra cluster on the side parallel to it so usually when you're doing doing migration the first step you need to migrate data model and maybe start creating the uh replicate your data into cassandra from sql but grading data model is not an easy step that's probably the most challenging one out of all and we are going to focus after we we talk about these approaches david is going to focus on how that schema implication happens the second step you you can migrate the function data access objects maybe you you will change architecture a bit modernize your your application have microservices there and things like that this function of course once you've migrated model once you immigrated function you do the testing there right it's not necessarily that you you're not using so right right now we're showing off the function off meaning that it's not serving real users yeah the real applications yet but you of course doing testing at the time then you can turn off the old one in this case both of the functions are off so this is offline time and at that point what you want to do is to extract transfer and load basically migrate all the data from sql to cassandra or another no sql database so why while they're all there are not any rights there is no possibility to lose any data so uh basically very simple approach to do and we will talk about atl as well after you've done etl you can start the new function and if you test it everything correctly that everything is sh is supposed to work okay and you will be able to serve [Music] real reads and writes from from the real application that was the the first approach now the second one when we want to have zero downtime if we want to have zero downtime we will have to run both functions the old one and u simultaneously in parallel and for a while and maybe test test very well before we decide to actually completely switch completely shut down the old function so we're again starting with the same uh set up we migrate data model this is again the first step and we migrate function after that okay nothing special here but what happens then is we will start using the new function as if it's we already completed the migration so we actually allowing rights from the real application to reach both sql database both relational database and no sql cassandra database so we are doing dual rights or we are doing shadow rights so basically there will have to be some kind of proxy that is going to send data to a relational database and the same data too will be shadowed to cassandra so at this point we are heavily testing rights saying that okay our tables our data model actually was designed correctly we are not having very large partitions they are not suffering there is no for example tombstone issues there are no compaction issues and all of that if we find any problem right if we find that we made a mistake we can always switch back to the original solution to the relational one because we also have complete replica of data there right so we we did all the writes into our relational database so we can always tune in this test and we can always fall back if we need to okay and so that's why i just pointed out yeah yeah sorry something to just point out here as well that in the example that we're giving we're talking about esquivel cassandra right but this the process that our tom artem is talking to would hold true for any of the other um no sql databases or any you know doing this kind of migration right so it again the example here is cassandra but it's not only cassandra that you could do this with so i just wanted to make that clarification that's right a lot of the cassandra part will most likely be the when we start digging into migrating migrating data model migrating data and all of that that will be very specific to cassandra so we're testing those rights we're happy with them at that point we move our data move historical data right here when we started testing our rights we basically added only recent data right and the sql database had all data recent and historical so here the third step take the historical data and move it to cassandra then after that you keep running both functions at the same time and you test it's make sure okay the performance is as you expected right so again if there is any problem you always can fall back to the sql solution because uh the sql solution has the complete copy of data your old function is running so you're running them in parallel for a while and c make sure that everything is good once you are ready you can turn off replace your old solution with the new one okay and there is a third approach minimal uh downtime the reason it's gonna be minimal downtime is we're not gonna run two things in parallel it's just an example here um but there there could be some provisions made to make it close to zero downtime but that's not our focus here the interesting part of this approach is you will actually do dual reads you will run both relational database and and cassandra at the the same time with probably with possibly no plans to turn off relational solution completely or relational database completely and i will i will explain the use cases as well so let's see how this approach works okay we are going to migrate migrate data again data model again so it's always the first step the second step we are going to migrate function and the third step so again i will go back my grade function but the third step what happens is we using our new function to do the rights remember we didn't move any historical data we're doing rights now to cassandra but the historical data is still in relational database so when we're doing reads we have to read from both cassandra and relational so that seems like like like a complex thing to do you will need some kind of proxy for that but the reason you're gonna do that there are certain use cases when you may decide that this is a viable solution for example the historical data that you have in relational database is not that important you actually reading it infrequently so there is maybe no point to move your data to to do the etl and spend your resources on that storing that data in cassandra oh there may be a situation where when that specific data uses some relational features that are not available in cassandra and it may not be very easy to implement them in your application or something like that or it may be the case that you already prepaid your service cloud sql database service and you want to keep using that while well while you have the resources to use up so this is this approach is not the common approach but i just wanted to make sure that you're aware that this is something that is possible as well okay and once you're ready you etl the historical data from uh relational database to cassandra and basically you switch the relational you turn up relational database you turn off the feature or at least the tables that are related to that feature you no longer need them in your relational database and use the new function and cassandra so what you have seen there in those approaches some common things you you always have to migrate data model right that's probably the most challenging part you always have to migrate function or some of some of your code right you always have to migrate data okay and uh some of the so we're gonna focus today we're gonna focus mostly on my grade and data model but uh my grading function would be again the business logic is unlikely to change what will what you will need to focus is on those data access objects maybe microservices modernize your architecture but at the end of the day you will need to implement way or you will need to implement api to read data write data so those crowd operations that that that we know of the the insert select uh update and delete right and therefore migrating data we did use uh shadow traffic so in microservices space you you would use some kind of proxies uh for that and and service mesh uh for etl of course you you will use available utilities to export data from relational database to import it into cassandra we are going to use ds bulk for example today but also for really large data sets you may use spark and and spark and connect to both relational and cassandra and can do transformations there so it's going to be another option and of course there are many more options including maybe using a kafka and or using pulsar or spark streaming to basically move your data into a pop sub system first and then move it to tundra too that you know right now uh you know for this particular workshop and i'm i'm actually going to pose this question to all of you right and maybe this is something in the very end um when we ask you for maybe other topics or whatever you want to see um what you're looking at this is a big topic actually um doing a a single two-hour workshop on how to do a migration like this right um is honestly not something i think you can cover perfectly in two hours um so you know it's one of those things where we're looking on you know should we do follow-on topics where we dig a little bit deeper get some you know give some like real world examples like where we can actually look through and walk through those types of things um so that's a question i'm going to pose back to all of you there because there is there's a whole world here you know artem artem was just talking about things like spark and kafka and pulsar right and getting into streaming tech we could have multiple workshops on that alone right etl tools you know going through that whole process so so definitely something to point out and if all of you would like to see more on this later and further topics on this then definitely let us know yeah sorry tim yeah uh i'm all i'm basically done there are some questions there and the comments like business project does not change for uh it may change right for if the original application was not designed correctly right if the business logic was mixed with um data with data access functions functionality then yeah you may have to break that into pieces and design it the right way so that was one comment [Music] we which software to use for the migration so uh the details of the for example migrating schema is we're gonna start looking at those there is no uh a tool that you can just okay click a few buttons there point to relational point to point to cassandra it's going to work right it's it's much more complex because primarily because the data model in relational is so different from data model in cassandra but you will see that uh shortly so david back to you all righty all right i think we caught up on questions and everything um so so with that so artem you know just kind of presented some very high level overall approaches like different methodology that you could use um to actually perform a migration itself right so what i'd like to move into now is oh let me by the way share back over to you guys there we go so what i'd like to move into now is now going through um and kind of comparing a little bit how you data model and sql uh versus nosql and then looking at you know from the nosql standpoint at least when we're talking about tabular approaches um with with cassandra i'll talk a little bit later on about like document and stuff like that um then what is that flow look like how is that different from what you might do in the sql world all right so if you take things from the relational sql world um many of you if you've come from that you've already been doing it you're potentially familiar with normalization things like third normal forms you know it is a process that we use uh to essentially you know reduce data integrity i'm sorry increase data integrity reduce data redundancy is what i meant to say you know where it's really born from a time when relational databases were created when disc platters were huge things for like you know a couple megabytes of data they were very expensive they were very slow um things had to be optimized for that world and since that time technology has grown you know significantly right and disc disc is no longer so expensive it's actually quite fast you can get a ton of it compared to almost any other commodity like memory cpu or whatever um much cheaper much more cheaply than we used to be able to now the point of this is that normalization was born out of a a different time right so data redundancy was kind of a big deal you didn't have much you didn't have much space to deal with not only that discs weren't very fast right so you really couldn't rely on io or anything like that to get your data and what this translates into though is a case like you see here this example where in the relational world with sql when i'm doing my data model right i'm going to model again to reduce my daily redundancy so what do i mean by that take a look at these two tables i have employees and i have departments right so let's say that i have a set of employees and i want to find out um what department an individual employee is in well if you take a look at that department's table for each one of those departments i'm just going to have a single row i'm not going to have any repeats right those are going to be single instances for like the engineering department or the math department or something like that and then i'm going to use a foreign key to kind of make that relationship between okay if i'm looking at edgar codd there that top employee which department is edgar a part of now there are some pros with this uh you know as far as using normalization methods i mentioned data integrity rights are actually pretty darn simple the cons though over time um and this especially is true for anybody who's ever had to optimize like a a nested uh sql query that's 20 joins deep right at points you can end up with some extremely complex queries and things can get pretty slow now we move to denormalization so denormalization pretty much being the opposite of normalization where now we're going to flatten out our data right we're actually going to put it into a single structure so notice what's happened here notice the employee table is how i've added department and that's added right there into the data structure right i don't have a separate table that i'm joining to or something like that and notice also that both edgar khan and raymond boyce are both in engineering but i just repeat the data now what's the point of this well the pro here a big pro is speed is speed at read and most if not all of the nosql databases that i have in mind a lot of them were born out of some of the barriers that we had with relational databases and scalability and such so a lot of them have been optimized to be able to be very fast and continue to scale and cassandra is one of those so cassandra makes an optimization on read it wants to be able to read as fast as possible at uh at scale it's the same thing you might do in a relational database if you're doing data warehousing or something like that um it's it's all about optimizing it reads right so you see here i'm repeating the data this is what i was getting at when i was talking about disks and stuff where in the relational sense i'm going to reduce the amount of data redundancy i have but in the case here i'm actually doing the opposite i'm actually going to use more disk to get faster reads because now i can get all the information i want in one read when i read that edgar cod row there are some cons though right now if i denormalize i may have multiple rights i have to perform i don't have the same kind of integrity constraints that i do in a relational database so there's there's you know things you have to take into account from that standpoint up from a query standpoint though your reads because there are no joins are very very simple okay so overall the approach in relational data modeling you're going to start with your data you're going to apply your normalization right to that and you're going to use that to generate your your schema your data model and then from an application developer standpoint from the programmer standpoint or the person interacting with that then we reference that very schema right you know the or the erd the entity relationship diagram or whatever we referenced that to then determine oh okay based off of these questions that my application is asking what queries do i need to form what tables do i need to join that kind of thing now here's the paradigm shift when you're doing this in something like cassandra you flip this on its head right so you start with your application workflows you start there and use that to generate your data model and i'm talking actually generate your tables your queries and everything from your application workflows and then you apply your data right so it's a different flip or it's a different approach to doing this um one the developer from the application standpoint comes in kind of at the end the other one we start it off really is what it comes down to okay so this is the way yes this is the way that we're going to do this here and let's take a look so here's the actual process of kind of the overall process of going through using your entity relationships your entity diagrams and your application workflows so i'm going to start both with my conceptual data model like an application workflow move that to map out a logical my logical data model optimize that into my physical data model we're going to do it in a couple steps and you'll literally start from an application workflow and work down to generating your queries and tables why we're showing this to you is because then when we start to map from sql to nosql you're going to start to see where this comes into play okay first thing here this is just an example coming from a youtube like app if you will um so if you imagine in an app like that you're gonna have videos you're gonna have users users can comment on those videos and such and so maybe if i wanna look at a video i'm gonna see the comments for those videos or whatever and you see that there's this relationship and this is a regular conceptual diagram right this is this is something that we've been doing in application development for a long time relational it's no different here in this world where i have these entities i have user and videos they have a relationship between comments and each of them are going to have a set of attributes on them now i'll take that and then i want to look at some application workflow use cases right and by application workflow what i mean by that is this could be something that you're just talking about like how a user may flow through your app i mean this could literally be a kind of a workflow you're writing out on a napkin or something like that and you're using that to kind of generate you know what does that workflow look like so in one case using the example i gave with videos and such you have a case where maybe a user is opening up their profile right on a site and you want to find all the comments that are related to that target user using its identifier some some user id or something like that in the second case here you open up a video page so i'm going to look at a video and i want to find all the comments that are related to that video using its identifier usually you know some video id or something and notice both of them say this most recent first right this just means that i want to order the comments time based because if i have comments come in a random order they're probably not going to make much sense from a conversational standpoint okay so here's my first use cases and then some workflows all right so then i'm going to come up with a pseudo query so in the first case i'm going to say okay i want to find some comments posted for a user with some known id and in this what i'm really saying is i want to find comments by user i'm going to partition by user i'm going to find them by user um so that's where you see i have the pseudo table to the right this comments by user in the second case i want to find some comments for a video with a known id probably like i said it's video id so i want to get comments by a video right and now from here i can actually generate in in this sense in this tabular cassandra sense within a sql database i can i can now start to generate my queries without without already having my my data model in place and the reason why is again there's no joins it's query per table design um and since i know that i want to get comments by user my query is really simple select the comments you know for you know whatever the columns are from comments by user where the user id is some id that's it it's really just that kind of simple it's the same thing with comments by video where i'm going to just go ahead select from the comments by video i want all the comments by a particular video where a video id is some id so then i can start to take this and i can use that to generate a logical data model this is where i'm going to start to make the relationships now something i really want to point out here notice those letters notice you see a k and a c and stuff like that so k means a partition key means i'm going to partition by this and then c is clustering column it just means i'm ordering how i'm ordering right the key thing to know is that those columns that are labeled with k and c those form my primary key this is how i'm going to uniquely identify a row right similar to a primary key in a relational database it's just different under the hood so what i'm starting to do is i'm using these so those pseudo queries that we talked about a second ago we already started to identify oh okay well i know that i want to find comments by a user id or by a video id and i want them in time-based order so that's what we're doing here we're i'm in the first case in the comments by user i'm going to partition by the user id and then i'm going to start ordering by date and everything that you see there with the k the c and the c i'm going to make a unique row with the rest of it's just my payload right so i'm just going to have the comments it's the same thing for the comments by video the only difference is i'm partitioning by video id instead and again a key difference here comparing how i might have done this in sql is notice i'm repeating a lot of the fields i'm going to have repeat data in two different tables and in this fashion it's totally okay to do that but that's not something i'll probably do in the sql world then when i'm translating to a physical data model all i'm really doing is now i'm adding in my types right no i'm saying okay for an id i'm going to use something like a uuid um in the relational world a lot of times for for ids right we use an int you know we auto increment an int every time something comes in in the distributed no sql world right especially for something like this we tend to use uuids why because in especially for distributed databases um if i have multiple nodes that are all trying to add a user at the same time and they're going to generate an id at the same time what happens if two of those nodes can't talk for some reason and i'm using an int and i auto i increment it and both of them try to create a user at you know id one i'm going to have a collision when they can talk again uuids generally will guarantee i don't have those kind of collisions so that's one difference again coming over and we're going to see this later coming over from how i might do things in sql to no sql in this case is just a slight difference in maybe how i'm going to use ids and such and then finally i can take those tables and i can actually generate my ddl statements right now this if you're coming from sql this should look really familiar um cql which which is using cassandra is a subset of sql it the syntax is almost identical there are some differences in commands and such but generally this should look very familiar where i'm going to say i'm going to create some table here are my fields and my types and then i'm going to set my primary key and in this case in both these cases i said i was going to um i'm gonna key by user id and video id okay so this is the general way right this is just the overall approach to this cedric do you have anything you want to add yeah maybe yeah i was i was about to ask you just just a sec um so if you look at the the workflow just like before on the top right hand corner what you need to understand is really that moving from a rational to no sql you cannot do it only with the table you also need what are the queries that would be what we need to perform because this is based on the queries that you will design the destination table okay so what you will do is create uh the destination table with the same attributes fitting the expected queries so yeah if you look at the rational uh schema it's not enough to tell what the nosql would be yeah yeah totally okay all right so let's see all right so let's go ahead and how are we on questions and everything are we okay from that standpoint um yes we we are okay we do a tricky question like super high level question not easy to understand to transfer in a couple of sentences but you know we are doing great okay okay awesome you know something i want to point out by the way real quick um let me blow this up a little bit so in the next whoops wrong button wrong button there we go so one thing i did is you know going back to the pet clinic app and what we're doing there is that big enough to read can you guys see that okay hopefully you can um this is just a really simple is it isn't he a little bit bigger okay no no now we're good okay cool um so one thing uh as part of this process and this is what we're just about to get into and i just want to show you this real quick i have here you know i've got a very simple setup where i have the pet clinic jdbc that's running in a mysql database here locally um i've taken some of the c data that they put in here and use that to generate you know just exported out a simple csv and this is just a very very simple case of something we're going to talk about here in a second um and so what we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to just move this over right but we're not just copying from the sql database over into cassandra there are some differences here right so let's go ahead and take a look at what those are and that's this whole next section here with migrating your data model okay so let's start with the owners now what i should do is let me pull back for a second by the way something cool about pet clinic here you can actually go and you see this live demo if you go to spring clinic.github.io they have this live demo button in here and you can actually see what it's doing so let's go ahead and just show you what this thing does okay so it's a pretty simple app honestly um you know you've got a set of owners i don't have any owners in here so i'm going to go ahead and add someone and we'll put and somewhere orlando and eight six seven five three oh nine all right so i add some owner and you know this by the way these are these application more clothes right this is exactly [Music] so some background noise from uh someone having a slap fight it sounds like a slap fight so so you know so i'm gonna you know you're gonna have a set of owners right and maybe that owner has a pet and funny enough i do have some they're right here next to me so one of them is shocker and who cares and is a dog and i'm gonna add the pet right and then maybe i'll add another one and i actually have another i have two greyhounds karaba there we go and again i'll just pick some date and there you go right all right so already we're starting to see some of the application workflow in play right um so i find an owner and then i get a set of owner information i add a pet and then i have information per that pet right and then right here in my interface i'm presented with all of that in one shot right so something to keep in mind when you're going from from sql over to your nosql system how what kind of questions am i asking here from the application and what we're doing in nosql all right so let's take a look at then how might you go about this let's see my slide's going to respond here all right i can't seem to move my slides forward i've never seen that one before oh geez no focus focus there it goes all right i think i have too many things running on here and my poor machine is just like now all right here geez there we go wow that was uh this is what i was looking for okay it came back okay so as you just saw a second ago right i went through this case where i go to the owners and you know in one case maybe i want to find all of the owners right so in this case you can see i have this both heather jones giller and dave gillard i want to find all the owners from a use case what's the use case okay a user opens the all page the owner all page and the workflow is extremely simple it's just list all the owners so here is the schema from the sql implementation right here's the schema from the sql implementation and what i really want to focus on is the owners over here um so the owners is very simple right it's just a simple list of owners and their properties um so we have a set of properties that go along with this owner things like their first name last name their address city telephone and then we have some id that is going to uniquely represent that owner right again from the sql world this isn't rocket science this is this is pretty much as simple as it gets so now we want to start translating that over to our our cassandra table in this case right so this is where we're going to our nosql database so in this clay in this case notice that it looks almost the same the difference so if you remember what i was talking about a minute ago is that i have an id just like i do in sql one but that is set to a uuid not an int this is what i was alluding to earlier and again in something like a distributed system i want to make sure my my ids aren't going to have any collisions or anything so we tend to use uuids instead of integers for stuff like that and again the k denotes that it's a partition we're saying this is part of my primary key similar to what we actually had in the sql tables this one's pretty darn straightforward right um and one read here in this particular case similar to what would happen to sql would actually get me all the information right since in the sql case i didn't have any joins or anything like that okay now let's go one level deeper we're going to owner details right and this is where if i click on one of the owners now i get a set of details for that owner um so you see their owner information but really the details we're after are things like their pets and such right so i get all those pets and their visits so what's the user the use case again it's the user opens an owner detail page on the workflow i'm going to find that owner and any pets that are related to the target owner using whatever identifier it is now here we get a little bit more interesting right now i have this relationship between owner and pets i have this one-to-many relationship between owner and pets you see here from again our schema from the sql world and you can see over in pet there um that we have this foreign key this owner id that's what's giving me that connection back to the owner back to the owner id and then the pets have their own attributes so what might this look like then when we go over to our sql database here um so this is a little bit more interesting because okay great we are still keyed off of owner id right and if you notice the name and the table that pet by owner so i want to get all pets by an owner so that part hasn't changed but notice though now we have what's called a clustering column we've added in pet id here in this table now this is collapsed we went from having two tables with a one to many relationship where we joined those tables to now having a single table so how did this work well for every owner i can now since i've made pet id a clustering column like this um i'm essentially going to store i can have multiple rows that's what's what we would call a multi-role partition i can have multiple rows in that single owner and the key thing when when you're using something like sandra where you want to maintain your read performance at scale is you want to have the fewest amount of you know i o hits as possible so when i make a read i want to get all the data i need for a particular query so for any particular owner like this because i can i have multiple rows i can have multiple pets per owner i can make one read and i can pull that out all in one shot right where in the sql sense i would have two different tables and i would join between them right and so there's just a difference in you know what that looks like in performance or what it can look like especially as you get you know multiple tables into it okay so what are some other options though right um one other option here is you could make a make those owner field static right um so i didn't do that in the first case if i go back um if i go back here i had i actually had two separate tables let me go back right here i had an owner table and then i had a pet by owner table so this other potential right is it just flatten it all out even more right so instead of having two different uh denormalized tables i could have a single table um where i just include all the information by static by the way that means for a particular owner um that that information for any owner partition um you know you could have i could have a thousand rows in that table and um it's just an optimization each one of those columns will only ever be listed once in the partition so you're using a lot less space because they're not going to be repeated it's the same owner but that's another way you could do it you could do this so now in a single read i could get all of the information about my owners and pets and everything okay how are we doing on questions and stuff uh we are good i feel you went very fast on the static keyword what it is so yeah so i put some more explanation in the chat but you know it's all about the normalizing the normalizing the normalization and as far you know how much how far you want to go with the denomination do you want to normalize a single relation one too many or even more one too many too many you know the more you then analyze the more you will duplicate the data sometime is good and you do have the static keyword to help you reduce the the verbosity when there are a lot of duplicates but you know i think the default is really the one too many so take one relationship and they normalize once and only and only if you eat some issues with performance you would like to demo they normalize even more or you do have a dedicated screen like here and you want to retrieve everything in a single uh call and that's a really good point that you just made their cedric about the performance piece in a case like a pet clinic app am i going to have millions or billions of pets per particular owner or anything like that or no right you're probably going to have a handful and maybe dozens at the worst so in this case having a case where you're not fully flattened out into a single denormalized table for everything you know from a performance standpoint you probably don't need to worry about it but if you had an app that would say much larger right and you had a lot more data to work with and such you may want to denormalize even more okay so now in this next section if we look at again our application workflow um you see that we we have this one owner per a set of pets we also have visits though so how might i go about this right i want to bring in visits now again if you look at our use case here it's it's the same kind of use case and workflows we saw before but now we're finding pets in any visits that are related to the target pet right so we kind of have this nested relationship between them again here is our schema from sql and you can see that we have this relationship between pet and visit and honestly it's really it's all together it's going to be between owner pet and visit and pet type for that matter right so there's a little bit more going on with this one it's the same kind of relationship we're going through the same kind of process right but when i want to represent this this again this other one-to-many relationship between pet and visit um you'll see that i did the same kind of thing where now i wanna i have a denormalized table where i'm saying okay for um uh for each visit i want to see my visits by pet right visits by pet so i'm going to key i have my partition key set off a pet um and then again i set i'm making a multi-role partition by using a clustering column for visits so that means i can have n number of visits per a given pet um and then that kind of sets up that same kind of one to many i've one pet id per n number of visits here but what are some other options that we could use as we talked about in a minute ago you could take all of these tables and denormalize them into one table you could totally do that right and you'd use you know i could actually say for a particular owner i have a whole set of visits or a whole set of pets and visits for a particular owner i can flatten the whole thing out this means what this translates into from a performance standpoint especially performance at scale standpoint is that i could perform a single read at that owner id get that single partition and i would return back the whole relationship that i was representing in these four joined tables from the sql standpoint another option i could just store these as a document we haven't really talked about this yet right um you know there are there are plenty of other uh document databases and such out there um cassandra matter of fact astra now through stargates the stargate's an open source project that actually exposes a whole set of apis things like a document api uh rest graphql such like that um i know that's been cep against uh apache cassandra the open source one so matter of fact you can use stargate today on a docker image it's all open and free and stuff like that the point being is that you could you could just take this whole structure you could just store it in a document right store in a json blob and then just store that and retrieve that however you need as well okay so then just kind of and yeah yeah i wouldn't be surprised if in the uh repo we shared in the beginning there is already a version with this document-oriented schema yeah you mean clinic in general or yeah the pet clinic in general using another db documentary i wouldn't be surprised to find that in the repo yeah yeah and i think a lot of it just depends on um it depends on what your needs are right and and what you're trying to do um something like this again you could you could totally store this in a document format all right and then just kind of overall comparing um the the models here um where you know again here's the original diagram from sql and then just this is just this flattened version of it really this is a denormalized version of what you saw before um that works we didn't talk about um we're gonna kind of we're not gonna get into every single one of the the examples here um one thing i do want to point out and i know cedric you probably have something to say about this is um a case of something like uh this pet clinic vet or for our vets where if you go back to the sql version we have this many-to-many relationship that's been set up this relationship between specialties vets and this join table between them because vets can have you know multiple specialties and specialties can an individual's specialty can have multiple vets kind of thing and the way that that was handled here was by using what's called a collection right that's what this is so for a particular vet i actually have a collection um where i can just re i can just store all of those specialties and again i get that single read and i can then just retrieve a set of specialties for any particular vet and i can go back the other way right i can also go back the other way um in this particular case we chose that for a given specialty i can then have because this would create multiple rows here using this clustering column i could then have multiple vets per specialty so it's one way that we represented that same kind of many many relationship but again it's not through a join table there's no joins that kind of thing i don't know cedric is there anything else you want to say on that one no i'm not good i i do have questions coming from partition key clustering key you know the regular one so that's going down spot yeah that's where by the way this workshop if if some of those types of things that you're curious about because i know that we're talking about some components of cassandra you may not be familiar with then i highly recommend if you check out last week's uh repo in the last week's workshop uh the introduction there on that one you'll get a primer on on all the stuff so i would say that that's probably a good one we need to reference uh we do have a good question from t for me uh golovk how to find honor by part of his name because this is a use case in the app you can totally find the owner based on the last name and look at the pet clinic owner table id is the partition key not last name so how how it is possible and it's a good spot so in some cases if you know that you know for a single last name you won't have a lot of ids this is what we called low cardinality use case you can create on the table what we call secondary indexes and then a last name because uh becomes something you can query on it will be a lit it will be slower that query by id but still because the cardinality is is low it's still acceptable but hey i do have a side close to me uh just an expert on that modeling so maybe you can complete my answer oh it's a good answer uh the other question i've seen was about partition size what does it so once we denormalized four tables four relational tables into one cassandra table uh what is the size of that partition and what is the duplication like in that partition so if you can go david if you can go back to the that example oh which example you looking for where you have the four tables relational tables you normalize into a single one oh okay yeah this one yeah yeah this one this one so um so so how do you analyze the the partition size so partition is defined by the owner id right so it's a uh the partition key and now you need to basically count or estimate the number of rows um an owner with a large number of pets and visits for example uh an owner in the in in the extreme case may have 10 pets right so and then each pet will have to visit clinic like every month so let's say for simplicity 10 times a year right so every year you will generate uh for each path you will have 10 records for the visit so for 10 pets you will have 100 records overall so this partition for this owner each year it will add 100 rows so it's a small partition right so the if if you assume that the uh the owner will have that going on for 10 years then you multiply it by 10 again you have 1000 rows in that partition it's a small partition there is no nothing to worry about in terms of duplication we are not duplicating uh owner owner information here right because it they are static columns all all thousand rows will only store that value once so the the static value column is shared by all the rows in the partition uh for the pad id we have the for the for the pads we will have to duplicate for all thousand rows for example we will duplicate the path birth date and pad name and pad type but then visit data visit date and visit description will not be duplicated right so we um we only have to deal with duplication of pet name pad birth date and pet type but that's usually for this example it's not a problem at all because pet name is unlikely to change pet type will not change and pet birth date will not change right so there will be no problems updating those values and things like that cool all right thank you our time alrighty let's move on and go to the next spot here now at this point your astro databases should be well up and running um i would not imagine any of them aren't so if we go back yeah i would be really surprised so this next spot here um you're just going to go ahead and very quickly create the data model here so this is section 2 in our repo to create the pet clinic nosql model um so you'll go ahead and execute this and you'll end up with that same that same structure that you just saw over here this is what we're essentially creating you're gonna notice some of you who are asking some of the questions too about um i you know what cedric was talking about you'll find that there are some indexes and such that are in play especially if you're going to try to search on fields that are outside of your primary key or whatever there are some use cases for them right um and you'll see that those are in place so again we're going to go to the number two crate pet clinic new sql data model and by the way i should point out that today getpod apparently pushed out a major update and um hopefully this is all gonna work smoothly um but uh not yet but pretty soon uh at some point when we get down here later you'll you'll find a spot where um we'll use git pod and we'll see how that goes today hopefully that goes okay okay can you show again where did you click to open this git pod i think you were oh that's not until that's not until um uh later down into section four this is actually getting more of the homework part yeah um this is the more the homework part we're going to take the last part and i guess i'll just go over over this real fast so this next part creates the data model right then you're going to essentially um grab the data that we exported out of sql that was the data that i was talking about here and you're going to then transform and load that into the new data model and so yeah that's down here but that's that's a homework spot got it all right so did load that's good yay all right how are we doing on questions and everything so far so good question we are good we are doing good yeah look good all right all right so we'll give everyone a moment just to to get through section two there it shouldn't take too long really and then i'm gonna do along with you actually i need to reconnect up my my piece over here actually so let me do that don't copy my stuff my credentials that are on the screen now that's right yeah i need to i need to do that real fast and again once you get through section two give us a thumbs up let us know that you're good to go now what i'm doing by the way is not related to what you guys are doing um i'm doing something as part of something i'm going to show you here so if you're like what is he doing where am i supposed to be doing this now you you so david we do have question regarding the service account creation so maybe you can show people how to do so yeah the ui evolved probably yeah so when you're in your astra ui okay um you'll see this little piece over here with this current organization right so if you come in here and you can go to manager now i already have an organization in play so i don't have a new one there but you would actually come in you can actually add in maybe i should just go to a brand new account i could do that yeah you could you would come in here and you would have a button it's a button i don't have because i already have one so you you don't happen to have a um no you know how about i just create one that doesn't exist let's see here's my brave i need this one instead i remember the password i used you know i'll just delete this one it should have oh yeah if somebody's going down to that spot yeah yes you should yeah i believe with the service account um i did and provide a doc link if you go over to your organizations you should already have one so i'm wondering if somebody is not seeing that like right here in the top left hand corner you should already have this part where you can go to your organization settings it should be at a minimum you should have your user that you registered with you go to security settings when you click on the ellipsis over here you always copy credentials that's where i'm getting that from okay so you don't have to create one maybe you can simply reuse the one there right yeah yeah because that one that one that i just showed you was a legacy one that that that came over i didn't have to actively create that um yes so if you can yeah if you can show even on github i do have some also some questions with git pod error like no such file or directory when they copy uh some db id but i think that's interesting yeah let me go ahead and do that yes this is a full yeah i mean the full service account that you copy right yes so if you went a little further which is totally fine right and if you're down here creating the service account and doing all that and if you spun up the gitpod piece it's going to automatically run a little script i have in there right and it says right here let me blow this up so you can actually see it okay and it says paste your you know it says if you don't already have a service account uh then create one and then paste your service account credentials here so this is what i'm talking about when in astra if you go to the drop down that i was just looking at so i clicked on my name there i went to the account and then you see security settings and this is in there this is in the repo if i click on the ellipsis i can say copy credentials okay and i just i just go back and i just paste those now it says paste your database id here right now what i want to do is i'm going to come back to my dashboard okay show my databases i click on the one that i'm working with so this is the one that we created for this workshop based off the repo i say copy my cluster id now i'm going to go ahead i'm going to paste that in and then right there it actually went and downloaded my secure connect bundle and everything um so that that did what it needed to i don't know hmm i see jt dilato i see his yeah yeah so nune over in discord when you receive the message no such file or directory when you paste that db into it did you did you go through that same process that you just saw me do um where you pasted in the server's account along with the dbid um but i need a new cluster and for jt uh delado let me see if i can get you an answer on that one i'll ask the team okay now another way you can do this by the way this is the long way of doing it but you can totally do it this way go into your if for some reason that script isn't working for you when you go to the database that we created if you say connect pick any of the drivers it doesn't matter you see this download bundle oh oh that's good to know jay okay i wonder jt delatto if that's part of it i would say to go ahead and create a new database along with us um and see if that changes it for you because if it was months ago that may have it may be one of the legacy or classic databases because there has been a lot moving on the astra front um so i would definitely go and create another one um so if you go to again to connect and you go to connect using a driver any one of them will work you'll see this download bundle so what you can do is you right click don't click on it it'll download it to your local machine if you right click on it say copy link address okay and then if i say curl dash capital l i'm using double quotes i'm going to put this in double quotes and i'm going to redirect this out to astra reds.zip then that will get you your your secure connect bundle as well and that should work just fine right so the only difference between what i just did and the uh the script that's in there is the script just does it through the devops api i don't know if i had a bug in it or something but you can always always just go and download it directly okay i see it kenneth yeah i see that yep okay let me see if i can get an answer as far as what is going on with that part as far as the not being able to get the service account right and then from there then the last part if you're actually going through and i'll just go ahead and do this so you can see it um you want to generate your application token if we're going to go forward with this part there are instructions on how to actually do that um if i'm in here if i'm in the astra console if i go to settings right you see i have a whole set of them already i can actually you wanna an application token allows you to connect securely through your apps uh and everything and it and you set these up and you get this kind of one-time token i mean you download it once you can use it all over the place right you can use it for multiple applications you can use it for external tools or whatnot so what i'll do is i'll say just to make it easy select like an admin user generate my token and then you're going to get this information i'll download a csv file here and then at that point right once i move away from this screen then i'm not going to see that anymore but i have my my downloaded information and i'm going to put that off screen so you'll see i still i have this new token now and i did download it so i can go pick that up all right now i'm not actually going to show you those because that's actually my real token but what's going to happen is then i can use the information so later on when you follow the instructions it's going to bring you to running this ds bulk script right and it says place paste your client id here i'm actually going to grab now this is in that file i just generated i'm going to paste this in do this over here real fast those are my actual real credentials and this is all uh put in the instructions as well all right let me pull this back over and what that'll do at that moment is it's going to be i'm just getting my here we go okay so what that does is when you run and again i'm following the instructions that are in the repo after you generate your application token um you pass in your client id and your client secret from the file you download uh and then that will run ds bulk for you and you can see it actually runs uh you know it essentially takes this csv file and it converts it over into what we need and then we'll store that into the database so if i go over to my console here use spring my tables and my owner table and there now i've got a set of data right so this data is the same data that came over the difference if you notice in my id i've actually generated a uuid on the fly i did that with ds bulk so that's actually in the script that we provide i actually have the whole command in there there we go you can see the command where we're actually generating the uid and so on and so forth so hopefully for those of you i apologize for those who are having some issue with some of the uh tokens and everything um we can follow up with that to see what's going on there i don't know if something uh is missing in the instructions or or the ui change or whatever so i again i apologize for that but hopefully here you can see you can still go through like a manual process if you need to to do all of this and you can do it right through the ui and and just download things as well alrighty let's see oh totally rk double 07 you can use a previous existing token um and it's actually one of the cool features of the tokens that once you have them right then you can use them kind of moving forward and you can even use them across databases and everything it's just that authentication layer right so you can totally reuse it yeah you can load without ds bulk um there is there are some other tools out there there's this um there's an upload piece in here you could load through your application um you know if you already have an api if you're talking to the application you could load through rest so if you went to connect here you see there's a rest api actually any of these but you could actually load up you could load data if you know how to use rest and you're familiar with that you can actually load data that way but i would say ds bulk is the tool for this kind of thing um if you are looking to take sets of csv files and stuff and you want to load them into cassandra ds bulk is the tool for that i don't know artem or cedric if you have anything else that you guys use ds bulk is really what i could do for that that's right unless you have so much data that uh you want to parallelize the process and you go to some uh distributed framework like spark okay i think i think at this point let's see we've got we've got just 13 minutes left right and the good thing is that the rest of what's in here is actually for homework anyway um so i think we should probably move over to the mentee and get our swag quiz going what do you guys think we need some time to do the swag anyway swag is most important yes yes so let's come back over to mendy and let's see does everybody see the mentee all right let's get our swag quiz going all right we'll let folks get in here uh ravi over in in youtube asks a really nice question here what are the most common and critical issues that we will face during migration you know one of the things and our time kind of talked about this when he looked at when he was talking about some of the overall methods that you can use um and and you know that one particular case with like dual rights or the shadow rights and actually he our time you talked about this in every one of the cases where you're not going to get the data model and everything absolutely perfect and right on the first time it's just it's not going to happen right especially as you start testing for performance and scale and ensuring things that are working the way you expect and everything so i would say that is you know that's where doing something especially if you're going to try to do like a no downtime migration doing something like shadow rights makes a lot of sense because you always always have your source system in place still there and working you haven't just flipped the switch and said okay we have to just deal with it now so you always want to ensure that you you have room to make mistakes and that you're not setting yourself up where once you flip over you have no other choice now um so i would say definitely um probably not getting your data model right the first time and it's going to take multiple iterations centric and our time you guys have anything you want to add to that no no no i i'm in front of mentee waiting to win some swag you know oh yeah then you're going to answer the question all right so we have folks in all right let's do the mentee i want to win some swag all right so first one you simply copy your sql schema over to a nosql database yes okay this one speed question let's see what happens here yeah the correct answer is no yeah you don't you don't ever want to simply copy your sql schema over to a nosql database you really need to take a look at your data model your application workflows what you're trying to do there and what makes sense in that nosql standpoint matter of fact you can't join anyway so you're not going to be able to just copy those tables directly over it's not going to be a good experience all right so let's look at our leaderboard by the way speed does matter speed and correctness yeah please donate x y zero yeah yeah please donuts right that's funny all right so mars is the fastest and in the top spot there with johnny and ribbit and let's see what happens in the next question question two four shadow rights are used to ensure safety during a no downtime migration increase right through a put for faster migration be all shadowy and stuff all right so the correct one there is to ensure safety during a no downtime migration you don't really get any increased right through output all you're really doing is splitting the rights and you're going to the original the legacy source system and you know your no new sql database at the same time right so it doesn't have anything to do with thorough but what it does do is ensure that during that process this goes back to the question um that was just asked by ravi um you know about most common critical issues if anything goes wrong during the process if you're writing out to your nosql system and you find that oh no this data model doesn't work or something like that you still have the source system it's still being written to your applications still talk to it and everything so you're you're not at this position where you're just stuck and now you have you know late nights at two in the morning trying to figure it out or something like that you're totally good right so it's about safety during a no downtime migration okay so mars is still at the top there with rivet and then martin wow mars is fastest in both these who's mars did i see kirsten in there i think i saw kirsten in there all right question three of four when migrating a data model from relational cassandra to come up with a cassandra table schema you need to take into account the relational database schema application access patterns both of those or just copy the relational schema over and that may have been a little tricky the correct answer was both you need to take into account both the relational schema and your application access patterns right and you look at you you have to analyze both of those as you're creating your new uh table schema for cassandra all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like oh we got ribbit sorry ribbit all right so mars is still keeping the lead right there that this is the first time i've seen someone be fastest every time in a row so far can someone knock mars out no offense mars but all right last one it's for all the marbles what are the advantages of the offline migration approach everything works once it's back online it's an error free migration simplicity and safety there's no need for etl we never need to bring that legacy database up again it's about simplicity and safety yeah that's that's the offline approach is the simplest of all of them um it is technically the safest as well the the the con there though right is that you have to ensure that when you do it that you can you can transition over in one fell swoop um so you know your systems can be offline the whole time but it is by far the simplest and definitely one of the safer ways to do it all right so let's see who who is our winner now the top three get swag oh so mars took it mars just owned this one uh so mars congratulations at being on the top there uh jt and martin uh you all all three of you are swag winners so make sure to take a picture take a screenshot of your win because you will need that to submit to jack and jack will probably um um jack will probably be dropped there he goes he's dropping some links and make sure to submit that to jack so you can get your swag all right and before we do this okay so we've only got about five minutes left um real quick i mean we just talked about the ds bulk piece that is actually part of the homework for those who want to do it um so let's go ahead and talk about some of the resources now on this page is a whole set of information right if you're not familiar with awesome cassandra you should really check that out going moving from from you know going to cassandra from relational there are multiple posts there that are in that tag there that anchor that cassandra from relational one there's some really good stuff there there are um some there's a nice blog on best practices from migrating from a relational data platform to apache cassandra um there are we don't usually include this kind of stuff but there are some free on-demand webinars that are in there as well but they're really useful and informational and that's why i put them in there so i just want to be upfront that they are you know they're on demand webinars you have to put like an email address or something but it is really good information as always if you want to learn more about cassandra and get in deeper with that then there's academy.datastacks.com everything there is always free there is the deus ex dot com slash dev that's actually going to be in part of the homework um that has a lot of embedded learnings where you can use something called catacota it'll actually spin up cassandra for you you can do data modeling and stuff right there um community.datastacks.com is like the stack overflow for cassandra uh so if you have you know more technical questions or longer form questions that's a really a great place to go and then finally our youtube channel the data sex developers youtube channel we have new workshops coming out every week you subscribe there you'll get notified and you'll be aware of the things that are coming um here's the homework right so if you just complete it's really about completing um the the hands-on portion uh to get the nosql or to get the ds bulk load into your database and then to just show us that you've got it in there there's some other content there you see that try it out that tried out cassandra data modeling that'll get into a lot more detail about some of the things we talked about in the data modeling here today so and then it'll let you do it at your own pace and gets into it a little bit deeper as well there are certifications as well so one of the things that jack is going to drop is another a form that in this form you can either do one of two things one you could choose to get vouchers those are 145 each normally but these are free you just have to fill out that form to get them and these will give you two attempts one voucher will give you two tries at any of the cassandra certifications out there um so that's that's nice on its own the other one if you paste in your dbid a matter of fact the ones you created today you can just paste that right in then you can get yourself a 300 astro credit so again that 25 rolling monthly one that we give you is enough to be that's essentially free um for any kind of the stuff that we're doing like this you're never gonna go beyond that um but if you did get to a point where you were doing more in astra then you can use that 300 credit either one is up to you and like i said we do our weekly workshops uh join our discord community um there's the link up top there we have 10 000 folks that are in the discord community today and that is a good place you can go to kind of continue the conversation with us uh and everything and with that thank you uh cedric our tim do you guys have anything else that you want to end with today no no no no no i'm all good um like the content today uh for the homeworks you know we will make sure to double check all the steps about the service account and if you cannot make it work we will switch with something else that is easy to do yeah yeah so for those of you who are interested in doing the homework um we'll we'll get right back to that and and see what's going on there um and uh as cedric said if if if that's not gonna work that way we'll we'll get in new steps we'll make sure something happens so you can get your badges exactly and anyway we will be there uh in 12 hours to replay the session yeah right that would work so yeah totally we would make that happen all right well with that thank you artem thank you cedric and thank you everybody for joining us today and we will see you next week hopefully all right take care thank you everyone bye and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she could multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to",
