to cassandra for developers uh to our workshop and um we will you know i've seen some questions already come in actually on discord and youtube with regarding is this for beginners yes yes this content is totally for beginners back to back today yeah back to basics so if you were brand new to cassandra you were in the right place and i did see another question that came up um we will have a github we'll share that with you we're going to do some hands-on along with um the stuff that cedric and i are going to talk about now first things just to start here boom there we go just some housekeeping items oh i lost there cedric sorry cedric i made you disappear but now you're back um just some just some housekeeping items yeah um so first thing if you if you see we're already this is going to be a fun session i can tell already but um if you start up in that top left-hand corner there where you see courses at that youtube.com datasexdevs many of you are probably watching us there right now um so that is one place that you can take a look there's also our twitch stream so why don't we go ahead and pop that let's drop that real quick into the chats here is for twitch i'm going to drop that down just in case so you know we kind of use twitch as our backup if you will um maybe some people prefer it so if for some reason if anyone ever has a problem um with the stream or anything like that feel free to go over to twitch if youtube's given you any kind of issue we stream to both right then on the right oh go ahead cedric sorry for emergency because we are actively tracking questions on your youtube chat and we are not active on twitch so which is really a backup plan okay yeah totally yeah twitch is definitely like the the backup plan like cedric said so on the right hand side you'll see that run time right that's data sex astra so i did see some questions do you need to install cassandra for this today no why because we're going to use astra so astra and we'll talk about this more later it is our cassandra as a service in the cloud we can spin up your free database within a couple minutes we're going to do that today so you don't need to install anything everything that you're going to do today you could technically just do right up on the web on the bottom left-hand corner you'll see for questions you'll see that bitly link to bitly cassandra dash workshop that's our discord channel some of you are already there with us in the discord channel i would um really encourage those of you who are on youtube to join us on discord right we're going to watch the youtube chat we're going to be chatting with you on both here's the big difference on youtube when the stream ends the chat ends and that communication with us stops where in discord that persists right um we've got i think about like 7 500 people now in our discord channel for cassandra so oh is it more oh it's way more now oh we're up to 9k now okay wow wow i'm outdated all right so so we've got we've got a pretty big community there in discord and what's cool about the discord channel is not only can you ask longer form questions the youtube chat's a little bit limited but then if you need to talk to us any other time we're there right so you can always reach out at any time so we really encourage you to check that out and then last but not least on the lower right hand corner you're going to see mentee.com i'll show you a screen for that in a second we're going to use menti both for some questions we're going to ask you in the very beginning at the very end just to kind of get to know you better and everything but then we're going to have a swag quiz right so pay attention because you're going to be quizzed on the stuff we're going to go over today and our top three winners will win some swag right so that's that's kind of important really swag is cool all right so we will go into the mentee speaking you know speaking of swag i will i will say it loud today oh yeah uh for the people who will be the ten thousands on the discord swat box for you as well let's go let's roll oh yeah there you go all right center just let's go up the ante up the ante all right so i did mention astr a moment ago um so what is csx astra it is a fully managed cassandra without the op so if if you're especially for developer i mean astro wasn't only made for developers but it definitely had developers in mind astra is really the way that you can spin up in a couple minutes a fully fledged cassandra database whether you're talking about what we're going to do today with the free tier which is free forever or if you're talking like enterprise class stuff right so we're going to use this today it is extremely easy to spin up a database and just get going you don't have to worry about installing it you don't have to worry about managing it that's all being handled for you um the free tier is a five gig free tier forever um it does have you know global scale and no operations and all that again we're not the whole session today isn't like a you know a marketing thing about astra or anything like that so we're not going to get into all the details but we will be using it and again we'll be using that free tier that five gig free tier all right cedric i'll give it over to cedric and cedric is gonna bring you through um essentially the cassandra fundamentals so this is the part uh if you don't know uh cassandra already we're gonna start okay so first question what is apache cassandra well cassandra is a distributed nosql database so every single word is important it's no sequel so it changed from oracle mysql you might already have used we will explain how and it's distributed so you can install cassandra on the single machine on the single node so full installation on the node and inside this machine you can do about two to three terabytes for the capacity and multiple thousands operation per second itself the node is already huge you know that's thousands and thousands of requests per second on the single machine but the power of cassandra is really all about distributing and so you will install cassandra on multiple nodes multiple machines in each node communicate to each other in a peer-to-peer way there is no master this is what we call master less and the way they communicate it's called go sipping all right so first pictures to understand cassandra have multiple nodes those nodes can be grouped as data center or ring we will use the term ring today maybe just to avoid any confusion confusion with infrastructure stuff and so this is the reason why the discord is called uh fellowship of the rings okay yeah well we're a bunch of nerds over here you know we are it's a it's a fellowship and it's about gasoline for the rings i mean all right so um go to next slide so what can you do with cassandra you might have heard cassandra about doing big data doing some high availability doing some geographical distribution and customer is used when you need to write a lot of data per second or read a lot of data per second and it's open source so this is what you can read on the website i want you as a developer to understand why we say that customer is good for that and this is what i will show you in the next slide so go next okay in cassandra you will store tables all right in a table you will design a column that we that you will call the partition key here in the in this sample the partition key is in red and see it's a country you might immediately notice that the partition key is not a primary key because it's not unique in the in the table see okay and now if we show you how the data is stored in the ring this is what this is what it looked like so david can you move on boom the data is distributed based on the value of the partition key you will group together rows with the same partition key value okay and just something to point out about that grouping this isn't something you're doing manually right when you and we'll talk about this later when you create your tables when you set your partition key all of this grouping that you're seeing is being done by cassandra itself right so it's not something you have to actively do or anything this will be done and we'll explain more exactly true but immediately you might understand that if you want to do select star from a table retrieve all the records from a table without anywhere close it's a bad idea in cassandra because now then you need to go and check every single node to get part of the data and so the query will be slow what you want to do with customer is always provide a where clause and in the where clause you will provide the value in red here the partition key with the partition key you go immediately to the proper node and retrieve all the value associated with this partition key you you store together what you want to read together so we do have a question that i think is really relevant to answer right now from disha over in youtube now alex already answered it but i wonder if there's some other folks that are thinking the same thing diesha says here a u and uh i n are in the same node they are different partitioned keys right no so yeah even different partitions can be stored on a single node any given node will actually store many partitions right so that there's no issue with that what we're really pointing out though is that any rows that are using the same partition will be stored together so that's why you see the example on top with usa or the french or german or france or germany you'll notice that those are together but you can totally have a node that has you know thousands and thousands of partitions that are on the same node um and so then uh sudarshan followed up with so data is scattered across nodes yes it is distributed across the nodes yeah so nodes and data is distributed in cassandra and this is a tradeoff if you want to store petabytes of data i didn't give you any numbers but big company like apple instagram huawei have clusters of cassandra with dozen dozens of thousands of nodes so we know as a fact that cassandra is running 175 k cassandra nodes uh not all part of the same cluster the same ring but that's still a lot this database is designed to answer to get real-time result even if you saw petabytes of data and so the trade-off is split the data among nodes and read the data only accessing a single node now i do just so you know i do see a set of questions i see uh from ceptin and to pendu and i think uh submit and stuff on youtube and um discord questions about well are there like backups of partitions on other nodes and um you know you know like some of the ways that you optimize how do you know what to choose and stuff we i think we should move forward we're going to answer all that stuff with all the upcoming material so if for some reason we don't answer one of those questions definitely hit us up but i'm pretty sure from what i just saw we're gonna and we're gonna address all that stuff exactly yeah we it's coming and if if we miss something uh keep asking and alex or i will answer okay so the partition key in cassandra is ash using hashing algorithm and the value as a partition key is actually a a number it's stored as an integer somewhere in cassandra and those numbers are called tokens and so if you understand the way the data is distributed among the nodes each node is in charge of a range of token and this is why we put some small number 0 17 33 50 67 that mean the tokens from 0 to 17 should be on the 16th would be on first node 17 to 32 should be on second node 33 to 49 should be on the third node and so forth and so on and so the distribution computation of the token and where the data should be for each partition key value it's all done by cassandra you don't have to to care about that it's it's it's a way to cast on her under that and you know if for some reason you add a new node in the ring the token will be redistributed and the data that need to be moved will be moved for you you don't have to not have to worry about that okay so you got it data is distributed based on the partition key now the data is also replicated you will define something called a replication factor or f it's telling how much how many times the data is replicated so a refigel 3 means the data lives on three nodes the same data leave on three nodes so the data itself is replicated okay moving on so how does it work well i think you can move on with the animation oh you want that one there you guys yes here you are um so you just you just have a row you want to insert so at the driver level you don't have to care the partition key will be hashed and you will get your token and here the token is 59 well you can ask any of the node to write or read 59 so i pick any of the node here the node is the one with 17 and the the guy will say oh but 59 it's not it's not in my range you know it's not between 17 and 32 i need to send these data to the guys in charge of this replica and this is [Music] these three notes so first there is a main replica uh in you know in charge of the 59 and also the three the three other one uh that will get the copy one of the arrow is not really accurate i think we should put one at least one in the 50 node i guess so the data is replicated three times and see boom we ask three replica to save this value okay with that we told you the data is distributed the data is replicated in multiple nodes and in the very beginning i also told you there is no master you know in a distributed architecture sometimes you do have a master and slave and if you lose the master everything's fall apart well in cassandra absolutely no master so no master data is replicated well if you move forward david that means that if you lose any of the node it's not a big deal at all cassandra will keep answering 59 is still there the data is still available on two node and c for some reason now you ask for 59 to any of the node well we will ask the two remaining nodes what is the value and it's transparent no you know people using the database won't even notice that one node is down so let's say we ask 17 to bring 59 17 ask three nodes and one of the node is down so um 17 detect that this node is down and we'll save a local copy of the value and it's called int and when the node come back online well 17 will give him everything that he may have missed and the database is self healing because now with the when the node goes back it brings it gets all the data he may have missed and it will be in sync with the other replica and just to add to that a little bit so going off of some of the questions that i saw coming youtube earlier about backups on nodes so backups are a different thing right but generally speaking when you're using the standard of a replication factor of three as cedric explained you're gonna have three copies of that data across three different nodes right so as far as like do you need a backup if you have an outage or something not really because in the case of cassandra you've got three copies of that data and in the illustration here we just showed a case where it was just one node that was down you could have in certain configurations two nodes two thirds of your capability being down and you could still facilitate the request still get the data still write the data and as he explained when those nodes come back up they'll automatically get healed and get and get the latest data right so it it kind of changes the game for like backups and what you mean by backups because because of its distributed nature and the fact that data is replicated in this way you kind of don't need backups for the same reason you might have like you know a disk dies or something because you've got that on the other nodes exactly and as uh even ask even ask on the youtube chat so yes the data or the hint will be saved locally oh yeah from ivan get get the request yes and there is a delay so by default it's two hours uh if after two hours the node is not back it's considered to be lost and you will bring a new uh node a new fresh node in the cluster and they will redistribute the token you know you don't have to care customize only that for you yeah and i do see one quick follow-up by sharker in discord can you replicate a cluster or ring i'm assuming what you mean as a data center totally we're going to talk about that later and some exactly honestly yeah it's like one of the coolest features um so once as as we move on it's just in a couple slides here okay yes so now very important to to understand when you when you ask for a value to cassandra that now you know that the data is available on three nodes if the replication factor is three and so you ask to write the data in the three replica you know you ask at the same time but now how much time do you want your client to wait until you can acknowledge him okay your data has been saved to cassandra you're good to go do you want to have a single node to get the data the majority of the node this is what we called a chrome or you really want all the nodes to have the value uh before you get your acknowledgements so these three behaviors is what you can define at the request level in each request you will define what we called a consistency level consistency level one when you write you only need one note to get the value and acknowledge consistency column you want the majority of the node and so two over three and this is the reason why you want your replication factor to be odd not even no it's because having a even you know if you put some replication factor four to get the majority of the node you need three replica to answer and it will be slower slower so three is the recommended uh replication factor sometimes five but you really need your data to be at risk and you know maybe you will lose multiple nodes at the same time but three it's a good trade-off between security uh your system will be always up and not replicated too much your data even if in a single node you can have up to you know more than two terabytes of data okay so now with this um consistency you might say oh oh well wait wait so you tell me you write a data let's say consistency level one so only one node acknowledge you i have been updated the two others will be updated but a few milliseconds later and if for some reason at the same time another client wants to read the same value and you also provide consistency level one and bad luck he did not pick the same replica but another one you will get an older value so what you want to do is write with chrome and read with cob that way you are sure that when you read among the majority of the node you contact at least one of those will have the latest value and in cassandra the last right always win and so at the client level at the driver's level he will compare the value and only pick the latest and give you the latest and so to ensure what we call immediate consistency you simply have to say write cohob and read core but it's all depend on your use case sometimes your iot use case internet of things and you want your system to write very very fast so you don't want to wait two notes to to acknowledge you to to keep going you will say only consistency level one and that's totally okay because you will only read the values a couple of hours later or through a dashboard and it's not a millisecond response time totally good to go yes so as even stated the way to go is really the replication fact the consistency level to write which is corrob two of three please the consistency level to read corrupt two other three two plus two is four it's greater than the replication factor you're good to go yeah and i even nailed it i've been nailed it in youtube i don't know if that's what you were responding to um cedric but uh he was asking you know the right consistency level plus the reconsistency levels greater than rf is a valid way to think about consistency totally you nail it exactly yeah this is what i yeah exactly what i want to say that's totally the way to go okay so we had a question about replication factor among multiple rings and that's one of the strengths of kashmir okay when you define uh what we call a key space which is like a schema you will say i want my key space to live on this data this ring or this ring or this one for each one you will say what is the replication factor and with this uh configuration now you can read and write from everywhere this is what hoover's using for instance you get a ride in the usa take your plane you write your uh you cassandra will write your rights information in the ring in the usa and it will be automatically replicated to europe and when you landed you pick your app uber everything is updated and now you targeting the ring in europe because this guy is closer to you and so any company that is globally distributed around the world would like to be able to read and write from everywhere and this is at the database level that it's replicated so this is true for geographical distribution you can totally think the same about where to install the node so now if i tell you i install a ring on adws i am stuttering on google cloud i installed a ring on azure and i made those ring part of the same cluster well all of a sudden you do have a single data layer novender lock-in remember patch cassandra is open source and you can have your app on any cloud interacting with the same data and it's replicated for you okay and it's also true for on-premise so your app also live on premise and you can have a dedicated ring on your um infrastructures and it will be copy to the cloud so no more lift and shift or etl yeah no manual file copy none of that yeah okay all right so now if we bring back why cassandra is good so first it's all about the scalability we told you on a node thousands of operations per second and two terabytes of data well one strength of customer is the linear scalability you need more power you need more requests per second we need more capacity you simply add new nodes and so this workload is fit very well for i through put high volume you know uh you keep having more and more volumes so you need to add more and more nodes that's something you can totally do with cassandra easily and it's always the same cost adding node and your new node whereas if you're not using a distributed database well you will scale up until you run out of money but you know in cassandra you can keep going with adding small new nodes and it's horizontal scaling so every read every right and so first range of use cases uh internet of things log analytics time series even streaming and the reason why is the reason is because you can write very fast and you know you can have millions of sensor information per second second big strength of cassandra it's availability remember you can lose any of the node you know happens this week we got some slowness on aws three weeks ago it was gc google just crashing on on most of the services um and you know at some point things fail and so with the customer way of thinking you know that you do have three replicas of your data you can lose any of the node it's not a big deal so this fit very well the mission critical the one that you cannot afford any data loss and you must be always on and for those i mean most customer-facing use case will match but caching is good because you can cache and have the the same data available outlook all across the world and people can access the data very fast because the node is close to them but you know anything like pricing inventory market data uh time and uh time and tracking you know we do have a lot a huge big customer doing uh track and trace using customers okay a third is distributed so i think and i think we explained that pretty pretty heavily you can do uh distributed all across the world distributed around multi multi-cloud oh but also what about gdpr and compliance with low even if you live in gen in germany for instance you know that you need your data to uh be in germany well with kassandra you can simply create a ring in germany and say oh anything that will be related to this use case we live in this key space and it will be only available in this ring in germany it's really simple at that inside a cassandra cluster you can have multiple key space and in each key space you will say where the data should live and how much time should the data be replicated so banking uh any regulation back to tracking and logistic retail customer experience but that value for security reason as well and last but not least cassandra is cloud native so the idea is because the one cassandra node is a small instance it's pretty easy to make its scale okay it fits very well the hybrid cloud multicloud approach as we just showed you and you will see in a minute in the software as a service offer using cassandra we implement some api layer for you to ease the usage because the data is replicated around the world and you can have the api close to the data it will be much much faster to consume right and everything is cloud native so we don't have dedicated use case for that but cloud native is eating the world in 2021s all right i think uh we're done for the theory and now we have times for you to get your hands dirty all right so i'm going to drop a link here and now by the way i saw a whole set of questions come in on both youtube and discord we're not ignoring you it just takes us a moment sometimes when we're in the middle of this to get to all of them um so i'm gonna drop the first link for the github um i'm doing that now this is for all of you to follow along with and you should see that link in both youtube and discord so what we want to do here now you're going to notice i just kind of go over the the format of this and how it works real quick so we do develop all of our workshops to be self-service there's always this self-service component to it and that's what you're seeing in the github repo that i just dropped so as you scroll down here you know we're not going to go through and read all this stuff to let you do that on your own but you'll see that we have a whole set you know different sections number one create your astra instance two create a table and three execute crud for this moment we're going to focus on the create your astra instance this will get you started with creating your astra your astro database your cassandra as a service database and the free tier that's a key thing is the free tier um and that'll be free forever you know no credit cards or anything or whatever are needed there and this will get your your database up and going but once you've completed this section if you get to create a table stop if you really want to go on go ahead but you're going to find that the theory that we're going to talk about is going to go hand in hand with the next section and such so what i'm asking you to do right now is just take a couple minutes go through create your astra instance here um and then while you're all doing that we're gonna answer some of these questions uh in the chat so go ahead and take i'll bring up a timer actually oh no i hope there we go my uh mike i don't know if you saw that but my computer is deciding to be interesting today um so hopefully hopefully we're not yeah hopefully we're not going to have any issues with this today i'm a little scared to go to any kind of new site or something right now um yeah because it's for some reason it's really uh maybe cedric you might you might want to get your screen ready just in case i'm always ready for you davey oh thank you i appreciate that all right so let's go ahead and we'll start this timer and kind of blow this up a little bit and again just go through that first section um the create your astra instance and then i will go through it after just as a quick review okay so did we have copy the link to the repo okay in youtube chat done on discord you should do the same so now we want you to go to um where you can follow all the instructions to create your cassandra instance and from that we will do a couple of exercises okay so you share the link on this code i did yes the link and thank you for sharing it again yep okay sharker apparently already did it all earlier great all right and let's see so i did see a set of questions come in i see that alex has been answering a bunch of them but there are some that i've always addressed so one that's just fun uh for uh prefu in um discord um what is the footprint of cassandra can it work in a raspberry pi you know funny enough it can i actually have a whole cluster of raspberry pies below my desk i have like nine of them uh that i use now would i ever recommend doing it that way for a real cluster that you want to use in production not really that's getting at the low end i mean you want at least the raspberry pi's at least the versions that i have they only have a gig of ram that's too low right um so but you can make it work if you really wanted to you can um so so you could you could go that low but again that would be a toy that's not something i'd really use um you can pretty much install it just about anywhere it is definitely definitely suitable for iot applications no doubt there at all um let's see uh i did see that jack was answering some questions about the difference between open source apache cassandra and and data sex enterprise or what some people call data cassandra essentially data sex enterprise is everything that's in open source and then we add on things like advanced workloads like search capability analytics with spark graph graph is a big one there there's enhanced security um there's more speed you know so it's just stuff that it's added on top of it that enhances open source apache cassandra but it is based off of that very open source um cassandra okay i see a bunch of people are done already with doing the uh yes and you know i see ben ben bulton uh telling us that uh why can i use only uh google cloud and that's only for the free tiers yes um you know because it's the ship the cheaper uh it's the cheapest for us to run some notes for you it's free for you it's free for you not for us yeah uh and so but yeah if you if you put your credit card in there uh to get some paid db you can use any of the cloud and you can do some vpc peering from the cloud you know for more uh intermediate to advanced level folks here you may already have some application running in the cloud in your own vpc and you simply want to access the database from there and to do so just avoiding your communication to go through the wlan so the wired internet you can open a peering vpc peering and now those the application can access the db in astra yeah and i did see um i saw a question is what is the difference between a database and a key space in cassandra we will address that in the section coming up so i'm gonna wait on that one um one thing to definitely point out i haven't seen anybody um say this but ensure that you are choosing the free plan here not the serverless beta okay not this free one this is something different we want the top one here that says free um and then as far as the pro pro cloud provider goes when you were using the free tier only as cedric just said only google cloud is available if you use the other tiers the other ones will become available right and that's based off of what cedric was just talking about you know it's it's a free tier so we're providing it for free but it still costs us something to do yes yes yes and we use the free free not the free server serverless is still better it should work but yeah don't use that yet that's not what we're doing today so you know exactly um and then the region just select the one closest to you um i'm in the east coast of the americas apparently there we go um so i'm going to use us east and once you've chosen all those you should have this configure database button i'm going to pick that now in the repo itself as i scroll down here now to be clear we provided values for you um let me blow this up just a little bit more there we go we provided values for you we have to ask that you use them it makes things a lot easier uh because then later on um as uh we're all going through the exercises and such together if you do something you'll find that the follow-on exercises are based off of using like the killer video key space and such if you don't use it it's not that big of a deal just know that some of the instructions for you later might be a little different so just take note of whatever you use but i can just fill these values out right so we've given you what the database name the key space name the username and the password can be once you have filled those out you should see your create database button light up go ahead and click on that and then it will start to create your database the free free yeah the free free i think that's the new thing we can call it that now from now on cedric's yeah free free free free free free all right and then you'll see this oh go ahead now you know you so i we got the question what's the what's the difference then if both are free and you know what what's the difference uh really it's all about uh internals so in in the the way that the servers are deployed under the hood in serverless we want to track queries to be able to do proper use whereas in the free free it's purple node and that's a way for us to to reduce the cost for you this week i mean this year but it's still better so you know because it's free free as of now keep it free free all right and then once you have created your database you should see something or it seems like a lot of you already did this so that's wonderful but you should see something that looks like this where you have the database you'll see the status you may have noticed mine changed from pending to active a moment ago and then i'm going to click on that and we'll get into the actual database information right now at this point we're not really doing much here we're going to be doing the actual doing right in the next part with create a table so as long as you've gotten to this part even if your status is still pending that's fine if you're here this is where you need to be and with that we can move on all right all right any questions we need to catch up on here um oh i see you're answering okay you got one there cedric yeah yeah yeah i'm yeah just asking some that just should that i should answer alive and so so as of today as of now i'm good i'm good i think we're right all right let's go ahead and then move on to the next section all right so in this next session we're going to go into the data modeling aspects right um so especially for those of you who are coming from the relational world there are a lot of similarities but there are some definite differences right i think this first section is probably going to feel very familiar as we start to talk about partitions that's where it starts to deviate a little bit from what you do in relational but the cool thing is a lot of it cassandra's doing for you right and this gets into that part where we talk about the partition key and such so we'll get into that so just going down to basics though right the first thing that we need to at least understand we're on the same page is a cell and a cell is really the intersection between a row and a column right that's where the data is actually stored so we have a cell of information with the name john in this case now if you move up to a row really a row is going to be what a single structure data item in a table and it's comprised of multiple cells so we see that i have four cells here one john doe wizardry and in this case that is going to comprise my row this is the same thing you know if you've been in a relational database excel google sheets whatever this should look and feel very familiar if you've done any of those things it's no different here now here is where we start to deviate a little bit and we talked about this originally if you remember that example we had in the very beginning when cedric was talking about that table with country as our partition key and how the data was being distributed around the nodes by our partitions so a partition really is a group of related rows what i want to point out is this notice at the far right the department we've got that little box around it and notice that in this case the department in each one of these rows is wizardry now in this example we're saying that department is our partition key right so this is what we're partitioning by since the department is wizardry all of those rows exist on the same physical partition now what's cool about this is from cassandra like if you do a select star against this table or something and you get this result you don't need to worry about where the partitions are or anything cassandra's doing all that for you so logically it's going to look and feel similar to what you've done in a relational database or something similar it's underneath in at the disk right where the data actually lives where this where this really comes into play but what i really want you to take away here is that again if you see rows like this that have the same partition key wizardry in this particular case since we set department as r as our partition key those will actually exist in the same physical partition now what happens though if i have multiple partitions so now what we've done is we still have the same table but notice over in department i have wizardry dark magic and devro well for saying department the department column is what we've based our partition key off for this table i actually have three separate partitions here i have one row with a partition of widget wizardry another one with dark magic and another one with devro now again this is this can be in a single table so logically if i were to do a select star from this table and i pulled this back i very well might be getting those three notes three rows from three different notes i very well could be getting them from three different notes but that's what cassandra is handling for you under the hood so it's that the point here is to understand what it means when we say how we're partitioning data and that if you use the same partition in a set of rows those rows will actually be stored together okay so if we look at the structure overall we've talked about key space a couple times we really haven't explained what it is yet a key space is essentially the container for tables it is also where you set replication now since we're using astr today you don't need to worry about that replication part it's being done for you if you were doing this on your own cassandra cluster though and you create a key space one of the required you know fields attributes you have to fill in is the replication factor you're actually going to tell it how you're going to replicate there in the key space other than that it's where you're going to store your tables and then within a table a table is going to have rows and columns just like a relational database there's no real difference there the big difference though is again within a table you will have multiple partitions based off of the partition key that you set now i like concrete examples so let's look at a concrete example because it makes a ton more sense in my brain so first thing we have our key space killer video right just the container of our tables then we have a table users by city now here's a convention here we're saying we want users information partitioned by city that's how we're naming this because we're going to partition by the city so if you take a look at the table here notice on the very left hand side you have city and we have phoenix in seattle and we're saying that's our partition key column right so when i create the table i will identify city is my partition key and then i'll name it users by city so i'm going to partition by the cities what i want you to notice is look at phoenix and notice that there's three rows there and look at seattle notice it also has three rows those are two separate partitions that could very well be stored on two different nodes somewhere but all of the rows associated with each partition will actually be physically stored with that partition now notice to the right of the partition key column we have last name and first name and the little label says clustering columns clustering columns are used for order and uniqueness right so if i want to order my data or if i want to identify something as being unique that's where a clustering column comes into play so if you take a look at last name there next to phoenix you'll notice helsin last fall smith it's in alphabetical order so what happens when you use a clustering column is as data is written if you identify a column as a clustering column like we have with last name as i write data into the database while it's in memory the data will automatically be ordered in memory where it's fastest and then when that flushes the disk it'll actually be stored in that ordered format why am i telling you this why does it matter because later on when you read the data it we optimize to be as fast as possible on the reed and that's important cassandra is purpose built to be able to maintain its performance at scale right performance isn't that hard it's the read performance that gets challenging right right performance in cassandra is generally in the order of microseconds or very very tight millies right a read performance is where where it can be more challenging even though we're still talking milliseconds but to be able to maintain that read and write performance whether you have three nodes or a thousand nodes right um you need some mechanisms in there so this is one of these optimizations so what happens then is we're trying to reduce the number of i o like the amount of io reads that you need when you go to read the data back later so if i'm pre-ordering the data at the right in memory and then it's written to disk in its ordered format what does that mean that means later on when i read that data it's already ordered i don't pay the cost of the order on the read in a relational database you're paying the costs and the order on the read now relational databases i want to be clear i'm not saying that they're bad or this is like cassandra is better in this way you know all together relational databases are general purpose databases so they work differently cassandra was purpose built to be fast and to maintain that thorough put in speed at scale so it optimizes that's what this is about so really what it comes down to is your data is pre-ordered if you use a clustering column when you read it later it only needs one seat to the disk to pull out that partition and your data is automatically ordered you don't have to reorder it um at the read itself okay so the partition key and the clustering columns um those two things comprise our primary key i'll get into that a little bit more later the last part though are those data columns the data columns are essentially your payload right i'm going to use i'm in my where clause i'm going to be selecting where against my partition and clustering columns and then my results is going to be the data columns right that's really what i'm after i'm trying to get out whatever is in the data columns so looking at now an example in cql by the way for those of you who are familiar with sql cql is a subset of sql it should look very familiar syntax wise it's almost identical that's on purpose there are some commands that are slightly different because it's a different database but other than that it should feel like home so here if i want to create this table i have my create table command you can see i use my key space dot the table name a set of column definitions what their types are and then the key thing i really want to point out the primary key so a primary key's purpose is to define uniqueness for a row right the first thing in your primary key always always always will be your partition key in this case that's city and you see the parens around it the parens are a convention you don't always have to have them in all cases but it's just a good convention to use that way there's just no confusion right so the city here i'm saying is my partition key anything that comes after it are clustering columns so i'm partitioning by city clustering by last name first name and then email okay so let's take a look at some examples here so first for the primary key again as i mentioned primary keys are there to ensure uniqueness for a row and you may define sorting right that may or may not happen the good example there at the top um in that example with city last name first name and email the reason why that's a good example is because that would uniquely identify a row in this case so if i had a city with last name and first name and then email well even if i had the same last name and first name in the same city email is going to give me that little unique identifier right so then that way i can say that this row is gonna usually be a unique result and the next example with user id those are uuids or some unique identifier that are specific to an individual user i know those are unique if you take a look at the example on the bottom though the bad example why is that a bad example so let's think about it we're partitioning by city and then we're clustering by last name and first name but what's really important here is my we're saying in that example my primary key is city last name first name what happens if i had orlando do john but then i had another user who also had the same name in the same city why we're saying that is a bad example is because in that case if you add a case where you did not have some uniqueness in your primary key you could just upset that you could just overwrite it right cedric mentioned earlier that in cassandra last right wins so if i started with a row again with orlando doe john and then later on i had a different dojo in orlando that would just overwrite the one before without something to make it unique that's why that first example in the good example we added email on that's why that makes that a good example because we're ensuring uniqueness now looking at partition keys and some examples here um it's good it's it's better to have partition keys that are going to be responsible to essentially like i just want to pull out i want to with that one value i want to pull out the things that are related uh to whatever it is so like a and i want those to be well distributed around my cluster right um so in the case of a user id that's pretty much as far down as you can go right that's going to be unique per user i know that if i had a million users i'm going to have a million partitions right they're going to be distributed around and if i select from that i'm just going to get that one user that's a good example in the second example there you see video id and common id right so again video id it's gonna be unique identifier for a video um so again i know that i'm gonna have one partition per video that's that's not gonna get too big or anything like that that's that's pretty well um section section depart and the bad example there think about what's happening that's that looks like an iot example right with a sensor id and a log dat but in this case imagine i have a sensor that i'm logging information every 10 seconds i don't have anything here that is going to stop that from growing right i'm going to talk about that more here in a second but that's just going to continuously grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow so i potentially could have a night you know a time at some point where that with that sensor id i have one very big partition i'm going to talk about that more in a second but you really want to ensure um that your partitions are you know kind of broken down in such a way where they distribute well and they're not growing too large or unbounded all right so let's go back to clustering columns for a second i did mention that clustering columns are used for either uniqueness or sorting so if we take a look at the first example here of the uniqueness piece we talked about this one already city last name first name as a primary key it's not unique i could totally have duplicates there however if i then add email in i know that even if i have two john does they'll both have different emails so now that's unique that's a good example in the second example imagine and by the way all of this data model that you're seeing here is actually based off of one of our um one of our reference apps called killer video which is like youtube light right so if you imagine in youtube you're gonna have a video and you're gonna have comments now if you think about it it wouldn't make much sense if i had a video with comments but when i retrieved the data all the comments were in random order right that would probably read a little weird so in the first example there on the bottom where it says video again comment id we're not sorting by anything useful um you know they're just ids they're not going to sort very well so if i were to pull a video and get all of its comments the comments very well could be completely random where in the second example where i have video id created at as a clustering column and common id now we're using created at to automatically order the data based off of time so if i were to pull a video by the video some video id there i will automatically get the data in time sorted order because i added that created at field all right so cedric i feel like at this point i'm watching the chats i see alex is on top of things are there any questions that we should stop to answer real quick have i lost cedric no no no no no you're there no i was focused on answering questions you know real life question td dive about data modeling uh but you know no obvious question as of today okay so disha in case of sensor id what would be a good example i'm gonna bring you to that in a moment i'm gonna bring you to that in a moment okay so we're okay questions for now yes we are okay wonderful all right so let's look at some rules right these are just these are rules you should start with when creating your tables and when thinking about your primary keys and how you should partition the first one and cedric talked about this earlier actually store together what you retrieve together um one of the let's say yes one of the things we haven't really talked about yet we're going to get there is the difference between normalization and denormalization and cassandra does use a denormalized data pattern right it's a query per table design so really your goal is to get the data answer the one query and get all of the data you need for that query with the fewest amount of reads and i o cost is possible right that is going to give you the most optimized return and the best fastest returns on data especially at scale so if you take a look let's say that in this example we wanted to open a video and we want to get all the comments in one query right well the top example there we kind of talked about this why is that one good well the video id so we have a video id we pass in that id and then we have all of the comments you know we we can we can get all the comments that are going to be listed in that video idea i get one read it'll give them all back to me however in the second example where we have comment id and created out what happens if i had a video that had thousand comments in that example i would actually have to select from every single one of those comment ids separately i would need a thousand select statements to get all of the comments that that probably wouldn't be a good way to do it right so in the first case i can literally make one read and get the whole set in the second case i'd have to make a thousand right so again this is what we mean by store together what you retrieve together you want everything that you need to answer a single query in in a partition and it's okay if you repeat things we'll talk about that more in a second with a denormalized data pattern now avoiding big partitions this one's actually one of my favorite things because sandra in a lot of ways you know just like anyone who our unix operators or linux operators the operating system will let you do just about anything including shooting yourself in the foot if you so choose um cassandra's not much different honestly you could do a lot with it but there are practical limitations right things like you see in those bullets up to 2 billion cells per partition um if you're if you feel like you're starting to push up into that kind of range you need to think about how splitting things up um up to a hundred rows now there's not some hard limit cassandra won't say oh you're at 100k you can't do anymore um what we're telling you is that based off of real world practicality you don't want to surpass these values matter of fact i would even argue that you don't want to get up to 100 row 100 000 rows in a partition but again if you're starting to get that size per partition it's probably time to break it up the same thing with the size 100 megabytes right you want to keep it within those so let's look at some examples here of where that that could get a little unruly right again the first example here that you see that primary key with the green check mark this is a good example why because i am partitioning by video id and then the most i can get you know how many comments are you going to get per video unless you have a celebrity or if you have a particularly successful site chances are you're not going to get you know a billion comments per one video if you do if that's happening you can totally break that up if you really needed to but generally speaking that's going to gate very well the the amount of information you're going to have per video id per video and you'll stay within the bounds of what you see in those bullets if you look at the second example though not so much think about if i had a data model like this with country and user id and let's say i had a country like india compared to say iceland right india has how many billion people and if i have a unique user id for all of those that means i would be storing information for every single user in the whole country so every time that i try to say pull the data from that country right it's not only going to be huge but that's that the bound of that is going to go well past 100 000 rows in a partition well past 100 megabits in a partition right so you want to be careful not to create your your data model in such a way where you're going to have these huge what we call wide partitions you really want to avoid those um going back to the sensor id example that somebody asked about before this is what i was alluding to so going along with that example with the country that i just talked about the same thing here in this example of sensor id and reported at this would be an unbounded partition right this is the case where i don't have anything that just keeps this partition from getting huge because for one particular sensor i could have if you think about it if i'm you know taking uh readings every 10 seconds in a month's time you're gonna have a lot of data and if it's never ended right uh at some point you're you're definitely gonna go past the the practical constraints that you should have so what do you do in this case we do something called bucketing right notice what happened in the first example with the red x you see i'm partitioning by sensor id in the second example i now have a composite partition key i'm partitioning by sensor id and month year so i've kept it now now what's happening is since we're partitioning in this way i've essentially bucketed it so for that one center i'm only going to store the amount of data for one month ever right and that way i don't have it unbounded so for every month for every month year i should say i will have a new partition that will go along with that sensor id so this is a nice way you can still store the data cause sandra as cedric mentioned it's a petabyte database like it can handle the data it's a big data database there's no problem with that but you just have to think about how do i store the data properly so i don't have these big unbounded or very very wide partitions and the last one avoid hot partitions the example really goes back to that country example i gave a minute ago imagine if i again stored i did this with country and user id and india was one example compared to say iceland um india potentially could have billions of values in that one partition and if i had that many users in my system all from one place there's a very very good chance that that partition is going to be getting hit over and over and over and over because there's just so much more use there what that means is if i have data spread around my cluster and i'm using like an rf3 i might have three nodes that are taking on all the load where the rest of them are just kind of sitting there doing nothing right again you want a much better nicer even distribution of your data and your partitions around your cluster so you can really reap the benefits of what cassandra can do so i honestly i think hot and big partitions in a lot of ways kind of go hand in hand they're not always related but they sure can be so it really comes down to when you're thinking about your data model and how to partition and how to create your primary keys you want to avoid things that are unbounded and you want to avoid things that are particularly wide like particularly large okay so let's see so we can move into number two create a table and catch up on any questions that we may have let's give everybody some time this time we'll do timer 10 minutes and i will ask all of you to there we go all right so what we're going to do i will drop the link let me pull it real quick here you go this is for the second exercise there you go by the way in discord i do have a little help from boris t something oh really nice yeah yeah that's why in question as well so thank you all right so again we're gonna do section two here and let us know with a thumbs up or something once you're done please how are the questions going cedric anything we need to catch up on uh so far so good so far so good just scrolling if i do have oh yeah what is a hot partition so i explain in the text form and maybe you can you can explain to others what hot partition is yeah a hub partition is really a case where you have one partition that for some reason is getting the line share of all of the operations right um the example i used a moment ago with country like if i had i was partitioning my country and and then you know clustering by user id that if i had something like india and india's got you know how many billion people that potentially if i had a lot of users coming from there compared to another partition say like iceland which would have you know very few to that there's a very good chance the indian partition if you will would be constantly the one being read from where the icelandic one or the other ones you know weren't really doing much of that and so what ends up happening is you end up with an unbalanced cluster because only a few partitions are getting hit a lot over and over and over and over and over and so you if you have a case like that you really want to try to figure out a way to break that up to better distribute the data around your cluster so it's it's really um it's really about the amount um of hits if you will you're getting to a particular partition if it's like taking the line share and it means that only a small subset of your nodes are doing all the work right so that's really where our hot politician comes in now if you have anything else you want to add to that cedricker no no that's what i would explain you know really sample if as a partition key you use the date you know year months day well all the students everybody will use the same node and write at the at the same node and the other nodes do nothing so you want to find a partition key that will evenly distributed the data around your nodes to avoid any hot partition hot notes okay all right how we're doing and again we're just doing section two create a table okay thanks to the kill i see you're done wonderful thank you oh kevin you're absolutely right don't worry about the login um the the latest version of astro will automatically log you into the cql console um thank you for pointing that out um i realized right before i forgot to remove that because that's a newer feature um i forgot to remove that out of the instructions so again if you go to the cql console here it will automatically log you in you no longer have to do that you can just move on and everything will work just like it should be yeah satish exactly um you don't need to worry about the credentials it will i need to remove that that's my bad from the workshop just click on cql console it'll bring you right where you need to go and just skip over the login part exactly yes it has been updated to simplify your life and our life so now it's automatically authenticated in the secure console and by the way the the username is called token but you know [Laughter] yeah sharker will you talk about ttl can replace bucketing partition key um we're not really gonna we're not really focused on ttl here um now we can talk about a little bit um you know ttl is really used for a more optimized way to delete stuff especially things that you know have have a certain amount of time they need to live maybe metrics data or something that you only need to hold on to like for 30 days or a week or whatever as you like archive them somewhere um you know like roll them up or something like that you don't want that stuff to just keep growing and growing and growing so you might put a ttl on there to kind of cut it off at some time um does it replace bucketing those are two different things in my mind um could you maybe is there a mechanism there um where you could maybe not bucket if that's what you're asking and use a ttl i guess it depends i'm trying to think of an example of the top my head cedric i don't know if you have one there i still think that those are pretty much two different things um i'm thinking about you know time series it's all about time series and events coming so if you put some partition key with the day at some point you get too many events per day so you need to add the hour in in the partition key and this is first pocketing and so on and so forth so after some time maybe you want to add the minute and the second as well in the partition key it's all about having not too many data in inside a single partition also maybe you want to do some pre-aggregation you know if you want to group or compute multiple events for an hour so you do some pre-compute and so if you aggregate the values of a time maybe you don't need the table that keep the you know each time stem for every single event and for for this table you can put a ttl which is time to leave how many data how many times does the data will be there until cassandra will automatically drop the table so again in a time series what we tend to do is the the table that will hold all these events will grow very fast and will be huge and so you want to move the data from this real time table to aggregation and something more oriented to all lab queries instead of oltp queries and so that means the data the table that will get all the inserts will have a ttl of 30 days because after 30 days you don't need the real-time flow at that point you are you will already move the data and aggregate the data to delegate it table more oriented for real-time aggregation you you know by the way i just saw a question come in about um no sql bench so we're not going to cover that today uh who was that where'd you go yeah hey hog hi hug cereal yeah um we're not gonna talk about uh no sql bench however we do have a workshop on nosql bench where did my workshop go there it is all right here let me go ahead and drop this to you and there you go yeah so we're not covering that today um but like i said we do have that workshop there you can take a look at now always by the way if you have a questions hub that you want to follow up with regards to nosql bench or whatever come reach out come reach out to us on discord or community we can totally get get you hooked up with the team over there uh so you can you can get more information or we can try to answer things all right so i believe we're around our time i saw a bunch of people say done how are we doing adisha we'll we'll be adding some rows in the crud section at the very end and cedric i okay you're already typing i think the thiago i have some things i can say there but it looks like you're already responding there i think yeah yeah all about uh using the sensor id the partition key yes that's also mean if you do that yes your data are pretty well distributed in the nodes because the sensor id will ensure that data will be evenly distributed but then if you want to read the data later on you need to provide back the sensor id so either you know the sensor id and you can provide a where close with him but if there are too many uh too many sensor ids then yeah you you are back to partition key using uh monster okay months day minutes that will really help to uh to do uh yeah to do search or you know time uuid and so as single partition and then using uh using a cluster column with day months hours to do the filters all right all right so at this point i am going to go ahead and run through uh exercise two create a table um so as some of you rightly noticed and this is my fault uh the cql console does log you in automatically like i said that's a newer feature i need to remove that out of the instruction here so you don't need to log in but once you do that the first thing we just wanted you to do is describe key spaces so this will show you all the key spaces that you have on the system and by the way you should be able to cut and paste i saw somebody having a trouble with that um i'd be curious to know i don't know if you got a um got a solution but the cut and paste for me does work but i mean people are in different systems and everything so if you give a little more information on that one maybe we can help you there now if you remember when if you follow the instructions you should have a killer video key space so you'll see this command here to execute is use killer video so what we're doing is we're telling cassandra hey i want to i want to use just that key space right i'm going to put my context to the killer video key space and that way if i were to then say describe tables and there we go i couldn't get my fingers in the right place um it's only going to look at the tables that i might have in a particular and that key space now i didn't create any yet so um it's empty so if i scroll down a little bit here you'll see this command execute so i'm going to go ahead and create that users by city table we've been creating or talking about again notice this looks like the syntax that came right out of that that slide that we had that's exactly what it is and now if i say describe tables there we go that was weird um boom i have my users by city table so easily enough that's it i created a table um and that's i mean that's as easy as it is right that it doesn't really get much easier um again the syntax should look very similar to what you do in the relational world other than the fact that you're defining your partition key here by that first value that's in your primary key all right so with that let's move on let me take a look at how we are doing in questions let's see token use killer video invalid request for question server oh if key space killer video does not exist satya um i have two questions for you one did you previously have a database and if you did what was its name two if not and you created it fresh did you in fact use killer video as a key space name how can you find out if in your console here in the ui if you go back to summary right you should be able to see [Music] your key spaces down here so if i come down to again if i go to my summary i've got my my database but if i scroll down and see key spaces i have killer video so if you don't see killer video there then use whatever key space you have another way to do it is if you're back in the cql console and if i say describe key spaces i should see the key spaces that i have now yours you know i have a couple extra ones because i've done some stuff in here but again if you named it something else you should see some other name just to ensure that you're using the name of whatever the key space was that you created let's see yeah and i see angel saying the same thing okay um you know multiple questions on you know how to set up a good party shirt key how to set up a good primary i mean primary key clustering colon and what would happen if you know the the needs change and you need to edit your partition key or stuff like that so in consumer you default behavior is really to get one table per query so if you do have multiple queries interacting with the same data that mean the same data will be in two tables and it's not a big deal in case you replication is the way to be as fast as possible yeah and by the way one of the resources that we're going to give to you here at the end is a whole set of scenarios on data modeling right um so separate from what we're doing today we have um catacota scenarios if you're not familiar with those they are a cloud-based like like a how do you put it like they're they're like a self-service you know like teaching tool by o'reilly it's all free um and we have our own site at data stacks on catacota and in there we have a whole section of data modeling that will actually bring you through i want to say five or six different real data modeling use cases iot is definitely in there and you get to explore and go and create the data model and work with a little bit more i really encourage i'm seeing some questions that i think would really benefit from going through those so we will drop those links here at the end and and you'll get those resources all right all right i think we're in a good place what do you think cedric should i move on um us yeah we are good uh you know what we do have tons of questions which is very very good i love this interactivity yes uh see we move forward you can still watch this session uh on youtube using the same link afterwards it's recorded and we will do the same session tomorrow um in let's say 14 hours so you know either way we're good to go yeah and just a couple questions i think we can handle real quick um i see one from guerrero in in discord is partition and primary key the same thing no the partition key is one part of the primary key the primary key is what you use to identify a unique row and always must have at least one partition key but the partition p is part of the whole primary key the primary p but the primary key is comprised of a partition key and zero or more clustering columns right so there is a difference yeah just reading exactly what i say are you serious exactly after that's great that's that's totally cool um i saw another question here um i think right from jack saying over in youtube saying will too many partitions be a problem no no and matter of fact a good example this is user id right um you could totally partition by user id and if you had a billion users you would have a partition per user if you had truly unique user ids which you can totally do the key thing is to ensure that you want to really distribute you want those to be distributed around your cluster as much as possible the more of that nice even distribution you have the better so the number of partitions isn't really the issue it's really the size of a partition or if you have a hot partition see and one record yeah you could totally yeah is this the case is it going to be one record i'm assuming you mean one record per partition or something like that and again right if you use like a user id um then i could have say you know 10 columns or something like that that represented all the different you know parameters or properties about my user and so i would have that one record per partition okay oh oh uh are you going for dill up there uh you want to go go yeah let's do it we'll both answer this one dil so dilba is asking in discord are there indexes in cassandra is the primary key indexed that's a great question yes there are in fact indexes in cassandra um however the the primary key isn't really index itself however if you think about it partition keys on their own are kind of an index right it's not an index in the traditional sense but you could kind of think of it like that now there are indexes in cassandra but there's only one of them that i would actually recommend using and and the reason why is um because you can if you think about it the the absolute fastest way that you're going to get data out at scale in cassandra is to properly data model with denormalized tables and use you know proper partition keys and such but there are always cases there are always cases where maybe you're partitioning by one thing but you really need to ask another question of your data right and where an index really comes into play the things you have to just kind of take note of when you use indexes in cassandra there are some sweet spots for them there's a new type called sai storage attach indexing which is the best option now it is also available in astra i believe i don't know cedric has it come to oss yet or is it still on the plate uh so yeah we do have a what we call cep which is a request we do have the code uh open source so we simply ask the casanova community oh this is the new index please integrate that to cassandra it's coming it's coming yeah so so right now astra and deus ex enterprise both have sai and it's coming for oss but storage attached indexes are really the the best way to do it now so yes you could in fact use sai there's i can um in a minute once we're done here i can go get you a link and i'll drop that for you you can use sai to very easily add in indexes even though sai is really great use always understand that any time that you are deviating away from what you're doing in your partition key and everything you're you know there's always a little overhead that's associated with it right um but sai is really meant for high cardinality low cardinality all sorts of things where if you use like um a secondary index or something there's some sweet spots that if you don't quite get scale wise you may not scale very well so yes there are indexes there are some caveats but i would totally take a look at storage attached indexes is the best approach now and cedric what do you what are your thoughts um yeah i mean you said it loud uh if i would rephrase me with my own limited english word nasty french accent i would say so primary key is indeed indexed default behavior if you need multiple query on the same data you do multiple tables but sometimes you can create what we call secondary index and now it's possible to query this new column but those are really useful with what we call low cardinality so you do not want to have you know a lot of values to scan to be able to reach that secondary index and then secondary index multiple flavors i stated by david s-i-s-a-s-i s-s-i and regular secondary index so you can use index but there is no magic there is still a small overhead to go first through the partition key screen the partition key with the secondary index and then be able to to to to work with that um give your links i can give you links about that and i did just drop so uh dilip i dropped and i guess i'll drop it to everybody if you're interested uh this is sai i'll just say index so it's obvious take a look now i'm dropping a workshop okay so we had we actually created a workshop on this last year in the workshop you'll see here this getting started there's actually a set of doc links i mean it might be nice if we put real doc links too so people get them directly but the workshop will bring you through it right you can actually do this on astra again and you know i'll admit i haven't looked at this one in a little bit so i haven't run through it to make sure everything is there but i don't see any reason why it wouldn't work but this will actually bring you through some use cases um there are also catacotta scenarios on this as well i'm pretty sure we included them um but this is i think this is going to be the example that you're looking for where sai can really come into play there are definitely use cases for it and like i said sai is the latest evolution of indexing in califor or i almost like california um in cassandra it is it is the l evolution past secondary indexes past sassy so i would start here if you're going to do any indexing at all i would start with sai first take a look at this workshop and it should have the information that you need in it okay yeah of course yeah no problem dylan all right let's go ahead and move on to the art of data modeling all right this gets into probably one of my favorite sections because especially for those of us who all came from the relational world um some of these things this is where it there's a slight paradigm shift in how you do things in the cassandra world compared to relational and that's okay there's reason for it and once you understand that reason it makes total sense right so first thing is in you know we have two terms we have normalization and denormalization right now for those of you who are mired in the relational world normalization will probably be familiar um this was invented if you think about it this was invented decades ago and normalization things like third normal forms and such were implemented back when you know if for those who were old enough disk platters were like this big and this thick and like five megabytes was like a ton of data disks were very slow right so databases back when they were created then they needed a way to be able to store data with the least amount of redundancy lots of data integrity and all that and that's where things like third normal forms and normalization and such came from right and so anyone who's ever done anything in the relational world you're going to be familiar with this if we take an example there on the right let's say i have an employees table and each row is going to represent one of those employees but those employees might you know be in certain departments and so how might i data model this you know what my schema look like well probably i'll have a separate department's data table where i'm going to store each of those departments one by one in their own rows why because i want to reduce any data redundancy because back when the stuff was created disk was not cheap and disk was not fast so i wanted to reduce the footprint of data as much as possible so what would we do then well i've got an employees table i have a department's table if i want to know what department edgar codd was in for example i'd probably have some foreign key relationship back to the department's table and i could use a join in my select statement and i could get that information um so great there are some pros here right rights were pretty simple you have you know you're great on data integrity and such but the cons were slow reads how many here if i get thumbs up in the chats how many here have had to deal with you know sql queries that are 20 joins deep or more or something right i used to be a dba at one point there was like a badge of honor to optimize those things um it was it was fun as a developer um you know you try to work with that as best you can but at some point you get diminishing returns right and some of the queries get really really complex now comes denormalization right now if you've ever done any data warehousing um denormalization even a relational database might be something you do called like flattening out the data i also remember though if you're working with normal forms and you're thinking you saw a table that was denormalized you're like what were they thinking why are they doing this right um but denormalization is really there to optimize speed at read what are you doing you're flattening it out so if you take a look at the example i have here that first row at your cod well now instead of having a different department a separate department table with all of my departments i'm just listing the department right there in the row now one of the cons might be it might be that well look if you notice the next couple rows i have multiple math departments but that data is repeated so from a data redundancy standpoint i actually have more you know i've gotten more data that's being repeated so i'm actually storing a bigger footprint of data however cassandra was built in the time of much faster disk and out of all the commodities disk cpu memory and all that disk is the cheapest and it is growing cheaper and is getting bigger all the time and the speeds are orders of magnitude more than what they used to be when relational databases were first created so the point is this balance cassandra makes a trade-off it is balancing using more and faster disk to gain the read performance at scale what does this mean simply enough we denormalize our data so instead of having two different tables i have one table and all of the data is stored in that table this goes back to what we were saying remember we were saying stored together what you retrieved together boom this is the example right i'm storing everything i need so when i pull out that one user and that one read i get all the data back right it's the trade-off that we're making here um now the pros here are it definitely increases your read performance no doubt queries are uber simple there are no joins in cassandra there is no such thing as a joining cassandra and this goes back to that one query per table design that we talked about so what i'm going to do is when i design my tables i'm going to design it okay for any particular query i want to get everything i need for that one query out of that one table now some of the cons though as you can imagine is now i have manual or multiple rights right um where because now every time that i have a department column that i want in a table well now i have multiple places i have to write that right so it's a little bit more complex from that standpoint um but in a database where writes are usually in the order of microseconds or whatever it's not the speed that's an issue or anything and then from an integrity standpoint you now have to keep that more up to date right where in a relational database you know that um with the right foreign key relationships and stuff when i set you know in the in the in the department table engineering i'm only going to have that one instance of what that is where in this case and denormalized i'm gonna have multiple copies of that so i need to keep up to date on that right um but the the trade-off the benefit the benefit is maintaining that read performance at scale and again whether you're three nodes or like thousands of nodes but this next part where i'm gonna get into this is where it really gets fun this is the fun part so from a relational data modeling approach what do you do you start with some data right some set of data that you have then you apply your normal forms whether it's an architect dba some devs do it right and you use that to generate an erd or a schema based off of that data so you model the data and then as application developers what do we do well we now go and reference that erd right we reference that hierarchy and we figure out what queries do i need to answer what what questions for my application this is where it gets fun if you haven't been paying attention anything yet right now pay attention here um in cassandra we flip it on its head we start with our application workflows we use that to generate our data model and then we apply the data so i want to do that one more time so in relational we start with data we then use normal forms to generate our data models and from the application we then figure out what our queries are based off that data model and cassandra you actually start with the application workflows you start with your queries and i know the the thing the eyebrow raise that is going on right now is like whoa dude did you just say i need to know my queries up front before i create my data model and i just said yes and i'm going to show you how to do it it is it's not crazy it's just different right matter of fact i'll argue that the second you start to napkin out even the basic the most basic ui of your app you're already doing this right so we're going to go through that process now by the way cedric before um before i move on i want to check after what we just said are there questions we need to address are we okay um there is a question we had three times and i really won't have time to cover it okay and we always have the questions so people watching us until now and the question is always okay what is the difference between no sequel database how cassandra behave differently for when should i use or cassandra again i see mango explain me little time also i see some edge base so let me do it in in just two minutes okay okay and you can you can challenge my way of thinking but okay in so both i mean let's say cassandra both are distributed nosql database okay first in a distributed system you cannot ensure consistency availability and network issue at the center at the same time you need to pick two of the three so mango piece consistency and partition tolerance to do transaction stuff like that and custom graphic availability and partition tolerance the idea is i want to scale as much as i want and if i lose a node it's not a big deal so first approach is do you want to be always available in scale as you wish or do you want to do acid transaction stuff like that there is a first choice then what kind of data do you put in there so in cassandra we show you tables but not only tables you can also do json because in cassandra there is insert json and select json and you will retrieve the value as json but there is a schema and on the other side is schema-less and that's also a difference and last um there is a way to insert schema-less in catalog and the technique is called document trading i copy the link in the youtube chat just to explain how it does and there is now an api in astra what we call the document api and you do have a document rest api to do some schema less in custom that's pretty cool but it's not fair to compare really  versus cassandra based on you know ap versus cp it's not the same use case first and also schema let's not schema sometimes it's not the same use case okay done you can move on all right all right so okay so again now let's talk about how do we take our application workflows and use that to generate our data model because that's really the question right that's what we're after so what you do is this so here's the flow of how you get from your application workflow and your conceptual data models all the way to the actual physical data model the thing you're going to the cql you're going to write with your table anyone who has done any kind of application modeling or relational stuff you're going to be familiar with the conceptual data model this is no different from what we've been doing for years right and and how we represent entities and the relationships between them i mentioned before that killer video is our one of our reference apps it's like youtube light and in the examples we've been giving so far we've been talking about this this relationship between users comments and videos right so that's what we're that's what we're defining here so if you take a look at the left you'll see i've got a user entity it's got some properties like email and id then i've got my comments some user comments and they have properties as well like timestamp and the comments themselves and then the video entity and its properties like id title and description and there's a relationship between these right so that's what i'm showing here i'm showing okay well users have a number of you know end comments on video and videos can be commented on by users right this is this relationship that we are defining so this might be one of the first things that i might do is kind of map out what you know what kind of um objects are we working with you know what are the you know what what kind of questions might i have from my application then i can start to use this along with my application workflows this is the part i was talking about when i mentioned you could start literally like napkining out a ui on a napkin and start to tease out what these queries might be so here's what we're talking about let's take a use case let's say a real simple one most most ecommerce most apps today are going to have users and users probably have profiles so the first use case here is that a user opens some profile so the question i'm going to ask is i want to find comments right related to a target user using its identifier some key and i want to get the most reason first there's actually a lot packed into that sentence but really what i'm doing is when i go to the user profile i'm going to see all of their comments and i want to see them in time order and the second use case now i'm opening up a video so i've clicked on the video right and along with the video i want to see all the comments that are related to that video again in time order right these are the questions that i'm that my app is asking so now we can create out of those alone some pseudo queries right so in query one we're saying find comments posted for a user with a known id show most recent so now i'm that that's kind of a pseudo query we're going to see how that's going to turn into a query in a second but imagine i'm going to get all the comments by a user and i want those comments in order okay now we just said right there i want to find comments by a user and if you remember the convention we used before whatever i'm trying to get by what i'm partitioning by so comments by user notice on the right hand side that little pseudo table we're creating comments by user and the second case i want to find comments for a video with a known id again i want to show the most recent what did i just say i'm saying i want to find the comments by a video comments partitioned by video so now how do i translate in that to a query now this is where using a denormalized data pattern and having a table per query design really shines this is it these queries i don't have joins to worry about or anything if i want to get those comments if i want to find comments by a user i'm going to select from comments by user where the user id is some value boom that's it if i want to get some comments by video i'm going to select from comments by video where the video id is some key i have not even created my tables yet but i actually have queries that will work right now i want to take this and move on to where we start to design the logical data model so remember we have comments by user and comments by video are our pseudo tables well what do we need there we've already identified some stuff right we know that we're saying we're going to partition so if we take the example on the left we know that we're going to partition by user so user id right is going to be our partition key now the value that you see here this k and the c the k this is called a chewbacco diagram the k is a partition key that's all it's saying partition key the c is saying clustering column and the order or the uh the arrow denotes the order so what i'm saying in this case is i'm partitioning by user id i'm going to cluster by creation date descending order and then cluster by comment id ascending order video id and comment are just data right there my payload in the comments by video it's gonna look just like the other one because it's almost the same information the difference though is now i'm partitioning by video so my video id is my partition key creation date is my clustering column where i'm ordering by descending um and then comment id is also a clustering column now if you remember it's the combination of our partition keys and our clustering columns that make our primary key so in the left hand side user id creation date and comment id that's my primary key on the right hand side it's video id creation date common id and finally since i am ordering a clustering column descending and creation date what does that mean it means the data will automatically be stored in descending order by creation date why is this so powerful because later on let's say i want to just find give me the latest 10 minutes or 10 comments by a user all i have to do is grab the first 10 limit 10 by user id and i will automatically get the latest 10. it automatically orders it for me right so okay so now we started to map out our tables and what the keys are going to be now i take this and i optimize right this is where i'm going to optimize into my physical data model for one i'm going to identify what the fields are just notice the difference if you take user id and creation date now i'm gonna say okay user id is a uuid that's its type um i'm gonna identify the types now what i want you to notice is watch what happens with commented id i'm gonna go back notice here i went from creation date and comment id there were two separate fields and now we have a single comment id but it's a time uuid we're pointing this out because time uid is like a cool type it's a combination of a timestamp and a uuid it's a unique identifier and a timestamp and one all we did here was collapse creation date and comment id and a comment id if you didn't do this if you didn't optimize with this would that be terrible no could you write a table that looked like that totally um but this is what we mean by when we say as you move to the physical data model and we're doing the optimization step this is what we're talking about if there's anything like this that you can optimize this is the time to do it finally we take that and we go okay here's our cql right we have our table names so again looking at the left hand side we know the table name is comments by user so i'm going to create table comments by user we have our fields we've mapped out user id common id video id and comment and their types we've applied those here and if you look back i'm going to flip back one more time i know that user id from the k is my partition key comment id from the c and the arrow is my clustering column and it's descending order so in my in my ddl here i'm going to say my primary key okay i'm partitioning by user id my clustering column is comment id my clustering order is common id descending i'm literally writing out the cql based off of what we've designed in the chewbacca diagram and that's it that's it right there this is the end result you create the tables and at no point did we actually have to go through and you know data model our data first or anything like that we could actually take our application workflows and work through creating our queries and our tables even before we have data in the system all right so with that um let's see questions will go to number three in this is gonna be the execute crud one let me go ahead and drop the link for everybody and this is where you're gonna do some of this there you go all right [Music] foreign yeah question for you david yeah go for it so if now you need to edit the comment that means you need to update two tables how do you do yeah right no you're absolutely right um you would update both tables i mean one way to do it right would be a batch it depends it depends on your your particular use case if you if you have multiple denormalized tables that both have comments and you want to ensure that both of those have the same values that's what a batch is for a batch in cassandra is not the same thing as a batch in the relational database it is not used for bulk loading of data period there's one example that there's an advanced use case with single single partition batches i'm not going to go there but generally it is for syncing multiple denormalized tables so that would be one way to do it now if you don't have that particular requirement if you don't have to do that then you can you know reduce some some overhead patches do introduce some overhead um but that's the mechanism to use is there is there something else you want me to say there cedric no no no i'm sharing killer video link okay it's a it's a real app it's a real use case so let's bring you the the source code and this reference application is available in node python c-sharp and java so by the way uh satish in youtube great question so the application is expected to maintain the max id so so you will find a matter of fact the exercise you're going through right now with execute crowd operations you're going to experience this right there is a function you can use in cassandra or in the driver through the code uuid you can use that to generate the uuids that you need that we use in cassandra we kind of glossed over that here but there is a mechanism that will do that part for you you don't have to actively like figure out what the ids are going to be or something you can just use the function so admit cassandra is a nosql database it's not a document-based nosql database however comma there's something new called stargate um if you go to stargate.io i can drop the link for you uh stargate is actually another open source project um that came out of these texts originally uh here you go where are you where'd you go i i missed and lost him now oh here you are admit okay um here here's a link for stargate um now interestingly enough um astra already has stargate implemented in so you will find there is in fact a document api if you go to connect while you're in astra and you'll see this document api um then it'll give you the information that you need you can in fact use this document api to create schema-less documents um so this is something new that has happened it is something that will also eventually be coming um i believe it's already the stargate already hooked up to oss right cedric uh yes yes yes yes oh um but you have to do it yourself in that case right yes it's in catsandra first it's it's available in inoss of course if you go to target.io you will find some docker compose to have everything running with cassandra 311 yeah so so generally speaking cassandra itself is a nosql database that is schema required however recently there has been the document uh api piece that has come into play yes and it's on top of cassandra inside the engine it's a proxy in a particular database modeling pretty pretty clever that allows you to do schemas so jack maybe you can help me out here um i do recognize we are coming up to time we're going to go just a little bit over but i see ben over on youtube as saying he's got a jump um how do we grab the voucher jack could you go ahead and drop the link so folks can do that because that would be fair yeah let's go ahead and drop the link so that way folks who need to leave you can and you can still get the form we should talk about this now for just a moment um there are now two options in the form that jack is going to drop one will give you the voucher that ben was just asking about to get a uh free attempts two or three attempts at a cassandra certification right um so that's one option the other option is something new that we're doing where it will give you a 300 credit for astra now again we're talking the free tier right now no no one should have a credit card going that credit is if you want to use one of the higher tiers you can get a 300 credit to use for whatever you want i actually suggest using the dev tier because with 300 bucks i mean that'll last you a little bit um so that is a really nice way that you can go in and you can start playing with you know like some of the bigger clusters and some of the features you get there um so it's up to you though it's up to you if you want the voucher for the certification or if you want the 300 credit both will be on the form and thank you jack i just saw jack dropped the form so feel free to go ahead and check that out if you do need to leave at uh at the top of the hour uh emmett is cassandra connected with aws and gcp via api as we did in azure um i don't know about the api part yeah you can put cassandra anywhere um you can put in aws gcp or azure no problem if you're talking about astra in particular in the free tier it's only gcp and the other tiers the other uh vendors open up um so it is just because the free tier is the part that you know doesn't cost you anything but it costs us something and gcp is the lowest cost for us but in the pay tiers you can pick whatever you one you want if that's not what you were looking for just let me know jacko dropped that form there you go there's celony [Laughter] um you know that's a great question sudakar how long is the credit valid i i don't know jack do you happen to know that one we can find out real quick at the credit union yeah the 300 credit how long is it valid for i want to say i don't i didn't think there was an end date but i'm i'm not 100 yeah i don't think there is an end date you know it's just you know when you register you provide the credit and you use the credit that's it no i don't think there is a deadline okay all right how are we doing on this exercise does take a little bit more time let me know um for those of you who are sticking with us uh give us a thumbs up let us know that you are done with the exercise if you would save enough time for those wide games so yeah cause we're gonna have that we're gonna have that swag game at the end exactly yeah yeah yeah we should be ending in 10 minutes yeah so what i'm gonna do is if those of you are still running through it that's fine i'm gonna go ahead and go through the steps on my end as well i need to go back to using killer video though by the way um i was kind of being sneaky and mean in one of the commands if you don't properly use the key the key space if you don't change the context um none of the commands are fully qualified and that was on purpose i would normally recommend to always fully qualify your commands but i was illustrating what happens if you don't switch the context by using use um so if you do find an error that says hey i can't do this you know i don't know the key space just use killer video then you can execute all the commands all right so we're going to implement the tables that we talked about from the slides and now describe those tables so we can see that we added them in and now we have those extra the new two tables comments by video comments by user now we're just going through the steps of the crud right so create read update delete um so in this case we're just creating we're inserting a set of data now somebody already noted i'm just going to insert that somebody already asked about the uuid piece and you may have noticed that these uuids are hard-coded we do this just for the sake of when we have a large group of folks like yourselves on doings at the same time if someone runs into some issue it's really hard to troubleshoot live what someone's dynamically generated uuid was and all that we in this case then we'll go ahead and we'll just hard code the uuids so if you do run into something we know exactly what you're talking about however and i put this right down here you'll see this in the workshop itself um that you in the real world if you were doing this in in your application you would use the uuid function to generate your uids in the fly the doc link is there again we did this just because of the workshop and how that works um and you notice the use of now that is a way that you can get the timestamp right it's it's very easy to use so you don't have to worry about generating those either okay and then we're gonna so we generate it into the first table and now we're going to generate stuff for the second table the same same exact deal where we used some hard-coded uuids but again you would just use uuid with parens and call the function and again for create they're just insert statements just like you would have uh in a relational world that doesn't change anything um so it should look very similar then on the read standpoint i'm just gonna select some comments by user now something i want to really point out i really um you notice you may have read this or not this cough cough i put here the select star from a table in cassandra is totally an anti-pattern this is not how you want to do things notice i have no where clause i'm not i'm not partitioning by anything here i'm literally saying give me everything now in a table where we only created four rows okay no big deal but this is a big data database that can handle petabytes of data imagine what that might look like if i had a table that had you know billion partitions or something right select star is not a good way to do things you always want to be using your partition key and your where clause to ensure that you're selecting by partition um somebody asked earlier well what happens if i want to search by something now you're getting into some maybe more analytics or whatever this is where maybe a storage attach index comes into play you apply that and you can you can use that in your where clause but in no normal operation should you just ever use an open-ended select star from a table like this without something in your where clause we're only doing it here just because it's very quick and um we're just showing the results that are in the table okay so now i'm going to go ahead and pull out something now this is the better example right this is where i'm actually selecting by my partition key and getting only the values only the rows that are associated with that particular partition again i'm doing all my anti-patterns here so we're just showing you know just general patterns how to how to read out of the database right all right and then in the update part um so these are just by the way these aren't ones to copy there's no you know copy this kind of command or command to execute these are just showing you um as you read through it we're just pointing something out that earlier we had inserted a record here oh my god that guy patrick is such a geek how do we go and update that so what we're gonna do is notice on our update command we're setting the comment to okay oh my god that patrick guy is on fleek and we're in our where clause we're using the two things we need to um that are in our partition key and our clustering column so where video id is that uuid and the comment id so i'm updating the specific comment for a specific video in this case and then if i select it back out we should see oh look oh my god that patrick guy is on fleek instead of oh my god that patrick guy is a geek and then finally how do you delete again you're going to use that same partition key you're going to use that same combination so here notice i'm deleting from my table again using my partition key and my clustering column to specify the exact comment for a particular video and now it's gone all right so let's see yeah here alex i'll get it for you let me get that sai workshop real quick and then in just a moment we are going to pop over to our swag quiz so just hang with us just another moment yeah uh alex it's in the uh data sex academy um here it is it's in the daysex academy org there you go all righty let's see what kind of questions how are we doing a question cedric we are good so question about the certifications so academy.datastack.com to have ordered the mooc and to get all the info datastack.com certification um jack dropped the link in uh discord and i think he will do the same on on youtube okay george real quick over in discord what is the optimum where clause contents except for the partition key which is obvious right so that depends on your query and what you need so in the case that we used here right this example um obviously we need that partition key but do i want to delete all of the comments or do i want to just delete a specific comment in this case i just want to delete a specific comment so that's going to dictate what i'm going to put in where clause in this case so even if i had multiple clustering columns like the example we had earlier was like last name first name so on and so forth it depends on what i'm looking to do right um if i just want to query by someone's last name and i want to get all the joneses well maybe i'm only going to include that last name on top of my partition key but if i want a specific person then i'm going to use both those values so when you're talking clustering columns it really depends on what you're doing with the query but you're right you always have to have that partition key all right so let's go ahead and just finish off with a couple things so this is the stuff that i was talking about these links we're going to drop here at the end um matter of fact if i'll grab them in a second so both if you want to get in deeper this is just a high level the high level workshop right this is getting you introduced to cassandra and there's so much we don't really get into here it's in a two-hour format take a look at this set of scenarios there is a ton of information here and it will actually get your hands on and with catacota it generates cassandra for you up in the cloud so even if you have like a lower resource laptop or low bandwidth this is a really awesome option and it's all free right so take a look at these links the second one here is for the data modeling course this is actually going to go in to some use cases um some actual real world use cases um i'm going to say there's an inventory one there's an iot one there's an e-commerce one there's a banking one i think in there so take a look here um also there's this datasacks.com dev um that's a nice place to go in it has a many of these resources are actually embedded in it but you can kind of go through and and take a look at all the stuff there it's really there for learning um and then um our classic courses if you will are available at datasex academy that's where you can go through a whole set of coursework this is all free by the way all this stuff is free um so you may have to like register for something but that's it we're not gonna send you ads or or do anything like that um all right and with that i think and oh yeah i almost forgot so for those of you who joined us on discord that's wonderful thank you and again if you want to continue the conversation go to discord another place you can go though is community.datastax.com that's like the stack overflow for cassandra right if you have any questions or if you've got like hey something's going on with my cluster or i'm not sure how to use the driver that is totally the place to go um we are on youtube we're on twitter we're in linkedin we're on twitch right come connect right if you want to hit us up on linkedin we're always happy to have new connections and again you can always feel free to ask us any questions or anything like that um yes with that thank you cedric you have anything else you want to add yeah you know if you like the content and obviously you you have because you're still there after two hours click on the button be below me you know subscribe to the channel we are doing those live workshops twice a week every week yeah and here let me um i'm dropping the links i'm just copying them out of the slides for you for the cassandra fundamentals uh in catacota and there's that one and then for the data modeling stuff another way to do it by the way um is if you just go to uh our catacota page if you go to um like catacota data stacks it should bring you yeah catacota datasets you will see in here there's more than just cassandra fundamentals and data modeling there is a ton right there's pulsar there's spring boots there's sai that's right there is an sai one i almost forgot about that right there's in each one of these if you were to go into one of these this is a whole course on its own right so if you take a look at say this one you'll find that when you click on that there's a whole bunch of information in here there's a whole and these are all hands-on that's how they're designed they're all hands-on so definitely get in
