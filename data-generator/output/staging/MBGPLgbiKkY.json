    "text": "[Applause] everybody Patrick Fadden Here I am here to talk to you a little bit about a really cool demo it's just a real easy example for connecting Java and Java app into Astra which is States X Cassandra is a service you'll find it's pretty simple but I'm gonna walk you through the process now this particular this particular example you'll see right here in front of you can go to this repo it's the getting started with Astra Java and in in this particular case there's two of them there's actually a Java component and then you'll see that there's also a UI component as well now the backend being micro services is all Java cuz that's the way it should be and the front-end is no js' also the way it should be and so there's these two work together so we're gonna need both of these and as you do to get started with anything like this if you go ahead and you do the git clone now I've just done this with both of my projects so I got the backend and I got the Ute front-end so I'm gonna walk through what the application does I'll just do it and then we'll get over to the code after we're done just so you can see how it all glues together this should be a nice quick way of an overview but really is as anything goes this is something you should go do with your own hands you should go out there and try it give it a shot and you'll learn a lot with it now because this is using Astra as a back-end we'll go ahead and use data stacks Astra if you're not familiar with that Astrid a two stacks comm and this is our Cassandra as a Services back-end so it's all Cassandra without your hassle and that is cool you don't have to download Cassandra to make this work so I'm gonna login to my account here and when I log in I'm given the option to create a new database now because Astra is really there's different tiers but really what we're doing for is for learning right now what I want to do is I want to create a new database on the free tier now you can use a free tiers free for you forever when you use it you could just use it as long as you want it will park it after a while but you can always revive it so think of this as like a great place for you to do your testing and playing around with Cassandra that you don't have to install anything and it's always up-to-date and somebody else has to run it which is the best part of this now so I'm going to create a real quick database here I'm gonna create this in US East one and I'm gonna give it a name let's call it getting started and same with the key space name and the database the the database username will be me in this case should you spell it correctly and my password and it's gonna be a terrible password I'm gonna tell everyone its password and dashlane is really trying to save me right now and sorry - lang you're not gonna save me from my terrible password I should create a better password but I forget what these are for these demos so let's just let's just roll with this so I'm gonna go ahead and launch my database so when I launch it it's gonna let me see what's happening it's going through the activity of actually creating it on the back end but let's while it's doing that let's go over and get our code ready so inside of the project we have a couple of things so let's go inside our getting started with Java so if you look inside this project you'll see that it's pretty simple Java project and of course this is all maven eyes so we're gonna use maven for everything and if you've never typed the word maven before do it now because it's gonna have to download half of the internet you know how maven works it's not as bad as SBT I don't think but you're gonna have to download half of the Internet to make this work to start with it's just how maven works but once you get maven going you could do a maven we can start it up using a maven command and we don't need to have a database yet and that's the key here this prot the way this project is set up is it will in the process of running it connect to the database and you'll see in a little bit how that works now with the spring boot run what its gonna do is it's gonna build the project and actually start running it and this is what we want it's gonna be the the back end will be fired up it goes through all its stuff nice little ASCII graphic with asker going but what it's doing is is getting everything ready for the front end and the back end to communicate now we can do the same over here let's go into getting started in the UI now this one is because it's a node application we're gonna be doing something a little differently in this case now because this is a node program and if you're a Java programmer and don't know anything about it we have all the instructions right here on the UI so some of the things you're gonna need for both of these is you're gonna have the current version of Java but also you're gonna have to have node Jas install the previous prereq the prerequisite is node version 8.1 and that's something if you're using a Mac this is where brew is your best friend you know brew install node nodejs and you are in a good place that's what I use and I use brew install NPM to get my NPM up to speed brew install NPM I think if I'm not mistaken will install everything you need but if you're on a Mac this is really in you're not using homebrew then you should really use homebrew that's how I get my whole environment set up now because this is running node we're gonna do an NPM install and then an NPM run start so let's go back over and we'll run that and it has to download a few things just like I said let's check out our Java program our Java program sitting over here running it took a while to write now let me let me stop this real quick and let me show you one thing you should check on is you should definitely check to see what version you're on so I'm running JDK 14 and that the minimum version is 11 for this and if you're not if you're running a Mac you're probably gonna run the old-school 1.8 and that's not going to work that does not have the right tools and everything all the API calls that it needs so again this is where I use homebrew to do my installs this is the most up-to-date version of Java that's out there but in this case what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna go ahead and spring run again get it running have it running let's check on our NPM over here oh it's downloading the Internet so we'll let that happen and while it's doing that let's go check on our database all right so it's still installing the database or initializing in a database we're gonna let that finish it usually takes about anywhere from 5-10 minutes five to ten minutes but we're gonna let this go it does say as long as 30 minutes but I don't think it's gonna take that long so we're gonna take a break and then we're gonna come right back to this and here's our database now awesome okay so when it starts up you get a bunch of really good information about connecting and this is really what you want to do you don't want a database just sitting there do you of course not you want to use it and to use it there's a few ways some of these are a distraction for today but are really cool like there is a rest endpoint in a graph QL endpoint that's built into Astra you can just use Astra directly with your API calls you don't even need to install Java or spring or anything else to make those connections you can just go directly to the database but that's not where we're talking about today because you're one of those people who want to build your own micro service layer and that's awesome so how do you do that well you're gonna have to do a couple of things first of all by creating the database we have a username and we have a password not visible because we know what it is it was password and in this case you know not being very secure I mean always gonna remember and now so are you and whenever we create the database we also get a secure connection bundle with it and this is really the key to making this work a secure connection bundle has a bunch of information including keys to connect to the database in a secure way because this isn't glued into one particular cloud and works in on pram or off pram or wherever you are in the world you have to use this connection bundle so to get it just simply click on it it'll download that thing into your local box so downloading the secure connect button is a really important part of this now inside that zip file is a bunch of really important information we will look at it a little later but once it's on my local computer that's that's super important and we'll get to that in a minute of how we actually integrate that in it has all the information we need from the from the Java side to make the connection to aster on the back end but let's see how things are going here now what we've already done so far is we've instan the java program running cool so let's get this going again and whenever we started this is gonna start the back end but let's get to the front end what's going on over here well the front end needs a couple of things so if you look at the instructions not only do we have to read node but then there's this thing in here about we need to have this put into an envy EMV file base address is localhost and 5,000 but if you look at the directions over here on the Java side it's actually gonna look for a different version now I'm sorry it's going to be looking for a different port so in the setup in a documentation here it's saying no no you want a base address of this so let's go ahead and set that up real quick and that's happening over here in your UI directory so if I'm gonna do this I'm just gonna use VI I'm gonna make that real quick and so what this does is it sets up an environment variable saying base addresses where where to find the base address so I'm gonna quit out of this now I can go over here and follow continue to just come all the instructions where I have a base address set I've done my install now I just need to do an NPM run start and we'll see how that looks so when I start that it's see how it pulled out my is pulling out my note environment great and it's running affronted and localhost 3,000 so let's go take a look at that now I've already typed that in earlier but of course it bombed out on me so now when I when I go to that you get this UI and the first thing that asks and the first thing that it asks you for is hey what about this database I need to connect to awesome we're on our way so I'm gonna put in my username which is me and dashlane is gonna be like are you sure you want to do this go away - lame because I used a terrible password does everyone remember what it was password you entered is very weak yes I know thank you - Lee and then the keyspace of course if you remember that was getting started and here's where we're gonna have to bring in our secure bundle now I'm gonna drag that over from another screen and just drop it in here cool next thing I'm gonna try out is testing the connection now with the secure bundle and all this information it should connect right up to the database test successful awesome so now at this point we have our UI connected to our back-end it's connected to a store the database I can hit save and we are off to the races so what it's going to do at this point is it's set up the situation where we can dump data into our aster database and to do that we say launch new journey and my spacecraft name is what just give a really good one like I don't want to say Voyager mmm there we go and the journey summary not about because we're just gonna do a quick pass and when you launch it it goes through and the UI actually has this really cool like star field simulation and it's rating and writing data into Astra of course that's what this does but it's a good demonstration of how to connect things this is not about this I don't think you need a star field simulator although if you put this on your desktop I'm sure everybody would be like wow man what is that this is my starship simulator running on data stack sastra I wrote it you can tell with that but really what it's here for is learning how to connect to Astra how to work with Cassandra etc so we finished our journey it wrote a few thousand rows over a thousand rows read a thousand rows great simulation okay at this point let's see how this thing works now as I mentioned this is a Java program that's running on spring so what do you get when you have a Java program running spring that's right swagger and you probably already saw this tab so what's going on here well this is running on my local host port 8080 but this is a place where you can actually explore the api's see what's going on like the credentials instruments controllers based graph controller instruments controller has get some posts this is a good place to play around and like any other micro service you can see what's actually being put in the gets inputs that you're doing on your database and because we're using swagger you can play around with it and actually try some stuff out and get some example values back now in this particular case this is actually connected to a stirrer on the back end if I was to look at a stirrer right now which I can I can go see that there's data in there so let's look at what's actually happening on the back end now I promised that I would give you a little peek under the covers to see what's going on and this is what I want you to look at as well is not just running it and getting that really super cool star field simulation whoo but learn a little bit about how you can connect your java program to Hofstra and as I mentioned it is very simple in a lot of ways because there's a lot of stuff that's done for you the secure connect bundle is a gateway to getting this done quickly but let's learn how to use it in the documentation there's this discussion about the session manager and like I said this is where the real magic is and that's this session manager has a few things that it does and we'll go look at the code here in a minute but if you're creating a new cql session and in that you're doing with a cloud secure connect bundle and so what you're saying is I like to create and like if you were using Cassandra like on your laptop you would connect to an IP address put any username and password etc but in this case what you're saying is no no no I'm gonna connect to Astra so here's my secure connection bundle zip file figure it out from there and that has all those certificates the security it sets up TLS all that good stuff and then you can put in your username your password and set the key space and you're done now if I was to look at the actual code itself this is the key part right here is this connect to Astra and when you're when this is running this assumes that from the UI you've gone through the whole process of putting in a username and password uploading that secure connect bundle but once it's in there you see it's this is how simple it is and it connects makes a new cql session using that connect bundle the username password and the key space that you put into the UI does a build and at that point it's done and it creates the needed schema if needed and from there you're just in that mode of like being able to dump data in and out of the system very simple now if you're writing your application this is something this is some boilerplate you could almost copy and paste this because this is how you connect to Cassandra running in Astra now I mentioned the secure Kinect bundle earlier let's take a look at what was actually in there so I actually exploded that thing so you could see what's going on now in there there's a lot going on that probably you don't even care about but there's something that's just kind of an interesting thing so you trust that this is what's happening I like to do this kind of stuff I like blowing up my zip files and see what's inside of it well here's this endpoint that I'm sure no one was gonna ever remember because this is a UUID hello random 128-bit number but it has the ports and all the information that's going to be required by the driver to connect to it it also has a key space information in it and then all the certificates so it can set up TLS and that this is the secure part of a secure bundle is that this stuff is all set up for you if you had to do this manually you would not want to use this but this connect bundle has everything all locked up for you so you have it ready to rock and so from this point I think it's the matter just going out and giving it a try if you have any questions jump on over to community data stacks comm let us know if you have any questions about how it runs but otherwise go out there and try it have fun with it and maybe make something else add a couple API calls for your own when you're done and you're you're having fun with it let us know we would like to hear from you [Music] you",
