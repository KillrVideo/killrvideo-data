evening wherever you are um you know i'd like to make sure that you are able to um hear my voice and adam can you say something so that we want to make sure you can hear two voices and no more than two i don't want to have an echo either right so if you can put in a thumbs up uh if you can hear both the voices that'll be great hey everyone great to uh great to see everyone on so uh yeah yeah excited to uh to keep this uh this series going here perfect i see a lot of thumbs up there and and i think we're good so let's get started on the uh workshop really exciting right um you know to be able to do this i know we kind of teased this uh last month right you know when we had quite a few people show up you know in the midst of holidays um but but i realize again you know we kind of hit the ground running um with the new year a lot of things to do but but really want to thank everybody um you know for being here um we have quite a few people um who are um you know um on the show and uh you know um you're gonna have the usual a lot of content a lot of hands-on where you're gonna do git pod uh and of course we're gonna have some fun too right you know we're gonna do the mentee uh we're gonna have some questions and we're going to give out some some swag for that as well um it doesn't matter which part of the world you're from uh as long as you win the minty quest right um so with that said let's proceed because we have a lot of things to cover today yeah that's right and we have a lot of people helping us um so it's just two of us on the screen but but this just wouldn't have happened without all these people and actually a lot more um you know um have to um at least recognize a lot of people um who who are you know not even on this on this slide uh who have kind of helped us and put put together this workshop they're going to be helping us with the chat they're going to also be helping um with other things as well so feel free to ask questions on the chat this stream is actually being done both on youtube and twitch uh we only respond to youtube chat um we don't do twitch chat uh and also you know if you have any more detailed questions uh you can take it on discard and you can you can get all that information um you know and i'll i'll cover that as well with that said let me introduce myself uh my name is raghav and srinivas and for whatever reason uh people in the world have a tough time pronouncing my name so i just go by rags rag's not the richest easiest way to remember me uh i'm on linkedin i'm on github and i'm on twitter of course right but i also uh i'm a mechanical engineer by by you know my original degree was in mechanical engineering but i like to kind of see um things in action you know because of that and and the closest we can see things in action in software um is really code so we will look at code today as well um and you know i'm a big fan of distributed systems i really love to talk to developers and one of the things i'm really extremely passionate about is what is referred to as the inner loop of development you know i talk about kubernetes and how it has helped i come from a cloud foundry background but but you know i still think we can do a lot on the inner loop with that said aaron go ahead oh hi i'm aaron um i i won't uh you know kind of like rags my last name's a little hard to pronounce too it's plutz but i just you know i'm just like yeah you can just call me urine i mean that's that's fine yeah i've heard a million bad pronunciations of it so i've grown kind of immune to it over the years but um anyway hi i'm also a developer advocate um specifically i like to advocate for the uh you know the sre dbre folks who are who are out there trying to um you know running or managing their own cassandra clusters and they're trying to make them better and better um you know so i try to help out in that space as much as i can i've been involved in the cassandra community for um wow for for like a decade now actually when i when i think about it um i i actually lead the uh the stack overflow um cassandra tag in uh in points so um you know if you've asked a question out there odds are i've i've helped you out and i've i've written a couple of books actually on uh cassandra and well nosql in general as well so um so yeah that's uh that that's a little about me you know happy to be here and and to help you all through this journey perfect um this is like like we said before um is a series it's part of a series we haven't quite figured out how many we're going to have right but but we know we we're gonna we know we're gonna have at least one or two more right um at least yeah at least yeah and and the nice thing about this is you know when you once you complete all the series uh you'll get a nice little badge like this which you can put on linkedin you know and you get the bragging rights uh after you get the badge of course there are some requirements for that uh today we'll talk about the homework um that that we recommend you do but we're gonna grade it only at the end of the workshop so let me jump right into housekeeping i already kind of talked a little bit about all of this uh we it's being streamed both on youtube and twitch um we don't really look at the twitch chat so please you know youtube chat there are plenty of people helping us um questions uh if you have more detailed questions i we suggest you take it to discard uh because you know there it's not just us the developer advocacy team but there is the rest of uh data stacks who can help you maybe even the rest of the cassandra community you can help um so just just take it out there uh and and for games and quizzes there's mentee.com uh okay and and there is a code uh that you can get uh that you will see in a little bit once i get up to minty um you we will ask you a few questions to get get an idea of the audience we are talking to because we just want to make tailor it to the right audience so we have an idea of what the audience is going to be but just want to make sure that we are not completely off right and and you know we're going to use the same mentee.com the same code uh to do the swag and some of you have attended the workshops earlier you know the drill but but you know for some of you who are new uh welcome by the way um you know just just you know keep an eye on this mentee.com there are lots of resources available you know it's a great time to be a developer right you know there are really cool things so you know uh one of the first things that you know i started when i was coding in kernighan and richie you know programming in c i don't know if you guys remember the first program was hello world right and nowadays we get measured by time to first hello world right um so so the the moment you can get started uh how quickly you can get started how quickly you can get your hands dirty how quickly you can roll up your sleeves and start writing code there are plenty of resources um you know if you go to astra you can get you know we'll talk about this you can get a database that you can pretty much use for production gitpod is the ide that we're going to be using is the ide in the cloud and we can't talk enough about that we'll talk about that later there are resources in katakura there's resources in github um you know there are academy courses certifications you name it you know like i said you know golden uh age for a developer okay with that said let me move to mentee is that a good time to do mentee anything else you want to add adam you know i would i would just uh i would just add rags that um it you know it really is a great time to be a developer but it's like it's also you know in development time it's it takes a while to get that development environment set up and um you know you'll see that we're using we're using it pod today to kind of speed up that process but rags it's like when you and i were younger it's like computers of that era in the 80s they begged to be programmed you know like i had a tandy and i would log into that thing and it would have i'd be at a basic prompt like like first thing you know and um i i really kind of i have a special place in my heart for computers of that age but um so so yeah we're going to do our best to uh you know make it yeah that's easy actually because you know well like i said when i wrote my time to first hello world my first ever word in kerning and ritchie it's a lot easier to do that but but today you have to bring a lot of stuff and today you'll see in get part there are lots of things that we bring together right uh make it easier for you you know these are kind of the details that you really don't need to worry about but if you want to take a peek you know nothing is secret here you know you can you can look at you know the git part and how we set things up and all that um so so pretty cool all right so let's make sure that you guys can see the code and let's start playing maintain okay here's the code all right guys ready okay and there and there's a shorthand command there like a slash right to get the code yeah i'm in my nightbot too many things to talk about so right right let me again i i know we get this all the time this is the code you know seven nine four six six eight nine six looks like the nightbot is not started i'd appreciate if somebody from our group can do that yeah yeah that'd be a big help oh oh the oh rigs the the menti code is being covered by your head covered by my head could so i will get rid of my head good point yeah it looks like i'm in there twice oh you're there twice okay i'll get rid of that okay how about that hey there we go there we go all the fun of getting started let me do this all right let me come back thank you thanks for all the help again so i'm gonna get rid of my head yeah and it does happen yeah all right so for now we'll get rid of my heads and then we'll worry about it all right so moving on okay let's see if everybody can join let's see how many people have joined the first question that we typically ask where in the world are you from if you see some indian darts european dots some uk dots or ireland could it be nice always very exciting to see this darts pop up right i do that i've done this so many times but it's still so exciting yeah yeah yeah very cool if you can put it in mentee that'll be really appreciated and the code again there is seven nine four six six eight nine six i know there are a few people joined i'm sure we can do a little bit better thank you again for those of you who are you know really giving up a little bit of sleep i guess you know to attend the workshop perfect all right let's let's keep moving have you been to any of our workshops before quite a few yeses cool a lot of new folks thank you welcome like to see more all right again for those of you the 20 of you who have been to our workshops before you know the drill uh feel free to jump in the chat and help us out all right did you attend the e-com workshop in december 2021 this was the uh workshop that we were talking about so 18 people know there's only one person who attended and and that's kind of what we we think yeah so don't worry you know don't worry at all because you know we're gonna start from scratch pretty much but if the one person you know who's already been here and those of you who probably have not responded uh two people now um you know we can we can set you up in such a way that you're not going to waste too much time uh in the early setup okay so this kind of what we expected as well yeah exactly okay how much experience do you have with apache cassandra never used it quite a few more than five years one person ooh is that you aaron who's answering that this kind of what we expect right um i think it's a good mix um less than a year quite a few uh but never used it before no worries okay we will we will set you up with the cassandra with what is referred to as astra all right next moving on what's your experience with nosql databases never used it you know kind of corresponds to what we saw earlier right yeah just trying to figure out if you know you've used something else as well three masters there or is it one master a lot is three okay never used it as 36 i have some experience that's good that's kind of what we expect and i think i have one more question so i think i think this is in line uh since we're going to be doing java programming today you know it's primarily spring boot i just want to get an idea of how many people uh oh that's great a lot of java programmers that is cool that is nice isn't it yeah yeah so we can talk a little bit you know dive deep into uh spring boot a little bit um so welcome those of you who those of you who have never done java don't worry um you know we will we will walk you through as long as you're you know open-minded i think you'll be good you know no no worries if you if you're not an expert in java and by the way i own my java one shirt from from long back yeah pretty cool um okay um anything else uh aaron to add uh i think i think uh this is kind of in lines with what um you know we were expecting right um no worries on that exactly all right uh with that said let's share your presentation and i know you want to take it from the architecture side right so are we at that point all right so give us a second yeah we can make you [Music] your screen and you're good to go all right all right hang on hang on all right that's right yeah that looks like uh it looks like i'm sharing now outstanding i'm sharing now outstanding right so this is actually part number two of um of the e-commerce series of the e-commerce um again if you weren't at part number one if you were no worries at all the code from part one is still there and we'll walk you through um and we'll take care of the the data model and the data data part one as well so no worries as well um but this is part two this is you is that we we want to show how to do this quickly we want to show how to do this you know with tools like javascript and datasets those are the two things that we're really going to focus uh focusing on we're going to focus on and you'll see how quickly and you'll uh by using these tools so for those of you who have uh for those not use the whole i don't know you know maybe you've uh you know done a lot of work in the relationship let me try to fix that yeah yeah yeah keep talking so that i can okay how is that is that is that getting any better all right let me keep talking and yeah yeah oh yeah looks like my voice is still looping okay oh hey that says better somebody said better all right it's gone yeah it's gone it's gone yeah i just don't know i need to work this out but when i trans transition between mentee and presentation something something seems to happen but but i'll figure that out keep going yeah yeah okay okay okay all right well anyway um going to go into this slide for for those of you oh now it says video and audio not in sync okay let's see that's strange stefano okay oh yep okay we're good you know what and we've had a request for me to redo that last slide so why don't i why don't i do that yeah all right anyway technical hurdles aside um so this is our our part two of our e-commerce series um you know of looking at like um like common you know e-commerce retail commonly known as e-tail um solutions that that folks want to see you know how you can take our tool set and um and and build out things that um you know are common out there that uh you know that that can help large enterprises build and uh and support e-commerce i mean the idea is that we're going to show you how to do that today with um you know really quickly with uh java spring boot and data stacks aster db those are the two technologies we're going to uh going to focus on today now for those of you who have not used nosql you know maybe you've uh you've worked quite a bit in the relational database world that's cool um we want to do a quick talk about um between acid and base you know you know two abbreviations that um you know that are that are common with um you know with each of those each of those databases respectively um you know so on the relational database side you know yet you have things like um you know atomicity consistency isolation and durability um and that that's that's something that's typical of relational databases um now on the nosql side that you you have things that are you know basically available soft state eventual consistency um oh do we have our echo back again yeah that's what i heard so let me see if i can do something about this um i have set it up oh alex says no it's good okay it may be something about all right okay okay um anyway so the idea is is that when you use a non-relational or a no sql database um you know you're you're making you're making um trade-offs is essentially what what it is it's it's a system it's a series of trade-offs that are made you know once you go to uh to a distributed database you know like um like like data sacks astrodb um you know so so eventually you know you you have to say that things are you know in in the data sacks astro world you know you'll you'll write you'll write your rows and um you'll have what's called eventual consistency whereas that first replica will be written maybe the second one you know but the third you're not going to wait for conversation or confirmation on you know you'll it'll it'll come back and um you know you'll you'll kind of trust that it's that it's made so you know there are there are things over the years that have come up with um apache cassandra that that try to help solve that eventual consistency problem but um ideally you know what what you have is that we're you know embracing a base strategy instead of an acid strategy um because there are other things that are more important to us than having data be immediately consistent so that's uh that's essentially it regs anything to add on that no i think i think uh you know at some point of time um you know people were like oh you can't have eventual consistency with uh with acid right um you know it's just not um you know it's it's kind of mutually exclusive kind of thing right but but uh actually even some of the um you know the uh typical e-commerce kind of applications you know which which we're going to talk talk about today uh you can still do with base um you know you may have to do a little bit of a little bit more work uh but but you know from an application perspective uh but but that's going to produce a lot of gains in terms of scaling and you know other aspects that have become more important these days so i see a question in the chat around elaborating on real world use cases of base versus acid you know obviously for for acid you know we can think of lots of ways in which um you know having acid transactions really really helps out like when you have you know multiple tables that may need to be updated you there are ways that you can encapsulate that in the transaction to to make it so that those uh those those values are applied atomically um now in the in the nosql world you know as as far as a use case where it's okay not to have that um you know think about um think about like a like a personalization or a recommendations use case um where you know you you've got uh you've got folks who are out there on a website and they they maybe buy like put like star wars action figures in their cart and then they get suggestions for like star wars legos star wars videos you know so on and so forth you know if all of those options aren't immediately available to show them ah that's uh that's not really the end of the world you know if you're showing them that that's not if you're showing them one that that maybe is a part of the group but isn't a perfect match that's that's okay that's okay so so that's an example where i would argue that that base is um is perfectly acceptable yeah too and and in today's days of fashion and all that right you know probably fashions are going to come back so maybe you don't want the latest anyway i'm just kidding [Laughter] all right so a quick chat through um through what we're going to have for you know just the architecture of our stack um you know for the for the user interface um you know our our team behind us chris will height specifically has done a great job of putting together like uh like a node.js react type of uh type of ui using tailwind css so it's it's kind of like uh you know if you want to call it plug and play website components that's um you know a lot of what a lot of what's gone into this but we're not going to focus on the ui too much the uh the backend service layer is actually built out um you know restful endpoints but it's built out on uh you know spring boot in java and then the back end of course you know goes off of a spring data repositories and everything gets stored in data stacks astrodb um and and we'll cover why uh why that's why that's actually a really important part of the stack as well so and we'll cover this now why astrodb i mean can can other databases handle this well i mean yes and no but um you know what you have to think about is with the relational database and and i've supported um you know of a fortune 50 website before that's run on a relational database um because in 2005 that was really all we had at the time um and and the thing is is that scaling you know when you're looking at like um horizontal scaling for for sure is almost non-existent um vertical scaling you know adding more ram more cpu more disk is is limited i mean you can do it it'll get you through uh through a short patch but eventually you're gonna hit a limit on how much ram a motherboard can address and and or how many physical cpu sockets you have or how many drives your server can address it's you're eventually going to run into that limit um so obviously when you're looking at a relational database you know even even today with um most relational databases have a way to do um you know like like uh distributed data so you can add like a primary secondary you know more replicas it's more of an add-on rather than a than a core component and thus it kind of performs like an add-on which is um you know not great when uh when you're trying to to run you know and and and get and drive um you know a few million dollars worth of sales it can be it could be problematic um geographic distribution is also a challenge when you're working with like add-on distribution components like that and that's an important point and when you know especially when your business may have users on like the east coast and the west coast of the united states and in eastern and western europe um you know it's important to get your data to where your customers are because you don't want them making a data call halfway around the world that's going to uh that's not going to be a fun fun uh situation for anyone now you could also use like a like a distributed document store um the thing is is that with most document stores consistency becomes more of a focus more of a concern um so that that stronger consistency is um is actually going to limit throughput you know usually with with primary secondary um architecture what ends up happening is that writes and reads go through a single a single instance but um you know what what happens from there is that yeah you can you can let you can have some have options like you know allowing reads from the secondary but that will only go so far in terms of allowing your throughput to grow um so what ends up happening is that you know your database activity specifically your reads becomes cpu bound and that's that's where things get problematic um you know one thing that um you know a lot of document stores are big on is oh we're schema-less you don't need to worry about schema with us um you know that was really great early on but uh but as as time progressed as data modeling progressed you know we we started to realize that you know schema's actually important and when you enforce schema um you're you're actually kind of future proofing your your database it it becomes a lot easier to um you know to to work on services and and build components out when you when you have a really good idea of what the schema is um and of course if you're you're running your own document store and you have different node types um that can be that can be challenging you know so if you're running in a situation where you have heterogeneous node type so maybe you have like uh like a primary node maybe you have like a secondary node maybe you have like a config server or a routing server you know it all becomes very very difficult to manage going forward when um you know when your devops or database team takes a look at that so um cassandra and specifically astrodb solves all these issues just in its inherent uh inherent architecture so again kind of the cool thing about astra you know i just mentioned the uh you know that there's no operational overhead it is a software as a service uh so it so it's all in the cloud um i talked a little about geographic awareness and how that's difficult with some other products well with astrodb you get that you can have your data replicated to multiple geographic areas and that's that's very very easy to do you're also not bound to a single cloud vendor you know uh astrodb runs in aws azure and uh gcp so no worries there and no touch scalability so when your database reaches a point where it needs more resources you know we have some um you know some things behind the scenes that take care of expanding that out for you all right well with that rags i think we can jump to um step number two in the readme uh which is getting everyone an instance of uh of an astra cluster perfect um all right let me see let me make sure yeah you want me yeah stop sharing you're fine i will i'll take care of it mine okay all right so you should be able to see my screen here and uh let's get started um the first thing i do and and let me put myself on full screen so that you guys can see better um and essentially what what i do is i start with the github link okay and and if for those of you um who might be wondering where's the github link you know just put a bang or exclamation uh github and it will lead you you know it'll give you the url um and and all that i do is bring this up right and now i'm in business right so so what i do is i go to this github site look at the readme which is what you're seeing right here and like what aaron said let's look at step number two which is create the astrodb instance i know that there are only two people or maybe three you know who attended the previous workshop right so you may not have created this before if you have created this before i'm gonna say it right now you can skip to step c okay don't need to worry about you know 2a and 2b but if you haven't then what i suggest you do is start with this step um you know where you register for astra so the easiest way to register no credit card required um you know no you know you don't have to put in any complicated code or anything like that you just have to click on this link right i'm going to click on this link and i'm going to open the link in new window i'm probably not going to go through this okay but essentially what you have to do is you have to put in your first name your last name your email and you know create a password and all that right you know um so pretty straightforward right so what i'm going to do instead is i'm just going to say sign in right and it's going to ask me for my password right and hopefully remember this right and what i can do is i can just say sign in right i'm not going to worry about this okay it might ask you these questions okay which is what is your primary goal in using astra put in whatever is relevant to you okay so what is your primary programming language um really java okay but it can be anything right um what kind of i'm really more of a back-end engineer because you know only when people when something is broken uh people uh remember me or or they think of me right exactly yeah yeah yeah when you get the photo four a.m call right um so anyway are you currently running in uh cassandra clare yeah i'm gonna say yes although you know i'm not running any production workloads right um and and we are here to help right you know so you can schedule a time to talk to a technical specialist if you want um you know don't hesitate if you need any help uh but even after you finish the sign up you can you can always do a chat um by you know this live chat feature right so once you're here i've already created you know i think with the free account you can only create five databases okay so if i try to create a new database let's see what happens um oh actually i got one more maybe it'll it'll tell me at the end but i'm not going to try that okay so let's let's leave it like that um and and then uh what you're going to do is you're going to create i think this has changed i don't remember this as being create server serverless database but but it doesn't matter okay so all that you're going to do is you're going to do a create database okay you're going to provide the database name as demos correct correct me if i'm wrong and this is e-commerce yes okay i will okay so let me see why um you you're not able to i'll i'll figure that out in this in a little bit uh but but you know just to paraphrase what aaron said um you know the database name doesn't really matter uh it's the key space name that matters a little bit more okay or it does matter i mean everything you can change it you know if you can go into the program and change it to yourself if you want but but essentially what what's going to happen when you know you can pick any region you want you know typically we suggest you pick something that's close to you you know google cloud you know i'm i'm in boston massachusetts so you know i picked the uh the monks corner okay um or really ashman virginia whatever right and and and we're good to go okay so once you hit this um you know you can you can create the database uh and and you will be um you know essentially it will create a database for you okay so so let's not worry about that let's go back okay and and let me actually bring that up again okay sorry i have to go in for the signing again but i was going to tell you one important thing which i missed you want to make sure that the database is active okay and you'll see that in a second okay you'll see uh these different databases and you'll see some of these on standby and what we do this is for efficiency and also to be able to respond quickly you can see demos is an active state fruits is an active state but everything else is in standby if you want to you know move something from a standby you just hit connect and you hit one more or just say sql console and and essentially you know it'll say resuming your database please try again shortly and it should be up and running in a little bit okay i know a whole lot of information here but but you know i'd appreciate if you can put a thumbs up once you have this database active um you know having the database active is critical is important uh after that you'll be good to go okay so let's see some thumbs up anybody able to create anybody having trouble did i miss any steps aaron can you talk and see if he can uh him if people can hear you yeah i'll uh try talking again i don't know if it helps or not or if i'm i'm audible yet all right so how do you create again you know just go back to um let me get rid of this give me a second just follow the steps here it this also has a nice walkthrough which walks through you know how to create the um the database name and the key space name okay so essentially you sign in and then provide the database name so you do the create database you can you provide the database name you know don't don't take these names just use the appropriate names that we have provided um so which is the database name is demos and the key space name is e-commerce okay all right anybody having trouble um you know let's see some more thumbs up please of those of you if it's pending it's no big deal it's going to take a little bit of time to get active uh but i'd like to see some more uh thumbs up before we proceed because you know this is you know kind of critical uh pradeep who's using his mobile uh you know i think it's gonna be a little challenging to to do this workshop on the mobile uh my suggestion is you know if you can find a browser on a laptop i think that might be a lot easier okay yeah shruti says it's pending which is fine no no big deal right so once you've done this um you know remember i there was a connect and a sql console okay so let me show that because i don't think we put the instructions in there maybe we should have put that a little bit better so let me try that again once more okay go back to where you registered okay and you're going to go back again okay this time i'm going to save it just in case i need to come back all right and then click on the database okay and say connect and sql console and you'll be thrown into the sql console all right and you can do something like describe key spaces okay or you can you can just follow this um the instructions that that were there okay so let me make sure let me open that in another tab so that you know i can i can keep these two going one of the nice things about git part and you'll see that in a second is it keeps a reference to your git repository so you can use that okay all right so make sure you get the sql console and like i said if it's impending it might take a little bit of time you might see a some message something like this resuming your database please try again shortly and once you have this then you're going to open the sql console on astra okay and i showed you how to do that let me repeat that for those of you who may be trying to find this you just hit on connect and then sql console and you should be able to see this can we see a few thumbs up when you see the sql console and if you have if you're having trouble let us know okay just curious if uh if people can hear me yet or if i'm or if i'm still muted somehow i think you should be good perfect lots of thumbs up that's good that's good oh hey someone said we hear you sorry about that right i didn't mean to all right so what do you think we should do proceed yeah i i think we're good i know what i thought i saw a question in the the chat around getting to cql console um but yeah let me repeat that step again because it's just that's kind of critical right so so what you do is if you go to the dashboard okay so um let me go to dashboard and make it easier here so let me go to the dashboard okay you'll see all the databases you know if you have created a database for the first time if you have registered just now you'll probably only see one you know i have one here i mean i have five here um so um click the right database right in this case i have a few i want to make sure i'm clicking on the database which has the key space of e-commerce you know just verify that it has the key space and then just hit connect and the sql console tab okay and it will bring you to the sql console okay so and if you want to do this just do a describe key spaces okay and you should be able to see um e-commerce or maybe not the first time around um you know you can you can always create one all right so let's go back and start using use e-commerce and then start creating the different tables okay so one of the nice things to do in in all of this is kind of do defensive programming as it's referred to so you create a table if it does not exist you don't want to overwrite something right if it's already there and then oops you know you're in trouble right so so what we tend to do is if it doesn't exist so just all that i'm going to do is take this okay and put it in the sql console okay let's see what happens okay so let's let me do the first step which is use e-commerce okay and maybe my um again you know you may want to do this describe tables okay which will show all the tables that you have okay so you can see here that i've already created all of this okay um and and you know it doesn't matter if you do this because you know only if it exists or if it doesn't exist it's going to create new right so if it does not exist then create a new category create a new table called price create a new table called product create a new table color whatever that is right did i jump ahead yeah you know i think you went a little bit ahead but i i think we're okay yeah i'll uh i'll cover the uh you know getting the um ddl code in there in um in the data model section so that'll be that'll be coming up shortly okay didn't mean to steal your thunder aaron so so why don't you why don't you get started with the presentation then and and please put in the thumbs up um you know once once you're done creating uh you know the key space and everything is in active state and so on okay so let me give you control and i don't see you there um all right you're good to go all right all right excellent um um people can uh people can still hear me still hear me right i how are we how are we doing on echo yes people can hear you multiple times actually exactly all right keep going yeah i think are are we okay now oh it seems fine now outstanding outstanding um so yes let's dig into uh into some of the use cases um you know as to as to what we're going to be building out here so when you're putting together an e-commerce website there are a lot of components that uh that go into it um you know so so when you know we were going through on um you know which which components we were going to focus on which ones we could run workshops on you know the list is very very long but um but in terms of getting going there's there's a lot of core components that you actually need um and those core components kind of reveal themselves the more you the more you look at um you know the the ones that everyone else is dependent on um so the last session you know the one regs talked about in december we focused on the product services well today we're going to focus on the cart services um so that's uh that's what we're going to look at today and um yeah with the the next sessions you can see that we have um you know hopefully two more coming yet all right so today with uh the shopping cart you know we really have two services that we're going to be concerned with so we have like user cart data or it's it's almost like metadata data about the cart itself um and then we have the cart product services which is really which is really about um you know what is in the cart and uh you know how do we persist how do we how do we maintain that so getting into the into the data models um real quick a a short um crash course if you will on on cassandra or distributed data modeling um is that we're going to really drive toward this one aspect called denormalization you know so that's where we we um you know we adjust our tables for performance and we build tables specifically to suit a query and sometimes what ends up happening in the relational or sorry non-relational database world is that you end up with one table supporting one query and you have to remember that that's okay um so the pros of that is hey we get usually get really really fast reads um and you have a simple query model too uh what the cons though is that sometimes you know you you do that through data duplication um but really that's that's okay um disk is cheap and uh that's kind of the assumption that um you know distributed data modeling really thrives up now the tricky part though is that that does involve manual you know data integrity enforcement uh which can be which can be a little tricky but um you know a good visual of this is that if we look at the relational world you know like if i was going to to query employees and i wanted to know what departments they were in and i had separate tables for employees and departments you know from a relational third normal form world this would be really great but what this looks like in the cassandra world is that you'd really build one table to support that query and that's where you don't have to worry about doing things like joins or setting up foreign keys or you know anything else that that goes into to complicate that uh that query model so let me ask you a question adam um are all joints evil or or is it okay sometimes you know because uh one of the things that uh a lot of people within data stacks are really the nosql word you know kind of like to talk about is uh you don't let friends do joints right um so so in that context um you know where is normalization where you draw the line you know sometimes it's it doesn't really depend on the use case um you know how do you kind of uh because you know when when you normalize it's it's very easy for me you know i just follow the steps and and it's done right whereas in denormalization i have to think a little bit you know um more right so so any any advice there well well regs there's a there's a saying in the database world and this this actually applies to both relational and no sql databases it is is um you normalize till it hurts and you denormalize until it works and that's that's really that's really the line that you that you try to walk with this um because because that's actually you know kind of a dirty little secret in the relational world that that we don't like to talk about is that hey when you denormalize there it helps too so i would say not all joins are bad you know especially if you're in a you're in a relational database um to to be honest i try to stick to inner joins as opposed to left joins whenever possible um and you definitely don't want to do what's called a cartesian join that can be um that can be really really really really bad so i would say joins are good you know use case appropriate and uh in moderation how about that yeah that's great and that kind of leads into a question that kamlesh is asking on chat uh is it one query for one table and how do you support crud uh on a table and we're going to get to that right so we are going to get to that yeah there there are ways to um there there are ways to look at um um you you can uh you can provide atomicity still in the uh cassandra astrodb world and uh and make sure that um you know you have an update that might go to multiple tables there are ways you can get it to fail where if it fails for one table you fail it for all of them and then at least then you're not out of you're not out of sync so oh and and someone's asking about what an inner right right to join who oh you know i would i yeah i tended to um like i said i tend to stick to in my relational days stick to inner join and uh yeah it'd have to be it'd have to be a really odd case well the thing is though is that really if i remember right the table on i'm gonna get this wrong but the table on the left i think is the one that's in your from clause right and then you're you're joining to the other and then right is really like if you're you're joining on a table but you're going back to the one in the from clause so i i think that if you do your sequel right you shouldn't ever need a right join but uh that's just that's just me anyway it's um yeah i can i can never get those left joints and right joints it's always a challenge but but but in general i i think that advice is good but anyway so of course you know now that um you know that we're looking at uh denormalizing you know doing things in as3db i have some some tips for large scale cassandra modeling of course um you know first of all data that's queried together should be stored together you know you still want to try and make your data call in one trip and back um try not if you can help it to build to build data sets from from multiple queries because obviously you know we talked a little about joins in the nosql world that means doing a uh an outside join which isn't any fun to do either to be honest um so again you know data that needs to be queried together should be stored together that goes to that whole you know one table supports one query kind of an aspect um use high cardinality keys you're going to hear me talk about this a lot um and what's hard car cardinality high cardinality means there there's a lot of possible values you know so like a um like a uuid that that would have like you know has billions of of uh you know possible values there um as an example of something that's low cardinality take a boolean you know you really have only two possible values there true or false i mean you could argue null but no it's really true or false and then um you know if you were to partition or distribute based on a boolean you'd have two partitions and that would be it and that wouldn't be you know any any good at all um so you want in order to encourage optimal data distribution you know you you want to make sure you're using high cardinality keys yeah and and then of course might be a good idea to to kind of hint on some of these might be part of the mentee quiz so pay attention yeah you know so um all of these are probably going to be in some form or another so so you know it might help to pay attention and and feel free again you know if there are any questions you want to put in chat as well all right so the next point i would say you know no full table scans um you know every every query in asterdb and by proxy cassandra should have a where clause you know you could because the thing is that if you're if you're doing a full table scan you can't make any guarantees about which rows are on which node so essentially to scan a whole table it has to go to every node in the cluster and that gets that gets expensive when we're talking when we're talking operational time additionally things tend to run better when you keep things small so think about small column values small partitions small result sets the smaller you can keep things the happier you're going to be um you know i i like to talk about a cluster i've supported in the past that um you know it could even with ssl running on this cassandra cluster it could support um a quarter of a million reads a second and it could do that at a p95 latency of like three milliseconds usually and it was just insanely fast and the reason we were able to get those kind of speed numbers is because the the result set for each of those queries was it was tiny i mean it was like single digits in terms of of uh you know k bytes in terms of what you'd get back so the smaller you can keep things the happier you're gonna be okay um so in breaking down the data model for our for shopping carts you know we're going to take it taking a considerable approach here of hey how do we how do we think about these things you know how do we talk through some of the problems around here you know so we we think about well i'm a user and i'm on a i'm on a website and you know i have a i have a shopping cart you know and this cart has things it um you know it has an identifier it's um you know i could have a name for the card if we're talking about like um you know building out like a like a shopping list or or something like that as well um you know it a cart of course is associated with a user um and a cart can be active or a cart could be inactive um and again that goes back to the uh the shopping list uh question as well so of course what does a cart do what's what's in it well you know of course shopping carts contain products and you know you know one shopping cart can have many products and you know a product will have things like it'll have an identifier um it'll have a name a description it'll have a price um so this is this is kind of high level how we think about how these things uh you know translate into some of the the questions we're gonna have to ask this data model and that of course leads into our questions about hey what what queries are we going to need here well you know as a user i need to be able to query you know my shopping carts and that means you know i have like an like an active cart or um you know maybe i want to see wanna see all of my available carts additionally the user would need to view all products in their cart they would need to add products to the cart and of course they're going to need to be able to remove a product from their cart as well um so so again these are the things to think about when we start you know um putting code behind how do we make this all work how do we make this all kind of gel together so some other things to consider and um this is just um this is just my my personal experience here um you know my my last job i supported um about 200 cassandra clusters um and that was across thousands of nodes um and i can tell you that um the shopping carts that we that we supported were under i wouldn't say constant but a bot attack was something that was i mean it was it wasn't rare it act it actually happened more than um more than we'd prefer and really what would happen is you'd have a cassandra node that would you know kind of max out its resources because you'd have a cart that was experiencing hundreds sometimes thousands of product ads in a second and you'd see the these carts get really really big um so you know there was there was a lot of debate that went that went back and forth um in terms of um you know what is the actual goal what are the bots trying to do you know most people thought that was really it was really they were trying to like scrape prices from us so that they can use them elsewhere or compare elsewhere but again one thing that that kind of narrows that avenue of attack is to have a time to live on um on your cart data you know and that's just because old carts sit around and you know they're they're avenues of attack for the for this kind of thing to happen now that's not to say that a bot's not smart enough to create a new card but again this is about you know kind of narrowing that uh that attack avenue um so so this specific property that you can put on a table is called the default time to live and it's a it's in a number of seconds um and in this particular case that five million one hundred eighty four thousand comes out to 60 days now for your business case or retail case maybe you want your carts to live longer maybe your carts are shorter lived you know that's that's okay you can adjust that as your business requirements dictate but the thing to remember is that you just don't want them hanging around there forever also um you know i kind of hinted at it with the with the amount of activity we'd see on a single cart and that having a rate limiter on the product ad service is a really really good idea um you know because there are ways that you can tell human activity from bot activity in this respect you know if there are hundreds of ads happening in a second i i'm pretty sure that's not somebody you know with a mouse moving around navigating your product hierarchy and managing to add hundreds of products in a second um that's that's more than likely a bot um you know so so finding some way you know to limit that to a sane amount i i think is a good approach as well all right um getting down to the the logical data model you know um and just to point out that um you know these models are going to be labeled a little differently you know from um you know from what you'll see in a typical er diagram you know where a typical er diagram would point out things like primary keys and foreign keys um excuse me here you can see in our legend that pk is partition key clustering key is uh is ck um you know so when we talk about active carts by user you know really you'd be keying off of that that user id you know and you you'd pull back you know a lot of that a lot of that metadata here um all carts by user you know if you wanted to see all the carts that that user had you know it'll it'll pull back a lot of the same data but um you know you're gonna want to add additional clustering keys for you know uniqueness that'll that'll that'll kind of help out there um and then of course you know you're going to want to know how many carts are there or sorry how many products are there in a particular cart um obviously you know you have that card id as a partitioning key um but then you can add things like timestamp to uh to make sure that your cart shows the items in the order they're added um and also if you happen to get two items added at the exact same time as rare as that is you know you have a you have a product id there that can uh that can be a tiebreaker all right and further refining that down into um you know what the the physical data model looks like in terms of you know what what you put into astrodb you know we really it really come to two tables here you know where we have the user cart table you know oh and and somehow my my uh clustering key on card idea got to be a different color oh how about that [Laughter] but um but but yeah and then of course you know you also have the the cart product data so really these two tables are what we're going to be uh focusing on today so um here's our our user cart table um you know again you know we have we have a user id with a uh uuid and that's our partition key um and just a quick breakdown of the as3db cassandra primary key structure you know we have a user the first one listed is always the partition key um so that's that's important to remember and then any of any of them after that are our clustering keys now there are ways to add a composite partition key but uh we're not going to delve into that into that today um you know so then we have things in the in the cart along with the user id like cart name and card id that again kind of help ensure uniqueness um user email is there you know again just to kind of help tie it to that um tie it to that user you know they're obviously you'll store the email in other places but there are times when you'll want that user email you know for use and use and other things and it it helps to have it as a part of that cart data um you'll notice here that user email is defined as static and that means that it is stored with the partition key and the easiest way to explain that is just um that that user email is going to be the same across all the carts so that way we only store it once and it's um you know kind of a quick way to associate it back to that uh that cart data um and then of course down here we're enforcing our ttl with that default time to live of uh of six months and second so let's say in a multi-tenant scenario um this what does default time to live do does it get rid of the entire table or does it get rid of uh the table tenant or you know obviously it's not going to get rid of the entire table right so yeah it'll um it'll actually do it um by by you know row if you want you want to think about it that way um you can actually have ttls enforced on specific column values um but um but in this case it'll it'll just um by default i'm pretty sure it'll just run off of the partition key um that way when the cart has been there for you know a six month period you know it'll it'll check it based on the based on the right time and then it'll actually write a tombstone over the top of it so for those of you who have you know used cassandra before it is important to point out that using a ttl does write a tombstone but um but again that's that's okay good question right all right so for cart products um again we're here to solve the uh the cart query um you know i talked a little bit about um you know how we have this card id as the partition key and then um you know we have our product timestamp to to ensure that the um the products in the cart are listed in the order that we add them and then a product id there just for a little extra uniqueness and we're also enforcing our ttl here as well um you know and that and that ttl it's going to vary a little bit based on the based on that times that the products are added to the cart but um you know that's that that's okay all right well reg now we can jump to uh number three in the readme i know i've jumped a little bit ahead but uh but let me make sure i go to step three um all right so i'm gonna get rid of your screen and every time i get rid of your screen somehow you'll lose your audio so just remind me to to and back again okay all right okay all right so going back to my uh github link right that's kind of what i'm doing you know execute session one product data model right go back to your sql right uh so so here's my sql and all that i do is regs i see a blank there you go what you're gonna see here is you're gonna um cut and paste um you know the the data models you know the product data models the shopping cart data models and populate the data i mean in a real life scenario you will probably not insert like this you know you'll do a bulk data bulk upload or something like that uh and and you definitely definitely not do a select star from category or something like that because you know we really dissuade that because what it's doing is it's probably going to go to every partition and and gather it up which is not a good idea right um but um you know since we're kind of you know again in the process of learning uh i think i it's probably okay all right so please give me a thumbs up when you're able to add the data models and populate the data again you know there is like you can if you hover over this particular window you know you'll see something like this all that you need to do is copy it okay go to your sql and paste it that's it okay you're good to go okay so you can see here right um i know there have been some questions there are already some thumbs up coming up that's great fantastic uh i know there was one question from i missed that part but i was going to talk about that let's see yeah so so somebody was asking you know um and and the suggestion by a community um chat was that uh follow along the read me and you'll you'll be good to go really follow along they read me and you'll be good to go and that's kind of what i do as well um you know just follow along with the readme uh so we finished step four right and we're gonna get to uh step five and all that in a second right a lot of thumbs up i think we're good to go anybody having any troubles trouble whatever hey rage did you ever uh bring me back for audio right so now i'm gonna give you control okay keep going now see if it uh all right so aaron all yours now and you're good to go can you hear me yeah oh yeah i hear you yeah i hear you am i horrible am i audible i think so keep going yeah all right all right um okay oh yeah okay i'll figure this out eventually it's not rocket science um yeah keep going oh i i know i know um i know cedric was talking about having me stream and uh yeah after seeing some of the problems that come with it i'm afraid i just anyway moving on all right so now let's talk a little bit about um the restful service layer that um you know that that goes into uh sitting on top of the of our database so um we have a link here that uh that goes to the uh the swagger ui and when the um when you actually have the back end running um this will be a valid link that you can go and you can kind of look at all of this as well um so what you can see on the user cart um service area is that um you know we have we have two services that we have right now and they're both get requests one is about retrieving metadata for the user cart or user cart's plural by user id so this will bring you back everything and uh specifically if um if if you want to get metadata for oh yeah the active cart um the second one is uh is is what you're going to have there um so it's so really it's the difference between do you want all carts for that user or you just want the active cart now usually in terms of most site operations the active cart is the one you're going to care about the most um but they are both there and uh you know you can uh you can use whichever one kind of fits the use case so here is a quick example of a cql query um from that cart table um oh actually you know what i did this when i i only had a single entry in there and i don't have a where clause so that's uh that's that's on me for uh for bad cql there normally you don't want to as long as as long as it's recognized um you know again for the point of illustration i think it's good but uh you know you definitely don't want to do it in production especially if you're running a you know cluster of an apple with you know lots of nerds and all that stuff right right um so let's just pretend that i added where user id equals and then my uh my type 4 uid pair um so anyway you can see that data about this cart is that um you know it just has a simple name of a cart from and then it has a has a time stamp on it you know it has a uuid generated for the card id um email's not specified but this one is active it isn't is active of true so that's uh that's definitely one we want to work with there so cart product is a little more complex here um and that we have three restful endpoints around um you know being able to do a put to add products to the cart um we have a get so that we can get everything that's in the cart all the products that we that we want to see um and then we have a delete endpoint as well so that we have an easy way to remove a product from the cart um so simple enough yeah um likewise though it's important to uh to add that the uh the put um the put endpoint actually takes a uh like a request object excuse me actually takes a request object in addition to the the query parameters or the url parameters i should say in that um it'll allow you to add any number of quantity for a specific product and then you can also mention the um you know the product name and description um and by putting that all in here it's actually it actually goes back to our principle principle about um how duplicating data is okay and this allows you to basically build out your cart for your ui without having to make you know multiple calls back to uh back to the product yeah and here uh you know it shows the swagger spec um you know with localhost 8080 and and this is the nice thing about github um we have bundled this all for you and you will see that actually in action today um you know later but essentially what it does is it resolves itself to the um you know to the url that you know you you get on get part it's going to use the workspace that you're going to use so i'm teasing it a little bit you know because we're about to get to the github situation all right so oh again i've uh i've errored in the way of uh of not using a clause but again i i know a magic head that i had where cart id equals and then my um my type 4 uuid um and and it comes back with um these three products that um that are that are in my cart so um you know if you remember from last session for those of you who are here you know i i built it out based on my my own personal collection of data stacks clothing um which has which i've been putting together you know for the last last decade or so so i have some stuff that that kind of goes way way back there um so so in this cart you can see that i'm purchasing um a data stacks vintage 2015 hoodie by data sex grade track jacket by the way those are really cool and super comfy um and then my apache cassandra 3-0 contributor t-shirt which uh you know i hold very near and dear i think i had like four patches that uh that made it into that one but that's okay [Laughter] anyway so so this is what you can do with the um you know an example of the cart product endpoint all right regs i think um you know we're now jumping to um step number six and and kind of putting this all together um and i know too that folks have asked that we um you know maybe show a little bit of the code so maybe what i'll do while you're walking through um showing folks how to get started in git pod bring up you know some of the code inside of uh inside of an ide and maybe we can walk through a little bit about um you know the uh oh absolutely i was planning on doing it anyway but uh but i think i think the point was it said uh step six but that may be wrong uh i think it meant step four because you don't want to skip step five for sure oh uh we want to create the token so let's let's start with step five um maybe some of you already got ahead of time um but but um you know we we have to create the token to be able to programmatically uh connect to the database which is exactly what we're going to do you know remember again in the architecture diagram that aaron talked about um you know it's a springboard application uh that is going to connect to astra and essentially there are a number of different uh platforms if you will or or entities that are used here spring boot and then there is spring data which essentially connects to cassandra but to be able to program at programmatically connect uh you need a token okay and that's the first thing you're going to do how do i create a token very straightforward right you know again all of this in the instruction you don't need to listen to any of what i'm saying but it might help you know if you just pay a little bit of attention here you know um so you go to organization settings go to token management okay and pick the database administrator you can fine tune this a little bit but you know just again for the illustration purposes we take the easy route you know we want you to like i said time to first hello world we want you to get up and start it as quickly as possible just do the database administrator and then say generate token okay so hit this generate token but here's the critical part don't you know move away from this tab because if you move away from this tab this information is all lost the client id the client secret the token and all that you don't need all of them you don't need the client id and client secret in this particular um you know workshop but you will definitely need the token but in any case what i would do is i just download this token details okay and basically what it will tell me is you know can i store it in an excel file or can i store it in a csv file or whatever and just say yes right and once it comes up you know then you can copy values from there but by chance you moved away from this tab no worries you can always create a new token okay so so um the best recommendation and and the instructions kind of talk about that as well okay so let's go and look at the instructions right and you will see here go to organization second settings go to token management pick the role database administrator there's a walkthrough and and essentially this is what the token page look looks like and my our recommendation is to download the values as a csv file so we will need these values but you cannot go back to this window because if you navigate away from the window uh then then it's essentially lost okay so so for example if i go back um you know to another tab then i've lost it okay so once you took uh you've stored your tokens locally okay give us a thumbs up and and i will keep proceeding because you know it's it's pretty straightforward then the critical part is open your application in get power okay so i'm just going to do an open link in your window okay and basically it'll it'll give me a know like it's trying to create a new one right and it's fine okay uh first time it might ask you for your github link you may have to set up the github uh um you know essentially handshake if you will right the credentials and all that and and for the very first time okay you will see something like this this is the um ide in the cloud okay the visual studio code in the cloud it's doing some setup which is cool right and you'll notice here it kind of looks like a ide right but essentially it's the id in in in in the cloud okay so what i'm doing here uh you know it's it's set up a whole bunch of stuff right and and if you look at env okay there is nothing in there um so what we recommend you do is look at this example okay if you if you just do open and all of these instructions are in there open let me let me do a clear so that you can it comes up okay so this part is the explorer or the you know explorer window this kind of the editor window if you will you can see here readme is in there uh but you can you can really edit any any of the other files right and right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to create the credentials to be able to connect with this we have provided a simple file called open i mean like dot env.example and what you're going to do is you're going to copy the env.example to dot env so you're going to do something like this cp.env.com okay all you can do what you can do is you can you can cut and paste this there are a number of different ways of doing this but all that we need to do is you need to create um basically add these values the dbid the db region the db application token and the db key space which is already pre-populated for you because we're using e-commerce of course if you used a different key space you'd go with that but again you know for the sake of simplicity it's just easier to go with what you have okay so let me get rid of this workspace and go back to the workspace that you know i've already opened okay and you can see here you know very briefly i'll show you my emv file okay you can see that i've populated all the values there okay so i'm gonna get rid of this token but but essentially um you know it has the aster token and all that and again you know if you just walk through the instructions it'll tell you exactly what to do about that okay so copy the env.example to env open the env and paste the region which is right here okay so if you go back again now i'll wander away from the tab okay so i'm going to go back to my dashboard okay and now you know i've lost my token right but but you know i've already saved it so not a big deal right um and i'm gonna go to my database okay and you'll see here there is a region us east one okay ignore this data center id we are not going to use that okay but once you click on this okay so it it talks about how you can get um you know the the region okay and once you click on the key space right will tell you um you know which actually let's do this this way okay and you can find the appropriate dbid okay so the dbid is right here okay so so what you're going to do is you're going to find the dbid which is going back in the dashboard and looking for the database id okay so so you're going to copy the db database id which is whatever the 7f whatever is here okay and i'm going to paste that over there okay and that's exactly what you saw here okay so for example if i do my dbid and i'm going to do don't worry about this command if you're not familiar okay so this will actually let me do this so you can see here it has the dbid in there okay and that is the 7f that that you saw before all right so so once you've done this uh you have entered the commands uh you're ready to run the um the tests okay so how do i run the tests again very straightforward you you start with the unit test okay go back into this terminal window and run this so if everything is correct and it's wrong okay so you can just go to back end and run this okay first time around it will download a bunch of maven files um i mean download jar files okay so i got it wrong so let me follow the instructions properly okay cd back end i did that right so let me do this again see the backhand i don't know what i missed here this is a nice part about the instructions right so even if i got it wrong so if the instructions are not working let's let's try this anyway let me try once more test the connectivity okay you may have to do this let me check that maybe that's all right let's try that uh i'm not quite sure what's going on i'm not going to spend too much time on what's going on here okay um but the illegal state that is odd okay and that is that so let me not worry too much about that let me go to the next connection and see if that's let's see if this test works oh hey regs can you sure yeah yes i don't know if i was enabled or not just checking i i suppose the good news is is that when you look at the chat um there are folks who are saying so maybe it's for me so maybe it's just that's the environment that's that's broken okay um so i will take a look at what i might have disabled um a token but but i did try it out this morning so so i'm not quite sure what's what's going on there i'll figure that out okay uh but again you know the uh the best part is you know you just you just run this um and and you should be good okay okay so once you've done all this installing the back end um you know essentially you're gonna do the same thing okay so so let's do this go back and install the back in okay just follow the instructions again right and you're good to go okay let's try one more all right so let's let me not spend too much time debugging this um yeah i'm uh i'm starting it on mine two rags just to uh make sure it works for me here all right um so then what you can do is you can you can get your public url by just um running this command okay which is the gpu url okay and this is where your your application is going to be running once once you know you have it up all up and running okay now you'll see a 8080 not phone because it's not running okay but at some point you will see that this port is going to be open and it's going to be good to go okay um and right now you can do this and you will see that failed to connect to the local host and and all that i need to do is use the start command and we'll will hope that it will all work right so we have provided a convenient script called oh i know what i did wrong okay which is i missed a simple command the source env okay so that's the one that i missed and now i think the test should work yeah yep that's a good call out is that when you when you run the start env shell so it actually runs that source command to uh so i just figured it out okay so so everything is gonna yeah work everything is gonna connect right and you can see that you know the tests are working fine you will see what what are all the databases in there and and my builders success so so you saw that these are all live right and then if i want to run this all that i do is just do a start okay and maybe i'm not in the right directory now right so i go back and just do start and then okay and you'll see that the application is going to come up okay i'm trying to see how we are doing with respect to time we are doing well um we still have about 20 minutes and there is your it should be coming up anytime now okay so let me go back again and take a look at it oh it's right here right so there's my the stuff that uh aaron has in his you know in his closet i guess right [Laughter] so that's all you really need to do and and you know there are a couple of things that that i really didn't talk about here okay um which is like if you now go and do this curl on the local host you'll get the information on this okay so if i do the curl here and the best way to do this is just bring up another bash okay so just say one more bash okay it will take you to another term now okay and do a curl and now you should see the information that is associated with that particular product and one of the cool things that you can do is you can also look at the swagger specification and we'll see what this means in a second okay but but how do i look at the swagger spec just um you know if you if you want to open this you can open this in two ways one is you can do the preview mode okay so again how do i open this in preview mode i just run this okay and you'll see that it comes up in a preview mode here locally okay so let me get rid of this let me get rid of this because i don't care about this um and you can see this in preview mode but if you don't like this in premium world you can just hit this open in browser mode okay and all of the instructions again are there it'll open it in browser okay or you can just use the link here and you're good to go okay so a lot happening there if you want to get a um idea of what kind of apis are used in the back end you know remember what's happening here right the back end is providing the apis and that is done by spring boot and spring data and we'll dive into the code in just a few minutes okay but what is happening in the front end you know that's the one that you know aaron talked about the front end uses the back end apis to be able to get all this information and do the thread apis the create read update and delete okay so so if you remember uh or if you go back to your workspace okay there are two parts here one is the back end then there is of course data and then there's ui so if you go to the ui okay and this is basically a javascript with tailwind um you know as one of the platforms that you're using primarily because you know it's just easier to get started and and kind of you said set this all up for you and what this does is essentially call the apis right and what are those apis so to look at what are those apis all that we need to do is um it isn't did i miss that oh yeah in the freaking directory so all that i need to do is is click on this okay so i'm gonna take this and post it here okay you know i made a comment um in the first session too with respect with regard to the the pricing and uh product services in that you know in a true like micro service environment in a big enterprise sometimes you don't you don't know what's calling your services you know it could be especially in the e-commerce world it could be any number of um you know like digital channels making calls to that um you know so it's important to have that separation between you know like what regs was saying what goes on in the ui and what happens on the back end um specifically here um i mean yeah we have cart services we have ways to group products together you know for uh for like a financial transaction um but this could be called from a mobile device this could be called from a website um this could even be called from a point of sale um self-checkout module that um somebody walks up to inside a physical store um so again it follows that same concept of um you know clearly having that separation between like that front end layer that that back end service layer and then the database absolutely so so you know you can see all the different services here right and essentially spring is doing all the heavyweight and lifting and all that and all that i had to do in in spring is just include um you know one um you know if you if you look at the palm.xml and just look for swagger you should be able to find this yourself um you know use this open api ui or spring dock and essentially the documentation of the open api and the swagger you know is automatically done for you but if you want to take a look and and dig a little deeper you know go into the source backend right main okay in java right and then you can look at the e-commerce application.java right it essentially all that it does is it starts off this application right and now if you look at you know like the different you know api controller open documentation or if you look at you know the different um objects right so let's look at like for example price rest controller okay it has a whole bunch of swagger in there and then it has the difference request mappings right like slash api slash v1 slash prices and that's exactly what we saw here right um you know in the uh um you know in the sagar in the swagger specification right um so so what you can do is you know take a look at this and and you can take a look at how this maps um you know to the object model that we defined before okay and and essentially you can see here it has the getter etc methods as we call it okay so it sets the product id it sets the store id um and so on um and and you know in the price repository uh it has all these different parameters um and and you know you can do the same thing with uh let's see uh product let's look at product right and this is exactly what um you know the url that we call right so so if you look at product java you know it has the product id model number and so on and if you go and look at the rest controller right so essentially what it has is has these different methods okay and cores are cross object resource something right of course um cross-origin right um you know essentially to be able to call it from different ip addresses right which is usually not permitted but you can over override it uh you know since you're doing you're you're making this into an api uh rest api that can be called from uh pretty much anywhere in the world right so api slash v1 search products so remember i did a curl right so let's go back and look at the curl that's exactly what we did here slash api slash v1 slash products and then we provided the product and provided the product id right and that's the product slash product slash product id right and it give me the it gave me the uh product details for that particular id okay so let's be brave here and let me try this and see if it works okay that's the medium so you can see here medium right and let me try like a uh tall i don't think it's there right so so you get nothing right so so essentially what is happening is the back end apis are set up um you know to to make this happen um and and you know it uh spring basically what it does is it wraps the um apis from cassandra wraps the data and provides it as spring data and that spring data is then presented to the user interface um you know adam talked a lot about separation of concerns and and this is the cool part of this is that you know the data is all in cassandra but it's it's kind of conceptualized as an object in spring because you it's easier in in a in a program to be able to deal with objects rather than as as you know nosql data sql data or whatever the case may be and then that objects are being manipulated by the user interface so so hopefully that kind of gives you um a end-to-end you know vision of how this application has been constructed and and it's good to have this because you know in the remaining parts you will see that we're going to add a little bit more like maybe a user profile maybe even be able to check it out using my credit card at some point right uh so so that's the whole idea behind behind kind of providing all that you you don't have all of that complete at this point today so like for example you know if you if you click on this right and you say add to cart right um okay add it to cart right and i go back to my cart cool and i do a checkout you're going to get a error right because we don't have all of this complete but the idea is that at some point at some points yeah this will all be filled in uh gradually the idea is to again um you know kind of uh open up each of these gradually okay so so let's see i i talked a lot um you know let's see some thumbs up of how how how you guys are doing uh even if you get to a point where um you know you're able to open up a git pod and be able to play around with it uh i think i think that'll be great okay yeah i see a thumbs up a lot of things coming through um you know um so so let me get rid of my main monitor and i think aaron i know you have a few more slides to present before we get mentee right um so we have yeah so i think we're doing well on time all right um really just uh just to kind of close out um and maybe do a little um foreshadowing and advertising for uh for the next session um you know we we've taken you through you know carton product i'm actually product is still out there if you want to go and um have a look at the last workshop that regs and i did on this that one's out there too um but uh the next session um is actually going to be focusing on the user profile so right now you know we're kind of working in terms of um you know having like uh you know like a guest checkout sort of a functionality um but uh next time we're gonna show you how to tie this to a user profile and then um you know able have you able to be like you know logging in you know have have the have the uh the site kind of recognize who you are a little bit and then um oh by the way you've saved a cart well here's your cart for you as long as recommendation engines maybe maybe actually actually that may be a good one for mentee i forgot about that i was going to do that what would you like to see um you know so so put it in chat put it in chat what would you like to see no so we'll we'll take a look at that yeah yeah i i mean i can i can do a back here and look at all the uh the subsystems that we're at least thinking about but if there's one that's not here that you want to see yeah we'd uh we'd love to hear from you okay let's watch my my cool puzzle animation one more time all right oh and then that mistake i got because i'm you know as a developer we all like puzzles i think right you know so yeah oh yeah yeah yeah all right so so what's next um well um you know hey i i think i think we've covered most of these we're looking at um no no this is this is the boot camp i was gonna i was gonna talk about this no no big deal but but we just finished uh a four week installment of the boot camp we called it uh the learnery and what we mean is you know january of learning right and all of these material is available um so just head over to github.com data stacks devs and and you will get a lot of information on uh you know this bootcamp this is also pretty useful um i would call it as kind of supplementary material to to what you're gonna to see in the next next few weeks um or at least in the next uh few installments of the e-commerce workshop um let me take over at this point uh aaron if you don't mind okay all right sounds good right oh i saw someone in the chat mention um product reviews that's a great one actually yeah i made a note we'll uh we'll see if we can build out something that's a great recommendation thank you appreciate that all right um so where were we um i'm trying to uh i think okay so so we finished all this just a quick run through all of this just to make sure now it's time for mentee so again let's whip up your phones be ready same code as before and we're going to do some mentee now all right all right let me go with manti are you guys here okay so we are about to ask you some questions for those of you who may not have paid attention before it's 7946 6896 okay and let me get get rid of my heads because that might make it a little easier which means again you know you're going to have some issues with audio but that's fine okay you guys good to go all right i'm gonna get rid of you too well i'm gone all right okay all right um so mentee so we see um i have like 34 people let's get to 40 please can we get a 40. i know there are a lot more people who are listening to the workshop attending the workshop uh okay 35 can we really get to 40 yeah all right i think we should get started what do you think okay again you what is astrodb simple question answer fast answer correct is it a gateway to the stars is it cassandra as a service in the cloud is it an id is it a local in-memory version of cassandra time's up and i think we did a pretty good job because most people got this it's cassandra as a service in the cloud right um i don't know if it's a gateway to the stars i know cassandra might be but not astrodb but it's really cassandra easy to use database as a service what we call as kind of the serverless database okay next question let's see the leaderboard wow so close gokul is in lead or was the fastest and is in in lead so gokula i know you completed uh the assignment i mean the uh exercises too um and you're answering correctly but again you know it's important to answer correctly but also uh important to answer in time and it could be anybody still okay so moving on question two of seven right answer fast to get more points and answer correctly this is a trick question why is astrodb a better choice for e-commerce than an rdbms is it because of scalability is it because of data distribution is it region awareness or maybe all of their ball yeah so nobody got anything wrong here because we cheated here a little bit right you know all of the answers are correct um any put exactly exactly right we gave you a real softball all right moving on i think this was pretty obvious the next one let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up because again it's important to answer um fast right i don't think too much movement oh we have rishi uh jumping up to the top uh or pretty much to the top to the second uh but da nangjai was really fast just picked one question right i mean one answer um and and good to go so still anybody's game question three f7 we still have four more to go okay or five more to go i guess what does ttl stand for yeah is it transform to linux is it time to live is it total tombstones left or is it totally lost let me see if i can start my quiz music i forgot about that if it's too loud let me know all right i think you know quite a few people maybe 80 of them got it right so so i think we did a good job there right uh let's let's check the leaderboard ah give me a second all right leaderboard looks like it's changing maybe google was the fastest and still maintains the lead awesome gokul uh rishi close charles very close sajo arturo heymont really anybody's game right now okay yeah question four answer fast but more importantly answer correctly what is one disadvantage of normalization there are lots of advantages but we are talking disadvantage and this might be a little tricky right many queries implies joints of tables inefficient data storage loss of data integrity are too many data dependencies wow we kind of managed to confuse the audience i think [Laughter] it's yeah it's definitely not inefficient data storage because because i think normalization does does a pretty good job of that yeah it doesn't you don't lose data integrity right you know data integrity is one of the reasons why you do normalization right um and too many data dependencies might be worded a little differently but but again um you know i adam maybe you should explain what that means too many data dependencies that's a good question um uh so so um yeah let me see perfect moving on leaderboard let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up gokul seems to not have answered this but he could still jump back in because he's still on the board um rishi is the fastest um let's see arturo was in the top heimann was at the bottom he makes the all the way to third so he might make the move to one he might make the move to two um you know so we'll see we'll see how it goes it's still anybody's game because we still have i think three more five six and seven right one of the following was not used to connect to astra if you paid attention you will remember what it was was it dbid was it application token was it database region was it steam id was it key space name there you go steam id um enough said we don't even want to spend too much time let's check let's jump straight to the leaderboard and see how the leaderboard is facing rishi jumps back and rishi said he had a networking issue apologies or rather you know my sympathies hopefully you know that's resolved itself and you're back in the game so like like i said before anybody can get back at any point of time okay moving on question six answer fast but more importantly correctly what does bass stand for um i think aaron spent a lot of time here is it basically available sata events uh sada b always stateful entries uh basically available soft state eventually consistent beavers eight soft elves i i set that up so basically available software eventually consistent was obviously correct and let's see how the leaderboard shapes up here looks like rishi is back in okay hey month rishi um it's still anybody's game so for all the marbles let's see what goes on last one question seven of seven last one okay what was least the previous name of the open api specification and we talked about this a little bit is it udi or uddi this is giving my age you know um or how long i've been doing programming corba is it rmi or is it swagger a lot of people got this right it is swagger and you are right um so here's what you're gonna do um i'm gonna bring up the leaderboard and those who are in the first three sorry only first three people get um you know uh swag what you're going to do is you're going to take a screenshot i'll leave it there for a little bit and send it to gary.harvey at datastax.com okay oh wow okay so hey man congratulations rishi and arturo what you're gonna do is take a screenshot hopefully you've taken that already okay and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna send it to gary gary harvey datastax.com okay so now i'm going to get back and hopefully um i'm going to have your back iron okay um i need me to cut you off but not quite sure what's going on today um all right so so with that said let's go to the um few items that we have left i think we did pretty well on time yeah let me see if if you are if people are able to listen to you people hear me okay no i think you're good um unless there is an echo if there is let me know uh but but you know i think i think you're right you know we covered a lot of material um but but you know we managed to kind of squeeze it at uh almost two hours uh we're a little bit over but but i think we're good uh like i said we're not gonna do any grading of the homework um um we will kind of keep it till the very end there is no echo so that's cool uh at least finally i got my i got my uh obs 101 done uh so add your own product to the website and um you know and essentially uh this is kind of what you're going to do you want to talk a little bit about this adam are you good yeah um so for the for the last session you know um regs and i put a lot of thought on it we didn't we didn't really come up with what we thought was a good enough solution for for homework for last time um so what i what i thought was that um you know hey if you could go in and have a look at the the cql that we have for um you know for adding the product data if you could add your own product you know you so you essentially make an adjustment to the product the category and then the price table um and then you can add an or the shopping for the shopping cart oh echo echo echo echo echo you're you're hearing some echoes yeah okay okay so essentially if um you know you can make entries in those three tables um and um you know then of course add an image you know navigate to your product add it to your cart and uh submit a screenshot of your product in the cart and i think you're okay all right so a few more slides to get through and we're almost there uh we have a astra db build-a-thon which starts believe and 21st february and goes till 28. you know take a look at that i appreciate if you can do something that has a lot of prizes there so you just go to build a buildathonhack.com okay take a look at this i believe there are some um you know early presentations starting as early as this week um i know we did a lot of chatting um you know we primarily focused on this workshop this installment but but we have a very robust community in this car um you know more than 18 000 people and essentially uh you know you can you can ask questions you can reach out to some of our product group product engineers who are who are very hands-on with respect to cassandra astra and so on and and you know you can you can get some help here as well and again you know youtube chat is going to go away as soon as the stream ends but this is the place where you'll get more information um you can also subscribe to our channels you know we have a very robust subscription um so feel free you know to subscribe to this and you'll get notifications um you know of of uh things that you have uh with that said um aaron you want to add anything um no i i would just say that um you know i know that we did a hackathon a while back and that was actually a lot of fun and there were some cool things that were created out of that so um yeah looking forward to seeing what this one brings perfect all right with that said thank you all very much thanks for coming and and see you soon in another workshop oh all right yeah and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button everyone um have a great day and uh we'll talk to you all later and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she could multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats and um you know when we do that we're all we're always going to question ourselves but you know overall i think it went really well so yeah youtube rags you too all right hey we'll see your eggs thanks a lot all right bye",
