    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hi everyone welcome to the distributed data show I'm Amanda I'm a developer advocate and this is our guest today Jonathan he's the founder of data sex it's good to be on the show with you today Amanda thank you I think this is you've been on the show many times but this is the first time that you've been on the show with me so the first time we're doing it together yeah awesome thank you thank you for joining us and today we're talking about something very exciting for us and for data stacks which is our 6.7 release that's right so in the beginning of this year we released 6.0 which was a really big release for us included advanced performance for the first time and then we're following it up six months later with seven cool that's great so can you tell us some of the like just at a high level some of the the new interesting features that are coming out in 6.7 the the biggest features are production support for docker so we have launched kind of beta mode docker a while back but now it's ready for production okay and we're also introducing a new Kafka connector oh okay that's quite I think I think a lot of people are pretty excited about a kafka connector I think so yeah yeah this is this is something that I'm a little bit passionate about because one of the things that open source is good at is no developers scratching their own itch but there it's a little bit less at creating a fully generalized solution to a problem space and I first saw this with a fellow named Olin shivers like 20 years ago he created a schema shell and he expressed that know his frustration that there's a bunch of open source projects in the space already and they're all solving 80% of the problem and so he's creating this to say you know not to have another 80% solution like the the xkcd now you have three competing solutions instead of 40 right but none really work yeah so he's saying I'm gonna do I'm gonna solve this problem 100% and so there's a bunch of Kafka two concentric connectors already but they're kind of 80% solutions and so we wanted to do one that's it's a hundred percent it's got it's very flexible in terms of how you map the Kafka topic to the DC table you can take part of the topic you can you can even split topics into multiple tables it's fully integrated with DSE security so this is you know it's really it's not a it's not an 80% product it's not a beta product it's it's it's a hundred percent we're really proud of it oh that's great so it's it sounds like it's fully ready for the enterprise its production ready it's gonna solve a lot of problems and it's funny that you bring that up about that 80% because I was recently at a Kafka talk when we all were at strata and someone had mentioned oh they were talking about Cassandra and the connector and everything it wasn't it wasn't so great and so I think that maybe that 80% problem it probably solved 80% of the problems but if you have that 20% and you really need 100 percent then it's not gonna seem like it's really solving your problem so it sounds like we've solved that problem yeah awesome so is there any other kinds of things that we have that we've introduced around I know we had some things with search so can you talk to a little bit about some of the new things that we have with search that we've introduced with search and 6.7 we focused on improving our support for geospatial data types and handling those and making those easier to consume from cql so that oh okay so you can just now be able to access these straight from secret ql you don't have to use the solar query syntax right you don't have to use the HTTP API or okay oh that's great it's kind of like search did everything before or at least it seems like it to me and now it's doing even more so I think that's well I think we've had a lot here in 6.7 so I think there was one other thing that we wanted to talk about so we've talked about the kunafa connector we've talked about search what about this new DSC metrics collector you tell us a little bit though yes so we've we've had ops center was actually our first product the stack so it's you know it's ancient in technology terms but that's that's been our story around this is how you monitor data stacks clusters I mean you know this is how you can tell when things go wrong and configure alerts and so forth and the and that's great and you know an OP Center does a good job at that right the problem is that especially in larger enterprises there's already a this is how we do mine right absolutely and and you can understand why it because if you're you know in DevOps or if you're a pure you know sre or whatever when something goes wrong you want to have that single pane of glass across all your systems so you can't tell from you know the Tomcat server to your application code to DSE you know where's that problem happening and what's it affecting and so having you know everything over here is in Prometheus but data stacks is a special animal and that's an OP Center right that's not a great experience and so we've we're introducing this metrics collector to make it easier to participate in the wider ecosystem of what you know what do you want to do with your metrics where do you want to put them and so it's kind of a you know example or you know one of the most common things that we're seeing people use this wars is prometheus okay especially popular in the kubernetes community okay and so we're providing Prometheus configuration out of the box so you can you can do that but it's not just Prometheus it's like anything you want to send those metrics to I really like that phrase you just use the single pane of glass for those folks especially when probably when they're in a crisis moment right that's when you need all that all consolidated that's really that's really great also so now that we're kind of talking about this in this ops and DevOps space I think we also have some improvements with our backup and restore yeah we've made restores it's almost exactly three times faster so yeah laughs it's and put some effort into optimizing that and it's it's consistent across you know the size of data if you're we if you're doing your restoring 250 gigabytes if you're restoring 2 terabytes per machine it's very consistently three times faster oh wow and I think there's new destinations as well for some of the backups yeah yeah because though the way we did restores before it would you would use what a low-level tool called SS table loader to send the restore data to their replicas in the cluster and then one of the downsides so that is yeah you would actually the replicas would need to do a compaction afterwards okay and so you'd have not just like okay my restores complete but now there's kind of degraded perform right you tell that compaction finishes right we've been able to eliminate that you restore oh can you tell us a little bit about how you eliminated that there's a proprietary it's it's actually really simple is that it's it's an optimization for the cluster being the same size when you restore as when you backed it up so well tag will tag the restore the backup metadata and say that these files came from machine X and these files came from machine Y and we'll just pull them over the wire directly to the right machine and duplication or anything oh ok do you still need to do the compaction so that's why you don't need a compact because you're pulling them over in the state that they were backed up oh wow so the downside is that you know if you've changed if you've added notes to your cluster since you did the backup okay then you'll need to throw those nodes away temporarily do the bet do the restore and then you can add the new nodes again so that's a good motivation to you know keep your backups up-to-date right right well it seems like even though it's a little bit of a workaround but it sounds like it's it's an easy workaround right you just add the notes later and it'll be quick to have quick time yeah great awesome so would you want to tell us any more about those back of him wrist backup destination yeah that's right so we've we've always had support for s3 and so we've added specific support for Azure as well okay and then the other thing we've done is there's a lot of products out there that say you can use our proprietary API or we'll also give you an s3 compare okay and so we've added the ability to direct it to s3 compatible storage endpoints that aren't actually part of this three oh that's great it sounds like a lot of with this update at least to me it sounds like we're really trying to make it as easy for our customers and our users our developers to use the tools that they want to use we're not limiting where we're trying to open it so that anybody can use what works for them with DSE yeah I think that's a good way to summarize our philosophy here awesome yeah well great well thank you so much for joining us on the show today I think we're all really excited at data stacks all about 6.7 we're excited to share it with the rest of you and so thank you so much for spending the time and telling us all about it thanks so much for having me on the show absolutely so that's it for today be sure to subscribe so you can see us every week thank you bye bye thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think you can also find
