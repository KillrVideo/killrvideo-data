    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] welcome to the distributed data show this is Jeff carpenter I'm live here in the studio today with Patrick McFadden hi Jeff how are you joining us from France we haved we hi John also with us today is mr. Luke Tillman low friends and last but not least mr. David Gilardi No so we have the full crew evangelist here today full house yep but that's not enough no I think we need a guest do we have a guest we do and in fact joining us is our director of curriculum engineering this is Tonia Gallagher hi everyone alright so it's great to have you with us today we'd like to know a little bit we'd like to introduce our guest and have some sense of who they are where they're coming from so why don't you take a minute and share a little bit about your background with us how you came to data stacks absolutely so first of all thank you all for having me this is really exciting a little intimidating with all the evangelists but it'll be fun alright so I've actually been in curriculum engineering for about 20 years I started out I got my master's degree in instructional design and it grew from there and during that time I was about half time I was a technical instructor as well because I do believe that if you actually teach your content in the classroom you really get a sense of how it's going and if you need to fix it and what works what doesn't work things like that so I was at one company for about 15 years and then about three years ago I came over to data stacks as a curriculum engineer and I moved up the ranks a bit to director of curriculum engineering and now I head up a team of of five awesome curriculum engineers Wow so I don't know why you're intimidated having a whole Cod array of highly opinionated engineers doesn't sound intimidating at all no not at all but not to make you feel worse but we do have questions too so right we're gonna do a round-robin on the questions yeah opinionated engineers have questions you have answers but I think these are good questions because these are gonna speak to a common problem common question I always hear I'm sure we all do is hey I want to get started I want to learn about how to use Cassandra data sex Enterprise how how do I get started how do I learn more about this so what options do I I learn er have alright well there's a there's actually several options and I'm gonna go into one a little bit more deeply let me just tell you what the three are and then one of them will focus on a little bit more one way is to jump into data stacks Academy and look at our curriculum there are long form courses as well as our short form content like tutorials and things like that let me get back to that one that one's super important we also have a channel on YouTube data X Academy YouTube channel which is great you can go out there and see some great small content there you can also like this and there's also you can take on-site courses so if you want to take curriculum at your own customer site we do have either public courses which are taught publicly to anyone any company come and come to those and those are often taught on-site in Santa Clara or you can arrange to have an on-site course just for your company of any of our curriculum let's go back to DSA because that's a pretty cool thing you can first thing you need to have an account on DSA so if you don't have an account absolutely get one it's gonna open open a whole new world for you for Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise so you're gonna get to there you can get to DSA you'll navigate to our online courses once you navigate to our online courses we have all kinds of neat stuff out there to help you get familiar with Cassandra DSC and all parts of DSA Deus Ex Enterprise okay so we can go to Academy data stacks comm and specifically once we're looking at our long-form courses there how do I know which of those I should take right a sort of learning paths is what you're asking about yeah that's pretty easy and hopefully navigating the site is is pretty easy we tried to make it so that it was somewhat obvious but if it isn't let me just point out a couple of things if you don't know anything about Cassandra the first thing I recommend is go look at DES 101 which is only a 30 minute introduction to Cassandra there's no exercises or anything it's just a cool overview of what Cassandra is as a great way to start and from there if you're ready you go over to DS 201 des 201 is is foundations of Apache Cassandra and if you do it under sects Academy it's about six hours of videos that you can watch with those videos we also have a virtual machine that can be downloaded from data stacks Academy to your own machine and then you could launch that machine and actually run through all our exercises you can also download all the course content so you can download the slides if you want to go through them yourself as well as the exercise file you'll need the exercise files say that you know what to do with the virtual machine at the end of the videos there's often a link as well that will bring you to some quiz questions and the quiz questions are just going to test your understanding of that particular video and so each course is made up of several videos and once you get through all of those you've completed a course when you're done with DES 201 if you're an administrator you'll probably pop into the das2 10 which is operations for Apache Cassandra and that'll that'll get you through some you know the typical operations performance tune and kind of stuff that you'll have to do if you are a developer you might jump straight to ds2 20 which is data modelling from there you're feeling ready you can jump into our 300 level courses so our 200 level courses are about six hours each or six hours of video and then if you want to do the exercises it adds a couple more hours but if you're ready for our our 300 level courses those are our specialization courses on on data sex Enterprise Search data stacks Enterprise analytics and data stacks enterprise graph so there's there's probably gonna be some engineers out there that are like me clearly an expert with my three and a half years because the Android stack said impress okay that's totally not true like I still feel like half years like you know it gets better but you know still learn new things but if there's what about somebody out there who's like wondering do we have something more advanced we have more advanced training available than what's just there on DSA yes absolutely so if you were on DSA you probably noticed that you could see the 200 level courses and 300 level courses and that was cool however we do have 400 level courses we have a DS 410 which is it man advanced administration for a Deus Ex enterprise and we also have a 420 which is at advanced developers course now both of those courses however since they're fairly long courses they're 4 or 5 days those courses are only taught instructor-led and they are taught on-site or in a public setting you'll have to reach out to that either training at datus XCOM or go to data stacks are sorry Academy - XCOM and go look for the link for on-site courses ok so so I got a question here but so what going back to something you said a little bit earlier about about some of the courses and some of the content and everything like this is this kind of near and dear to me because when I first came to Davis tax I spent weeks in every one of the DSA courses like going through them all learning as much as I could and you actually mentioned the BMS so I'm gonna brown-nose here a little bit because honestly the amount of information and the amount of work that was clearly put into not only the course material itself but then the VMS with all the exercises was really quite awesome I mean it's some really comprehensive stuff so that's really neat so I guess now I'm done with my brother nosing my question - always like what is the secret sauce that makes that makes Davis X Academy like how do you guys put all the courses together you know get all that content that's a good question actually there's a lot that goes into it there's a lot that goes on in the background and I don't think people realize how much work it is to actually put together curriculum but to start with first thing we did is that we built something called the skills tree and the skills tree is all of the knowledge we think you need in order to be an expert in a particular topic so an example of a skills tree is we have a skill stray that's called Cassandra expert and what we did is we we wrote down every little piece of knowledge in a tree that builds you know there are nodes that build on other nodes that build on other nodes and we built this tree to give us a visual representation of all the kinds of things you'd have to learn and then from there we worked with experts within the community as well as within data stacks to figure out what kind of gaps there are knowledge gaps there are out in the out in the customer base or with anybody taking our curriculum so we would talk to the sport engineers and we'd say hey support engineers we're really curious what kinds of things do you see over and over again and how can we and curriculum help you not see those same questions over and over again an example might be compaction let's say everyone has trouble understanding compaction so supports getting inundated lots of questions about compaction and so we figure hey if we can help alleviate some of that load on support we're doing a good job so we make sure we add that to our curriculum we also work with a solution architects who go out there all the time there are there are sort of our Road Warriors are out there helping customers all the time we ask them hey guys what is it that you see in the field that could help your customers what could we do to improve our curriculum so that your customers have a better knowledge base when you come in and you guys are just helping them with their particular use case we also work with sales and say hey what do you guys want to see in terms of curriculum from there we write we write what's called a and our educational narrative and in that narrative we decide what is the best learning path or curriculum then we go and we write our our classes and the way we start is we all believe that the best way to learn anything is through hands-on or through exercises some people learn by just reading or listening but a great many people learn by doing so what we do is we start with the exercises and we say what does this person need to know right now to be successful with this piece for example compaction what do they need to know about compaction to be successful how am I going to illustrate that in an exercise how am I gonna get them to do it okay great once I write the exercise I put some requisite knowledge around it so I might build some slides not a lot you know I don't want to build lots of slides so I build some slides around that piece and then I have to build a learning platform so we have to have an environment in which you guys can that customers and you guys can actually test our exercises so that might be a virtual machine or it might be a cloud infrastructure that you can use to to test our to actually go through our exercises and then once we're done with all that we hand our curriculum over the wall to our delivery organization at data stacks for them to actually go out and teach to either on-site classes or to teach public classes and then we also hand them over to our very professional video team that goes and records in a studio like just one and then Dana Stax Academy studio where they will go and record the exercise record the videos walkthrough solutions things like that and then we well then we upload all that to datatex Academy the very last thing we do is write quiz questions that test your knowledge make sure that you understand what we just taught and so the quiz questions get uploaded to this text Academy as well okay so in terms of bandwidth and resources you know that the engineering team is always innovating the adding new capabilities to DSA so how does the curriculum team keep up with this fast pace that's a very that's actually really good question one of the things that's interesting is that data stacks actually the end of the curriculum engineers work in product and engineering so we already have a sort of natural relationship there which is really really great because there's already a camaraderie and a relationship there but just like the documentation team and just like other teams that did it Stax Academy we have or did data stacks we have to do some work right in the work we have to do is we have to make sure that we stay up and current on on product on the product itself so we go to the same meetings that engineering goes to we go to the same meetings that documentation go to we followed the same slack channels you know to make sure that we're up to date we look at the JIRA tickets and make sure we're we understand the JIRA tickets we arrange time with subject matter experts in engineering to say hey I'm not going to waste your time but I have some questions about this particular area can I get you know half hour an hour of your time this week to talk about it so I think we stay up with it just like other people in the organization because we have to release curriculum right around the same time that product releases product yeah I think that's really you guys do do an excellent job of that you know DSC 5.1 just came out and soon afterwards we have updated courses posted online with new you know up-to-the-minute content yeah cuz product never stops right if it did there's a code complete yeah it would be so much easier for my job but no it's always changing always evolving I just want to point out that in that list of experts that she talked about speaking to to develop curriculum I did not hear evangelists in that group we don't even have to call you out we you guys have to help us great the evangelists really help us to in building the things like the skills tree always critical to get their help well alright so there you listed I mean oh there's a lot of stuff that happens but of course we have a large body of great information great courses out there but you know never being satisfied with the gist that let's let's talk about what's coming because in that same vein there's always more product there's got to be more course is coming so what's cooking what's in the works right now so there's a lot of things on the works right now curriculum engineers are constantly keeping up on on curriculum right there's new releases so we have to be aware of those as well but we also have to rerecord videos for Deus Ex Academy so the 5.1 videos are gonna get rerecorded and new exercises and things will be uploaded I mean that's a pretty big deal that takes several weeks or a month or so of time so we're doing that we're also not only do we maintain the suite of courses so you guys probably I don't if you counted but there are three of the DS 200 level courses there's three of the three on the level courses and you probably heard me say there's two of the 400 level courses so between the five of us we're maintaining a suite of eight courses so we're constantly keeping those updated and fixed and maintained but we want to add new curriculum people always want new curriculum we want to add new curriculum so there's a couple things we're planning on doing there so we want to add curriculum for security we're looking at we want to add a new 200 level course of the very DSC focus or a DSC specific as well as we're always looking for new ideas so if anybody here is listening Academy add data sax comm if you have ideas or if you want go to our slack channels that we have absolutely go connect to our slack channels and and and tell us out there when you guys want to see because we want to build what you guys want to see awesome Wow this is great information I hope everyone that's listening to this has got this question in their mind you know just follows your advice because they're gonna be successful there's a lot of stuff to work through that is just awesome it will make your career better and will make your experience better so I'm on those slack channels by the way for any of you watching this I I monitor those slack channels if you have a question specifically for me you want to know more about curriculum you want to know more about de Stax Academy you want to know more about what's coming in the future please did you know hit me up and slack I'm happy to answer questions they're awesome all right well thank you very much Tanya for being here today this has been really helpful and thank you everyone for joining us on another distributed data show thank you guys for having me this was really fun thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think you can also find
