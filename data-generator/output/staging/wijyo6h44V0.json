    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] welcome to the distributed data show I'm David learning and here with me in remote land is Steven the left hello and today we're gonna talk about Java all right so first things first as I hit the mic with my head you know okay I just hit these cells for graphic job right um but I have an explainer I haven't actually asked you what what is it graph these up you explain a little bit what a graph these L is sure first of all gremlin is a is a graph DSL it's a way to traverse a graph vertices and edges it's similar to sequel in the sense that sequel provides this language query relational databases gremlin kind of does the same thing thing but has more general purpose elements to it what's a sequel those but basically we're talking about how do you how to query a graph in the language of the graph witches versus knitters okay okay into like general explanation privately do something so so now we're talking about specifically yeah so job right let's talk a little bit like what's the difference there like what you know what we do a job like oh so with yeah with with with Java specifically we're looking at ways to sort of extend Bremen which is written in Java and we're looking for ways to extend gremlin to provide some more like specific ways to work you to talk in terms of the language of the graph itself so the domain of the graph might be something like healthcare and you would be writing something in Java that has healthcare specific language encoded in it so your query language sort of shifts from being a something that's specific to something that is more specific say healthcare or education or whatever it is that you're you're working in and we present ways that in in Java there every different sort of ESL has a different way of being implemented in different languages and it's Java um we have some specific annotations and things that you use in order to create your your DSO okay okay so actually you mentioned annotations right yep so now I'm gonna cheat a little bit here because obviously I've also been working with the graph DSL implementations or consider permanently self-initiative Java recently but for our viewers right for the folks out in the audience who might be watching this can you tell us a little bit what what are the annotations doing for you one of the big challenges we had in developing the framework for building ESL's was that the sort of the structure of the structure of Gremlin the class structure gremlin was sort of a little bit complicated and through direct extension of certain classes it really was kind of yet to do a lot of boilerplate code work in order to implement it yourself and so you came up with the idea of using the Java Java annotation processor to add annotations to your to your code to your DSL code that would automatically generate some of that boilerplate for you it makes certain things a lot easier to maintain it to manage as opposed to trying to do it by hand basically you know I'm actually kind of glad you said all that because I'm totally shameless plug shameless plug for some videos we just recorded in some materials I've been working on lately they actually dig into that with it one of the things one of the points I should get to is how the annotations they're a huge time-saver because when you look at the generated classes and look at the amount of boilerplate that's there that if the annotations exist and you weren't generating code that's part of that with the asylum communication in Java then that was something I would have had to worry about this and the fact that I didn't have to was was an awesome site that's pretty cool so I you know I never asked you that question it's that I'm cool to hear you talk about that so all right so what do you say to someone though you might just think this is another layer of abstraction right no like why not just write Brennan which person inch around don't you have to understand gremlins Versalles any way to even use the DSL oh yeah I mean I think you could say that from India cells could be another layer of abstraction I mean I think people could make that argument and you could implement it that way but I think you lose a lot of gremlins foreign power if you do you know in sequel you you would you build a data access object of some sort and you hide your sequel behind that and in grumbling there's something analogous read you can put your gremlin inside of the data access object and no one would know that there was gremlin going on back there but the problem is something like a data access object class is that it's going to return something like say a list of persons you know list of person objects and once you have a list of personnel but you really can't do too much more with it than that it's just fine persons maybe have some parameters on that on that particular service method and it's going to give you a list of persons but growling if you work with Rome for a period of time you know that gremlin isn't just about getting me a list of persons it's about getting a list of persons and then traversing further in the graph it's about filtering and reducing and grabbing map keys and doing some kind of computation on those and it the language sort of builds upon itself so if you just get a list of persons you really can't get do too much with that however if you build a DSL when I say get me a list of persons I can to my graph language of gremlin and continue along with the traversal I can say let me filter those persons further let me do a grouping on those persons let me do you know whatever it is the gremlin would allow you to do from that from that point forward so and what's nice is that because of the way the annotation processor works I gives you the ability to go from the DSL from your domain-specific language into graphs language and then back into your DSL again so you don't lose any of those like important steps that makes gremlins so powerful so I think that yields a lot more flexibility than just kind of hiding the gremlin away in a class and some object mapping oh ok so are you saying that if I let's say had some verses to find my DSL right I could then execute against those particular you know items it might be a self but then I could chain on or tag on gremlin steps after that and kind of create like a large person of more complex one exactly okay sorry the next thing that comes in mind because in your mind you want a DSL unit for now I have some answers for this right I think that might be but I want to hear from you like yeah I mean I tend to find them I've seen them useful for graph developers and people who are like graph analysts and to be worth useful to both those kinds of folks graph developers like them because they're gonna help keep their code more maintainable more testable more reusable analysts are gonna like them because they can write their traversals without necessarily knowing all the rules of the graph that they may not need to know else and they just could focus on the API that's exposed to them and the DSA the DSL should shield them from some of those from some of those specifics so usually I mean I've worked in places where where we're a team there was only you know I was the only person on the team who knew gremlin I mean that's what I was brought in there to do yeah and I was a central hub for all querying ahead I'd build with you know I'd build this this this DSL which usually tend I usually tend to like to build DSL in such a way that filtering becomes the flexible piece to my to my design because everyone seems to understand like even when you're just getting started around on the first you learn is how to get rid of vertices and edges and things that I don't want filtering is like a really simple thing you don't have to think too hard about you know whether property has a value and a key or not those are really simple things and so when it can build all these complex algorithms underneath a particular dsl step and just allow people to have access to the parts of Gremlin that they're comfortable with that's a really powerful thing in it let's let's let's people who don't know Bremen terribly well become start to become familiar with it in an easier way and then you know along the way they're gonna stop and look at what I wrote right they're gonna stop just calling my my DSL step and go look at the code and say ah let me see how this is working over here so it ends up becoming like this really nice teaching tool for folks who you know for teams that may have just one person or two people who really know gremlin well and the rest of the team is trying to come up to speed it's a really nice way to get get the rest of the team um you know working with gremlin and being comfortable with it ya know and you know except it's interesting that last part about how the D cells in effect kind of helping break up the gremlin underneath into bite-sized chunks and there's one of the one of the things that actually some of the work that you did that I totally took them to blog post which I'm gonna plug here in a moment was side of it right the side effects go and there's a great example I think of that in in the blog post that you have where you embed or a code side effect within the language of your DSL human and before I looked at that right um side effects you that you tried to take the I'll show you traverse all right so these jurors let's get pretty hairy right they get pretty complex and to try to take that full of that and understand it that could be pretty daunting but then in this 1k is because the layman kind of define I was able to take a look at Sipan go what is that do and then go and dig in and find out what side effect doesn't it made all sorts of sense um kind of brought things together so it was just a neat example of being able to say take things in bite-sized chunks and look at what this piece of the dsl is doing and that kind of helps at least my level of understanding we're talking about Java obviously today you know are there are there any other languages like that we have we're gonna have DSL support for or that exists now yes yes Python has support and obviously with Java you can you can pretty much use the annotation processor with most of the jvm language without too much trouble I'm sure groovy and Scala wouldn't you wouldn't have any trouble using using that in those cases closure probably a little different but you know we basically cover the JVM no Java we have the next release is tinker pop I'd say we should have a pattern defined for dotnet that it hasn't been proven out yet but I've been my pet experts that we have a way to do it is will love documented that'll be cool and the goal was basically to ensure every GL will be out there every gremlin language variant has a DSL pattern for folks to follow but that's gonna happen as each as each language period comes out well yeah you make me happy to see SharePoint I'm I'm more of a port Java guy but in the video reference app right we support c-sharp no chairs and Java and so for me it's important that we eventually parity there so I'm actually really quite excited about the dotnet one right so we can get embed back so once again we do nothing yeah press sure that all right so you know long lanes long lines of the language variants you know goodbye I believe gremlin DSL has actually been around for some time you just released the ability to use them right in the language or the Java version and we had the drivers address it was there like to some decision major who dip or something like that or was this always a plan gist of time to get things filled up like yeah the idea the idea of DSL went back to take a pop two days years ago yeah the approach we use their tinker pop to and gremlin gremlin was a very time to groovy tinker pop too and so the approach was very very specific and use a lot of meta programming and and stuff like that it just it just didn't work well in 3.0 and forward so I think the approached ESL's was really formalized a long time ago but they in fact people went ahead I saw on the mailing list people went ahead and built the SLS within Tinker Papa 3 even before we prescribed a way to do it which I thought was pretty cool but it showed just how much people like that having that in tinker pop to that they went ahead and and just forged ahead into the into Greenfield just trying to figure out a way to make it happen but we were cautious because you know we want to be sure that we had a first of all to run the language solid which I think it very much is now in the last certainly in the last year there hasn't seen a whole lot of change to the underlying guts of things so that's been very good and we wanted a pattern that could be implemented across all the language variants which goes back to what I was saying as a few minutes ago we didn't want to have something just for Java and that was there was no way to do it in Python like maybe we're trying to we want to keep it so that there's parity across all the language variants so that you know Python doesn't get the short end of the stick and JavaScript has a totally different way of doing things so it took some time to be sure that we had something Universal but it seems like it seems like we have that now so now it's just a question of in each language what is this what are the steps it's going to take in order to implement these things for some languages it might be really simple it might be just as simple as just like in Python you don't have all the you don't have an annotation processor right I yeah there's no there's no boilerplate either because the because there's you don't have the same type system that you have in Java then it forces a lot of the annoyances that generate all the boilerplate code so different languages will make things harder or easier just depending on on what's available in those in those environments okay okay all right so when you mind are decels at the furred wait for folks to code in gremlin or are there cases in there maybe it might not be a good idea to do so I tend to like them I mean I tend to see them grow organically too like they I don't think I've ever set out to just build a DSL at the first particle project if you put too much structure into the DSL early in the development process it leads to this over engineering I think was like the biggest pitfall you can you can get into is just over engineering the DSL building a bunch of steps you don't really need just to follow some convention that you've predefined for yourself so you just need to sort of a look at common traversal paths to determine what the best way is to do that it's just too tempting to just build steps for everything at your schema and forward but it might not be a good idea to bother with with the ax cells if you have like a really simple domain the graph you know something sometime it just looks like a really simple one but like there's not a whole lot you can build with that you know it's probably not going to be a whole lot of value to building for something along those lines I might not build bother when the DSL but like traversal algorithms that were completely static for some reason in other words if there was no way or no need to ever modify the nature of an algorithm what's the outermost completely self-contained system like its output would never need any additional processing then maybe a DSL isn't worthwhile but I tend to find that it's like a really it ends up being a really useful thing in larger projects and smaller ones too so I kind of like going that way I can't think of too many reasons you wouldn't want to try and go that route yeah and it's to a point about like a static algorithm or something you couldn't affect mix and match though right like you could you could use DSL for saying 90% of the traverses are but if you have like that static algorithm you may maybe you don't really need or maybe it doesn't make sense to call pieces from your DSL but because be the basic remand steps are available through yourself reference right you can kind of mix them back to the truth yeah yeah definitely and I think that's that's the way it works best that's the way it's how I meant by like it building organically like I'm start just those same gremlin steps over and over again in your code and you'll say I should probably extract that into my own DSL step so that instead instead of the same thing I'm copying pasting over and over again let's turn it into a step and then all that goes away and then that little step becomes this really testable atomic unit and that becomes like this basis for you know higher level higher level steps that you can feel much more confident in because you've tested the lower level steps you know so much so much more intently indirectly so it's a it works really well that way okay very cool so here's the point where I'm going to give it shameless shameless plug for Steven let's blog post and matter of fact I know that you have the one blog post security put out and part of the shameless plug as far as I'm concerned it is just an excellent excellent description of what are do cells you know why would you want to use them get some nice examples and everything like that and we provide the link here and then don't you you said that we were talking earlier and you said we can actually had another block was good enough can you talk about that a little bit I trying to focus on mostly benefits of dsls in and what they were in the first post we used I used Java in that case to just as the mechanism for explaining it all but this next one is going to be more about sort of like guidelines for developing your developing via cells and we use Python in this case it's explain it so I'm hoping I can try and continue that that pattern as we release new dsls for different POVs so we'll see how that that kind of goes but I think this there's possibly would be a little bit more helpful only and this new one will be a little more helpful in the sense that again I think the guidelines for building them really I don't think it was even Greek I don't think I even grown anything like that for the initial post attacking taker pop - was all mostly about how to's but this one has built a little bit more on experience about that from building them in different applications over the years okay well cool so make sure that about Stephens awesome blog posts I know the first ones out that and second one's gonna be really soon right we will provide a link here with you so thank you so much Steven for being here that was awesome and really insightful you know there's actually a bunch of stuff I teamed up yeah I didn't realize before so no great good and see you guys next time on the
