discord chat so we will know we are good to go pretty interesting content here today so uh how long meanwhile while we are waiting for the confirmation cedric for uh how long do you work and do you use kubernetes oh uh let me think uh it's not long i would say two years at most [Music] but we did a pretty deep dive during the summer so i extensively use kubernetes even if it's pretty recent yeah and i started approximately four years ago or maybe a little bit earlier our initial intention was to use docker swarm for that purposes but those times docker swarm was not ready at all and from the features point of view it didn't do all the job what we needed it to do so how it goes for us i see what we are good uh if from our site video quality is very high i see perfect connection and zero dropped frames so we should be very good if we have if you have any kind of problems with the quality please don't forget to adjust your youtube settings because you may need to set it to a higher quality yes good so um that's great to have you all here thank you so much for joining that's data stacks monday learning developed developed and delivered by developer advocates of data stacks and today that's the final uh last class of our docker learning path and today we speak about kubernetes that doesn't matter if you join at us for the world course or you jump it in right now as long as you have understanding of how docker works this um this workshop this class will be very useful for you uh to realize like why kubernetes is in so high demand and why it's used so widely but nearly all the companies those are using docker containers in general there are some competition but i would say it was won by kubernetes some years ago yes i would say now it's done good maybe you're wrong but yeah uh okay so again welcome to the last class that's the introduction to kubernetes final week five of the docker containers from basics to kubernetes originally it was from basics to best practices but due to you asking us to add kubernetes now it's five weeks from basics to kubernetes not only to best practices and important to know if you just join it all of our previous sessions are recorded so you can watch them in any moment and that's absolutely for free and this course was a big success as we got already over together one half thousand registrations by yesterday it was over 7 000 views on youtube and all together over 110 days overall watch time and that's only those uh streams you've seen before so that's only grow that's cool yeah that's cool and thank you so much for joining so first few things we are going to discuss today container orchestration so kubernetes is a container orchestration tool and uh before we start i really want you to be not like this character on dilbert.com people speak a lot of technical words but what the purpose of our class is to get deeper and to gather real understanding of which problems it solves and how it works in general this workshop is an introduction level workshop so it's easy to learn but you aren't going to be kubernetes masters after that but we will explain you what's the general field of responsibility of a kubernetes which problems it solves and how to develop your uh your further skills so you will know where to learn if you are interested and want to make a deeper dive okay so uh some of you attended uh our docker learning path and you may remember uh those pictures on the right if you are going to run multiple containers that's uh on even on a single host it's not going to be easy because there are a lot of dependencies one has to wait for another mounting volumes setting passwords and so on and so on so in general that's a long story even when you run uh on it on a single host even when you run it on your laptop you may want uh to use container orchestration and you know what docker compose is the container orchestration tool most of you uh should know the docker compose already and the really simple idea that's a very simple tool it's not for production really it's for pretty simple use cases but the main thing it allows you to describe container configuration in a file and apply this file and make your containers running so words are the basics of a container orchestration basically and that's already better to use than just plain old docker run true but well then what happens if you speak not about your laptop but about thousands of containers over hundreds of servers it may be like 10 servers it may be hundreds of servers it may be thousands or thousands of thousands with ease and amount of running containers may be tremendous for big companies kubernetes was developed by google and it solves problems uh for the companies also at the google scale so no surprises it's not going to be too simple today but you will manage that when we want to handle um orchestration of the containers on a big scale we definitely need good tools for that here is a little link there is a great uh comic explaining what's the kubernetes at ease that's kinda a vendor pitch for a google compute platform and google kubernetes engine uh hosted solution or managed solution we will speak about a bit later uh i'm not selling you google kubernetes engine no way but i do recommend you to watch this comic it's really really funny so but let's proceed which problem kubernetes solves well not only kubernetes there are some another tools first of all deployment and provisioning of the containers we discussed it before on the previous classes what in some cases uh provisioning of a container should be done in some specific order for example and deployment of the containers must be done um to some specific hosts or nodes so we will will be spread for for example it makes no sense to run multiple instances of your service um in the single node is or i mean on one of the nodes of a cluster as soon as this node will be dead power outage all your instances will be not available after that so for example kubernetes considers the location allocation of the servers and will try to put ports to different servers uh so even if one of the servers is not available anymore still we will be running instances of your application also upscaling downscaling sometimes you need more sometimes you don't need so many uh computational power sometimes you expect black friday coming and you're going to sell the wall company including board of directors when congrats and that's again not easy to handle with playing docker or playing docker compose health check monitoring and also self-healing if one of the containers is not operational we have to restart that if one of our containers uh is kind of blinking we may need to terminate that and bring it back so things like that load balancing it's not so easy to organize load balancing using just plain docker here comes kubernetes and its software defined at networks and load balancing and that's a built-in feature that's really cool so you can run a multiple containers of the same service over your cluster and that's for kubernetes to take care of the load balancing automatically that's completely transparent for um the administration for operations team and that's great and i love it so much then resources management and resources utilization how much computational power do you have do you need more do you need less uh make proper lot on multiple servers not overload one single while others are idling that's another point also routing make one service available for another service uh so these kind of things publications so make your services available from outside it makes no sense in like let's say web application if you cannot access that then yes and you know so all these features is really what is the meat of the container orchestration and why you should use kubernetes over docker swarm or docker compose because those two only start containers one to each other you know side by side but no real application logic whereas the orchestration the orchestrator can say okay now this endpoint would be the load balancer between multiple instance of the same services if if one services crash it will be restart and if one services becomes slow it can be scaled out with a couple of command lines yep well um technically you can set up docker compose so it will restart failed services but that's like a pretty plane simple stupid restart nothing like richard link of ports or like yeah regarding docker swarm or compose so first hi rped glad to see you again i will answer this question in a couple of slides yep and uh many other things regarding container orchestration without that you would have to do it all on your own and that's definitely not the thing you want to do so yeah that's a picture i really like sometimes management of complex system looks exactly like that and now we are going to change that and one of these knobs will lead to i don't know an explosion and another will adjust what you need but you have no idea in which order you have to change them so container orchestration is the thing what helps you to do the things easier i wouldn't say if is because as well tool to manage containers at the google scale of course that's not the simplest tool you're going to use you know there is a difference uh between tiny car like just to bring you to a food store and back and between big complex truck which brings like 40 000 tons to this food store delivering something so of course it's easier to drive a small car so kubernetes and his friends first of all there are multiple solutions in the field of container orchestration and i'm going to strike them out step by step first of all docker compose is not production ready and mostly probably never will be production ready i know some small projects using them using it successfully on the production but that's always about small projects you may need something better helios helios was developed originally by spotify and now it's deprecated because spotify moving to kubernetes so they accept only bug fixes but helios is not in development anymore and deprecated docker swarm it could have been a bright future for docker swarm but were able to late all the world needed container orchestration tools and kubernetes was in place already when swarm was still not usable at all and it was just too late and it lost to kubernetes i'm not saying docker's worm is good docker swarm in the modern scenario and nowadays may be a good feat for uh small projects especially as it uses um configuration files almost directly from docker compose so if you are using docker compose already it will be pretty easy to control to convert to swarm but in comparison with kubernetes docker swarm is still not perfect fit for more advanced workloads and there is a marathon message mostly the same story as with docker swarm now they are pretty powerful but they definitely lost this battle to kubernetes so when we speak about container orchestration i would say what kubernetes makes like 95 percent of a market medium do you agree cedric i do yeah i think that's like just reading good so let's go uh next thing you can use uh kubernetes uh on your own with on-premises and there are also some managed solutions nearly every big cloud provider suggests you to use their managed kubernetes and it's delivered by amazon by google kubernetes engine by azure kubernetes service and many others here is a thing to discuss on premises hosted and managed what does that mean for you and which option you should choose i will not stay on that for too long because this course is mostly for developers so i doubt if you will make decisions like that but what you need to know with on-premises uh running on your own infrastructure and kubernetes you take care of everything and when we speak about a hosted solution like you can use aws elastic cloud machines but you still can run completely your own kubernetes there and manage it on your own and of course application is always on you and you can use managed kubernetes as well for example if you google kubernetes engine it simplifies work but it very depends on your use case so i want you to understand what's where are the options will you manage kubernetes and install kubernetes and update kubernetes or will it be done by some cloud provider and we can switch to kubernetes kubernetes fundamentals and we can go i think so first of all you cannot run your application if you don't have servers in kubernetes cluster we speak about nodes and node can be a bare metal machine node can be a virtual machine note even can be a docker container speaking of you put docker in your docker so you can docker while you docker that's of course not for production workloads but more for testing and educational purposes we will use that today and then there are two main kinds of node master nodes and worker nodes in short masternode is used to schedule jobs schedule containers and manage things and worker nodes are more powerful nodes which run the containers and do the real job and on the right side you may see there is also utcd if you don't know utcd is um we can say database which is used by kubernetes internally but we aren't going to do to make a two deep dive so we don't care about gtcd at this step so we have worker nodes and there are some containers should do it on worker nodes and here is a trick the point is what the base you need in kubernetes for base unit you deploy you operate you terminate if needed is the pod and many people uh kind of lost at this point like what is the port why you spot why can't we use container just normal docker container short answer is the trick is kubernetes doesn't work only with docker containers it may work with rkt containers it may even work with some special virtual machines kinda as a containers that's why pot is a wrapper for a container is one just obstruction layer and you see on the example of the right we have kubernetes node so let's overall this blue thing and we have two ports running on this node and one port contains only one container and that's the most used use case when you just have one container one port as a wrapper over this container and you are done in some cases you may have multiple containers per port why and is it a real use case in short yes a typical example for the containers running in port along alongside to each other is a side car for example you maybe have heard something about apache cassandra i hope maybe if you didn't you should because it's a really great database but not the point for today if you run cassandra in kubernetes with cassandra iterator you may notice what you have to contain or purport for cassandra what's the trick simple answer is one container will be explicitly cassandra and one container will be a sidecar sidecar is a special management process uh which you may use to retrieve for example monitoring data some metrics uh how it goes is everything is fine with cassandra and so on and so forth containers running in the single port they share something they may use shared volumes they share a network and moreover they share inter-process communication so for example port a on the left cannot use ipc to communicate with port b on the right because they can communicate only via networking but containers on the port b on the right may use absolutely inter-process communication as well in short most of the time your ports will have one and only one container and that's perfectly fine in some cases you may want to have a deeper relations between some of the containers which kind of logically group it together and you may want to have them within a single port in general there is a very good rule of the thumb how to define if you want to put your containers in the single pot or you want just to have multiple pots one container per pot think of scaling think if you want to scale if you have container a and container b and they work together think how do you want to scale them if you scaling up always want to have as much containers a as much containers be then they are good candidates to be put in a single pot if uh you think what you may need to have one instance of container a but 10 instances of containers b and you don't need things like inter-process communication between them then mostly probably you just need different pots yes so maybe a sample i will go back to cassandra if you don't mind so customize the database and you interact with cassandra using the the port opened by customer but kubernetes needs some kind of probe to see if a container is up or not or you may want to interact with cassandra housing api and so in the pod we put a second container which expose cassandra in http this pattern is called a sidecar if you have heard about sidecar this is putting a container in the same pod of an existing one yep exactly okay so i think we can move on yes and put us as a small ad i guess sorry uh put us make us smaller on the screen oh we still big heads and you are on top of the text yeah okay so i will make a smaller boom magic and and now we are small yeah all right this is kind of magic yeah good so pots in details what is the smallest deployable unit in kubernetes you may consider port as a container with metadata kubernetes needs to run that and to configure port we can use secrets and config maps to configure pod what's that secret is uh as you could guess a password or api key you want to store secretly um that's one of the points to make control over with your authentication system but we don't speak too much about the security today and cm configuration map is a just a list of key value settings you may want to have to configure container that's mostly about for example the environment variables we were speaking at the last classes so secret about the confidential information and config map is about more about debug falls environment production and other settings you may need to set up a container again if you are using docker compose for example in testing and development and kubernetes in production which is a very often use case you definitely will need to change some settings for your application running in production then ports management you can manage ports directly but it will be mostly the same as to manage docker containers because wellport is a wrapper over container we can say a lot of work to improve that we use deployments what is a deployment deployment describes a group of pots and their configuration desired state count of pots you want to run some settings for them and so on then deployment manager deployment controller sorry based on the configuration you get you gave to the deployment will set up ports uh will create replica set replica set is a kind of internal replication manager let's say which is in general suggested not to touch directly but only via deployments you can create replica replica sets manually but it's considered a little bit of bad practice so prefer to use deployments instead and the deployment and we will make a deeper dive as the deployment is one of the main tools in kubernetes we will work with a code directly and we create it create replica set to scale pots up and down as needed and how do we use all these view team before we go to the first little practical example there are two ways to communicate with kubernetes via api well let's speak about the tools using cube ctl direct commands and using files and infrastructure as a code approach first one is much easier so you can see examples on the right cube ctl is a kubernetes control it's a simple console command which uses kubernetes api to execute the commands you ask that to do so in the first scenario we see just cube ctl create deployment deployment name and which image we are going to use that's not really useful on the first example we see something already more interesting cube ctl create deployment deployment with the name mind mydap my deployment it will use image in nginx by the way if you have been on the last class you know it's a bad idea you always need to use some text not use the latest version and finally dash dash replicas is to set amount of ports you want to have to be running in general and final example here is when we want to expose some port then it can be done like that for the deployment uh to open port forward but there is a better way we will discuss later networking is a special story then second way to work with kubernetes is infrastructure as a code you uh write down in a configuration file using kyamal what exactly do you want to have and then you say just cubesite instead of a create deployment you say cubestyle apply file and that's a very great approach in general i recommend at least for production definitely use this one because it really allows you to have your kubernetes infrastructure as a code and you can completely use it for example with git and i cannot open all the stories because i still with some non-disclosure agreement from my former job but i can tell you what having your infrastructure as a code under git control helped us a lot of time in a lot of times in some special situations in general that's very great it's really great when you can walk through the history of your infrastructure and see like okay one month it was like that and one week later it was like that and there were some changes and then we run into some networking issues for example so with normal git div command you can see all the differences between your infrastructure uh the thing like the selected dates and that's really cool so um there are um multiple ways uh to manage as you see and i see in chat hyperanalym uh what about using helm we usually use uh helm for uh to install operators like cassandra operator is now suggested to install with helm it's not yet in the documentation directly as the recommended way but it is recommended way already and we will add it in a couple of days i think so um we don't cover helm uh today but you need to know what if you want to install operators you may need a word helm and it's a curator manager let's say uh question one more can we use kind for production no no no no inside docker so i think you got the id yeah yeah you won't yeah it's it's not yeah it's not strong well we use kind and kind is a great tool but only in learning educational purposes maybe for testing the idea for testing a lot yeah yeah it's really like medium cube good um what exactly do you install for cube ctl running so with cube ctl is a very simple story cube cubesat is a simple small console executable file so uh if you install cubesitel on linux or os6 mostly probably it's going to be cool x and you can use that completely so that's like a very lightweight thing and yeah so cube ctl is just the client exactly as cedric says good yeah and i also shared the the you know the link of a bigger workshop we did on kubernetes multiple hours with hands-on deep dive and you can follow those steps uh it's working with cassandra but at least you do have everything you need to install on your laptop to have kind which is a kubernetes on your laptop yep good then uh networking so oh um do you know about so see the question here just before do you know anything about git ups and flex cd never heard about those i'm not sure i understand the second question can we use kubernetes on operator uh regarding git ops and flexidine flexi d doesn't sound to me i didn't see that before and regarding git ops um that's the approach when everything is under git and that's like infrastructure as a code and every pull request is the reason to do some jobs run some tests deploy something in kubernetes and so on and so forth so yes even that's strange yeah even even google doesn't know flex cd i just just tried to find it but yeah so uh i don't find anything regarding gitobs is a very old strategy very new word at least that's what i've seen yeah i mean all my life is the gitobs at least for life five years for last five years so let's move on and faster we go sooner we can jump to a real code so kubernetes networking there are two cases for kubernetes networking we want to cover internal networking and external networking and we start with internal networking imagine you have a group of ports every port will have an ip address every port will be running on a node and mostly probably we are going to run on different nodes question is then how are you going to connect uh port b to port a you need to make some kind of routing you need to somehow to connect them maybe using ip addresses and then don't forget pots are ephemeral today you have five tomorrow you will have eight tomorrow you will the day after tomorrow you are going to have 800 of the boat a kind so um there is a better way we trust um kubernetes to handle to handle networking for us service is a network abstraction used to expose an application group of pots as a network service in short you have uh your service i don't know whatever service let's say it's a python web service just for example it can be whatever you want and you want to have three instances of these boats so you specify it in the deployment what you need three instances okay and then you define a service over that specifying what it will match this set of pots and this board and as a result after that you don't have to uh your other pots don't have to know nothing about this python web service for example they just need to know the name of a service and that's it and then they ask for this service it's a simple dns call then kubernetes will automatically calculate which node and port now to use for that and there is a load balancing as well so that's a real dns request i'm going to use the python let's say our service is called the python very easy when we just ask dns server for which port i'm going to ask it gives me the address and my client goes to this one and that works really good we consider service as a kind of a said for a group of pots and service also may provide load balancing another point would be external um query so we can configure service to be also available from outer world from the internet but in general that's a bad practice so uh that's always better to use ingress ingress is an entry point for external connections it's kinda router what accepts incoming queries and routes them to a proper service based on the defined rules so you may configure ingress to say what if you if someone asks me for my favorite application dot com when it have a query has to be routed to service a and if it asks for anothergreatservice.com then the query should be routed to service b and well there are very many different setup obviously setup options and configurations but in short kubernetes ingress is an entry point uh for the outer connections via routing so you may specify which query goes to which place on production mostly probably you are going to use ingress on testing and development purposes it may be easier to use service open to outer world and we are getting very close to the end of my overview so we can jump to the real code kubernetes persistent data so what's the uh story behind persistent data the trick is it's not so obvious and not so simple to work with persistent data and data you want to store even if your port was terminated and kubernetes so uh here on the right we see a little sham how it works all together first of all to work with persistent data you are going to create some persistent volumes and every volume needs to have a storage class storage class depends on the uh environment you are working with so it will be different if you work on like bare metal linux server your own on-premises or if you work with google kubernetes engine storage class will be different for example then um port may make a persistent volume claim so that's a kind a request for the persistent volume uh if this persistent volume claim can be executed and so you have persistent volume available available for this spot and for this claim when this persistent volume will be arranged to this port so that may be not as simple as we work it with volumes using docker as it is persistent data is a long story in kubernetes so if you are going to use it on production i do ask you and i do tell you this introduction level workshop is not enough and you do want to make a deeper dive but for the overview purposes that's for the beginning will be enough and a little bit of overview how it works in the real life and how your application looks running in kubernetes in the real life that's the simple application example with the persistent storage oh sorry that's a typo that's not a persistent storage but with a configuration um what we see here that's a simple shama we have that's our application just myapp.com it's a stateless for the simplicity and the beginning you see the ingress ingress receives or external queries when you have a service this svc is an abbreviation for a service so you can so we see what ingress sends all the queries to a single service behind service we see a group of ports three ports in this case those are managed by replica set uh defined by the deployment you remember yes what deployment defines groups of port and deployment controller creates replica set to establish replication for them this one is a bit transparent so don't that make a too deep or too much on that for now that's not important then finally we have some secrets allocated to these spots and config map allocated to this spot as well so we will share the configuration that's a very simple example usually things look like more sophisticated mostly the same example but with a persistent storage already higher level will look the same ingress service group of pots managed by deployment and now we have this persistent volume claim allocated for the persistent volume and persistent volume has a storage class um we do have a good question again from arbit thank you for being there week after week um so what's difference between a docker volume and a kubernetes volume and so in my in in my you will complete my answer but in my perspective so docker volume is really a folder somewhere you know in your file system uh just mounting um a file system whereas in kubernetes a volume persistent volume has a real specification so it's not only file system you can so it's used storage class as defined by by alex and you can have multiple implementation of this persistent volume you can use ebs block storage you can use depending on where you are which cloud you are using you will have not the same implementation of this volume why because maybe you want i i i o you know very high throughput and you will have dedicated type of volume maybe ssd just to be as fast as possible but it's it's it's more expensive yep uh so uh there is nearly nothing to add because you explain that uh mostly all of that the point is when you're using plain docker mostly probably like 98 persons maybe uh your volume is going to be just a folder in the deeps but usually it's just a folder well maybe not 98 but around 92 or something like that but there are other drivers so in some cases you may need to use another kind of a storage and it's absolutely possible with docker um but usually it's just a folder and sq bernatus is a production-ready tool so you can use different storage classes the mostly probably depending on the platform you are using on-premises it will be this one on-premises with uh network attached storage it will be another one and so on and so forth on amazon it will be different so that's already platform specific good but all of those were simple applications and this one looks a bit more advanced and more realistic to be honest uh for example here we working again with a single ingress and only one service behind that but this service which is a main service for us uh the application will also work with a database notice there is no direct connection between ingress and database service why because you don't want your database to be available outside only internal network connection is supported so it's kind of a security question but also application may use another services um so in this case it uses only one simple example back-end service which i don't know maybe caches some information or executes any another job and in most of the cases that's exactly that how application looks like sometimes simpler sometimes harder but that's how it usually looks like of course with persistent volume claims for database it's out of a scope key it's not shown but of course your database is going to use persistent volumes and one more thing i didn't mention before is the namespace again as kubernetes cluster may work with dozens or maybe hundreds of different applications communicating with each other or standalone you don't have one to have them all together running in the single namespace in the single space we use namespaces in the kubernetes cluster in kubernetes to isolate some logical spaces uh one from another for example you want to isolate one application from another one or you want to isolate monitoring part of your system from the production part of your system so they will not they will be isolated that's um not even so much about the security but about manageability because if you have to if you uh ask like cubesitl uh getservices and you have ten thousands of services running it's not going to be easy to handle them so namespaces are about logical grouping of the things and oops okay i see apps no no no no no we are just starting good so and then let me dive to the next thing we are going to we are going to cover today so yes we can run things using direct cube ctl commands but we in general should tend to use files and how does the earth files look like let me show you so you have heard maybe about your video killer video is our killer video ah no it has a separate okay so let me switch them and i copy paste the link in the description and also the all in one because this is probably where you exactly you know everything of course thank you yeah so we have a killer video all in one repository and that's so if you don't know killer video very simple to explain it's our demo application reference application showing how we work with cassandra apache cassandra and datastax enterprise today we will use it for the demonstration purpose to demonstrate how it works with kubernetes just because it's a pretty nice architecture in general kill your video you can consider as a youtube for example so it's kinda a video hosting it's a demo application so please don't use killervideo.com to store your real files uh but yeah it's a clone of youtube so uh i will make it bigger hope you can see that yeah that looks pretty good so we start with docker compose uh just to make it uh easier to realize before we proceed to kubernetes manifests so that's a docker compose yaml file which describes how application looks like when you run it on a staging when you run it on the testing or locally we have some services we need to run for example web service will be web frontend of course and back end will be as you could guess backhand so back and services we may need also studio on uh to manage cassandra as it's a demo application to work with cassandra we are going to have database because we need to have database of course and a couple of more services i don't want to discuss right now because what's out of scope we speak about the kubernetes today but there is nice interesting thing uh to mention dse config is a one-time bootstrap container we want it to be executed only once not run all the time in the background so uh how it works i will show you in a moment in the kubernetes files there are some options uh you may uh you may be familiar with and some uh maybe not so familiar to you let's take a look so image port depends on environment that's all understandable but what's the label and specifically compose service type node port that makes what does that make very easy uh there is a special tool called compose which allows you to convert your docker compose files into kubernetes manifests and that's really cool um you still have to be very careful because after this kind of convertation it will not will be production ready so you need to walk through them and see but if you just want quickly to convert from um docker compose into kubernetes manifests and you are fine if there can be not too if there may be some scratches let's say then this compose is nearly perfect uh tool it very it's very smart so it converts everything what we describe here like that uh it will use uh image for the deployment uh exactly this one it will expose ports and it will create service based on this definition uh push some environment things into the deployments and so on but uh docker compose does not allow you to uh set some special settings for service for example because well it's a docker compose file it's not for kubernetes technically so if you want compose to give compose some hints like how do you want to have your service in this case when we just use labels for docker and docker compose they change nothing because those are just uh some metadata for it like not real data but compose knows what if it has a compose.service.type then service for this deployment has to need to have type noteboard what is it i will show you in a moment and mostly the same for some other things we will have note we will use noteport for studio and i think that's it that so we can proceed finally to kubernetes manifests so where is the folder called kubernetes oh by the way we didn't explain what does that mean k8s it's just abbreviation that's exactly kubernetes but people are lazy to type kubernetes all the time so we cut off eight characters from the word uh kubernetes and now everyone bro writes that like k8s yeah okay ok you can read it simply as kubernetes or k-test doesn't matter it's all the same so here we have all the files created by compose for our deployment of killer video in kubernetes maybe with some minor adjustments and that's interesting what in general you can put it exactly to one single file but it will be too big you will see what the kubernetes manifests are too big and what we want to have here is uh maybe a little bit smaller files easier to understand so for example at first we can take a look at the bot as you remember pod is the smallest deployment deployable you need base unit in the kubernetes you can manage and that's uh kubernetes manifest we work with and that's a very simple one so every kubernetes manifest always starts with some simple definitions first which api version it's going to use which is mostly uh we won so far for with simple objects like pot then kind kind what is it exactly this one is sport because well it's a pot if it would be service when it will be a service or deployment we will see it then there are some metadata so some meta properties of the port we are going to create creation timestamp is now yet uh we will have labels in this case labels is a simple thing as a compose creates this file and copy paste all labels you have to the labels of every configuration file it creates and the name of this port will be dlc config it's just a name but then there is more interesting thing which is a spec so uh settings for what we are going to have it will have containers and it will have only one container for this one we don't need multiple containers image we are going to use uh name of this container it's a kind of optional this one can be cut off and restart policy on failure as it's a single run setup port which technically should be done by job in kubernetes but job's out of scope for this workshop we just run a pot to do all the setup job for us and it has a restart policy on failure that's important it means what if port container in this spot exits with exit code 0 which in linux world means success it this port will not be restarted by kubernetes because restart policy is on failure so with pod it runs it exits as it if it exits with exit code zero we don't touch it anymore but that's a rare use case mostly probably you want your containers to be running longer here comes the deployments at first i will take a look at the web deployment and web service so and here is a very important thing to understand about how kubernetes works selectors um but first let's speak about them deployment we have so metadata master yeah can you zoom a little oh one more okay yeah i hope yes thank you yeah yeah yeah good so it's a bit too small uh first metadata so uh labels you know it comes from compose it doesn't matter name of this deployment will be web and we will have some annotations there so how exactly it was created by compose that's a compose artifacts usually you don't see too often in the kubernetes definitions then we have already interesting things first how many replicas we are going to use by default as we don't know where exactly these uh kubernetes manifest web deployment will be executed we set it to one if you run it on production mostly probably you are going to adjust this value to some higher numbers and specs we are using we will it will this spot both of these deployments will have only one container so we are using only one container um it will have environment killer video logging level equals debug so let's uh just copy paste from docker compose yaml file and that's what i speak when i say what compose is not like for direct usage on productions you may mostly probably want to adjust things like that when which image we are going to use and which name it will have and which container port we will open uh to be available at this spot and we may switch to web service and actually i will need both of the files because that's very important thing to understand how selector works so notice these um speaking of metadata these uh ports of this deployment it has named web and uh container has name web as well be if we go to uh web service do you remember what the service is is a facet uh kinda front end gate for the pots of a deployment it works with and in this case we have an important thing this one so first part belongs defines them service as it is which port will be open port 3000 and part target port 3000 so as a target port on the pods we are working with we will use port 3000. also port 3000 will be default for default port for this service very easy and now comes very important for point how service understands which ports it uses it with which pots it works due to selector and that's a very common technique in kubernetes you have some services working with another based on the selectors and selector in this case we see eo dot compose dot service web where does it come from we have where is it oh yeah labels we have labels here here dot compose dot service web so that's a very simple selector based on labels we it will work with all the pots label it like your.compose.service web and we see it in the selector so as a result this service will automatically be a front-end for all the ports with this label you you see right here i don't cover it no i think i don't good and finally last setting service will have type not board and node port is an interesting thing from one point of view node port is one of the widely used service types in kubernetes from another point a point you uh should never shouldn't well maybe not never but try not to use it in production what does that mean note board it means uh what this service will be available not only internally but also externally on port 3000 and as a result when you have files when you have a service available or running at this node node a let's say let's say you have three nodes node a node b node c if your service if your container runs at the port node file node a it will open port 3000 at this node what's the problem first of all your node has only one port 3000 or any in our port only one time it means what you cannot um just allocate second port using the same uh port it will be blocked already it will be in use another point what for example you are going to have multiple nodes one instance of this service available like let's say it's stateful and you can't run many of them and then today this boat runs in the node a and tomorrow note a got some troubles like maybe some issues with disk or whatever and port and pod has to be reallocated to another node what happens then ip address changes of course and you have to reconfigure external services using this service which is obviously in many cases maybe a very very very bad idea especially if you don't manage them directly so um we do suggest to use node ports only in the scenarios like development testing maybe some special kinds of staging but in general staging should look like your production infrastructure and therefore it should not have node ports try to avoid them how to avoid them use ingresses very simple that's for testing so we don't use ingresses here we use just node ports because it all runs usually on a single node no problems good and then some more things to consider here i told you about um so others other players will be similar uh if this application uh has to be accessible externally or internally it will have service web service uh has service because it's available from outer world back-end deployment sorry back-end service is needed because web service will access end so it has to be opened but it doesn't need to have node port it has no node port why because backend should not be available externally we don't need that at all but we still need service and there are some more cases for example like where is it generator generator deployment it's a special service for killer video has no service at all why uh because it only executes it never answer your questions it always ask questions like create that create these write a comment and so on so as long as no one wants to communicate with generator i don't need to have a service that's enough for me to have the deployment okay um can you can you say a word about the version you know api version v1 api version v1 beta you know first line of the yaml file so as far as i know this is simply version number to i mean used by kubernetes for validation of the file and try to cope with version of kubernetes you want to deploy yep exactly so uh take a look api version explains to kubernetes where to look for the definition and processors let's say for this kind of manifest in this case we use manifest kind deployment and this api version is actually i guess awfully outdated because it was added approximately two years ago yes it was added by me two years ago so now recommended api version for the deployment will be different and there is a very interesting point to notice about api version in some cases it may be just v1 because we work with port you remember port has api version if you want because it's a base unit in kubernetes so it's a built-in type but if you work with more advanced things like uh extensions for kubernetes custom extensions not built-in types but for example operators like we speak about gas operator that's the operator we use to work with cassandra in kubernetes of course so we may find give me a moment i will find a separator cass operator that should be this one i guess do we really introduce the operator concept uh not in this workshop because otherwise we will over uh tonight yeah i agree so just for everyone if you are new with kubernetes so in kubernetes there are multiple type of resources we talk about pods which is the default and basic one there are multiple kind of resources could be a config map to store your keys could be secret to store your password could be replica set if you want your pods to have multiple instances that's not the point those are default and basic resources but at some points you need some custom behavior you know for with cassandra for instance this is the one we know best when you start a cluster you want to start node one after the other this is what we called node bootstrapping and if you do if you tell nothing to kubernetes kubernetes we'll start to we try to start all the nodes at the same time so we need to tell kubernetes how to interact with our application and to do that we are using custom resources okay so load are called custom custom definition resources never mind and we need an operator and this operator will really listen what is the state of the current application and interact with it and we need that intelligence on top of basic resources from kubernetes and this is bring by an operator yep exactly uh it may be not the best comparison from the technical point of view but it really explains why do we need operators in general you can consider every operator as a management tool for some specific application so it's kind of a package manager we can say well it's moral helm like a package manager doesn't matter but if you want to install grafana with some default dashboards the grafana operator will do it for you much better than you could do in the beginning cassandra bootstrap and management is also not a simple thing that's why we use cassandra operator to simplify operations with cassandra on kubernetes at all so my point was if we open example cassandra data center that's the beginning of a file a file every category every kubernetes manifest starts with two lines api version in and kind kind says what is it this manifest about at we see we say cassandra data center that's the customer resource definition introduced by data stacks of course and here we see api version so api version helps to kubernetes to realize who is the owner of this kind and there are them information how to process it what has to be done when we create a cassandra data center because if you would say like uh api version v1 kind cassandra data center kubernetes cannot do that because cassandra data center is not a built-in type of course it's a well yeah it's just not a built-in type type so we say here cassandra data stocks com v1 beta 1 and therefore kubernetes knows what these kind of resource risk manifest goes to cassandra data stacks com so cassandra operator must be installed to process this kind of definitions i hope i've answered these great question yes you do and more questions are coming regarding performance of cassandra inside kubernetes you know it's it's like a virtual machine is not as fast as uh bare metal but you know what also what is neat with cassandra's horizontal stability you need you want more small nodes that you know bigger nodes so yes that's slower meaning in kubernetes it's still virtualization you can find some pretty fast storage class remember the persistent volume to interact with your data using ssd but that's still slower than bare metal you bring some flexibility with virtualization but you miss a little bit of performance yep and pranaly asked is it the same operator is it the same as an application so basically apparature is an application but we call it operator because it's created to do some maintenance job uh on kubernetes uh for you so cassandra operator knows how exactly to install uh cassandra as we speak about cassandra operator which settings has to be done how to better run a rolling reboot and so on and so forth good i hope the answer answered this one so and now finally i want to do some practical steps because well that's time goes by talk it's cheap helm is a operator manager so with helm you install operators in and kubernetes applications as well does kubernetes fail a port then associated uh storage claim has issues for example corruption wow i think it all depends on the liveness probe so kubernetes we interact with your pod using some probes just to see if the pod is running and if the probe is lc two probes to http code so if your disk is corrupted that mean that the else probe of your pod should take that into account i don't think kubernetes by his own try to interact with your volume so this is really part of you when you build the elf probe to be aware that you know the volume should be there i think yeah that sounds very reasonable uh i mean um data corruption first of all this kind of a corruption corruption you may use uh old-school hard disk drive and have some um uh failed beats on the this hard disk drive that's one kind of a corruption or maybe there may be some um result files written in a wrong format and so on so it's also data corrupted but i doubt if kubernetes should react on that so that's in general about monitoring for events which is out of scope for the kubernetes for developers and yes and you know thinking about dp a great question dp today you know you put you put me on the spot answering your question to be honest but that's very good you know i also learned in the process is it too much to handle but app developer maybe maybe those con those discussions should be done by both people from productions and developer because the guys from the upside probably have a lot of procedures monitoring tools to handle these pods and kubernetes resources and you will probably follow the same path yep i would say take a look bright applications as we use it to write before and write applications to run on kubernetes may require different and more knowledge uh from developer site absolutely and we can consider it as an disadvantage as long as we don't get a higher paycheck so kubernetes enable developers who care about how their application will run and understand some nuances of course they are higher paid than developers who doesn't care so there are no doubts for me it's fine because i always care yeah but yours you come also from the upside yeah i have hope's background uh mostly probably that's why i care okay so uh we can go with um then a little demon so and uh first thing about how to run uh kubernetes again we always say that's not enough to listen to us you always have to put your hands on and do your job and that's the only way to learn it better there is no shortcuts that's on just go and do that and we have some options first of all a very good way to run it on your own machine as long as you have um docker installer is kind kind uh is literally kubernetes in docker and that's the test environment and development environment you do not want to run kind on production kind is a pretty funny thing if you think about that kind great special docker containers those behave like kubernetes nodes that's uh pretty funny and they you work with them and they answer like kubernetes notes so you you work with them using cubesat installation of a kind is pretty straightforward as long as you have docker installed and docker compose uh there is my installation point quick start brew install kind here we go welcome so uh on linux and on uh mac it's usually like that you just copy paste latest executable file set the executable bit on that and you can go on yes and that's it and you know remember i will provide a link in the chat where how to install all these tools because those are part of the you know longer kubernetes and so when i have it right here and let me make it a bit bigger for you i have kind install it so it's very easy for me to use i think it will be fine and i uh create a cluster for myself the uh there is a file uh kind config and i'm going to adjust something here so we don't need that we don't need that yes so we are using kind um maybe you have also heard about mini cube this is another way to run kubernetes machine why did we pick kind easily because with kind you can have one kubernetes master and multiple workers and because we are doing demo with kubernetes with cassandra and multiple nodes it's easier for us to have multiple workers yep so a mini cube isn't bad and if you want to have if you are fine to have only one node in your cluster which is again for development purposes usually enough uh then you're completely good to go with um mini cube in our case kind works much better so here we have my cluster definition which is first kind cluster api version kind x kubernetes eom so we know what's that that's an extension and we are going to have some nodes in this case we are going to have four nodes one will be control plane so master and we will have three workers and here is a kind specific thing if you going to use node ports with kind and kind runs docker and docker as a result you your node ports will be opened to a docker container but will be not available from your host machine so in this case to make application available from out for outer world my node port services i'm also has to use extra port mappings to forward port 3000 which is going to be used by my web application and i'm doing that for every node because there are no labels and i don't know which node will have my web application running in the end because maybe randomly allocated for one of them as you see i have some space for improvements here okay so now i'm going to apply this file and this one i'm doing with kind don't forget we aren't reached yet um keep still and to create a cluster i go with kind create cluster name will be test and config will be in cannedconfig.yaml which i've just created and kind starts to create my cluster it will be pretty quick because the image is downloaded already so we just need some seconds to start up the notes and we see what it starts uh four notes so one master note and three workers and it's going to be something went wrong okay what was wrong words okay i already have something running here that's weird okay i think i've cleaned that kind delete cluster name test name test and test okay uh so kind get clusters no clusters found so i think i can repeat this aquarium so that was a short answer could i use kind on production no so but besides kind while it's installing i want to show you a couple of more options i'm only curious is my port free okay it looks like my port is still not free and that's a bug because uh it is free port is not available address and ready use funding but ok i know how to fix that so it doesn't matter that should not happen for you but may happen to me i will simply use another for my host board will be three hundred three thousand twenty white one hundred so i can create it again so okay while it's creating let me show you something different uh another option to use to play with uh kubernetes is uh labs dot play dash with kubernetes dot com i will copy paste the link good it's in the chat uh that's the tool you can use like you've seen already play with docker maybe you can use that that play with kubernetes and that's the same idea kubernetes as a service don't use it for production workloads all the notes will be terminated within four hours but to play with docker it's uh very good and you can have multiple nodes which is nice for example i've used node 1 to initialize kubernetes cluster using cube adm cube adam is a built-in kubernetes tool to setup cluster of course and i believe i created router already so now i can use suggested command for on other nodes to join so now if i can you see that is it big enough it's a bit small for me okay i will try to make it bigger hey there just a second oops get back okay now it's too small for me but okay i will try and um then uh cassandra oh sorry cassandra kubernetes cluster was initialized it suggested me which command to use on other nodes i want to join this cluster so if i now say cube ctl get notes we will see only one note which is kind of not ready so mostly probably i want to restart that um or i will simply run a new session doesn't matter but anyway on the next now you know i really want to start a new session to show it connection has been lost of course because session is closed to log in on the lapse uh play with kubernetes you may need to use your github account or what was that hub.docker.com account okay so now it's uh refreshed i'm adding some new notes hey there where's my note i'm really afraid to reload that like so last time i tried to use play with docker it was also behaving like that in general local usage is of course always better and finally so it doesn't create any instances for me thank you so much uh finally if you uh it's a caching problem it was the same with play with docker if you cannot use by any reason labs play with kubernetes.com and you can't use it locally write me an email i will send you a linux machine with kind and starlet so you will be able to use that on your side with no problems yeah because this doesn't work to me that's stupid that's funny this morning it worked very well but okay yeah it's the same session id and i guess it will not create oh yes it created a note for me great so i now kinda have two virtual servers first one i'm going to initialize cluster master node so there are the commands i need to use to make them running it may take some moments because to run kubernetes cluster kubernetes has to pull some docker images so meanwhile we can jump to my and that's something very wrong is happening with my kind that's incredible oh hey okay i have plan b doesn't matter plan c already response from demon ports are not available 900 is already in use ah of course that's my bad because host port has to be different that's easy three thousand three thousand one three thousand two that's it i have only one machine of course so that was the problem okay i have to delete good and i can create it again that was on my site don't blame kind i'm sorry so meanwhile our first note was initialized we need to execute one more command to initialize cluster networking otherwise network will not work for me this one is going to be very quick it's done and now i can join any number of worker nodes to my cluster and that's the command suggested to me by kubernetes that's going to be cube admin join ip of my machine which port to use with some tokens and discovery tokens now i can go to node 2 and i will use even one more so i go to node 2 i copy paste this command coupe cube admin join it again will take some time and i will run the same on note 3 how it goes for these gentlemen already i don't care so it looks like they are joining waiting for the cubelet to perform a tls bootstrap and i can try to ask cubesitl cubecontrol get notes okay so perfect it works already by the comment cubecontrol getnotes i get the result what i have three notes one is master h is 105 seconds and i have two notes those are not masters they are not ready of course because they are bootstrapping okay second one looks ready and third one looks ready so now if i say get notes okay second one is ready already now there is an interesting trick please think a little bit try to guess it's hard to answer don't worry does it have any kind of running pots in this moment cedric you know the answer wait a second let them think write an answer in the chat yeah do you think do you think there are some pots running or not i will check meanwhile no space left on device okay so no there is nothing running nothing running oh my god so locally it's not the great day today docker system prune that okay we still have a web version so it doesn't matter and third note is still not ready i don't know what happened to that the note has joined it for cluster it says but okay this note will be enough for me interesting what happened to that but that would be enough so meanwhile answering questions answer is complicated and not so obvious as you may think if i say cubesitel get pots it will answers no resources found in the default namespace but if i say cubectl getports o namespaces we found out what we have pretty a lot of things running what how it comes why do we have pots running already answer is there uh uh service mechanisms in kubernetes kubernetes as it is and all of them are also running as spots so kubernetes as it is a set of pots and that's pretty interesting moment now i see some of them are ready some of them are not ready let's give them a moment to bootstrap maybe they need a longer time or i may add one more note let's walk through the technical things we have here right now and what does that have core dns what does that mean do you remember we discussed that service auto discovery routing and so on and so forth kubernetes inside has real the main network system servers those answer your queries so core dns is a real domain name server answering queries then utcd i mentioned that in the very beginning ktcd is the database kubernetes uses to store config again for service discovery and some more options when we have a cube api server so that's a api server running on the master node which reacts when you do cube ctl cubesat makes a request to api server using kubernetes api when we have cube controller manager well that's the controller manager the brain let's say and then we have some proxies and rotors and the scheduler node so let's take a look at another thing first of all no container creating in it so it looks like uh those uh not running will be launched at some moment but now let's take a look on a better thing i want to see which nodes are those spots running and i can say dash o so for options and i can say option white option white means what for get command i will get a bigger output so some more details now i can see what they're running on different nodes and let's take a look at the thing if i tell a cube city l get pots and i will grab for node one do you remember node one is a master node uh we will have some things here like core dns etcd api server controller manager proxy router and scheduler right a lot a long list of the things but if i run the same command uh looking for the note 2 answer will be much shorter why because uh node one is dedicated for management over cluster and node two is dedicated to should to execute pots to keep nodes running usually worker nodes are much more powerful and usually worker nodes uh don't need so much processes to run they use router so it's a part of a software-defined network in kubernetes so every query comes to this node will be dispatched to a proper container proper pot and it's all processed by proxima and if you would ask for node 3 i guess answer will be the same if we will get any answer after yes after all okay so something goes wrong with the note 3 but we don't care so much it's just not started yet although six minutes it was enough good and i will try to start with this one so first of all i'm switching to node one and i will need to have my video all in one file so what i'm going to do is simply git clone this file this project to my kubernetes enabled application so clone address and that should be enough luckily this note has git installed so no more steps for me to do and i can switch to killer video all in one and i can switch to kubernetes folder and there are two main ways for us uh we may run application as discussed before okay it's weird but okay okay so uh we can execute direct commands or we can apply files so in this case uh we can start with a very simple one we can do uh cube ctl apply and apply first a simple file before we proceed to kill your video and before we go where let's take a look at the definition of this file so i'm not executing this cupca tail apply but i just open this file and i will make it a little bit smaller because it's too big i hope for you as well and we see first it def has only two definitions single file two definitions perfectly fine one is deployment and one is service both have simple api versions because those are built-in definitions built-in manifests first one we create deployment name will be my nginx and labels will be up engine x as you will work more with cubes kubernetes you will meet that more and more often that's like very traditional to uh separate uh applications deployments ports for selectors using up equals something and when we have a specification for this deployment we will have three replicas and a template for the pots of this one because deployment is defined with template and this template defines the port which ports will be created it will have metadata labels up engine x so every port will have label up engine x and it has spec specification every port will have one running container one and only one it will use it will has name engine x image engine x142 and it will have ponte container port 80 open for the service and now we can proceed to service that's service first don't forget important thing for us is selector we know what it will choose all pots where label up will have value and geniux very simple and these service will have type load balancer so it will not just throw randomly queries to the pots available but it will also have some balancing i don't remember what now in kubernetes i guess that's kind of round robin and finally it will has port 18. pretty obvious so let's execute this command okay so answer is simple service my unix service created deployment my unix created now we can say cube ctl get put and we see our pots are running that's quick to start engineering and then we can say cube ctl get what else could we take a look at deployments deployment story and we see we have only one deployment and if a default name space call it my engine is exactly what we created right now and finally if we look for services and here notice instead of the full names you may use aliases to not type for too long instead of a service i write svc it perfectly works as well i see what i have two services one is kubernetes as it is and second is my nginx svc um and those are main things for us that's important to understand i guess for a service i needed to to a switch type to node port otherwise i will be not able to access those load balancers but that's fine because we we always can change that so we can take a look at the pots now and those are my pots but i want to know more about them so i say yes all okay i don't need all name spaces but i definitely need a dash oh white so i will see the nodes and others so i see what all my ports are running at node 2 and that's pretty obvious node 3 is still dead maybe i'll have to add one more and uh note 2 obviously is very for the one and only worker so pots will be scheduled for the worker it all runs uh with pots on my note 2 here [Music] and let me take a look that's node 2. a very important comment for us to know is cuba city described so it gets more information about one particular application or whatever you are interested in running cube ctl describe port and i will simply copy paste these value oops wrong click good so i see information about my running port here and what i want to see overall name namespace default and that's not important so where is it located what's its internal cube ctl ip address it's controlled by replica set you remember i've noticed it so we define it with deployment and deployment controller creates replica set to establish a replication for these services we see details about for containers so we have only one container as discussed before it has port 80 host port is not allocated because of a service type wrong and that should be enough for us to know and now i want to change these service to make it available for us or you know what i would better switch to my uh cube ctl i would better switch to my killer video application so what i want to do first i want to wipe out this application how we do that first very easily in this case we say uh into create that the said cubectl apply and gave a file and now then to delete that will be very easy we just delete using the same file in this case file is located remotely on github but well usually of course we work with normal files over local file system so we can again say cube ctl get pods and there will be no ports in default namespace the same relates to services and deployment we have only kubernetes which is the default one so uh we have our kubernetes definitions now i and they use node ports so i can show you how they work the command will be exactly the same cube ctl apply and dash f and what exactly i'm going to apply i'm going to apply all files out of this folder and something is wrong oh okay that's fine uh so i'm specifying the folder i'm going to apply and um cubesat goes what's okay there this one was created two years ago so we have it looks like we have to adjust the kubernetes deployment for killer video and we have problems with deployment which is not a big deal because it's easy to fix and i will fix that right now for the deployment right here it was ups v1 so no worries and first deployment we have to fix is backhand deployment yaman and of course it has no nano i hope it has v ok that's better so i only has to adjust these line boom ups v1 right quit boom okay better good so what's the benefit of this approach for files one of them i can easily replay the command as long as there are some changes changes will be applied but if there are no changes for some of the files for example service web is created already it will be not touched so it's very easy um declarative manner so those are configured so nothing is changed those are not fixed yet and something is not fine message required field selector in deployment spec if you choose to ignore swester or validate fails okay i will usefully date files or yeah that should work fine no much for candy okay yeah it looks like that's a pretty obsolete yeah we really have to update that for a newer version of the api of the kubernetes um regarding the things we have right now so it requires selector okay anyway for the next step i will fix this deployment file and you will have it in our absolute wrong side where is it where is the killer video um docker learning path adjusted for week five so it will work for you next half an hour and as we are out of time for today the last things we have to do week five uh assignment so uh e that's first i speak to people from the docker learning path now i want you to get a little bit rest read additional materials and prepare for final assignment which goes live tomorrow you will receive an email if you registered for the eventbrite um for data for docker learning pub if you will not write me on discord or email alexander.washnev at datastax.com and now for those who are still hungry and wants to do more if you go with only for this workshop and want to put your hands on more on the kubernetes i only happy to hear that you can go with labs dot play dash with kubernetes dot com or install kind or mini cube locally and use application from week 2 or week 3 of this learning path and run it in kubernetes and it may be not easy in the beginning so there are two options or you may want to use compose to convert docker compose files or you may want to write kubernetes manifests manually and i would suggest to go basically both because they give different experience if you have time that will be great if something doesn't work for you ask us at the discord you don't need to install discord for that you can do it in browser and basically that's it for today so it was a great session yeah thank you so much thank you for your help uh it's always pleasure and most of all thank you everyone of the attendees i see so many many people stayed with us till the very end that's incredible we are always happy and see you soon thank you very much [Music] [Music] change [Music] [Music] cool [Music] you [Music]",
