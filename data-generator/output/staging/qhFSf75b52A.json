    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] welcome to the distributed data show this is David Gilardi and with me I have Q Gabriel I and over in the remote world there we have Darla Baker hello and we're gonna we're gonna talk about data sex manage cloud alright so I'm just gonna start it off right what are you guys can someone explain to me what is DMC what's the Deus Ex magic lot yeah our you should take that one so data is effects manage cloud is data stacks offering of management of your data database in the cloud so you its database as a service essentially we provide in in your cloud environment we provide end-to-end management and metrics monitoring and uptime guarantees for your your database okay so like so from a standpoint of like Sam a developer coming into this or you know I mean you know I'm in operations or something like that are we saying that instead of me having to worry about like my own bare metal or spinning at my own cloud instances or something like that you guys essentially are handling the the database end like and end 'full thing yeah I mean yes as a service model okay okay so like whoo so that kind of lends itself into like you know who might use this right I could I could I could see that easily from the developer standpoint as a matter of fact you know shameless plug for the killer video reference app right we're actually we're actually using DMC for our back-end cluster right so I have my answer to who I think might use this but I kind of want to know like from your standpoint you know do you guys have particular types of folks that you you think would use this or you know types of businesses organizations or anything or you know what's your what's your take on that yeah I mean short for me you know I I worked through the full stack and there's a lot that I'm excited about when it comes to having new DMC is an option for me you know in my when I'm wearing my architect hat it's really convenient to be able to think okay here's the component that is has been massively simplified for me and I don't think as much about the operations of it and I can just say okay here's that square DMC that's data stacks and then I can move on to the rest of my architecture you know similarly as a developer in my role as a developer I'm thinking about I don't have to get all wrapped up in okay I have to set up this whole environment you know I can just focus on my code and how I need to store my data and get my data and focus on adding value there and then when I'm wearing my operator hat you know all these are obviously usually different people and most organizations there's an operator hat you know it's just one less environment that I have to you know pay a lot of attention to I can just think okay check in with the DMC team we have regular check-ins and how are things looking is there anything we need to know about that's that is really liberating for me to have just one less several less things to have to think about I work on the operations engineering team on the data section managed cloud team so we're where most of the effort comes into play is in the reducing the operational complexity so an operations are an SRE team for a business has the you know you have a focus on the business whereas the the complexity of just the database is abstracted so you know you have the ability to to see what the database is doing through through our console and you know with logging and health metrics and whatnot but you don't have to worry about it we receive reports we we deal with the alerts and you know for our self-healing and just basically provision and forget it for the most part and and yet at the same time we engage with you when your application changes to ensure that the database continues to function oh so that's that's interesting there so when you say that your application changes like what kind of changes are you referring to like are you talking about like hey I've got a schema change in my Cassandra table or like what yeah what I see you shaking your head see which what kind of changes are in mind well yeah like like Darla was talking about you know if you if a schema change obviously you know you want to work with us to to make those changes okay that way we can know what's coming down it's also gives us an opportunity to help you in kind of in a consultative role to say this data model looks potentially problematic or I mean there's some things that are gray area it's not like a bad data model but it's not a great data model but it is what fits the problem best but we may need to have heads-up on that because we can also say what you know really to do as well with a good degree of consistency or not consistency dependability maybe we need to scale this cluster out and so we can be a partner with you in that regard which is also very comforting you know I actually manage our professional services team and that's something that we have our consultants go help people with and to have that level of guidance at you know from your manage service partner in DMC is very very valuable so is that is that something that you guys like it sounds like you're you're watching the system right and that from a performance standpoint or whatever is there some like threshold I'm not looking for the exact numbers or anything obviously it's gonna be dirty - yeah 40 - oh that's a great that is the threshold 42 is totally a threshold right but is there you know are you guys then managing the system and you're watching performance you're watching maybe for certain indicators and if something kind of gets to a you know past a certain point you're like okay hey maybe it is time to kind of scale it out like is that is that part of what DMC is yeah definitely we're watching watching key metrics all the time and both taking Media corrective action were necessary but always reading with the customer to you know to figure out what might be going on I mean all of us you have been been part of an application lifecycle know that you can make changes to an application that effect the database yeah and we need to we need to be sure that we're we're on top of that so so there's a lot of engagement there the other thing to the DMC provides the developers the ability to very easily you know spin up to test and you know and not not have to worry about you know getting approvals or things like that you know once you once you're on the platform you can you can say hey I need a I need a three node graph cluster two two piece of the application out and get some really really fast feedback on that in a throwaway environment that you know that we can you know that without in having to involve anybody and and that's that's a that's a distinct advantage because that's operational complexity to most developers don't want to deep dive into tuning and configuring a database they just want it to be there and likewise on the operational side most operation teams are DevOps teams or whatever need to or build automation for their application but from the standpoint of just the the database that aspect is handled for them okay and if it but we also provide an API that will help with with non production automation as well if they want to do that on their own okay all right that's actually quite a bit of stuff in there honestly I didn't know you did some of that that's that's kind of funny so I'm curious from the you know from from the standpoint of say like a developer someone needed needing to provision a cluster or whatever right it sounds like there are some controls like a dead cluster I just need to spin something up I need to test something like how do you guys control there's like a time to live on this you know are you watching and going hey you know you spun this development cluster up and it's been up for you know a month are you star you still using it I'm not seeing any activity like is that something you guys kind of control or you just leave that up to the folks so the because the clusters live in your cloud environment typically you'll be typically cut a company will have either their own garbage collection types of activities or types of services running or they they have some sort of human monitoring of a bill that says hey why is this three node cluster been running for three months with no activity so we don't we don't micromanage that that's up customer you can still at eight the capabilities right right I mean if a customer were to ask us to - you know - - for example we we get asked to tag clusters in a way that that allowed their garbage collection to work properly we do do that but if a customer said hey we oh we don't want you know we won't want them to be killed then we would certainly we could do that but typically that's not something that we could ask okay but the customer will generally have that you know it's kind of funny there's all sorts of little tidbits of information I'm getting out of you guys right now that I think would be really useful for what we're doing so so I'm like oh I'm gonna have to come back to Darla and start hitting her up for some of this stuff so so another like a another question along so it sounds like okay you said in the beginning that you support the operations and management like end to end right so one of the things I know that is on mine for me is like what about upgrades and that kind of deal you know where there's nice new shiny stuff coming out in the next DC stack or whatever how does that get handle is that on me is that on you like how to where's that complain are you talking about versions that aren't yet out no let's just I meant my question for Miss Dan point of like a ga version that yeah is is ready and baked not not something that's like a pre-release or anything yes oh sorry I was thinking about the the the a feature that we don't yet have but would like to is the ability to you know to test out a pre-release version because those things kind of you know there there are customers who like to stay behind the curve a bit yeah and our customers that like to be on the bleeding edge and certainly developers that are looking for you know say a particular spark feature or something that's that's just being being added and it's and that ability to experiment in preparation for for a release that then there are their applications coming down the road so and that in that sense those are those are really shiny objects right yeah to to want to play with which I I do believe we will support in the future but not yet otherwise then of course the you know anything that is available currently we would have any release you know up to the latest release available to to be able to test whatever whatever features we have in the SE okay okay very cool so is there anything that you like either one of you guys anything you think we haven't really kind of hit on some highlights or anything as far as the DMC that you you want to tell people about mmm unless that's come to mind right now you've done a pretty good job of asking us good good open-ended questions and you know I'll take that that's a good way to just bring it back to me so thank you so much q and Darla's for being here and we'll see you next time on the distributed data show thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your
