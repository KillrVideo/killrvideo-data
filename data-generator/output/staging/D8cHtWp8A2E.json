    "text": "[Music] from datastax this is the distributed data show podcast hello everyone i am alex wolshnev developer advocate at data stocks and today we have a very special guest joshua mckenzie and we have also a very interesting topic about that wrought to a cassandra version 4. hi joshua hello yeah really glad to have you here today uh and i'm going to introduce you to our uh guests uh joshua works for data stocks at data stacks for many many years already and last year's i know you were a vp of engineering but uh could you please introduce yourself first yeah for sure um like you said josh mckenzie um i am an apache cassandra pmc member and committer and i've been at datastax for over six years which is very anomalous for me um being at a place for this long and not getting bored is a testament to the complexity of what it is we're working on um in terms of my my experience with the project and kind of my role with it um ironically enough a little bit over six years ago i started as the windows lead and i didn't know that at the time that i was pulled into the project that decision was apparently made between the time that i got the job and actually started um which is good that i happen to be pretty agnostic to those kind of things so uh that proved to be a really interesting uh experience an opportunity to kind of deep dive with some of the things going on in the windows kernel and how it intersected with cassandra but yeah over time that kind of evolved a little bit worked on cdc added a few different types to the system done some work in the commit log space and have also done quite a bit of project management and coordination on the project for the last four years now at this point uh so yeah hands on a lot of fingers and a lot of pies and kind of stay active and stay busy and really connected with a lot of people both inside and outside data stacks mostly a first tribe with the project itself okay uh could you please also explain for those who uh don't know yet what's the pmc for apache cassandra yeah the pmc on apache project is the project management committee it's essentially people that are responsible for um cultivating the community and and helping the project stay healthy stay diverse and make sure that things are moving along and that the kind of apache credo of community over code is upheld and that essentially governance is healthy on the project great and uh is it a big team i mean bmc for apache cassandra yeah well there's a there's a difference between the the body itself as a whole and the number of people that are actually active on it um so the pmc itself i think is about 33 people last time i checked but in terms of the the active individuals on there were you know probably low double digits um in terms of those of us that are that are active on the project at this time uh we we don't do anything emeritus or inactive or anything like that so pmc members from ten years ago will occasionally pop up their head and have a point of view on something and it's always it's always fun to see people come come back and re-engage but yeah it's a large body and that's one of the things about the apache process that is so um unique and and for a lot of people it's it's kind of difficult to wrap their head around is that notion of building a consensus with a large number of people it's a thing yeah there's a different set of skills a different set of perspectives and um obviously a different set of kind of political sensitivity or insensitivity sometimes to kind of have those discussions at large and come to conclusions yeah it's uh not going to be easy to collaborate with such a big team i have a family of three and you know when we discuss where to go for a vacation every time it's very painful yeah i don't know how you guys manage that yeah and you you also think about like software engineers are historically a pretty strong-willed lot so when you got a group that large of a bunch of strong-willed people uh in time but the the theory is and the belief is that the conclusions we come to are better for it yeah i can understand so josh you know then like the main question what's inside the cassandra community and cassandra users goes for years already cassandra version 4 why it takes so long what's happening inside yeah absolutely what's the point so one of the things that that we've found from talking to a lot of users in the community is that there's basically like one indicator of whether a project is moving or not and that's major releases and if you go into the jira and actually take a look at what's happening on the project we've had that same kind of cadence of contribution of stabilization of jira tickets opened and closed by count what's been going on with 4-0 is really a major push towards stabilization um is really looking to you know if you look at other database software for instance from like the relational database movement it takes decades to stabilize software this complexity and at this point in the infrastructure layer so what 4o really is is a major push towards um more robust testing more robust use case testing generative fuzz testing and really sussing out things that um you know you will you wouldn't expect to run into and you know 99 years out of 100 but with software that is as widely adopted as cassandra is and that's so ubiquitous there's going to be somebody somewhere that has those chain of events that leads to those kind of situations so looking at the scope of work in 4.0 proper we're looking at it being i think anywhere from 30 to 40 percent more work than that went into 3.0 as a major just by sheer ticket count alone and a disproportionate number of those tickets are actually bug fixes and stabilization in the system yeah that's cool i can imagine there is a really a lot of work behind that well when i was responsible for some site reliability the golden rule of everything was never use uh version 6.0 always wait for x.1 like always never never go before with anything 0.0 so i see so you guys want to have uh 4.0 absolutely reliable yeah that's that is the aspirational goal and i think that is actually a realistic goal one of the things that's happening differently with this release is massive use case testing where we're actually um you know in the community some of some of the individuals that are running some of the larger cluster counts are standing up clusters and actually replaying data through that cluster that they've captured in real time from the system itself and in ford auto there's a new tool there's a binary audit logging system called fql tool which for for the geeks among uh among us it's actually based on a chronicle cue which is i think out of the high frequency trading sector super super high speed uh q implementation that basically lets you capture data live from your cluster without negatively impacting its performance turns out you can use that to replay it on the new code base versus the old code base there's an open source cassandra diff tool that lets you dip those things so we literally have hundreds of use cases that have been tested against 40 before its release um and that's that's an entirely new motion and new muscle force that's something that came from the community participation itself which is really cool to see yep i know uh i was at the accelerate last year at the talk of renek marchella of full query logging and like i was really excited we got some uh talks about that later on and it's a really cool thing and first it's very nice to see how big companies like netflix uh invest so much time and efforts into the apache cassandra first and second that's a really cool tool for all the kind of replaying production logs and so on and so forth speaking of testing besides the full query logging what also you are using to make the system stable what are the main technologies behind well there's another thing that data stacks open sourced uh i think about a month ago called fallout which is an extension of jepson it's basically jepson as a service and for those that don't know jepson is um i don't know what kyle's last name is off the top of my head but anyway um a fear does this this testing of distributed systems and their consensus algorithms and and checks the different uh correctness and guarantees of them and fallout basically provides jepson as a service and the whole the whole notion behind this testing infrastructure is you it has three logical components one is you generate data that goes into the database um the second is you have what's called nemesis which will take machines down which will cause network partitions which will cause degradation and then the third thing you have is validators which check to make sure that the data that you think should be there is actually there and the the reality is that in these distributed systems when you have 60 70 80 600 1 000 nodes on any given day something's going to be going wrong like that's enough nodes out there that there are going to be some optimal situations on your network with your infrastructure what have you and and testing to ensure that when those things occur you're actually in a good state is a very complex thing in a distributed system go figure right like chaos monkey at scale so fallout is one of those kind of new tools and new approaches and the the fallout that we open source is actually based on kubernetes so there's been a move with a project towards having uh there's actually a kind of proliferation of kubernetes operators right now uh one from iran since the cluster has their point of view data stacks has their point of view and there's kind of a push towards unification of the operator fallout is based on kubernetes um in its open source form and the the version inside data stacks with fallout is actually based on an internal tool which kind of needed to be deprecated so there's a lot of testing that happens um and those tests need to be written on the open source project but basically there's there's that angle of generative fuzz testing which i'm a big believer in there's the angle of a massive number of use case tests also a big believer in that as well um but the the the fundamental problem that we run into in in computer science and in this case is that when you look at the combinatoric nature of some of these these systems that you're attempting to test and you matrix all the different configurations that you would need to test at what scale you run into the heat depth of the universe problem where like testing all of them would end up taking more time and more computing power than the human race has and is expected to have uh so so we kind of have to figure out like there's a one of the things you often see is in in different domains and this is related is that you will have algorithms that generate this mass proliferation of things and then a human needs to come in and actually tune and decide and add that kind of qualitative layer of judgment to what testing do we need to do and so that's that's true of of fallout and of the matrix of tests that we're running as well but anyway yeah there's a whole lot of different testing that's going on that's the tldr uh for 4.0 that we've never had before that is is really really promising and we've actually surfaced a huge number of uh kind of unknown things in the system that can happen when the stars align in just the wrong way that we've been able to fix before people have actually run into it which is huge yeah uh my favorites my favorite problem current moon phase is not supported by your operating system okay one more question uh no sql bench are we using no sql bench for testing cassandra version 4 yes fallout actually is integrated with no sql bench but no sql bench is actually kind of a bigger and this is actually an interesting question um low generation tools and what opinions they're expressing no sql bench is a broader point of view about testing nosql databases at large whereas there's a there's a ticket on the open source jira right now the work hasn't been open source quite yet um but there's a tool called harry which um alex petrov has been working on that has its own kind of low generation point of view john haddad has done a bunch of really really great work with tlp stress from the last pickle that has kind of a different point of view about load generation and and much like the kubernetes operator where there's this question of uh and scott andreas phrased this i think incredibly well like let a thousand flowers bloom like there's a lot of different points of view on load generation and all of them are valid right all of them have have different things they optimize for and the same thing may hold true for kubernetes operators as well so we're kind of trying to figure out as a project um what is the right what is the right thing do we just say here's the here's the buffet of options for load generation no sql bench being one of them or or do we feel like there is you know one tool to rule them all and oftentimes in software engineering what you find is that um in some domains there's the 80 20 where you know 80 of use cases can be solved by like the the 20 rule that you implement but a lot of the important value comes from that kind of point of view the opinion the codification of what it is you're actually trying to target and do a kind of bespoke implementation for so anyway long-winded answer to your question about nosql bench but it's actually a pretty interesting thing we've seen happening in the cassandra ecosystem in the last year or two yeah uh definitely by the way if you are curious how data starts tests for data stacks enterprise and apache cassandra we deveral team recently released two workshops for exactly for fallout and uh northcare bench so it's all now available at our channel you're going to watch this video mostly probably so like you can get much deeper into how it goes okay thanks josh it's very interesting now i want to proceed with the next one there is a really a lot of people working at the cassandra version 4 and a lot of companies whom you would mention first which people are the most important from your point of view which companies made the biggest impact to a version four yeah i would trigger me with that word important um there's there's contribution by volume and one of the things that we always struggle with is like not all lines of code are created equally not all commits are created equally um so every engineer that i ever talked to and i've managed engineers for quite some time they always rail against this whole like you can't judge a book by its cover when it comes to metrics however when there is a preponderance of evidence and things um if you look at the github insights for the cassandra project it's pretty obvious that apple has had a really huge hand in helping improve the project over the course of the last few years they've done a bunch of incredible work um they're all incredible engineers and um it's it's public knowledge that they're running a boatload of cassandra internally on their infrastructure it's very important to them strategically as a business um we've also seen some pretty cool work um by the guys that were running roxandra over over at instagram instagram yep yep and uh yeah you've got you know vinay and joey that have done a bunch of great work netflix has been pretty present in there and obviously you know data stacks has been present as well as contributors but what you see is that there's there's a lot of really really big really successful companies that have essentially you know bet some of their strategic success uh on this software as an infrastructure like a core critical infrastructural component of what they're working on one of the things that's been most enlightening to me um within actually about the last six to eight months is just finding out how how much more cassandra there is in the world than than i knew than i realized and finding out about other you know other other users other enterprises that are running 60 70 80 000 nodes of cassandra that aren't you know actually on the project itself as well so it's it's been interesting to try to reconcile these two things where you have um a lot of really big heavy-hitting players that are incredibly success successful incredibly technically skilled companies that are kind of at the forefront cutting edge of tech and seeing that um you know bringing the the power of the gods and the power of fire down to other companies and other mortals and that's kind of been the cycle of cassandra um but yeah furrow has seen much more of a community upswelling um in terms of the contribution to it and the driving of its direction than any release in the past has seen okay yes uh let's uh i've heard uh apple mostly uses uh version two i don't know if it's correct or wrong but at least that was a uh that was said like uh one or two years ago so i'm curious am i going to migrate directly to version 4 from version 2 or something is going undercover what we don't know i can't speak to any of the internals of what they're running unless they've chosen to make that stuff public um but they are as we all know they are definitely running a lot of cassandra and different versions of cassandra have different uh different trade-offs in terms of what they optimize for and one of the things that we also see is that the migration from being a thrift-based storage and for those that don't know thrift is a super super flexible um no schema but also kind of difficult to control with proliferation of things moving from a thrift-based storage engine to a cql-based storage engine and codifying that api means that for for enterprises or for users that have adopted a lot of older cassandra and built their applications on thrift there's a disincentive to moving forward because it involves rewriting to a new api and so there's you know we see that there's a lot of cassandra out in the world running across a lot of different versions um actually i think a few years ago there was a really interesting talk about i think it was an instagram with francois and his team running a proxy that was translating thrift into cql so there's it's been interesting to see how being an open source ecosystem there's a lot of different opinions that can be expressed about the apis themselves about the storage engine in the back end and kind of drive adoption in that way okay um i know what you was one of the people um making some project management support to make this release real yeah and well you know i kind of understand how these kind of work works in the regular company like regular product company doing regular job that's i believe everyone understands how it works but how it looks to work with an apache product i will not product maybe but apache foundation project and what was your personal involvement into version 4 by itself yeah well um it's been it's it's always interesting and it leans on personal relationships instead of hierarchical influence which basically means like i'm talking to john haddad every week or every other week i'm keeping in touch with didesh and i'm keeping in touch with vinay and joey and i'm talking to jay and like all of us kind of have to stay in contact to kind of know like where each other's heads are at what we're working on i'm talking to alexian benedict talking to jordan john like it essentially ends up being this giant like social network of soft power is one way to put it and jordan and john are working on project management as well but at the end of the day um nobody's telling anybody else what to do and everybody has um other priorities and other things going on in their life not to mention that you know there's there's other things going on in the world today as well that may be taking people's attention away from working on an open source project um you know global pandemic lockdown etc so essentially what it translates into is me personally trying to walk this very fine line of of helping make sure things don't slip through the cracks without being obnoxious right like i don't my goal is not to pressure anybody but just to make sure that hey you know if a katarina has a ticket that needs a reviewer and i know that joey's expressed interest in it but it's been a week and a half like is still on his radar should we grab somebody else you know if benjamin is stalling on something check with him to see whether or not like he needs any help and it really like it is an honest expression of um i kind of get to have a foot in these two different worlds where my like my mandate my priority the reason i get up in the morning the reason i exist my role at data stacks is drive adoption of apache cassandra make it the best nosql database in the world and thankfully i also have resources that i have the ability to kind of help direct uh towards that end but ultimately that is that is the goal so project management and 4-0 ends up being a lot less about dictating what people are doing and a lot more more about trying to help shape attention um in the event that you know people are multiplexing and something's falling off a radar and time and again i i have discovered that we all have so much going on that things like that do slip through the cracks so it kind of requires this consistent drumbeat of just making sure you know we all on the same page anybody need any help with anything um stuff like that so that's what that looks like and jordan and john are doing the exact same thing um we're sending out aspirational weekly but it really turns into more like bi-weekly updates about um you know here's the status of the project we've got this jira board that shows where all the tickets are we kind of have different quick filters to show hey here's tickets that nobody's moved in the last couple of weeks maybe somebody wants to take a look at that here's things that don't have an assignee um so basically just that like shaping attention and helping kind of guide people towards um you know the things that that may be of value to the project as a whole to work on yeah okay so a feature freeze for the cassandra version 4 was announced i believe in somewhere in autumn 2018 i think so and the question is like how we as a community decide and how do we build the consensus about what should go into the version four and what should wait so for example i mean this pluggable storage engine uh for roxandra instagram things uh the obviously not ready to go live and four version zero it was just not finished yet very interesting upgrade by itself but okay it was just not ready but how do we decide what what fits and what doesn't this is a super timely question um yesterday morning out to the dev list i sent out an email with a draft for um kind of codifying how we do governance as a project and this doesn't come from me right like the pmc has been talking about this and benedict uh spent a huge amount of time and energy and effort to kind of help shape this conversation um we don't really have a precedent for saying here's our muscle for doing this thing and so for 40 it was kind of a you know not really random walk but we're all like okay we've got a lot of meat in this release we want to stabilize it we've got enough features that are inside it so let's go ahead and say here's the date where we're going to draw a line in this hand and then we'll stabilize from there my my personal point of view on this and i've spoken with some other people in the project and there's there's some interest in this and sympathy towards this perspective is that we start using the cep process that's the cassandra enhancement proposals and and really have like a collection of things where we say okay for the next release we think this is its identity and here's the here's the features that we think we want to get in there um i personally and again like there's there's no single decision maker on a project like this i personally would advocate for us also having a point of view about a calendar date so if things take longer than we expect they do which they always take longer than we expect they do it's true of software engineering in general but certainly during this project um we say like you know here's our here's our cutoff date right like let's let's aspire for majors every six months or aspire from majors every 12 months or whatever it may be so have a point of view about what we think the identity of release should be right so when somebody looks for a compelling narrative for why does cassandra 40 exist why does cassandra fibo exist they have a really solid gut check feel for ah this is why this thing is here and why i should care um but also have some guardrails on that so things don't stretch too long and one of the things we found on this project and we've taken a lot of different approaches to try to figure out how to tackle this is that when releases happen infrequently there's an immense amount of pressure to try to get something in before release is cut which ends up implicitly pressuring that date to slip and yes there was there was an attempt to try to get to where we had releasable master super stabilize release much more frequently which was great for developer velocity but not necessarily great for stabilization of the code base so we're going to have to figure out how to strike this balance to to you know have be mindful and cognizant that this is complex infrastructure software that takes some time to bacon to stabilize but also have releases more frequently than you know we have been in the 4-0 era i said yeah that's interesting uh do you think it may go uh on the way like it's done with ubuntu release a release approach like we release something every six months or every year like on these cadence um define it um it it may go that way i mean i i would advocate for that i certainly can future i've talked to some people on the project and six months is not outlandish for for releasing another major in terms of the cadence with which we do it but what has to come first is the discipline around testing the discipline around quality the automation around diff testing of different user workloads um i i floated the idea of people being able to submit anonymized schemas that we then use fallout to do like generative fuzz testing against your schema and like that i think there'd be some value in people being able to say i've uploaded my schema and i've seen that it's run against the new release and i know it's fine in a mixed version cluster and in the new new update so there's there's ideas that we're banding around with how do we use kind of modern ci cd principles and disciplines to get to where it's safer for us to release infrastructure software on a faster cadence um kind of open pandora's box with you know modern application development modern infrastructure development paradigms and the cassandra architecture but that's that's a different topic than the forum topic so we can talk about that later yeah yeah definitely it's a big topic and i will be really happy to discuss some more topics later on okay so now the latest release of cassandra version 4 i mean alpha release is alpha four uh it went live like in the end of april somehow i believe so uh alpha four sounds already much better but uh still not enough sorry uh how do we how do you think when do we know we are ready to go to at least have better release yeah on the wiki we actually have a pretty well codified set of points of view on what our release release life cycle is and so that kind of said what what guarantees can a user expect or not expect from a release and in beta there's the expectation that you can basically run this thing it's going to be api stable you won't expect cql semantics to change you won't expect the public apis in the code basically change um and the the part that there's fluidity around is what is or isn't going to interfere with somebody's ability to actually test the code base like if you're a user and we say beta's ready break this thing um you know we don't want to have like a laundry list of known issues 15 miles long where every single time you find a defect you got to go check it so right now we're at a point to where where i believe five tickets away as of this morning from a beta release so we're pretty close at this point uh we've been floating in this kind of like six to twelve range off and on for uh it seems like about a month now the reality of that when you look behind the scenes is since this is the first like really community-led release we're kind of having to figure out what this muscle looks like we're having to figure out what are what are the different cutoff points for different milestones for the release and what's going to go where and what do we do with flaky tests and what do we do with x y and z so we're figuring these things out and and codifying those behaviors so subsequent releases should be a lot smoother and happen a lot more rapidly in terms of like knowing when it's going to happen um but yeah for now we're we're pretty dang close to the beta and uh i've kind of taken it upon myself to do what i'm thinking of is like a daily drum beat go through every single ticket make sure that nothing is stalling reach out to the individuals that are working on it and make sure that if anybody can help with anything or they need any external input or any kind of resource support they're getting it um but yeah that's that's kind of where things are i see okay so apache foundation that's always about the community and my question is how do you feel like working with a community being a part of a community for so many years how do you feel like community changed in these years and how does that community collaboration change within last years my personal opinion i'm going to try to be diplomatic is that the cassandra community in many ways has been insular we have not um we've not expanded out a lot and and a lot of that like you know everybody's a rational actor and this comes from all the all the right places of the right intent is that this is like crucial infrastructure software that the world runs on like this is the backbone of a lot of like core stuff that all of us interact with literally every day and so there's an immense feeling of responsibility to make sure that the bar of quality remains as high as we can possibly keep it and what that's translated into is like when i think back to me being introduced to the project you know six and a half years ago um like to test whether or not i could come into this ecosystem was like here's a ticket no one's been able to solve chew on it for a while and like that's a really high bar to figure out like if no one else can figure out how can this new guy figure it out so we've there we've long had discussions about um how do we make this a community that has a lower barrier to entry where we can identify areas in the code base where we don't consider them um like you know third rail hot button if if you touch this you can bring things down kind of territory and and figure out a different path to you know inclusivity and ramping on the ecosystem and the project itself um there's a lot of really good discussion going on with that there's diversity and inclusive inclusivity initiatives going on with the apache foundation itself this is something that in general people are realizing that if you leave things to their own implicit evolution you don't really get the outcomes you want in terms of a diversity of perspectives on your project and so this is something that i've got a lot of thoughts about i've got points of view about and and we're kind of starting these discussions as a project um and this topic came up even a couple weeks ago as well um with somebody from the board um all like all positive things everybody's open-minded about this and just trying to explore with curiosity what are the right next steps for us as a project to consider a couple of things that were that i expect us to see um relatively soon is that uh data tax has come forward and has has offered the the drivers as a donation and a contribution to the project and has offered the dsx documentation as a contribution to the project as well um both of those projects have a different set of expectations um and a different set of entry points in terms of people's ability to get involved collaborating on those things and so i think between initiatives around like identifying low-hanging fruit between initiatives that are very nascent around modularizing the code base and actually cleaning up some things and making it so you can come in and work on something without having to understand everything um and around having people be able to get involved with the driver ecosystem i think there's a lot of kind of change on the very very near horizon in terms of what that project community looks like and its diversification but that's kind of like some of the thoughts rattling around in my head on that topic yeah i see okay we are almost out of time so i have time for only one last question so you work not only with cassandra of course but with many different products and projects and so on and my last question would be like how do you think what the best things would be for the apache cassandra and apache cassandra community to borrow and to learn from in other projects but also what would other projects learn for good from apache cassandra project and the community by itself yeah so in terms of what the cassandra project can learn from other projects i've been looking to other apache projects to kind of see how how they run things how they work any things they do that the the cassandra project doesn't yet have and one of the things that stuck out to me the most is widening the kind of inclusivity of what we consider contributions outside of just code and even outside of the ecosystem of you know tooling and other software around the core of the project itself and one of the things that was most surprising to me and eye-opening and obvious in retrospect is this notion of having people that are in marketing or in sales actually dedicate and contribute their time and their expertise to the cassandra project itself and to help drive adoption help drive awareness things of that nature so that's something that you know i've i've definitely picked up and learned from some of the external projects specifically you know databricks and their relationship with spark was what kind of opened my eyes on that topic you know i'm not surprised most of the engineers use it to consider projects only from engineering point of view but we should not forget what that's not only about engineering that's about all the systems ecosystems all the things what making cassandra what it is by itself any product not only cassandra yeah absolutely and the the one big thing and maybe this is you know hubris on my part but the one big thing i think the rest of uh at least the apache ecosystem may be able to benefit from with the cassandra project is that we have a little bit of appetite to try to figure out like the minimum viable codification of what the apache way is a lot of times there's these discussions about it's really hard to understand the apache way it's really hard to understand community over code it's really hard to understand like what the pmc's role is what committer's role is and i mean if we manage to codify this in a way that makes sense that has like the guiding philosophies of like here's the bare bones of like the pmc's role and the powers in the hands of the committers and the committers are the ones that actually shape where things go and like if we can if we can get to a point to where we have um a precedent or a muscle where we can codify as a project what we do in a way that's digestible and lightweight i mean right now the governance stock is two pages right like we've really made it a point to try to keep this thing terse that could be valuable to other projects and just in general having some kind of a precedent for you know lightweight governance like these are things that could apply beyond just the apache foundation since the cncf isn't particularly prescriptive in how projects govern themselves so there may be something there that we could we could help share with others okay yes that's one of the biggest projects in the world i would say we definitely can learn something from others but also learn a lot teach a lot to ours and uh what i want to say in the very end so first of all josh thank you for being with us answering questions it was a very interesting uh communication upon all the things happening with a cassandra version for it was a long way this year it's going to be done i bet and the very last last question like like come on everyone is asking infinite when when when when when when yeah the um the non-answer that i give people it's like when you're when you're running a proprietary software team it's almost impossible to give a date and when you're working on an open source project like take that and make it two orders of magnitude worse um i i'm pretty comfortable saying like in this calendar year we will have a 4-0 and given that we are five tickets away from a beta and 36 tickets in beta away from ga um i don't think it's gonna be december 31st um i i would i would aspirationally say it sometime in the fall of this year we'll have a 40ga hit um and a lot of that is going to be up to a lot of people working really really hard and you know volunteering their time and their heartbeats and their energy to really engage with this process which is which is a huge thing which may what makes open source really different than a lot of other a lot of other you know tribes you can associate with okay so final word there is a lot of people watching us who are cassandra users what would you say to tell to them to make cassandra happen uh sooner and faster uh engage with this testing like as soon as that beta is cut or even now because like we're only five tickets away from beta it's not going to be that different than where we are now um get this thing installed kick the tires try it out test it out and if you're a software engineer and you want to start getting involved with the project absolutely come on like hop on jira ask hop on to the the asf slack for the cassandra dev channel ask how you can help out there's a bunch of people that are super excited and interested in like onboarding and mentoring new people onto the project um there has never been a better time to get involved with things and so that's what i would say is if you want to see the release sooner get involved and let's get here sooner together and even if you are maybe not ready right now to engage into their development you always can find a warm place in the field of documentation i bet absolutely yes absolutely thank you so that was judge mckenzie and alex volchniv from data stocks and see you next time thanks a lot thanks for listening to the distributed data show please subscribe with your favorite podcast app give us",
