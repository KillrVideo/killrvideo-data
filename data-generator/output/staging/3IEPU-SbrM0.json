  "title": "Distributed Data Show Episode 56: Multi-Cloud: The What & Why",
  "description": "Today we’re tackling what confusion my exist around the various *-clouds. We have multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud, private-cloud, and so many more. After we narrow down the multi-cloud description to it’s key points the conversation begins around why we’d want something multi-cloud to begin with! It’s the beginning of a series of conversations we’re going to have around the multi-cloud space and all of the complexities, advantages, lock-in, and related topics around this new foray into distributed systems technology.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud. DataStax Enterprise 6 (DSE 6) includes industry-leading performance, self-driving operational simplicity, and robust analytics.\n\nLearn more at http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise and https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-6\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastax?sub_confirmation=1 \nSite: http://datastax.com \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/datastax \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastax | https://twitter.com/datastax-academy\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/datastax\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/datastax \nhttps://github.com/datastax \n\nABOUT DATASTAX ACADEMY\nOn the DataStax Academy YouTube channel, you can find tutorials, webinars and much more to help you learn and stay updated with the latest information on DataStax Enterprise©.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems yeah and also kind of the we're gonna try to diffuse some of the confusion around it because multi-cloud can routinely get mixed in with hybrid cloud or like maybe what's private cloud is that a thing even a more like what are what are all these things that are appended to cloud right so multi cloud per the definitions that we've been discussing and have found out on the interwebs is basically two public cloud providers being used at the same time to provide a service or whatever you're doing with those two cloud providers whereas hybrid cloud is a cloud provider could be public or private one it gets a little fuzzy mm-hmm attached to some on-premises definitely like private cloud something right so it's it's kind of those are the the key differences but then it gets a little fuzzy even in that sense right right because it so for one it sounds like hybrid cloud definitely has that dimension of an on-prem mm-hm so we know that for sure but it sounds like even we could have a hybrid cloud multi-cloud situation there's no reason for not yeah it sounds like it gets a little bit fuzzy yeah you could have AWS GCP Azure your data center your computer under your desk who knows you know it starts to span out but there's definitely like that polymorphic encapsulated reverse encapsulated situation with those those two definitions but as far as what we're talking about and going to be talking about for a few episodes is multi cloud as in running a service database etc across to public providers like Azure and AWS for instance so hopefully that kind of clears up a little bit of what we're gonna be talking about over the next couple of episodes but so we know what like kind of the what now what is multi cloud but really why what what do we get with multi cloud it's very good question and the obvious reason is that it's the cool thing to do right it does sound cool yeah it's very cloudy yeah so aside from that silliness the first thing is it gives you the best of all worlds right I mean if AWS is leading in one technology and azure has some new services around something else and then kubernetes does something with GCP and you want to use all those capabilities if you go multi-cloud you you've got all of it right right right exactly right so best of all world that totally makes sense but there must be other elements to it as well right swegen Ron maybe like protection protecting against you know lock in cost which kind of even loops back around to what I just said even though you have the best of both worlds one of the advantages is to maybe not use all the bleeding edge stuff but to make your system's able to be moved among those clouds so like if you have AWS stuff running and GCP stuff and then for some reason you need to offload some from AWS and over to asher for like let's say some leverage right for pricing concerns or something like that you have that option then if you're set up to run in a multi cloud environment right you're not really putting your a I mean honestly your eggs all in one basket you're really you're really protecting yourself against any kind of arbitrary inflated cost on one provider things like that yeah what about do you think there's any kind of like maybe legal implications or maybe what would you call it around that area I don't know lawyers seem to make everything real simple yeah so there's a lot of legal ramifications especially with gdpr coming out just recently and other privacy concerns like one of the big privacy concerns for a while there was I believe Germany and EU had some very strict privacy controls around IP and analytics data being stored and even if you did have permission to store certain data it had to physically be located in country so if you need to store something in country like say maybe South Korea or Germany or over in Sweden you want to have a data center location that's in that location that you need so if one provider doesn't have a location there but has it somewhere else you need it but then all of a sudden this other provider has one in say like Frankfurt boom you need to go multi-cloud to have that dual option between the two data centers so I think that kind of stems in perfectly to the other thing that we were discussing which is really the kind of a typical architecture that we're kind of seeing a round multi-cloud are we really are they is that kind of well typical we're not typical right like one of the right yeah I mean from my from my point of view I'm like well what what are people trying to do what what are companies needing to do that is multi cloud we see some companies starting to do this and in some situations the architecture is pretty straightforward it's like I have my copy I have my copy B and that's in this cloud and this is in that cloud boom and and they move forward with that but then some get a little bit more advanced or have more complex concerns like maybe one company will use AWS lambdas in one location and another company will come in and say well we need to have location or proximity to that but then our stuff is over in Azure so all of a sudden they're multi cloud and really they're just using multiple services between the two cloud providers that are not particularly just copies of each other but different actual services best of both worlds right yeah get the best of both worlds there right so really it's still very new and kind of fledgling endeavor to get into this multi cloud space and there isn't a just standard architecture that we see we see people doing some things that are starting to be a trend but overall it's still a lot of very disparate types of implement patient's we see yeah it's gonna start to be interesting to see actually what customers and people are actually doing in this space with their architecture I can imagine it it's gonna get crazy yeah it's gonna span this for sure yeah so there's much more to talk about here for sure so we're gonna have a couple more episodes around multi-cloud yep so today we talked about the what and the why and we talked a little bit about how we kind of imagine people will do this architecture but we're gonna spend the next couple episodes really diving deep into these areas and stake management all sorts of stuff yeah so we're gonna be given our opinions on a few of them yeah exactly at least two or three so be ready so until next time yep I'm Adrian and I'm Amanda Cheers bye thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we
