  "description": "In this course, you will learn how to effectively and efficiently solve search problems with Apache Cassandra™, DataStax Enterprise, and Apache Solr™, the open-source engine behind DataStax Enterprise's search capabilities. Course topics include an introduction DataStax Enterprise Search, Apache Solr™ functional use cases, search fundamentals, query vs. search, schema, and more.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 5\nDataStax Enterprise 5.0, the database platform for cloud applications, includes Apache Cassandra 3.x with materialized views, tiered storage and advanced replication. Introduced in 5.0 is DataStax Enterprise Graph, the first graph database fast enough to power customer-facing applications, scale to massive datasets and integrate advanced tools to power deep analytical queries.\n\nLearn more at http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise and https://academy.datastax.com/resources/whats-new-datastax-enterprise-50\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastax?sub_confirmation=1 \nSite: http://datastax.com \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/datastax \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastax \nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/datastax\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/datastax \nhttps://github.com/datastax \n\nABOUT DATASTAX ACADEMY\nOn the DataStax Academy YouTube channel, you can find tutorials, webinars and much more to help you learn and stay updated with the latest information on DataStax Enterprise©.

    "text": "[Music] hi I'm Timberland and this is an introduction to data stacks Enterprise Search Search is a key component of data stacks Enterprise Cassandra is of course at the core of data stacks Enterprise and a number of other features are integrated along with it these are things that commonly show up in enterprise use cases and deployments of a database like DSC search is one of those things this course focuses on that feature there's a lot of material to cover in this course and I want to give you an idea of what some of those objectives are we're going to understand the architecture of data stacks Enterprise Search it's based on common open source components but as they are integrated with Apache Cassandra we have to answer some questions about how that integration works and how it gets its work done it's important for you to understand that architecture so you can think about how the product operates and how to develop applications against it and of course we'll follow that up with some basic search queries we'll get an idea what the query language looks like and as always get our hands dirty on the keyboard actually using the product a little bit there are some operational considerations that we'll cover we'll talk about how to manage solar cores and to memory settings and things like that we're going to cover some of those topics as we move forward schema intersects with search in some important ways and we'll look at how that works we'll get as more advanced topics like the analysis chain and filters and as always we look at some common use cases ways that people actually put this thing into use in the real world now coming into this course I hope you have a basic familiarity with Cassandra we're going to assume that you do we're going to be talking about the ways search integrates with data that's in Cassandra without explaining a lot of Cassandra basics so you want to look at some of the other material and data stacks Academy that will introduce you to Cassandra if that's an introduction you need but if you're familiar with it you'll know that there are some things that it does very very well and then some things that are a little bit cumbersome for example text search that's not really a Cassandra feature and that is what the search product is all about it gives you distributed multi data center full text search across data stored in Cassandra tables that data is because in Cassandra always on and available data stacks enterprise search uses two other Apache projects of course Cassandra itself is properly Pachi Cassandra also a top-level Apache project and search brings in solar and leucine to the picture as well solar is by itself an open-source enterprise search platform that gives you an HTTP interface to an underlying full-text search engine it works very well very widely deployed and its story for running as a distributed system is not necessarily so clean so the data stacks integration with Cassandra ends up being a really good idea Lusine is the underlying search engine that powers solar it's fundamentally an indexing system that allow you to index text in interesting ways and of course other kinds of data as well and perform high-speed searches on that unstructured data this course like all of the courses you'll see on data stacks Academy uses the killer video domain killer video is a fictional video hosting website and we like to use it to build our examples using films and so you'll see a lot of film based examples in this course and you'll notice there are a few things there there's the title of the movie there's the description there's the release date there's a rating this is sort of movie metadata that might be in a website like killer video we're going to use things like this in our examples in fact if you take a look at this table here this is the Chabad code diagram or our standard way of diagramming a cassandra table of a table of movie data and so if you look at the fields in this table this is the kind of stuff that we're going to want to look at using search and build our examples around there'll be some other tables we come up with as we move through the course but this is really the foundation of the movie data model that we'll be playing with and we've got a lot of search material to cover so let's get into it you [Music]",
