    "text": "based on sort of how loud the Applause are how many people want to see me build an AI application in under 20 minutes yeah all right good I I created as few slides as possible um but I did create I did create a couple uh so my name is Carter rasa uh my pronouns are Heim and I have the distinct pleasure of serving the developer relations team here at data stacks and wo and I uh I consider myself to be a gen nerd um but it's funny you know uh you know Chad asked Harrison like you know you've been doing this a long time and he was super like taking back he's like what are you talking about man this stuff's brand new uh and that's how I feel about it you know I've been building full stack web applications for you know a long time like let's say maybe 20 years uh and I didn't write one line of AI code until about six to seven months ago when I joined data stacks and prior to that you know chat jpt had been out for a while and open a I had been out for a while but it hadn't really permeated my community or where I lived and I just kind of felt like you know what that is the domain of machine learning Engineers data scientists super brainy people it's not something that someone like me can do uh and I'm hoping the next 19 minutes uh that you all uh that you all feel differently and I I want to show you what's possible uh and I'm going to use Netflix as an example uh so uh so Netflix it is a it is one of the most popular pieces of software in the world it's used by hundreds of millions of people It Is by every definition an a piece of A+ software the Netflix engineering team is considered one of the finest engineering teams in the world they have no trouble hiring um they're amazing I want you to imagine that after tonight this amazing event um maybe some of you are going to the a uh AI Engineers World Fair coming up this week uh so you've had a busy week and you go back to wherever you live on Friday uh you curl up on the couch and you want to watch a movie by yourself or perhaps with a loved one and you know exactly what you want to watch you know you want to watch a movie with uh a strong uh female lead and oh shucks that is not what you wanted uh and look some of you in the audience are probably saying like that's completely unfair just you know get rid of some of the words use keywords whatever um sure I mean that would be fine uh if we lived in a world uh that didn't have chat GPT right I mean Harrison and Brian just told you like and by the way they're not alone right hundreds of millions of people also use chat GPT um chat GPT has changed how people think software is supposed to work uh and that is why you know products like Netflix have to evolve so then the question is okay fine um what does that have to do with me right you know if you're a web developer if you're building a startup if you're building an application uh you know great Carter's telling me that I have to build intelligence software like what you know how right how am I supposed to do this and uh Al you know we have a fantastic technique called rag um but you know retrieval augmented generation is a technique that makes this kind of intelligence available to all kinds of developers um no matter their skill level and I want to prove this to you by taking something like this so this is a website called the movie.org uh think of it as IMDb but not owned by Amazon and we're going to take information from this website and we're going to build uh smarter Netflix uh and we're going to do it right here uh live in front of you so here's Visual Studio code uh this is a python script I'm going to go ahead and just start running it and we're going to talk about what it is doing uh so you can see this script running uh and you can see movies starting to get ingested so what have what have I done um well there are two things I'll call out one I'm uh importing the data API client uh for astrab so asrb is data stacks's vector and nosql database so I'm getting a client that I can use to store information and I'm also using unstructured so unstructured has a uh cap capability of uh scraping websites and uh helping to take that unstructured data and make it meaningful so I want to walk through this very quickly line by line I have a Json file that has all the movies that I care about pre-loaded I'm going to go ahead and create a client to my database I'm going to specify a specific collection called movies and we're going to iterate through all of those movies for everyone we're going to use unstructured to fetch that web page and this is pretty brilliant unstructured understands the parts of the web page that are maybe garbage um but it also understands what parts are considered to be narrative text so that's what I want right I want everything on the web page that unstructured considers to be part of the narrative for that web page once I have that content I'm going to go down here and I'm going to issue an upsert to my database right so if the if if the docu if a document with that ID isn't there great create it if it is there update it and I'm gonna pass along both structured data like title and the path to the poster image and this unstructured data so let's uh let's go ahead I'm going to go ahead and kill the script here we go so let's go ahead and switch over to the database to see what this looks like so this is astb uh let me make it a little bigger great and all of my database are listed on the left uh I have uh every database has one or more collections so I've got a collection called movies and here is all of the data that I've pulled into my database using unstructured and you here you can see the structured data like title poster path and this unstructured data but there's another thing uh that's kind of interesting I think so uh there's a vector column you might be asking yourself how did that happen because if you go back to the python code uh I am not importing openai I'm not doing anything here to compute that Vector embedding so how did it get into my database it got into my database because uh data stxs has shipped a feature called vectorize so when I created this collection I was able to configure a specific uh embedding provider in this case open AI but we have launched support for many more of them and I'm also able to specify a specific embedding model in this case text embedding three large so every time I insert or update into my collection it is automatically Computing a vector for that information and storing it in this Vector column so awesome so we have uh we've completed uh 50% of the rag Journey we've ingested the data into the database but now we want to build an application because I promised you I was going to write code and we're going to build something so how do we do that well uh Ed earlier uh mentioned that we launched langlow 1.0 so I want to show you all what Lang flow looks like so this is completely open source it's running on my laptop it is going to spawn an editor that you can use to build AI applications I'm going to go ahead and make this a little bigger and I'm going to start from scratch I'm going to create a new project uh you can have you can start with a blank slate or you can uh use a template I'm going to use a template for the sake of time uh if I zoom out don't worry about being able to read anything uh the components on the bottom represent the uh an ingestion phase I'm going to ignore that because we've already ingested the data now we want to build the app right so let me go ahead and zoom in and I'm going to talk through every single one of these components one thing I want to mention immediately is that as beautiful as this UI might look uh behind the scenes it is it is for developers and behind the scenes it is all code it is all python code you have the full power of the Python ecosystem you can edit this code click save and you're good to go um so the UI is uh very convenient very nice to look at um but this is for developers and you always have access to the code uh this chat input is going to take uh you it represents like the search box right for this smarter Netflix whatever the user types into the search box we're going to run it through the open AI embedding model right and here uh it's pre pre faulted to three small I have to change that to three large because whatever embedding model you're using when you're ingesting you have to use the same one when you do Vector search so you know no big deal uh I'm going to go ahead and configure it with my open AI API key langlow has the ability to store Global variables so it's just really fast and easy easy uh to store those and use them as you're building your apps uh here is the vector search uh component I'm going to go ahead and change the collection name to movies uh I'm going to configure my application token my API endpoint uh I'm going to customize there are Advanced options uh and I'm going to instead of returning just four documents I'm going to return 10 I want 10 documents to come back and great and that's going to that's going to go do the vector search I'll show you what that looks like in one minute all of those results are going to come back to this parse data component it's just taking this list of 10 things and smashing them into one big text string uh and here uh this is where uh we start constructing the prompt that we're going to send to the llm uh for the most part this is fine um I'm going to go ahead and edit it just a little bit uh given the context above um let's see return a list of movie titles in markdown markdown format uh that match this query ahead and do this uh okay so now we've done some prompt engineering right uh finally we're going to send the prompt to uh open AI I'm actually going to go ahead and just use the 3.5 turbo I'm cheap uh and frankly rag is so great that you don't need to use the smartest llm uh and I'm going to go ahead and configure my API key uh and we are done and now we're going to send uh what comes back from the llm to the chat output so langlow has a built-in playground um because once again this is like an IDE we want to make it super easy for you to test your AI flows and as you kind of heard up here in some of the questions from the audience like oh you know like how do I test the performance how do I see that it's working like this is a really great environment to do um iterative uh AI application building so let's go ahead and repeat what we did before right uh strong female lead and it's going to think and it's going to come back with a list of uh movies that match this query based on Vector search so there we go uh Wonder Woman uh Kate red Sparrow this is exactly what I was expecting exactly what I wanted awesome so imagine that you're happy you're like this is perfect I've I've I fiddled with the temperature I fiddled with the model like this is exactly what I want the problem is this is my IDE how do you turn this into software that people can use so with langlow you have tons of options for getting this out of Lang flow and into your software what I'm going to do is I'm going to rely on Low's ability to operate simultaneously as an API server so let's go ahead and copy so this is running on my laptop um I'm going to go ahead and copy this URL and I'm going to switch over to my full stack JavaScript nextjs application uh and bigger great and I'm going to paste that langlow URL in here I'm going to save it and I'm going to to run it uh awesome so uh for those of you who aren't familiar nextjs is a full stack JavaScript framework um langlow is entirely python but because I'm running it as a web as an API server you can build these applications using any language any stack that you like uh and let's go ahead and spawn my app all right awesome so now we've gone from that langlow UI to something quite beautiful um we've called this movies Plus+ uh and let's go ahead and rerun this query right strong female lead so we're asking Leno we're making the API call and if everything goes according to plan awesome it comes back with exactly that same information yes yeah this deserv a round of applause all right so uh but look uh it's it's it's it's easy to debug things when you're in your IDE what happens when you ship this to production and like maybe it's not behaving right or you get you get a report from your users like hey I'm getting really weird results well as Harrison helpfully mentioned there's something this awesome tool called Langs Smith and uh you can use Langs Smith with langlow as easily as setting a single API key environment variable and as you can see right here what time 6:14 right like one minute ago uh all of that interaction to the llm I can make this bigger too because it's awesome all of that interaction was sent to Langs Smith for our observability needs right I can click into all of this I can see the chat input was uh strong female lead all the way to the chat output was this list of movies right so with a S and it's and as a developer I didn't have to do anything I set an API key in in my environment variable of course I created a lsmith account it all just worked it's totally amazing uh so now one thing I wanted to mention though uh one thing you might be saying is like look man cool toy but like you showed us Netflix and you gave us as a chatbot right uh and I know you know Harrison specifically mentioned one thing that he's really interested about is what kind of user interactions do we really want to build for people right um and uh one of the things uh that is uh possible now increasingly possible uh using more and more tools that are coming out is something called generative UI and I want to show you uh what generative UI can look like so I'm going to go ahead and say show me these as you I and boom boom this is this is this is not just like some static stuff this is a fully interactive hoverable UI you can click on any one of these things uh you have the full power of the web platform or whatever mobile platform you're on to build these things right um and uh in this in this case it's powered by the versel AI SDK um but once again more and more tools are coming out that are making this kind of programming possible um and honestly uh once you see something like this you can never ever unsee it uh and your mind just starts to go to like what else could I do like could I say something like show me the trailer for Wonder Woman I don't know let's see holy crap about I had no father I was brought to life by Zeus oh I wish the audio was louder but that's okay right the gods made the Amazon to restore peace to the world and it's what I'm going awesome so uh all right so uh I hope that that makes all of you yeah good movie right no sincerely right like look you can poke holes and all that stuff right um you know me and some of the members of the data STX Deval team put this app together like pretty fast right everything I showed you is like no more than like uh 200 complete lines of code so imagine what's possible when you're building real applications uh you know in in sort of like with with real resources right like if I if I can build this in 200 lines of code imagine what you can do in 2000 thank you very much",
