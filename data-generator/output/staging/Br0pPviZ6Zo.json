    "text": "come on up uh and can we please give uh a very uh warm welcome to Lou and Minnie oops I think this just fellen don't worry one USBC connection Away From Success okay fantastic take it away thank you hi everybody we are very excited to be here it's an insane venue and I'm Minnie this is Lou we work at te draw at vinsy Park and today we're going to be teaching you how we taught models to play t draw I'm going to give you a quick teaser of what's to come but the main demo is in the latter half of the talk and then Lou is going to explain to you what we do at tail draw some of the previous projects we've done and what led to te draw teach great and I will do that if my mic stops pinging off but I'm we're just going to go with it we're going to go with it we're we're just going to do this live if I have to hold this I will um yeah so what what what you're seeing right here is we so we made our own like intro slide but we also asked the the this model to create an intro slide as well and it's done a pretty good job it's done a pretty good job you know can can you see you you guys yeah um by the way is is the mic okay are you is it here all right okay let's go uh so yeah um we're from te drawer te drawer if you don't know it's a it's a whiteboard Library it's a canvas Library so if you want to make like canvas-like experiences like this one so we're like this experience we're get we we're within right now um is built using the teal draw Library um as you can see we've added lots of things like like arrows we spent a really long time on the arrows getting it's it's probably yes yeah thank you thank arrows fans right we we we spent a lot of time making like the RO are you seeing that do you see that making the rotation like really nice right like and and it has this this digital ink oh actually I'm going to go into the inky Inky mode we we spent a long time making it really like nicely spudgy right any splodge fans okay and and there's there all these like little extra details like if I resize This Heart can you see how the can you see how the dashes like stay at the tips of the heart do you see that anyway so we could do a whole talk on this just some some more context um so like the teal draw is it's all web based right so everything you're seeing on the canvas is just built with web Technologies and it all interacts with it like like every other shap I'm just going to pause that right and so like I can even prove it to you I could just like open up this and sort of like look this is all these are all this is just HTML uh so if you can code for the web you can code for Te essentially that's that's just some important uh foreshadowing background okay so back in the 14th of March this is more foreshadowing on the in the 14th of March 2023 open AI introduced their first like Vision models right and they showed this particular demo they had this drawing of of of a website they drew like on a piece of paper gave it to the image model and it and it turned into like a functional website and so of course what we what we spent a lot of time doing and the community tried with te draw is like could we do this with te draw so we just have this like little drawing of of a little UI and and you can select it all and hit this make real button it's probably too small to see so you can just trust me it says make real in the top right and we sent this off to open Ai and anthropic and they're both competing on making this this real website so look I can I can type stuff in here stages it works okay and this is they've both done it pretty well but like the funny thing is um what if I change my mind right what if I change my mind it's not the end right happens a lot so you see this button here right what if I want to like move it over here and the fact that this is all like built on web Technologies means that you can sort of draw on top and I don't know if this is going to work I don't know if this is going to do you think it there's no way that works right like we we might have to do a couple goes on okay interesting like so so it's done a pretty good job it's done a pretty good job okay uh but that's that's not good enough I'm going to try something else let's try and turn this what if I just try and make this green I've just sort of colored it in green a bit and make real right let's see let's see I'll hit it a couple times just just to give it a few attempts you know tokens are cheap right that's green that's green that's green okay so anyway this is this is old news we're not here to show you this is not what we're showing you today so like this is boring right so we we experimented with a whole bunch of other AI experiments like this is one called Draw fast where you can like generate uh models in real time like the the funny thing is when you have this like interaction this canvas primitive you can actually interact do you do you see what's going on here I don't even need to talk you can just you can just have a look we're interacting with an image in real time this is uh that because it's just all web- based you can put anything on the canvas you can put a webcam feed this is what tus was losing his godamn mind over this morning right like I'm going to post up the clips later um and you and you can draw on top of this and everything however there there's a big problem right there's a big problem so so far what I've showed you um is we have our our canvas contents we send it to the AI and it gives us something back it gives us an artifact and that's the end end of story what if that thing that AI gives back to us is not a website it's not an image but it's like more canvas what if the AI could play te draw right so that's what we've been trying to uh work work on however llm llms are really bad at canvas they they suck at it if you just out of the box um so like lots of different teams are doing a great job at trying to improve this right so uh this is what fig Jam does right so uh fig jam it they use templates and I met some of the people who made this they have a huge list of templates that the AI model populates with generated content which is it works really well but it's it's slightly more limited so we've been doing these experiments where we basically give the AI the same tools that a human uses right letting it letting it use the the draw tool and things like that this is a really early experiment and what we found is it's pretty good but like we weren't entirely sure which route to go right here's here's another experiment uh from from the labs right they drawing this little person um the AI the AI is in charge here but like the results were mixed right so um here's another I think this was actually a more recent example uh we've done loads of these different experiments this is again using a completely sort of different a different approach um here here's another one you may have seen this is one of the uh one of the latest experiments I think uh this was autocomplete this was sort of flipping the question around What If instead of asking the model to do things on the canvas we could ask it to just like carry on and I'm now really really happy to show you uh like our current experiment which is still very much a work in progress but it's uh the best that I think anyone has ever seen AIS do on the canvas uh and we call it teach right we call it teach because we're still teaching it I'm just going to I'm just gonna just do a oh is my okay there teach right and I'm super excited that Minnie is going to show you um some things that teach can do right now okay and I'm excited to show you so that was a pretty good recap but essentially this is what we're doing affecting the canvas and I'm going to show you straight away what it does we create a little frame here and then we can say draw a snowman spelled that wrong what we've also found is that if you have good grammar put a full stop at the end start with a capital it usually does it a little better so we're going to see what it does here but what we're going to see is yeah we're using everything that you could use if you went onto t.com and started playing around with the canvas yourself this is you know we have circles they're colored in a couple of lines triangles and what we can also do that is really really cool is then modify this canvas everything that we can see see on our screen right now is what the AI can see see we can say make it melt that works right it's probably not going to work let see but it might no oh no oh and he's duplicated oh he's he's melted tiny snowman um and that's really cool but we can do a ton of other things too and we've pre-loaded a bunch of prompts here um but you can get as wacky as you want I think we probably spent I like so much of my job over the past few months has just been playing with this um so I guess like by the way check out the te dra Twitter feed and and stuff to see this s everything's there wow that's ridiculous that's ridiculous yeah this is my favorite one but and this one's labeled so you never really know exactly what it's going to do but you will always be delighted um and you can do more practical things too it's not just drawings it's not just colors we can make a sample flowchart for preparing a talk kind of like we were doing yesterday and hopefully what we'll get is a bunch of shapes with text inside of them and arrows binding them to each other impressive Lou lost their mic it's just me now um and when we see this we think cool this is a chart but it's not really what I want it to look like but surely I can't move things around or can I um so we can do that we can also make a retro board we spend a lot of time on our retro boards and we T dra also has really awesome little sticky notes that have a bunch of little cool features for editing them uh and you can move those around get your whole team to come in and play multiplayer not on teach but on our regular taal draw.com and these you can also move around you can also edit them and you can also if you remember make real the little video demo from earlier where we turned no way let me show you we started with the little sketch and then clicked make real turned it into this I should have loaded this but this is going to turn it into a simple wireframe there's not a really awesome use case for this that I can think of right now but it is cool and if you haven't seen by now that's kind of the point of this talk no are you seeing that it's done it backwards that's crazy that's Twitter or x no we'll stick with Twitter but um this one gets a little more complicated we're asking to create a table for tracking the quantity of cakes sold and what this will usually give us is the cakes the quantity and sometimes the price we're going to see what it does here date that that's fine we can say get rid of the dates but I don't know you think it'll happen I think it's this is the Moment of Truth wow it's it's not over yet we can turn this into a bar chart with the right circumstances if the demo gods are with us today thank you and I even got the strawberry in the right color which is really amazing so oh there's more there's more there's so many things I'm going to I'm going to get through this if you want to search the web put your queries in some little Cur brackets you can do a bunch of fun things this one on the top right if it does it correctly that's my favorite but if it doesn't I might just carry on um yeah this is the Paris Olympic shooter meme it says coolest shooter at the Olympics no special gear no problem um while our team was creating teach they kind of Lent into what they called an AI driven format where they looked at what the AI language models tended to do and tended to create more often than other things and also combined their technical knowledge ideas all of that and let that guide the process if you want to know more about that you can come to us afterwards I'm going skip this one but there's a lot of things that this can do we call that mode easy and it brings us to the end of our talk where we want to talk about Trends I'm going to skip all of that back in the day or I should say when a new piece of technology comes onto the market the tendency is for developers to default to using text back in the day this was the computer you had a keyboard you a type that was all well and good but then Along Came the computer mouse and that allowed people to have a lot more flexibility a lot more freedom to move around the devices do whatever they liked but not long after that I think I'm going to stress out if I try and go too fast we created that's a nice Mouse that's a good Mouse we have trackpads we have a trackpad here and while that loads I'm going to say this also happened with phones first we had the Nokia phone you could type on the Little Numbers if you tap three times you could get a c it took a long time I can't imagine using that today but we we got blackberries after that and we could type real quiry keyboard messages then you know we have the iPhone best thing ever or not Lou doesn't use an iPhone so sorry smartphones this is a real Blackberry but you get what we're [Laughter] saying and now we can use our hands I can you know use hapy things shake it to undo swipe around but what would be really cool because with AI now what we're seeing is that people are using chat again we're seeing the trend of text being used when there's new technology and that's how we interact with it but AI doesn't have to just be chat and that's not to say I don't love it I pay for Claude I use it every single day but what if we could do more and that's what we wanted to tell you about today I hope we showed it to you well and if you want to try it yourself go to teach. teal draw.com or follow us on Twitter to talk more [Applause] wow that was absolutely amazing a tour to force",
