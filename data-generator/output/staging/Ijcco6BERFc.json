  "title": "Distributed Data Show Episode 86: Awkward-Free Spark Development with Holden Karau",
  "description": "Patrick talks with Holden Karau, Developer Advocate at Google, about ways to incorporate Spark in your application without impacting performance or having to learn Scala.\n\nJoin us at DataStax Accelerate learn how Apache Cassandra and DataStax can help you succeed to building large scale applications. For tickets go to datastax.com/accelerate and use discount code ADVOCATE20. \n\nHighlights: \n0:00 - The awkwardness of using an analytic framework like Spark in your application\n0:40 - That to do when you have analytic requirements in your application - stream data to Spark, run jobs, write data back to your data store where it can be consumed realtime. What not to do: query Spark on the critical path\n3:53 - A great example: using Spark to perform rollups of IoT data in the background and writing back into Cassandra. This allows you to access both summary and current data at realtime.\n5:12 - How a whiteboard would come in handy on future episodes, and how to hack your boss :)\n6:27 - Spark Streaming is one of a number of streaming solutions available, it's continuing to evolve in Spark 3\n8:25 - 5G wireless is low latency, high throughput which is only going to increase the quantity for streaming data\n9:30 - Running streaming Fortran in the cloud - is this a good idea?\n10:30 - Wrapping up\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud. DataStax Enterprise 6 (DSE 6) includes industry-leading performance, self-driving operational simplicity, and robust analytics.\n\nLearn more at http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise and https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-6\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastax?sub_confirmation=1 \nSite: http://datastax.com \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/datastax \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastax | https://twitter.com/datastax-academy\nLinkedin: https://w",

    "text": "try to ask you a question and I hope you get a straight answer give me a straight answer which is I want to talk about spark in the application space I know this is like square peg round hole can we do this from dates and this is the distributed data show so I'm gonna park in the application space is a little different and that's okay right yeah there's a lot of different places where spark can fit I think the best place is off of the end of the queue really for the yeah like this cough good is spinning yeah data yeah right like for the most part I really don't want your application to block on spark right because when it does you care a lot more and that makes my job a lot harder all right so here let me throw out a couple cards okay so obviously with Cassandra we we talk about it as an application database yeah but it doesn't do the analytics totally doesn't do it does not do it don't even try I know you want to try don't do it all right allow filtering is not analytics so little insight of cql joke there but there are plenty of cases where those analytics requirements are writing the applications totally but they may not be something that I need it calculate at that time right yeah so if you if you have a situation where you've got like a no sequel store you mean I'm analytics but you don't need them necessarily to be immediately live computed every time I pass totally streaming the spark having it do the aggregates right the results out into something like Cassandra which is designed for real-time access right like it is totally reasonable to use spark in a screaming system like this to produce results that you are going to consume real times from something else like the pattern that I've seen that I really just don't want people to do is the case where they have their application at queries spark over the JDBC driver live backed by a terabyte of data and like spinning beach ball but I mean this I mean yeah they're a spinning beach ball everyone kind of waits they're like I myself I've waited five minutes for a cluster that did not exist right there's your problem yeah but like and and it's just it's okay to do that some of the time right like it is it is okay if you've been charged it you're okay with the latencies that's okay and also like one of the one of the cases where I see it where it's like totally legit as well is like you're using spark and local mode to like sort of give you a unified view of your data like sure probably don't need the JVM to do that but it's okay right it's not gonna kill you I don't seen some people do spark jobs like on a casino table yeah that wasn't very large like they were doing like a join yeah sure yeah it may take a second or two and maybe that's okay in that application context totally yeah like if you're you just need to not assume that your latency is gonna be fine just because it worked in depth right like NotI tessellate no no no if your pager is gonna go off you don't want spark in the hot path yeah that's true um but if you can put it on the end of a queue right like if it's data coming in from IOT getting fed into Cassandra also if its data in Cassandra you're aggregating that's consumed from an analytics table awesome I've seen some really cool stuff here where people do like this rolling update playing background totally so look like IOT data like oh my classic weather data you know you get all this high resolution data coming in and you have a smart drug running in the background continuously this just rolling up rolling up rolling up and it's dumping all that data into another cassandra table yeah and you know it for the end-user it looks like wow I'm getting all this live really quick millisecond data when really all the hard work is being done back here yes and if you have like a I think it's Kappa architecture whatever I don't know naming them not lambda it's Kappa Sigma it's yeah we're not make a move I don't know but like if you if you have a function which nicely represents the aggregation is the application of new data on top of pre aggregated data it's a totally great pattern you can have spark doing the aggregations in real time aka hundred milliseconds latency putting in there yeah human real-time and if you need it real real-time right you consume that aggregated data and you also grab the latest records to from wherever your buffer is at the same time and you just apply those to an actual real-time right if that's what you actually need I feel like we need a whiteboard screen that like showings down because we could be drawing some stuff here real fast we could okay dr. producers about the right now so maybe some day I know there is wine downstairs we'll go down and get wine and come up and talk about their crazy obligation architectures with the magic spark I feel like if we if we had enough wine we could just draw it here yeah wouldn't help anyone but you know and I would know it was going ready I would probably not get a lot of people out diving but I feel good about it yeah I'm really and you should too yeah you want you want Patrick to be happy yeah most of my team's yeah we've already covered it but anyone but when you're happy you pay them more right that's right yeah yeah so they should definitely make you happy occasion like some but it's also important to lower your expectations is that like a human SLA and so it's like we want you to be happy and why don't you throw on us time but if you're sad the rest of the year and then I give you good news at Bonus Time cash money so we went from spark and applications to hacking your boss I mean aren't those the same thing I think these are these are all very important Muppets yeah yeah human factors human factor important all right so moving on to a large pattern which is not acting your boss sparks dreaming I yeah so how is it in the world streaming's like processing it's like huh busting out of the seats yeah no it's true um everyone has a new streaming engine and spark has one too yeah wasn't always there but yeah so I mean spark has had many different screaming engines yeah the latest one is for people who don't really care too much about specific records right and I think this is a really good case where I think it applies is machine learning right um where it's like yeah I'm getting a terabyte of data per day if I lose point zero one percent I don't really I can't swear on this one right oh you already have that we have good beeping okay I don't really give a and so it's it's okay okay yeah so everyone won't know what is that right it's real subtle thanks out so streaming machine learning oh yes final lose some of the data I think that's one of the situations where it is this mean one makes a lot of sense I think in in spark 3 we're gonna see another evolution on sort of the streaming engines I'm hoping the API is stay relatively similar but if you want to find out more about that I encourage you to watch our other session where we talk about things that might happen in spark 3 no promise no promises for sure and decoded yes yes I think those are yeah I mean this is not a world that's gonna go away streaming is a thing yes we would have to deal with it I mean if we look at like and actually streaming is more important now because have you read the 5g spec for wireless so or do you know what that's about this may come as a surprise you well like when I want to relax I don't sit back in the bathtub open up a bottle of champagne and grab the latest I Triple E specifications I do a code review yeah good call all right but where's the commitment level really yeah so 5g yeah is this low latency high throughput yeah wireless network which is gonna be like you gotta gotta get it and we got a process all the data yeah we have a streaming data coming out of us every single car scooter I mean I'm we're in Austin I got their scooters everywhere on the street and all of them are streaming data and cars ubers lifts and all this things streaming data we can't do anything without streaming data anymore it's true I mean the nice thing about this though is that for a lot of those things an acceptable SLA is already reachable without doing Herculean efforts with technology we have today the only question is will we be able to keep pace with the rate of growth of the data and I think the answer is yes I think we're do have an interesting Frankenstein right I look forward to that LLVM Fortran combination but I suspect before too long you too will be able to have streaming for train in the cloud nothing says modern applications like stringing for a chat in the cloud yeah I actually had to install Fortran inside of my containers like 20 minutes ago do you realize what a cry for help that that could that whole statement is I've installed container a continued version of Fortran yeah actually it's really frustrating because like I want to use the optimized like we're trying all the cool sea librarians and everyone else so like the problem is like it's like a container but like I'm gonna have to gin separately for each different arc and like with really socks right like it does so yeah mmm well Wow you're using Fortran boy on that note we should just end this right now all right so we've got that we're talking about some sparking applications and if you can tell it's complicated and don't use Fortran at home please please don't use Fortran all right we'll see you next time I know man you should use Fortran ah you should use Fortran my brother is a portrait programmer he's a hydrologist do you not want your brother to make this sweet sweet advertising bag is also an Emacs programmer your excellent portrait I'm like dude you have a job from 1979 what do you think my job is",
