you can hear us if you can see us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat we will know we can start hi stefanon hi alex hi everyone welcome to today's workshop introduction to apache cassandra for developers yes as alex said please tell us if you can hear it as if you can hear us yeah so looks like we are good yeah yeah looks good on my side very good all right so let's start let's start i think you're showing your screen so that's right i'm going to switch to yours actually give me a moment sure boom lots of thumbs up so great oh and there we are okay so welcome to today's workshop introduction to apache cassandra um we are i'm stefano uh developer advocate at datastax i like apache cassandra i like distributed systems and today i'm also here to teach you something because i love to teach these are my my social contacts so you are very much welcome to connect with me um alex here on on my left please uh right this is yourself so i am uh alex wilshere developer advocate data stocks and uh i actually enjoy all of our workshops and maybe some of you have seen us before if you didn't when you are lucky enough and welcome to this team uh enough of words let's move on let's move on yeah because it's not only the two of us but the whole developer advocate team at data stacks is a you see lots of people and they are usually behind all of the work we do so it's a team work and some of them might also pop up here today in the chat to help if you have questions speaking of questions and interaction with you a bit of a preliminary information today we are streaming on youtube but even the very uncommon case that youtube has trouble which happened just yesterday after one year of everything going fine we will switch to twitch for as a backup plan so get ready we have some plan b in case there are trouble but hopefully today it will work on youtube um this is uh there is um quite some interactivity in this workshop which is uh which has very various forms one is the um the chat box you see on the on the left on the right of your youtube live window so this is a place to interact us and ask questions and everything and we are trying to keep an eye and usually we try not to leave any questions unanswered but that's not the end of it because we are also having we have an active community on discord and actually maybe we can ask our good old nightbot to drop the link to it so you should see in a few seconds a link to the discord server of datastax developers which you are invited to because that's that is where the discussion can go on even after this live is over and the the topics covered there range from very widely between develop app development new technologies obviously nosql databases and cassandra in particular and we are there to help you and yeah chad discuss and answer your questions um that's not all of it because we are also having a interactive quiz and gains during today's workshop and by the way the the last part will be questions with timing and the fastest answers will win prizes so please uh don't forget about maintaining we will come to that in a little while now um more to the point today is an interactive workshop so we will be introducing you to this uh wonderful technology that is the database apache cassandra and you will also be able to do something by yourself so some hands-on exercise to do that don't worry you don't have to install anything because it's all done in your browser thanks to uh technologies that are available in the cloud so first thing we have a github repository and i think it's a good time to drop the link to it in the youtube chat we have a github repository containing um today's slides um source code which today means uh cql commands to run to execute so you will see later what that means and the indicate and instructions to to perform the exercises by yourself because the idea is that the github has a big readme that explains everything and enables you to do the practice and to learn on on your own even if you for some reason are not keeping up with today's live session so you can go there anytime and do the the practice by yourself but obviously we need a database github is not enough and the database today again lives in the cloud for you so we will be using astrodb which is a database as a service offered by data stacks based on apache cassandra and that will make it possible to play with the database without having to worry about operations maintenance installed installation anything and the sweetest part is it is free up to a very high level of usage which very much covers what today what we will do today and much more so i see questions in the chat i have no background in no sequel am i good fit to attend this workshop yes and even more than yes because this is again an introduction to apache cassandra and i would say cassandra is one of the coolest nosql databases so you are very much in the right place all right and i would add a thing here a lot of people consider nosql it's something monolith uh like uh there are a lot of sql databases and they all similar to each other from a developer's point of view and then you think uh no sql so they're a group of databases very similar to each other and that's completely wrong because they are very very very very different so if you know it won't help you with cassandra because cassandra is different if you know cassandra it won't help you with grav db like now for j they are different and things like that so you are totally welcomed yeah absolutely indeed nosql databases share one thing that they are not relational databases that's about it so then there is very much variety within the nosql family now that's not the end of it because we would like to uh help you brag about break about your achievement so let's say you follow the workshop you're interested and you manage to do the exercise successfully then we want to prove that we want you to be able to prove it and that's why we have a program of badges verified badges offered by badger io i think right badger io if i'm remember correctly and uh we will have some homework for you to do at the end of today's workshop you can submit the homework anytime in the next days let's see and we will grade them and we will award you a nice badge that you can then uh use in your social profiles and post uh about it anywhere and yeah you know be the cool guy who can prove their knowledge of cassandra that's not the end of it so let's speak a bit about the homework again homework will be a bit of exercises by the end of today's practice and there will be also two very cool interactive scenarios that you can go there and play with in the browser so you will be given the opportunity to play to learn even more about the cql language which is the basic language to interact with cassandra and the data modeling process which is the one of the most important part of using cassandra there they are very cool uh interactive scenarios you can play you can do them and they contain exercises and they guide you along doing exercises so i think that's a good time to switch to the first interactive part of today which is just not yet the quiz with prices but just a few questions to get to know you better so without further ado i would invite you to go to mendy.com possibly with your phone and there you will establish connection with our questions so to go to mendy please take your phone go to mendy.com and enter the code that actually in the chat and which will you very see a moment yes yep and under the code you see on the screen yeah the code is also in the youtube chat and you will yeah yeah now you're seeing that on screen or you can use the qr code on 404 on github link let's see that's very unexpected but i'm going to check let me check meanwhile anyway join the mentee while we are checking the github link but it should work that should work let me paste it manually maybe no okay i think it works but anyway i'll paste it once more so please keep this repository open because it will provide the guidance and also help you navigate through the various commands that we will later ask you to run in your own database now we will ask you now we will ask you a few questions yes totally fine we don't yet ask the questions that's all good we will ask you a few questions no rush but in the end using the same mentee so don't quit after the questions from mendy we will play a game with surprises so uh stay with me or jump in right now and meanwhile i'm starting the first question uh where are you guys located where are you from where are you now okay i see india is the united states uh uk or is it ireland i'm not sure again united states that must be canada and that's definitely that's definitely africa that's amazing you know what we do educational trainings for a few years already and i'm happy to see how we have more and more people from different regions i mean we always have a lot of attendees from india for example but it's great to see what we now have getting more and more attendees from africa that's just very cool thank you for joining yeah so just just a warning i see many answers in the youtube chat that's unfortunately not how it works so you're supposed to go to mendy.com and put your answers there because otherwise they are not processed and that's not so imp that's not a big problem now but when we will then go to have the quiz the the game quiz uh if you answer in the youtube chat you will not have a chance to win so winners make points only by playing within mendy.com we don't have uh any integration between the youtube chat and this mendy platform sorry so please remember to join mandy for the later questions good then next question what's your experience with nosql databases we have a couple of people with a lot of experience which is great and most of you of course are beginners in this field which is totally fine we have a dedicated workshop for introduction to apache cassandra you are attending right now we also have very interesting workshop introduction to nosql which explains the variety of different nosql databases how they support each other and how they compete and they also invite you to attend it so i believe that's quite interesting here most of you never use it or have some experience but not too much that's cool then um that's the right place for you right place for you to be here welcome are you a certified nosql and or apache cassandra expert i mean i certified maybe with any another nosql databases not only cassandra okay we have one certified person two okay that's getting better but most of our attendees are not certified in this field and well that's pretty much expected that's why that's why good news right data stack sponsors your education and certification as a no secret expert and that is really cool and i like it a lot uh we will give you more details in the end of this workshop but for you to know the data stocks you can get your uh education for free in the no sql field get your voucher in the end of this uh workshop and then take a certain take an exam and and pass it hopefully if you learn furrow enough and become and certified nosql expert without paying a cent isn't that amazing yeah i do believe that's quite amazing yeah so uh that was the last question for the setup and stefano i'm switching back to your screen absolutely so but please keep the mendy open because this very same connection to mendy we will we will be used for the quiz so don't close it yet right if you want to play the game and have a chance at winning prizes okay but i think it's now time now we we have met we have gotten to know our audience a bit better i think it's time to try and have a closer look at this apache cassandra thing that we are about to to see what do you think alex uh sorry i think it's time to have a closer look at cassandra yeah sure speaking so far and now it's time to get into the meat of the thing so apache cassandra what is that well it is a nosql distributed database and when i say that every word here has a very important meaning so let's see it is a nosql database so what is a database i'm i can imagine most of you know what the database is it is a technology able to let us store and retrieve data in a well organized way and hopefully performant way and so far so good cassandra is nosql uh that means that it goes beyond the very good and and the well-established paradigm of the relational databases so it is approaching storing of data and managing data in one of those new ways that we just remarked no sql is not a type of databases but it's rather a whole philosophy a whole set of different ways of not implementing relational databases basically and the important thing is that uh cassandra is distributed so it has an approach where the data is stored on several nodes uh just one one point i see in the charter question do we have a recorded session for a later reference yes very much yes that all of our workshops will be then will be available later as recordings at this same link you are watching now so you can also by the way you can also browse our datasex developers youtube channel and there are lots and lots of videos on all topics including this video here okay so let's go back to a cassandra it is a distributed well that means that cassandra as many computer programs lives in a in a machine that we call node so you install cassandra on a given node and that means that this node can host let's say a few terabytes of data and since it is designed in a very well performant way it is able to support a lot of transactions per seconds per core so you have a multi-core machine you have more transactions now when we say transactions let's say read and write operations i'm not speaking of transactions in the transactional sense of relational databases so just read and write a lot per second something like a few tens of thousands per second per core usually but what what is very powerful in in cassandra it is that is the way it approaches uh distributed data because the whole cassandra database is not just that one node but it is a whole set of nodes you see they they are now many nodes it's uh seven of them it might be even me very many more than seven and each one is each one is running cassandra and they can collectively form your database so the data leaves distributed sp scattered in a very precise way throughout all of these nodes these nodes speak to each other according to several protocols in particular one of the most important is the gossip that is what makes every node aware of the other nodes how they are who they are and where they are so that the interaction between those makes it possible to look at the database as a single thing from outside even though internally it's a distributed system these nodes together form what we what is called data center or we usually call it ring which for now for us today is the same and you might wonder who is using cassandra so what kind of performance or si or data size can cassandra support well uh good news is that cassandra is now a very well established database it is more than 10 years old it's been developed for a long time and optimized and improved for quite some time and it is used by some of the largest uh it companies in the world so the names of apple netflix if you ever used an apple product netflix product if you booked an uber ride and i don't know if you also github is using cassandra for example so let's say these big names speak about the reliability of this of this database because these are companies that cannot afford failures or downtimes much and they also deal with data at a scale that is uh almost astonishing so you see the numbers here these are this light is from uh i think a cassandra day or maybe an accelerate event a few a couple of years ago and you see there are clusters made by hundreds of thousands of machines of nodes they host collectively several hundreds of petabytes and they support a number of operations per second that is a very very impressive i would say so this is just as a testimony of how cassandra can be powerful if properly handled and uh yeah so let's have a closer look at some of its main properties so cassandra is a nosql distributed database we know that it is also decentralized we will see later what that means let's say that as you briefly saw in previous slide it is uh able to accommodate big data so if you have clusters made by um let's say tens of thousands of nodes and every node can host a few terabytes of data you can do your multiplication and figure out that we can easily reach petabytes and petabytes of data cassandra is optimized for a very high performance in reading and writing so due to the way it is uh due to its architecture it is able to support very fast reading and writing in particular writing and i say that just because for most databases the architecture is a bit skewed to fast reading but not necessarily fast writing cassandra takes a different approach and makes also writing very very very fast and performant so cassandra due to its architecture can scale linearly that means uh i think we have separate slides on these points so maybe i can just jump forward so uh let's just mention that it it is a database that can scale linearly to virtually any size any size of cluster it can be configured to have the highest availability it is able to self heal and most of the procedures to to adapt to to disruptions is automated it supports geographical distribution so it can be spread all over the world a single database can be spread all over the world uh well linearly does not mean horizontally but yes we speak we are speaking of horizontal scaling but we will come to that in a second black leg uh it is platform agnostic so it is it will not uh how do you say fence you in a single cloud vendor and it is open source so let's go to a few of those points so big data already um data is distributed and partitioned over uh this distributed architecture several nodes and you know what happens if you need more data because somehow your your your application is growing you just add more nodes so you can just scale horizontally by adding more and more nodes and cassandra is optimized to run on commodity hardware so you don't have the astronomical cost of very powerful dedicated machine special purpose machines you can easily just add more and more ordinary machines then you have a very good read and write performance i think with we say that already but in particular the way reads and writes occur is not coordinated by any centralized entities so even if on a very large cluster you will have a very fast reading and writing in particular you have constant time access regardless of the size of your cluster so if you have this no this this ring made by six nodes you have the same access time as if you had 600 nodes which is a remarkable achievement then there was a question about linear scalability now by linear in this case we mean that if you uh if you increase the number of nodes in general you expect some increase in the performance in particular for example the amount of read writes that your system can support now the usually there is less than linear increases so let's say you double the number of nodes and in many system you have a bit less than twice the num the performance available uh on a very wide range of cluster size cassandra is uh surprisingly linear so if you double the number of nodes you actually get double the the performance available and that's how good that's as good as it can get because something super leaner uh i don't think it can exist alex what do you think would you would like to have a super linear system so you double notes and you have three times as much performance but i think that's something that is not in this universe but even having it leaner is not bad so another important point is that cassandra is offers the highest availability so you can have data is replicated over several nodes not only that but you can have a single database uh spanning several physical locations and with the inter data center replication also automated which is the highest availability you can design and actually if you design your cluster and your database in the right way you basically achieve a 100 uptime theoretically so even just a just a very widespread earth level disaster can make your your database not available nothing short of that on that and the important point is that there is no a master node so every one of these nodes every one of these rims that form your database is active so there is no a primary and then a lot of replicas just reading read-only or anything every database of these every cluster of these will be able to support reading and writing and as i like to say all nodes are created equal in cassandra so there is no master architecture of any kind there is no concept of master and there is a point someone mentions uh there are coordinator notes and i want to explain every note is a coordinator no yes yes so there are coordinators but it's it is not a fixed role like this node is the boss every time a single query arrives there is a query coordinator that coordinates that one query and then after that it it will go back to having the same role as any other node so every node can temporarily act as a coordinator for a single query reading or writing okay so another very cool part is that we all know at least many of us know that operations and management and maintenance of databases can be a very heavy and daunting task good news is that cassandra is mostly able to take care of itself so to speak in under many circumstances so if you have in particular if you have to scale out for example you have to add more nodes most of the underlying data redistribution is happening automatically behind the scenes for you i see a question about hashing we will come to that later the answer is yes uh for distributing the data yes now let's go to the geographical distribution point cassandra is designed from the ground up to support multi-data center databases as you see in this picture we have a database in california we have sorry we have a ring in california we have a ring in europe and one in asia and they all form a single database they communicate to each other uh asynchronously behind the scenes and they ensure consistency and this all happens basically by design and you don't have you don't have to to to worry about that too much and it will guarantee that your data is uh everywhere and in particular if you have customers in various continents that's very important because you want to offer low latency to all of them so and yeah and a remark here is that all data centers forming this database are active so it is an active active setup no read replicas or anything no back no for fallback replicas of any kind they are all the active part of your database another important point is that cassandra can run on every cloud provider or even on your own premises and a single database can also be deployed in a hybrid way so if you want to have a maximum resilience you can have your database spread over several cloud provider a bit of aws a bit of azure and so on and it will still be a single database uh so geographical and cloud provider uh independence last point very important is that apache cassandra is um an apache project so it is covered by the apache license and that will guarantee that you you will never be locked in of in any way which is cool probably you who know of many apache projects at least spark hadoop zookeeper maven most of you so let's stop here for a second i've seen the youtube chat uh popping up with questions so alex there have there been uh interesting questions that you want to discuss uh uh there are a lot of questions about consistency how in general it's all about how consistency is being maintained if it's the active active distributed system we explain it later so i don't want to stop on it right now uh is it possible to keep data locally restricted for gdpr reasons yes yes um and yep so that's a primary in general i'm answering questions on the youtube chat and if i somehow miss your question then let us meet later on discord yeah very good so i think uh i hope i picked your interest with this description of uh of cassandra i think it's now time to for you to do some hands-on parts and get your hands dirty so get ready for your first hands-on session what will happen now uh you will be creating your own database in the cloud and it will be a cassandra based database for later playing with it now i see a very valid question in the chat what is astrodb well let's let's let's make one step back astrodb is a database offered in the cloud as a service by datastax and it is based on apache cassandra and you will basically be able to spin up your own astra database in the cloud in a few clicks in a few minutes and you will be able to use it later as if it were your own cassandra installation on your local machine or whatever wherever you want with the advantage that uh it will take a few minutes to set it up so today for the exercises it will otherwise we will take the whole workshop just having you install cassandra on your machines which we don't want to do and it will basically be managed by data stacks for you in in their own cloud machines thanks to the magic of kubernetes by the way behind the scenes so what is astrodb is a database as a service offered for free to you by data stacks and you will use it today to play with cassandra a bit and then i hope we hope you will be starting to use it to create who knows which wonderful application so uh there's a question you you will see it later juncture astra db is multi-cloud so you can choose the cloud provider and it will be deployed on that one so astrodb is uh allows you to put your data anywhere choosing the region and the cloud provider this is uh in answer to jamshare by the way you will not have the burden of uh operations because that's all handled for you as a service in the cloud and there is a free tier that's to answer ashkai agrawal there's a fleet here that affords you 20 million reads rights and 80 gigabytes of storage per month so actually for very heavy workloads that's a a paid product but today and for a reasonably sized small scale application you will be staying within the free tier that's because you will have a monthly credit for free to use if you want to go on and keep using cassandra which we encourage and using astrodb you can still stay on a street b and play with it and even set up your own application and let it run forever and as long as you stay within this bounce it will be free so yes it's completely free unless you are really running an enterprise level kind of thing so uh the link to the github repo you already saw and then i think it's time alex what do you think it's time for the first part of the hand of today's hands on so i think you can either scan the code or type the link you see here or it should appear in the youtube chat in uh two seconds but maybe i can paste it for some reason it is there is some delay so oh yeah here we go just took a few minutes a few seconds so if you click here maybe uh you can start registering but probably alex might take over with his screen in this place right that's what i'm going to do so ladies and gentlemen in the next few minutes i'm going to be your best friend because we will walk through the first exercises uh working with apache cassandra we don't want to make you install cassandra on your laptop because it's going to take quite some time and that's an introduction for cassandra for developers we will use cassandra as a service in the cloud because it's already deployed there by us for you but basically all the exercises we do today you can do with your own locally running capacity it's of course totally supported and yes as uh our dear stefano just uh said spending five minutes on that yes it has free tier uh so let us go on and let me speech to my screen right boom so now mostly probably you can see my screen and that's our workshop and i will again put the link to you in the chat right yes you do have to create an account please create an account following the link astra.death 12-16 as it was pasted in the youtube chat already so please create an account again this uh scenario this workshop is totally free and you don't pay for the astra usage actually you can use ultra even for small production workloads without paying for that so first thing you have to understand is that our workshop into the cassandra github repo which you will use to do all the exercises and you can do those exercises right now together with me or you can do it later on your own asking questions um at our discord server as well and let us start so first part of our exercise will be to create your astrodb instance so you register at astron i chose start free now to start on a free tier and that will be enough when we have to create a database and we will walk you through that so i already have my oh okay sign it out i will sign in back [Music] okay i i already have one uh let me make it a little bit bigger for you so you will get this screen to create a database immediately because you don't have any at least most of you and i will just push for button create a database now i will create a database following the instructions of the workshop i will use for the database name name workshops and by the way i will paste it to the youtube chat to make it more comfortable for you i told you i'm your friend and then as a key space name we will use chat thundra at this moment don't ask what is a key space we will explain it soon now we have to select a provider in region and as a provider you can choose between google cloud platform amazon web services and microsoft azure and now please tell me which cloud i should use just right on the youtube chat which cloud i should use for this demo it doesn't matter because astra and cassandra runs on every of them but frankly speaking for us it doesn't matter because astra provides these abstraction layer aws aws azure aws aws okay guys so google cloud hey i'm ring thank you actually you didn't know maybe i'm a certified google cloud architect but as most of you ask for aws yes aws please hey unring that's how you get banned by our nightbot don't do that okay so looks like ours has won and then for the region i will select europe from frankfurt as it's the closest region to me aws is a clear winner but that doesn't really matter you will see soon so i push the create database button and my database is being started right now and meanwhile that's what you can do as i said i'm fine if you are doing the lab after a workshop but you also can do it right now with me so as you see now i have two workshops two databases sorry and the one i just created is in pending state that's totally fine now astra deploys new database new cassandra database for me so it will take a minute something like that and uh obviously we just finished the first uh exercise right yeah maybe we can ask for uh we can ask uh for a thumbs up in the chat if you manage to create your database and have it in pending state just to to make sure you are following along so if you manage to get to the pending state the database being created you can give me give us a thumbs up yay yes that's good thumbs up you guys rock i take it as a yes i created it yes yes yes yes a lot of yes okay great very good great nice to see a question what's the default cluster size it's great frankly speaking for the free tier i don't remember it i think it's three three i think it's three i think you know three cluster i think if you i think if you describe a key space there is a three in the replication factor being explicitly mentioned yeah uh you see when you are on a page tier of course there are more options no questions but you should be good uh on the free tier for educational purposes uh totally and hey take a look my database isn't status active so that means it's operational i can connect to it uh we see trans on aws in europe central one zero read request zero right request zero storage consumed and zero data transfer not a big surprise because it's just created we can take a look at itself it must be in the totally perfect state so we wait for grafana dashboard to load and see the status of our cluster and we see what we are doing well no request errors and that totally makes sense because well again there are no operations over this one there are instructions on how do you connect to this database using apis using drivers for your application and using sdk but today for the purpose of this workshop we will use sql console cql means cassandra very language that's the language you use to work with cassandra quite surprised i'm being so obvious today and uh that's a console you work with your uh at your browser you have cassandra for example i can ask use health for help so i can ask for help and get some shell command topics what i can get if those system and i can ask for example for describe e-spaces to ask to see what key spaces i currently have do you remember i created the key space uh chatsandra it's now key and available for me so stefano uh do we go um do we go for uh the next slides or should i proceed i think we can do it i think you can stop there on the secure console so it's ready for the next steps and maybe we should jump back to we will later you will let her know what's what is it what is going on and when you when we do the rest of the practice so there is a few there are a few very quick questions in the chat one is can i use astra for production and the answer is yes you can many companies already doing that yes exactly so again it's it's an offering being used by many big companies but also i would say if you have a very if you have a small workload you can also use this free tier for production if your application is sized has a size that fits there so then maybe it will grow and if you need to scale you might want to promote it to a more a broader a larger level a higher number of nodes and everything but still yes you can there is someone sajal wow it's using grafana yes there is a tight integration with grafana maybe alex is the best person to speak about that okay oh yes right cedric hi cedric thank you that you interjected yes exactly i was saying the same so um is key space like a schema well key space is you will see it soon you will see let's not spoil the surprise okay so we can move on to a bit more on the internals of how cassandra works so uh and let me switch for screenplays yes answering question good uh and can we use uh python programming language yes totally absolutely there are drivers sorry no no no all good yes there are drivers uh but not in this workshop in this workshop as it's fundamentals we work directly with cassandra federal language yeah but of course yes uh by the way the the uh cql console is you have seen alex writing uh comments there you it's like many other consoles even though it's in the browser you write commands and you hit enter to to execute just for for later remember that you you have to end every command with semicolon and the like the good thing is that you have path completion so you have tab completion so if you start writing a command you can with the tab key you can have it easily autocomplete okay so let's move on um as i said uh before this part of the practice i hope you are now interested so we can have a closer look at uh what happens within cassandra when you use it so how does it work let's start this part a first important point is that data is distributed so we mentioned that already and let's have a closer look so this is a typical cassandra node made by made by seven sorry a cassandra ring made by seven nodes seven servers machines and on the right you see a table because surprise cassandra stores data in tables tables means that it has every so a table has rows and columns columns as you see here country city and population so this table stores uh information about cities grouped by uh so defined by a country they live in and the city name and then there is the population which is presumably a number okay so this is conceptually in my mind it is a single table but when we say data is distributed what we mean is that actually physically speaking the rows making up this table are spread across the whole cluster so every every there are blocks of rows that are on one node blocks of rows that are on another node but you see there is a there is a property here you see that all rows in usa are together all rows in france are together all those of germany are together and well many other are just one single row per counter so that doesn't apply but the point is that the the column called country is the what is called a partition key so the value of country will define what is the node which will uh keep the data we will which will host the data in particular there is a very important consequence of that if you have many rows several rows with the same country you have the guarantee that they will go to the same node as you see in this in this drawing in practice when you have a table there are every table has at least a column or maybe more but usually let's say one in many cases and this column is the partition key and that will define how rows are grouped and how are they stored over different nodes in the cluster as you see here so how does partitioning work i've seen a question earlier about partitioning so sorry maybe switch to a previous slide i don't want to add anything take a look uh ladies and gentlemen a lot of people at this moment don't understand why cassandra is doing that i mean like there are many databases what store all their data uh on a single node and if they need some secondary read-only replica they add secondary read-only replica then this data is also stored only completely on this note why does cassandra distribute this data divides data into the groups answer is very simple take a look uh then you have more and more data your business and more and more successful you have more and more clients more and more boots offering more and more services at some point your data doesn't fit into your server and then you have to replace it completely then your data grows again and again and again it doesn't fit the server and you have to upgrade it again getting more and more storage more and more storage at some point you already paying hundreds thousands of dollars per server and you again need more but for no server to fit all of your data and then you have to go sharding and sharding in relational databases or non-relational as well is extremely hard what differs cassandra cassandra is big data ready what does that mean it means what it can handle any amounts of data you didn't misheard that apple stores in cassandra hundreds petabytes can you imagine such a huge database in my sequel it won't work that's why cassandra distributes data in the partition from the very beginning it's required to be able to scale for data of any size yeah yeah good good point well well said thank you okay so this is why uh a table is uh distributed from the start so it is ready to host a very large number of rows a very huge amount of data without worrying about the later problems because it starts distributed and how is partitioning working so we say that the partition key in this table in the sample table is the country so what happens behind the scenes is that the value of country you see on the left you see australia canada germany well these are values in this case they are two letter uh text values they are made within they are uh there is a a function called partitioner that uh makes this value into numbers now in this example numbers are one zero to one hundred in in reality it is a very larger amount i think it's two to the 64 or something like that anyway the partitioner transforms the values in the partition key into numbers and every node is assigned a range of these what is called a token range so you see in this example we have four nodes and the range the total range is 1 to 100 it's not like that in reality but that's to a simplified form and the first node will have to take we'll take care of numbers of values of token 1 to 25 the second node 26 to 50 and so on so uh within the belly of cassandra whatever the the column in the partition key they are always made into numbers and the number will determine which is what is the node uh responsible for this piece of data so you see uh as a the fact that several rows with the same partition key will always end in the same node is guaranteed by this process because several rows with the same germany so berlin and nuremberg in the example will have the same value of part of the token and they will be guaranteed to end both in the second node in this example now the partitioner is a function so every node is able to do that and indeed a crucial point is that every node is aware of the shape of the topology of the cluster so every piece of data that has to be written or retrieved every node is able by itself to compute what what is the right node to to to store the data and this is the principle that guarantees the constant time the constant access time even if the no if even if if the the cluster is very large even if the ring is very big every node by itself is able to directly lead the data drive the data to the right place without having to to speak to any coordinator of any kind so these are the token ranges and let's let's pretend it's the the full token range is uh the full tokens range from 1 to 100 and we have a four node data center so you see each each node is responsible for 25 values of the token now let's say my application is becoming more and more popular i'm i need to host more and more data and uh what happens we we told you already that you can scale horizontally so we add a node surprise the full range instead of being divided by 4 now is divided by 5 and every node is responsible for 20 values of token and this is the typical scale out situation i see a question is auto scaling available well the nice thing is that the redistribution of data happens automatically so whenever you add a node a process of data streaming takes place and uh in a in a little while well it depends on the size of the data but eventually the data will be redistributed according to the new token range assignments now there are two observations to be made in in this one is that there is no downtime so there is no moment during this process where your application uh has problems so the whole process happens and in the meantime the database will continue being completely available and reads and writes will be able to be done the second point is that the way partitioning is is made guarantees that the amount of data that has to be streamed is the least possible amount and this is due to a property of the partitioner that is the consistent hashing property so the way partitioning the way uh partitioning uh is done guarantees that the amount of the number of rows that have to be moved from one node to the other is uh as little as it can be now well in many cases applications have to have growing data demands but there might be also cases where this is the opposite so let's say christmas season is over or black friday is over and my very big need for a large database is over so i want to scale down for some reason i want to scale in so i want to go back to having fewer nodes the good thing is that this is also happening automatically and again there there is no downtime and everything works as uh as any uh administrator would like to be would like it to be and so cassandra is able to take care mostly automatically of these of these processes then again there is a layer of uh manual management that might enter in some cases so it's not a black box kind of thing but most of it of the boring operation can be left to happen automatically sorry uh uh please get back to the previous slide so take a look there are a lot of questions uh about uh how it differs from uh sharding or uh how do i redistribute data after scaling out or scaling in so let us phrase that one more time partitioning is totally automated you just add new server to the cluster and cassandra will recalculate token ranges cassandra will transfer data cassandra will star cassandra will enable new server when data transfer is finished and that's a cluster job not yours it's totally automated on the outer side then you decommission a note cassandra will recalculate token ranges cassandra will stream data cassandra will then decommission those nodes and you are good and it's all totally automated with sharding you very often have to change your application at application layer in order to support new charts uh via cassandra you don't need it you still work it with a single database so uh sharding is manual slow and painful partitioning is totally automated and cluster makes your work for you i love it i am a lazy engineer i prefer cluster to do my job so there is a question are only 100 tokens issued per cluster no actually no the 100 is just an illustrative example the real numbers are 2 to the 64 i think anyway it's a huge number so this is the real range of tokens it's a very huge number and yeah so that's able to to deal with a very very huge number of um partitions or token values which you know in this sense is the same indeed you can have a very large number of partitions in a cassandra table and that's hardly you can hardly hit a problem there okay so let's go forward now all nice all good when when it's when it comes to sorry data distribution but obviously we are very much responsible people when it comes to data and we want to make sure data is properly replicated because you know you can you have to plan for failure so there is a concept called replication factor and that's a number a low number usually and it just says how many nodes will host a given piece of data so in the example you see so far uh every partition every part of the table every single value of the country was on a single node but that's hardly uh a well a good setup in production because you are obviously very much in danger if a node goes down for some reason indeed it's good to have the data over several nodes so you have this replication factor now let's say i have replication factor of one that means that every partition will go to one node as in the example we saw so far so there is this block this usa partition in the in the table of the count of the city population and this is just on this purple node and that's it of course that's not something we would recommend in production again because a machine can fail you can have any kind of problem network connectivity whatever so we can consider replication factor two that means that every partition in particular for example this usa partition will be hosted by two different nodes as you see here now that's good that's better and you can also increase to replication factor three which more or less is let's say in almost all setups is the recommended choice so if you if you don't know better you you should assume in production replication factor has to be three that's it and there is hardly a situation where you would go beyond three because then you have less and less advantage and more and more uh cost i would say in storage so if you have replication factor three except for very strange setups that's good enough for production so what that what what this means is that every piece of data is in three different nodes but that's not the same as saying that the whole table is on all nodes because again as alex remarked you can have a very huge database and that would not fit on any individual node it is just to say that there might be usa on these three nodes and there might be germany on uh on three nodes partially overlapping and so on so there is no single node having the whole data but still you are you are not losing even a single row if a node is temporarily unavailable and that's good okay so replication factor three let's say is the recommended choice and then we will then fix replica rf to three so let's see what happens when uh for example some data needs to be written because now we have a distributed data we have uh three different nodes that will be responsible for let's say the usa part of the table so let's see what happens when uh your application has to write these two rows about usa to the cluster so the application for some reason reaches node 17 here and the node number 17 which means 17 stands for the for the token range corresponding to this node by the way so what comes to the node is usa but the node by itself as any other is able to apply the partitioner function and to turn usa into the number 59 again this is fake numbers these are small scale numbers to make the explanation easier but anyway the note number 17 says oh i have some data that belongs to token 59 so i have to to carry over these pieces of data these new rows to be inserted i have to carry them over to these these and this node and this is what we mentioned earlier because now node 17 is acting as query coordinator for this write even though and that's entirely possible node 17 is not even hosting it's not even storing the data itself but that's not a problem it is just you acting as coordinator and it will distribute the rows to write to the three nodes that have it so what happens is that this number this this data usa which correspond to 59 they they are they go through the node 17 and they have to go there and there and there so the the other three nodes and this is what happens the orange node acting as coordinator will write will send the rows to right to the other three nodes which will then store them permanently in their own file system in a particular way and there it is so this is how a write happens in in this replicated uh setup now let's see that for some reason let's assume that for some reason one of the three target nodes is temporarily unavailable it is broken it is rebooting whatever catches fire you never know okay so uh first point is that generally speaking the database is still working because of replication but then what happens with your right well the nice thing is that if the coordinator if the orange node notices that one of the three target nodes is not answering is not able to acknowledging the right it will store what is called a hint locally so node 17 knows that it hasn't reached one of the three target nodes and it will just store the hint later node the blue node comes back again and it will receive the hint so as soon as it becomes available it will receive hints by other nodes which i will notice that it has become up available again so it will be able to re-align its uh data with uh with the right so at the end you will have consistency again and this is more or less the hint mechanism at play so okay there might be cases where the hint are not enough uh for that so let's say a node might be down for days and days for some reason and then that will call for uh some kind of manual repair mechanism which anyway is a good practice to do periodically but let's say in ordinary temporary down times they are automatically handled by cassandra itself now before going on alex did you do you want to bring our attention to some particular questions some something that pops up in the chat nope i believe all questions are answered very good and there is not something i would [Music] that's there is not something i would highlight at the moment okay so let's go on now we've been speaking about replication and uh replication solves a lot of problems so basically makes my system more robust more resilient but it has some downsides let's say now i'm showing a slide about the cip theorem or cup theorem or brewer's theorem and that was mentioned in the chart i've seen a few passing references to the cup theorem in the chat earlier so some of you at least have know what what it is about and let's briefly uh speak about the cup theory because it's important so every distributed system unfortunately has to obey this theorem because this is a theorem like a mathematical theorem not uh it's it is a limitation but it is not a limitation due to how the the database is built how the distributed system is engineered rather it is an intrinsic mathematical limitation of this word of this universe the point is that you have there are three features that i would really much like to have in a distributed system all at once ideally but i can't and you can't nobody can because they sort of exclude each other now let's let's have a closer look so i guess all of you would like your database to be consistent uh which which means that every client reading the data will get the same values regardless of which client and also uh during concurrent rights so i would like every client to get back the same values basically that is very much a desired thing right but i also would like my system to be available so to be always possible to query it anytime but i also want my system to be able to work even in the case of network failures and that's a tricky point because first point is that sooner or later your network will have some problem your nodes will have some problem speaking to each other even in the best hardware setup at some point there will be some network failures and i want my system to be able to work even in that case because there is a very huge risk and the worst that can happen in a distributed system is that somehow there is a network disruption and two parts of the system think they are the whole system and they start diverging let's say my database is split because the network is temporarily broken and the two parts of the database each one thinks it is the whole database and it starts you know reading and writing and accepting reads and modifications so let's think of the database behind the bank account it's very much a danger right if one half of the database is writing transactions and changing my bank account values and the other half is doing differently so that's not even a database anymore it's a split brain situation and that's something that i have to avoid at all cost indeed partition tolerance so the ability to work even in the case of network failures is one is of these three properties is the one that i cannot avoid i mean any reasonable system has to guarantee partition tolerance so basically the cup theorem says i can have two of those at a time so i i can design my system to guarantee two of those at most now uh i don't want to have split brain problems uh by no way so basically the choice is between having cp or ap so i have i'm forced to make a choice uh now uh every database nosql or relational anyway they sort of take their choice and they might be designed to be cp they might be designed to be ap so it depends on the use case they have they are more more uh poised to to to support the cool thing is cassandra many say that cassandra is ap mostly because it uh favors availability over consistency basically but that's not entirely true and i know that this point is very dear to alex i really smile right because actually the cool thing is that you can tune cassandra you can tune cassandra to be more on the ap so available side of things or the cp so you can have you can ask cassandra to be more strongly consistent uh maybe sacrificing a bit of availability or you can ask cassandra to be available maybe uh sacrificing the strong requirement of consistency and the cool thing is that this happens per query so for every single query you can ask the system to basically choose between availability and consistency or something in between and maybe we can uh move forward and have a look at um so okay sorry maybe this is uh represented within the cassandra the interaction with cassandra this is represented by the consistency level which is uh the concept of consistency level is a setting that is every query you run on cassandra comes with a consistency level and basically that means how many nodes i want to acknowledge the operation before uh before the coordinator sends back an okay to the to the application so i want to write a piece of data from outside let's say for my application for my drivers whatever i can ask cassandra dear cassandra i want you to make sure all all involved nodes have done this right before you give me your okay back or the other of the opposite is i just want you to to make sure a single note has given me an okay and then you i will take i i don't care about the rest so the consistency levels range from any which is very much discouraged except for very strange cases then there's one local one two three quorum local quorum all the way to all so um usually the right choices are somehow in the middle but let's let's uh maybe have a closer look what what are these values those basically mean how many nodes will need to send the acknowledgement back to the coordinator before the coordinator in turn gives an okay back to whoever issued the query the right or the read okay so these are the consistency levels but if it comes to many oh sorry if there are many data centers the situation gets even more complicated but let's start with consistency level one and let's say this is a write operation maybe an example might help explaining this the client is wants to write a piece of data we have replication factor three so there are actually three nodes involved three nodes will have to end up with the right in their file system ultimately so the client writes the client speaks to a coordinator the coordinator knows that there are three nodes involved and it will send the right to all three in any case but the point is that as soon as one of them sends an okay back to the coordinator then the coordinator tells to the client okay i'm done yep i would better say as soon as the uh this confirmation acknowledgement is received because acknowledgement can be sent but never received right and lost because of a network yeah yes so yes as soon as the coordinator receives a single acknowledgement that's the meaning of one then the client then it sends to the client okay i'm done but one that's very important that is not the same as saying that only one node will get the right because the point is that the coordinator will send the write to all three nodes involved anyway the point is that two of them will be done asynchronously and only one of them will be synchronous with the whole right operation so consistency level quorum quorum just means more than half of the replication factor so in this case two out of three consistency level quorum means that the the coordinator will wait for at least two acknowledgements to come back to the to the coordinator and then it will tell the client okay your right has succeeded and then consistency level all you can imagine the coordinator will wait for all nodes all three nodes to send back the acknowledgement before it speaks to the client now in some cases all is recommended but in many cases that's probably too much and you might think uh very good let's use all all the time but yeah remember the cap theorem so if you if you ask consistency level all you are uh you have to be aware that you are moving the needle all the way to the consistency part of the theorem and you are sacrificing basically availability because think what happens if every even a single node of your cluster is temporarily down then no write will ever succeed and that's probably not what you want so be careful because the cip theorem cannot be avoided what you can do is to plan your consistency levels according to your needs query by query which is pretty much a powerful a powerful thing to do for you okay so that being said let me very quickly mention one thing uh in most workloads what you want to do probably is to have what you what is uh called immediate consistency so you want a guarantee that if you do a right and then you do a read you will never get obsolete data stale data in the in the read and to get that there are various ways the best way is let's say that usually the best way is to have quorum when writing and quorum when reading because if you think about that if you have quorum and quorum you have a guarantee that the two majority of nodes in reading and writing will overlap and since there is also a timestamp comparison you will never be you will never get stale data in this way if you read after writing basically with a minimal overhead on on the cluster much lower than if you had all all for example so immediate consistency is quorum quorum sorry yes alex uh no no are you serving me for interrupting but a great question actually by varun nayak can application decide certain table on availability and certain tables and consistency a short answer is yes but that's actually even better you uh can to control consistency you have two buttons two levers to knobs uh replication factor and consistency level replication factor is desired is defined per key space and consistency level is decided per query so you can execute queries to the very same table at a very different level of consistency level requirements and that is amazing yeah absolutely that's very cool and gives you pretty much a granularity a fine-grained way of controlling your application because actually the typical application has different needs within it so there might be writes that are very much secondary so to speak like writing a log entry and other that are more critical and have been able to tune individually that makes absolutely sense yes you can choose consistency by individual query okay uh one more point one more point i believe you highlighted that uh but animesh mcgee asked a very good question also what happens if there is a discrepancy in data being received from nodes how to choose what to send and read cases is it it well i just mentioned that there is a timestamp comparison and there and that there are um digest sent along the way so maybe that would lit a bit too much i don't know do you want to spend a few words on that uh yes please could you get to the previous video let me go to the relevant slide right this one maybe it's good enough yeah yeah good good good so the point is uh when we get uh answers uh let's say we make a read request with consistency level quorum at replication factor free it means what we will wait for two pieces of data to exemplars of our replicas before the return answer to the client as you see on the screen right now if we get the same data that means well we return this data if one of exemplars is too old and outdated and stall and not correct outdated wrong when new piece of data the newest piece of data will be returned at the newest version will be returned to the client and meanwhile query coordinator will enable the second layer of defense uh cassandra has multi-layered defense from inconsistency first layer was hinted handoffs and second layer is a read repair then cassandra during the read notices what there is a inconsistency in data it starts a repair for their failed segment so the note what you turn its tail data will immediately be recovered into the consistent state and it's totally automated again you don't have to worry about that yeah yeah actually there are a few mechanisms to ensure consistency some background running hidden repair mechanisms automatic manual initiated by read queries a lot of things happen behind the scenes to ensure consistent data all the time so but we will not highlight them all now and i suggest we move over so another observation is that data is actually maybe okay we say that already data and cassandra is made to be distributed not only within a ring a cluster but also within different data centers between different data centers so here you see i have a whole database made by data centers around the world or maybe on different cloud providers or both things at the same time so how does that happen obviously within a data center you might hope to have very low latency but probably you don't want your query to need to do a round trip of half the word before your client gets an answer so uh so okay just to mention this is very much possible and it works like that but in for to handle multi-data center situations there are consistency levels that are specific to limit your uh query to a single data center or not in some cases but you know what you're going uh so you know what you're facing so higher latencies that there might be cases another point of distribution of data is that when you when you create key spaces which are grouping of tables you define replication factor per data center so you you might want you might create your key space with a replication factor that is zero in america and zero in asia and three in europe and there you have your tables that are gdpr compliant because by by definition by the way you created the key space tables that you put there will only live in europe and you are compliant so this is how you control uh say data governance related uh things okay so uh we've been looking a bit at how cassandra works internally how its architecture allows the astonishing powers it has so very briefly uh a few remarks on the use cases that are typically good fit for cassandra cassander is very much scalable so it can support very huge amounts of data and very high volume of reads and writes which makes it a good fit for several types of applications so you have heavy rights heavy reads that means that applications that produce a lot of data iot log analytics event streaming or any kind of time series indeed they are very good use cases for cassandra by the way cassandra when it comes to time series has specific optimization that can be enabled for tables that when you know that they are written in a time or ordered way um but we don't go much in detail today then cassandra if properly configured is very highly available so it might be a very good candidate for mission critical cases uh when you have to guarantee that your that the database is always on always available that you and that you will never lose data even if you have a small database but that is very much critical that it will never be down so for example market data pricing inventory and similar application medical critical data or stuff like that cassandra is distributed i hope we convinced you that it is distributed and very well at that which means that if you have to be close to the customer everywhere in the world that's a good fit if you have to support mobile workloads that's good and as i just mentioned in a few slides ago if you have to obey compliance requirements also that's very good uh application so any kind of things related to banking retail customer experience and similar and actually any application where you want to give low latency all in the world everywhere in the world is a good fit for cassandra in a sense thanks to it the way it takes seriously uh the distribution of data last but not least cassandra is able is good at cloud native applications indeed uh it is able to support modern cloud applications in several ways it is very easy to build microservice based architectures on top of it that's one thing not only that but cassandra itself is um very so it is a good fit for kubernetes indeed there is a way to the to deploy cassandra within kubernetes that is called kate sandra and it is a very cool open source initiative and that makes for uh yeah all the cool uh cloud native things of today uh so i i suggest you to have a look at kate sandra if you are into kubernetes now i see a question uh is cql the only tool to access the cluster well no no in various ways one is that you have drivers for most programming languages so you can when you today we are using sql but in uh when you write your application you will probably use drivers which just will expose access to cassandra programmatically there's there's other answers here because on top of cassandra there is a layer that is also an open source project called stargate and this is able to this builds and a set of additional api layer on top of cassandra which makes it possible to access cassandra data in a rest way in a document data in a document api way grpc graphql you name it so there are actually very many ways to access and input output data in cassandra okay so let's have a quick look at the rest of this part so um let's have a look at how how is how data is structured and how you design your tables when you have an application in mind which is very much important okay so uh what is the main the most the fundamental unit of data in cassandra is a cell so we've been already speaking of tables and you can imagine what a cell is it is an intersection of a row and a column and it can store data let's say a string number or other double time date timestamp uuid so there are several kind of data types that cassandra supports when you when you have sell one by the other you will have a row and the row is just a slice of your table so a number a name as a family name and a department let's say several rows together will form a partition so um in cassandra we started by showing you that you this that you think of your table as split into partitions and the partitions are defined by it it was the country name so canada was all going to a node so a partition is just a group of rows that share the same values for the column that is the partition key so in this case department all three rows here share the same value for department and they will form a partition and they will always be stored together the storage is per row so every row will go to so rows are stored together the whole row and many rows are stored together if they have the same part value for the partition key and yes partition key can can become composite so it can be made by several columns and in some cases it is like that okay so and the the the outer layer above partitions is the whole table the table is made by partition and this is the general picture so you have this concept called key space which is a grouping of tables within a key space you have tables and every table is basically like a spreadsheet you can think of it as a spreadsheet so columns times rows but internally it's very important to think of a table as split into partition and every partition is guaranteed to be all together but different partitions might be on different nodes and that's important because that's not a detail a technical detail that you can forget and leave leave to the administrators but also as a developer as a data architect whatever you have to take that into account because when you model your data your tables when you design your tables you have to remember that different partition will be on different nodes and you will never want to do a query that has to ask data from several partitions at once because that would mean having to speak to several nodes in a query and that's very slow in general if your if your cluster is big that's very slow so uh you can already guess from here that if you design your your data your tables in the right way you will have you will design tables so that your queries will be always directed to a single node and that's the best that's the biggest point in in modeling your data okay so this is the syntax uh we already mentioned cql cql is the cassandra query language and it looks a bit like sql but don't be fooled because below that there is a whole different architecture i hope by now uh you are you are convinced of that but this is how we create a table so create table name and then uh column type column data type column data type and at the end primary key now this primary key at the end is the most important so it's the most it's the part i want to describe more in detail so this is how we are creating a table that will contain user information one of the columns is the city and you see there is this funny double parenthesis syntax here so when you create a table you have to define what is the primary key and a part part of the primary key is the partition key but let's go forward so okay we will come to this statement later so um okay this is something i mentioned quickly that when you create a key space you define a replication factor per data center so you can have it replicated three times in a data center five times in another one and zero times in another one that's something that we mentioned uh speaking of gdpr and similar data compliance but let's back let's go back to the the table creation so uh very much similar to what happens in a relational database you have something called primary key which is a selection of columns of your table and they are chosen to guarantee unicity of the rows so the primary key value the values of the primary key have to defer row by row you cannot have two rows with the same values for the primary key and which one to choose well it depends on your table so in particular when you define the primary key in general you specify a subset of the columns that is the partition key so look at this example primary key is city last name first name email which means that every row is a unique combination of of these four values so there there cannot be two rows with the same city same name same name and same email but in particular city here is the partition key it means that all so primary key is a logical way of describing the data but partition key is a way let me say physical is a way to define where physically the data will go which node will host the data and if since the partition key is ct now we are saying every all the rows from uh ottawa will go to the same partition will be on the same node all the rows from new york will go to the same partition same node and that's important again because we want the queries to be just going to a single node okay so the partition key i just explained that and there are so the partition key identifies the partition and it there has to be you cannot create a table without a partition key okay so um in general you have columns that are part of the primary key but they are not partition key that means that your partition will have several rows potentially and they will have the same partition key same city for example but different name and email that's okay and they are called so these additional columns that are not in the partition key but they still define uniqueness are called clustering columns and they actually are used to to decide the internal sorting the ordering of the rows within the partition now there are choices that you should avoid because they will not work so look at this example if you have a primary key that is city last name first name that's not good because if you think about it um what can happen so i want these to define uniqueness of rows but if i have city last name and first name don't you think there might be more than one john smith in new york probably there is probably there are many of them so that's not enough if i want to guarantee uniqueness that's not good because i might have different users which would have who would have the same values for all three so the right solution is to add another field in the primary key to make this a good choice of a primary key so different john smiths will have different email at least on a in a different way this video id comment id is not an ideal choice of the primary key but for a different reason that's because let's say we are building a youtube like of application so we want to sort we want to keep comments on videos in in a table but the id is a random looking uh string so since the clustering columns define sorting sorting the comments by their id doesn't make much sense so it's better to add creation date for example in the primary key so the sorting within the partition will be uh useful will make sense for us in our application okay so that's about partitioning there are some fit pitfalls to be aware of so remember that when you choose partitioning you are choosing which rows are going to be together in the same node so you have to make sure your partitioning uh keeps together rows that you want to retrieve together so your query will go to a single node straight and you will have fast queries on the other hand um okay so let's see this is a an example um you want to store together what you are going to retrieve together so in this youtube like application look at the first example the primary key is video id created at comment id all good all nice and in particular if i create the table in this way my first column is the video id in particular the partition key is video id that means that all comments for a given video will be together in the same partition and that's good because i can get all comments for the for a given video in a single in a single query in a single select and that's probably what is needed for my application while if i choose to partition this same table by comment id that hardly makes sense because i will be having a hard time retrieving all comments for a given video and that will really not work much on the other hand uh i have to make sure i'm not creating partitions that are too big because that might not work very well so even though so even though um look at the same so the the first example here video id created that comment id yes might work and it will work it's good because it groups together all uh comments for a given video and look at the second example that might theoretically even work but i would have a bazillion comments in the same partition because they are just grouped by country and there are a lot of them and i hardly need all of them at once so that's really not a good choice of partitioning and it might expose me to the risk of having a huge partition uh well that's not the only point maybe i can skip this point well okay i can it's a bit late so maybe we skip this point let's just mention that and a hidden danger is to have um partition that initially work well but then they pile up pile up more and more rows and at some point they become too large so there are solutions to this uh maybe very quickly i can invent synthetic fields and add them to to the partition key so to have to divide my partition in in blocks that are guaranteed not to grow indefinitely that's called bucketing but i have to skip a bit on that another danger is to avoid hot partitions so look at these examples i'm grouping items uh maybe it's still the video comments in this youtube application i can group them by user id for some reason that probably works i can group them by country but that's a very much a danger because there might be a lot of activity in a partition let's say the india or the us partition and not much activity in the vatican or the the partition which are smaller countries so i'm really not balancing the load on various partitions so on various nodes which means that i will have i will be not using the power of all nodes basically even if i have a lot of nodes there will still be a single node hosting the india partition which is probably having a lot of activity and that's what is called a hot partition i have a lot of read and writes going into a single node the node containing the partition for india and even if i have a lot of machines that's really not going to be spread so the load is not well balanced and that probably is a hint that i have to rethink my data model uh wait a second i wanted to explain a very important thing those slides have a slide of a year award for a reason yeah and let me explain uh why exactly the point is uh just aldrin h teen asked it a great question uh if i have a partition and later are the bucketing what happens to my old data you might have a slide about that because it's very important once your table is created and your primary key for this table is decided so partition key and clustering columns you can not change any parts of a primary key and if you find out what your partitioning was wrong you will have to create a new table and you will have to migrate all the data to a new table and that's quite a lot of work that's why we always enforce the idea but it's very very very important to think ahead of your data model and think ahead of your partitioning and once we that's why we call those slides the most important the slides of the year 2021 for you uh this year is almost over and i doubt you will see any more important slides uh in this year now this will be the winning those those going for the winners uh so yes migration is going to be painful so you have to really really thoroughly think ahead about your partitioning and data model and data module is something what stephanie will explain in the next slides yeah so there's a there there is a reason why you can't change the partitioning once the table is created the reason is that you might have a cluster made by 200 000 nodes several petabytes of data and if cassandra let you change the partition that means that every time this happens you can imagine how many pieces of data have to go around and your cluster will probably be just you know on on its knees it will be absolutely overwhelmed so the choice that cassandra takes to to make it possible to afford the huge amounts of data is that you have to think carefully of your data model before you create the tables and then you stick with it that's a bit of a extreme choice but it is uh the price to pay to be able to to reach very huge uh amounts of data and the the wonderful performance on that so uh let's create a table alex it's time for a bit of practice let's create the table i love it so you will now jump to your screen we will jump to my screen and we will answer so give me a second then all right okay so ladies and gentlemen we get to the second part of our lab as i said already you can do it with me right now on our completed later for the homework and for the page it doesn't matter just don't forget to make a screenshot of the last screen of the last step which comes in the next part of the lab actually not in this one so we created our cassandra database and now we want to work with the tables first at first we will navigate to a sql console and login to the database uh in this case that's very easy you basically just click to sql console and uh mostly probably you're already able to operate you can type a help command you can type a command describe key spaces and you will be good now our next step is going to be we want to ask to describe our key space so my key space i type describe command key space space catsandra the key space we created for this class nbc this command um the description of your key space create key space chatsandra with replication network topology strategy europe central one free and durable writes through what that's all mean that's what the command use it uh during the creation of the key space for us it uses network topology strategy for your application there are two replication strategies simple and network and simple is good for your laptop and bad for anything else a network topology strategy is for real production deployments because it keeps control of your replicas so replicas will be relocated as far away from each other as possible in the single server racks and the scene in the different availability in this different availability zones and different server racks uh to ensure they not fail together we are far away from each other then europe's central one is the data center we use it to deploy this one and it has a replication factor free and durable rights true which is out of scope for this workshop so if you want to know what the durable rights mean you have to go to the academy.datastax.com and take a course of cassandra that's way how you get yourself you get ready for your certification anyway now our next exercise and our next exercise is going to be describe key spaces we did that already and we see what we have some key spaces most of them are a system so they belong command manager to cassandra and now we are going to work with the key space we created uh for these uh exercise and that's going to be very simple i just type the command use chats and run and i can use tab to feel uh to autofill the end of a line so as you see i'm using now chat syndrome good that's key space i will create my tables now we are going to create a users table and this at this point we can execute a command to create user table we will just copy paste these uh simple table create table of not exist users email name password user id the first three lines will be type text and user id will be typed uuid universally unique identifier primary key will be email and now you can guess take a look if i execute an insert statement in this table and insert three different users with three different emails how many partitions i will have in this table please type your answer in the youtube chat meanwhile i am executing this query how many partitions we stable will have if i execute three different inserts with three different users emails and three different users and meanwhile raghavan asks is case space similar to a schema yes key space is similar to postgres schema and sagill animash and already others rakhavan are giving right answer three different emails make three different partitions yeah as many as the users correct correct correct thank you so much looks like you did a good job following us at this workshop that makes sense well done good okay so we just created a table it has partition key it doesn't have clustering columns which is totally fine now let's work and let's proceed we will ask to describe tables so we do it we've described tables command and i see what i have only one table users now i can ask to describe table users and you see the command which sql prints output is much longer the one what i've pasted actually i told you already there are 1 000 of different knobs and buttons and levers how you can consider configure your cassandra but in this case we use um actually we use it only the required one when we create at the table we define it a primary key all additional settings are optional and defined to just follow the default by the way if there are someone who works with plain open source apache cassandra maybe you have noticed the difference uh as you see uh astra db uses unified compaction strategy although modern cassandra version 4 doesn't use it it's not yet merged into the trunk so in this case astrodb is a little bit ahead of apache cassandra uh from the features but we don't speak about unified compaction strategy today anyway you can learn about that on our next events so we have our table described now we have users but that's not enough let us create a few more tables we will have two newer tables posts by user and posts by room stefano wow would you explain us why do we need two different tables for posts yeah well i can explain that in one word now and then it will be a bit more in the in the data modeling part as you wish yeah very quickly the point is that uh you might remember that i stressed a few times that uh you have to design your table so that the partitioning will support the query you want to do so in particular you want you always want to query a single partition at a time so let's say your application needs two different ways to get comments on to get to get post one is by user i want all post by user x and the other is by room so because this is a chat room this is a chat application with several rooms i want all posts by on that have been written on room x by anyone so uh these are two different and very much independent way of retrieving of retrieving posts and the right thing to do with cassandra is to create two tables with the same rows grouped differently that is to say partitioned differently and that's why in some cases the correct way to approach data model is i create two tables which are basically the same except different partitioning and then it will be my job as an application as an api or whatever to write to them uh some at once to keep them aligned that's the quickest answer i can come and uh i will say you know just it's in a little bit simpler manner don't forget our data is distributed that helps us to scale out but uh makes uh harder to get the data because we have multiple servers and we need to know which particular server to ask if he asks all the server together it's called full cluster scan and that's a very bad idea it's not going to work fast so when doing a query select statements we have always to specify partition key and if we are looking for messages by user we know user id but we don't know the rooms he wrote to so we can search by user id but we cannot search by room and if you search for all the messages within a room like this chart on the youtube well then we know the chat id but we do not know uh user ids and therefore we have we have to duplicate data here and now um question by aldrin einstein won't be duplicate data and answer is yes wait for it we explain it on the next slides uh but let's call it the normalization so we created those tables and let's take a look now i can describe tables again describe tables and oops i will see yes i have my tables users post by room posed by user well oops wrong program tab when we go we just created multiple tables and now uh we proceed with the next slides before we go with the write with operations okay let me switch the screen hey stefan are you ready yes i'm ready i'm i was trying to to give a few answers in the chat but i'm i will proceed i will proceed don't worry no no i'm i'm ready to jump to the data modeling part yes please yes now please pay your full attention if you want to fail with cassandra data modeling done wrong is the best way to fail with cassandra at ease viva style no with no style it's boring and that's difficult so don't do that be better than that so please pay attention because cassandra is powerful and it can give you very high performance but you need to get data model right because as any as with many powerful things it requires some responsibility so let's see how you model your data for an application with cassandra first thing is there is a concept called normalization that is a very illustrious and celebrated idea in designing databases and it has been in place for more than 50 years and it is the base of relational databases so you have relations basically you never duplicate any piece of data in your database every information is there only in one place and you have ways with ids basically and references and what kind of identifiers you have a way to embed relations between tables in a way that avoids every duplication of data and this is normalization very good very nice conceptually very cool actually but as the amount of data grows that starts to show its practical limitations because you start having a lot of joins a lot of complicated queries and the performance is suffering you can have queries that take a lot of time to execute and in today's world sometimes you just cannot afford that it's as easy as that so there is a counter idea of denormalization which is one of the basic ideas that is shared by most of the nosql databases and it basically says oh let's forget about normalization which is nice and mathematically very elegant but we want to to go fast so we just take the data duplication as an idea and we promote it as the founding idea so no problem if i am duplicating a piece of information no problem as you see in this sample table department so there are two different employees in engineering well i just write engineering twice no problem there is not a different table engineering departments and then an id here i just duplicate engineering so that's risky um some of you with a relational background might say that's risky yes in a sense but the point is that when i then want to retrieve employees i don't need any join so that's in in a nutshell that's the idea i don't need any join because i sort of resolved the joints at writing time so when i read i just read fast from a single table all the time i would like to spend more time on this point but probably we are a bit uh yeah we are a bit late so uh yeah but anyway i will require a second uh because it's a very important point it's a point probably here's many uh we were told for many many years in the universities on the courses and whatever what normalization is great and then normalization is wrong and that's not like that those are tools there's a good as long as you control them generalization is not like the dark side of a force which is bad by default we don't live in the star wars movie we were we live in the real life take a look when you work with a normalization it's great because you can with one single write update all the data because data is normalized you don't have redundancy you don't have redundant copies of your data one single right you get everything but when when you do select you have to go with joints and joints have two problems first they are slow and second they are double slow if your date is spread across hundreds of servers and finally the killer feature what kills the joints if you need a performance over big data idea is very simple you can execute joints only consequentially one by one by one if you have three four five joint statements if your statement in your select query you are going to have the executed one first only then second only when third on level and four from the fifth you cannot do them in parallel that's why they cannot be slow by desire they cannot be fast by design and that's get even worse on a big data on a distributed system on the quite opposite the normalization requires a redundancy of your data spread it over multiple tables so now you have to do multiple writes when you update the data but when you do a read you have to do only one single read with no joints you get all the data at once with a very simple query and now take a look that looks like a compromise uh solution compromise solution but the point is cassandra has extremely good right performance very good read performance as well but it has incredible right performance and ability to scale for rights and now notice that rick i cannot execute five joints at once i have to do it one by one by one but i do can execute five right at once in parallel and as a result the normalization is significantly faster and we are fighting for performance so our customers get their answers immediately yeah okay um just okay i wrote an answer about pagination and reading many many rows which yeah but generation basically works the same uh you have uh uh you have all the limit of set options so generation works exactly the same way yeah but still if the question is how to read a lot of rows and if that implies to read like all the table that's probably not the workload for cassandra itself you might want to use all up specific tools such as apache spark which is a very good solution coupled with cassandra and cassandra would act as a very resilient and strong backing data store but still cassandra itself is more all ltp oriented so okay yes we you can have autoretries at the driver level and there are pretty sophisticated ways to handle that uh you can configure them at driver level in your application code okay so let's go let's say let's say the normalization is now our friend we know that we can trust it as long as we are in control so let's assume we are in control and we go forward with what where does the normalization lead us well uh in the typical way you model your data to make your application run in a relational database you start by looking at the data you come up with the entity and relationships between them and then you design tables and there is basically a single way to create the tables the way that let me say uh reproduces the word and then with an arbitrary amount of joins you design the queries that suit your application right okay forget about this and let's think in a cassandra way which is basically the other way around because in a nosql in particular in the cassandra way you design the application you start with the application you start with your customers so what is the what are the workflows your customer will have in your application then you start by identifying these flows uh what are the needs of your customer what is the kind of interaction what are the pieces of interaction between your customer and the application these will make you design the proper queries because every type every single interaction with the application will be a query a particular query to get some data in a particular way and once you are equipped once you know the queries you can design the tables again because if you know the query you can then find the right way to partition data you can find the right column to put in the table and you can design the table accordingly all of these within the comforting blanket of denormalization so that's very broad broadly described now there is a there is a science behind data modeling there is a very well established workflow to approach modeling your data in cassandra to create the tables for your application and that's summarized by this uh work workflow here this flowchart you start with uh two things one is an entity relationship diagram much similar uh to what you would do for a relational database and at the same time you think of the queries you design you look at the application flow what are what is happening in your application and this makes you basically from this you extract the queries that will have to be run on the day on the data then mapping together those two things you can sorry you can end up with a logical data model so as basically every query will make it will become a table at least an id of a table then through a process of physical optimization you make you make everything a bit more precise you decide the data types you decide how to deal with a particular kinds of special kind of columns such as a column containing a set of strings or stuff like that you make your calculations to avoid running into partitions that are too large or ever growing or similar things and then magically you will have your tables in the form of create stable statements so very quickly um well the conceptual data model part which is one of the starting points in designing your data model is very similar to what you have seen in relational approach so you have entities which are bound by relationships and everyone every entity and relation has some attributes so we have in this case users videos user might comment on videos um a user has an email a video has a description a comment has a timestamp and a text itself and stuff like that okay so far so good then think of our uh ideal youtube clone application we start thinking of what happens when the user interacts with our application so for example the user might want to click on my profile and they want to see all of my comments but then the user might click on a video and they want to see all comments on that video and these two interactions with with the of the user with the application correspond to two different queries basically now they are here they are written as text so something like find all comments to a for a user based on its identifier most recent first okay very good this is basically a query right so indeed the next step is to do um mapping between those use cases those application flow items and make them become queries indeed this query becomes something like find all comments for a user with a non-id and that will become a table a table that we called comments by user which we'll still have to design but it will have to answer this question this query it will have to support this query and this is where choosing the partition is important because a similar query number two here find comments for a video this time and we need a different table even though the comments are the same so the rows in the two tables will be the same rows differently grouped differently partitioned and that's if you remember that was something you saw already in the practice part when you asked yourselves why am i creating two tables this is why indeed the second table called comments by video will contain the same rows but they will be partitioned probably by video id because they have to support that particular query and you remember that my query will always need to go to a single partition and get the data in the partition yes each comment will be written to both tables that's denormalization at play it's very much less expensive to take care at the application level of the double write than it is to have joints on the reading side of things and my application will be fast i will not lose customers at this very small price of having a bit more storage and a bit more attention when i write the application code okay so indeed these two queries are actual queries that i can express in cql language as you see here basically this is still an idea but we are almost ready and this is a process that involves the entity relationship diagram as well i'm ready to make them become ideas of table as you see here this is the logical data model and it is something that comes from comparing the queries and the entity relation diagram so these are this is a special notation called the chebotko diagram that makes uh it's easy to identify what is what are the columns in the table what is primary key what is partition key you see actually these two tables in the example have the same fields it's just different how the partitioning is done but anyway then a physical optimization takes place and then we decide that user id is a uuid data type i will gloss on it comment is text and similar choices so but now we are ready because basically the table has taken shape and we have our create table statements nice so this is a very brief account of how data modeling works but you see it's a process that starts from the application which is the cool part in a sense start from the needs of your user and ends up writing the tables to support the query and usually every query will need a single table but remember that storage is much less expensive than losing customers because your queries are slow and i see a lot of cool questions and i think i've seen also alex you are uh lightning and you're managing to answer all of them maybe very good so um we are now at the point where you can play a bit with the table reading data inserting data changing data and deleting data which are the basic operations so i will give it over to alex for the practice yep okay so yeah we have a great question by vierphan talani uh how do you how will it make sure data is consistent between two tables and a short answer you can use batches cassandra or batches for cross table consistency but in short you now have to care about a cross-table consistency application layer a layer and in general that's not really makes me happy but we have to admit what cassandra enabled developers get a better salary and obviously there is more work for me to do but i can survive that as long as i get my money so that's okay uh okay so let me switch it back to my screen and we go to the next exercise [Music] yeah so we are getting to the step 3 and that's going to be almost the last question almost the last step we do today uh that's going to be create a part of the creation so insert data and search users we have some tables so now we are going to fill them that's done with the insert statement we will start by inserting three different users and you know already that will make three different partitions uh what's going on please don't leave the site okay so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to insert those three users those statements are basically the same uh i will make it clear and i will paste these data users will be a little bit different so now we can make a select statement and oh okay we are still inserting no you know what i want first to read uh so i will do uh select all select all is a bad idea don't be like me don't do that in production select all in this case you may have tons of columns that's definitely not what you want to have but for these purposes i will make it select all from users boom and okay i get my data looks like it was stuart and we are good by the way notice how uh cassandra highlights uh scout sql highlights your data email is red because it's a partition key and name password and user id are purple i'm not so good with a color sorry name password and user id are purple mostly probably because they are data columns good so now we are going to put some data to put some posts first we will go with the posts by user table and let me run this command boom and second we will post by room table so i will simply copy paste it i will put it here okay so normally then you execute a query into two different tables uh one query insert interposed by user second one in insert post by room you can use batch i know i won't use that in this case for the simplification let's say it's a little bit more advanced so now we are going to read these data uh i will go with a simple statement i will just make select all from posts by user i see those uh posts and now notice one statement is read one is cyan blue and room id and text are purple that's because room id and text are data columns you know that already user id is a partition key partition column and post id is clustering column you know that already okay so well well what we are going to do next uh now we can try to gather some data from posts by user table okay so what i will do i run the query select post id room id text from post by user the user id blah blah blah blah blah i get my data i have the user id of written uh in disposed by user as a partition key and therefore i can retrieve data from post by user table but now take a look what will happen if i do the same statement by posts by roon wait for a second and think what do you think will happen if i execute this query to the post by room table wait wait think think think i hope you came up with something because now i'm executing this query and boom there are some red text what kinda means what something wrong happened let's take a look at what's going on i will make it even a little bit bigger for you invalid request okay thank you error from server code 2200 invalid query invalid query but you know what query is perfectly valid message cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and fuss may have unpredictable performance if you want to execute with query despite the performance and predictability use a low filtering take a look if i add this statement in the end now my query is executed isn't that amazing hey stefano i think i have to do it with all of my queries yes you solve the problem let's put a lot of filtering in production and call it a day yes yeah yeah sure so uh basically no what happens yeah don't do it what happens when we say allu filtering we insist on cassandra doing full cluster scan and what is it in real life i don't know about you but when i order pizza i specify my full address the city the street the house number right and uh forcing cassandra to do select without specifying uh the key the partition key like room id in this case it's like to order repeats without specifying your house number and then a poor delivery person will have to knock every door on your street and ask maybe if pizza was ordered from here it is as stupid as it sounds but you are smart you won't do that so take a look first ever the only thing you need to know about a low filtering do not use a low filtering second thing you need to know about a low filtering do not use a low filtering and the third thing you need to know about hello filtering if you see someone in your team using a low filtering please stop it because it's the best way to craft your cluster performance to the ruins and you don't want to have it so do not use allow filtering well we are going further on this step and now we are going to get some data okay so we got this post by room table data uh and of course we can get some data with them uh paused by room specifying the room id so how do you how do i adjust this uh query so it will be working i have to specify not user id but i have to specify room id right so i will go for it and i will do room id equals let's say running running uh where did i do the mistake select post id room id text from post by room where room id [Music] okay that was simple double quotes again that hit me again and again okay so this time the query works without any um hello filterings and basically we are all good so we get our data and the final thing we want to do since we used the time view id for our post id field and we still need to know the time of the post was created we will use a function date off to extract the timestamp from the time uuid so i will grab this thing and i will paste the statement and we are getting this post date which doesn't exist in the table but now exist in the output because i use a date off and now i have the date cool so we are done with that part are there any good questions yeah there is a very good question but i'm right i'm answering in the chat but maybe yeah so what happens if two batches update a record like total amount and well the answer is uh that's a very good question andrea the answer is that this is a very particular use case where you want to do what is called a compare and set application um a query so it's a special kind of query that actually involves some kind of transaction a micro transaction it's called lightweight transactions those are possible in cassandra and they have they come with a performance cost because they necessarily involve some sort of coordination and they might they have you have to use them when you when you need them but not more than that because otherwise you are killing your performance but yes there are some cases where you need to coordinate access to a row like total amount indeed and you can do them so you can serialize the operations on on such on such a row okay right so now we are going to update datum so to change something and now we are going to change something so this case we will update posts by user uh and specify new text and notice what now we have to specify both user id and post id why uh answer is we must specify user because user is a partition key and we cannot execute query without specifying a partition key and then we have to specify post id because if you want specify post id this text will be applied to all records in this partition so that's why we specify partition key and clustering key so let's do that i will run these posts by users and select the data from it and we see what it was updated successfully well not a big surprise next one uh we will insert some more data now that's important to understand in cassandra as it uses absurds if you're familiar with for example you know this concept algorithm update and insert are the same moreover i will tell you even delete is the same but that's a special secret if you want to learn it how come delete is the same as update and insert when you will have to go to the academy.datastucks.com to learn how it works internally and why delete is the same as update so we are going to write these data but this time i will use insert instead of the update and we will see how it looks like and i'm executing this statement and we see what there are not a new uh row added but instead of that this row was a change of this one aaa row was changed to and mount goomba was not so easy uh why i told you in certain update from cassandra post a few uh poor point of view ah mostly the same cool so what do we go well last thing left for us is to delete the data uh delete the data is basically we are doing that if uh delete statement so that's not a big surprise so we can do these uh statements and i will clean it up a little bit and now execute them so we can walk back through it and see how it was executed so we select we do delete we do select on uh posts by room we have four strings here and then we do delete from post by user like user decided to delete delete his posts and we delete and we delete and they get the results finally in the end posts were deleted so quite predictable uh one very important point which will be explained at the academy but in short if you want to delete everything from a table you better not do delete but truncate so you can totally do um truncate table post by user and it will result okay i don't have any users anyway and uh that will be like that table is empty of course but this way deletion is more optimized if you have to wipe out your whole table of course um there is a question great question by sajal gayala are the rollbacks that's amazing question and take a look uh in short answer is no for a very simple reason uh if you have like some theoretical uh knowledge in this field you uh know already what any kind of transactions especially transactions what require rollback ah require locking optimistic locking pessimist pestimistic locking but anyway there are there are some parts of a table or even a wall table to be locked as long as transaction is not executed as long as your database feeds to a single machine and as long as your data feeds to a random access memory it can work and it can work lightning fast but then your data is spread at over dozens hundreds maybe thousands of servers any attempt to execute a lock and without lock rollback is not possible we will basically destroy any performance of your cluster and cassandra was designed to support highest level of the performance like very single uh digit millisecond performance over petabytes of data basically you cannot afford any kind of logs over this data otherwise it will be destroyed so um short answer is no you do not have rollbacks in cassandra there is a way to do read before write and do not execute insert or update or delete statement in case you don't want it to be executed it's called lightweight transactions but even in this case we do not speak about rollbacks we are speaking about checks before rights which is very different concept which doesn't require locking okay so it was great question by the way now we are done and i'm switching screen back to stefanos right thank you so i have to say i've been looking at the chat and congratulations because there are a lot of very interesting questions today so it's been a very cool discussion going on as an aside but i hope in the meantime you've been able to ride through the crowd operations with alex because that's the basics how to interact with the cassandra on the cql with the secure language so it's all very cool and i hope you you had fun uh the fun is actually about to start because we've been go we've been done with the theory we we are done with the practice and now it's time to play all right okay so ah you know what i have and i'm switching back to my screen somebody asks me if i am in any way related to lionel messi and no if you see me play football you you know that the answer is no but funny thing many years ago i was in a german pub and i was mistaken by messi by a group of very convinced drunken germans who went as far as to ask me for an autograph [Laughter] unbelievable nice okay it was nice yes sorry yeah that's quite cool story you didn't tell it before okay 10 years ago so uh well well well well well well well so let's take a look we go now to that this what does that matter it means what we go for a game and in this game uh we ask you the questions you answer if you do it fast enough and if you give right answers you have chances to win the prizes and that's amazing so let me see uh if i we have 70 people on youtube and we have uh 74 people on main team that's okay if you are not with us on 90 then jump up right now you won't have a lot of time go to mandy.com and enter the code 8306 2966 or scan that qr code next to stefano and we start in a moment please uh pay attention don't miss a word and tom regarding the certification don't worry we will say a word about that after that piece so i'm about to start and that's going to be uh quiz time with alex and stefano and we are getting to the first question oh yeah just a few seconds i am giving everyone a chance to join now please notice youtube has a slight delay so if you want to have higher chances to win to to answer fast focus on your mobile phone or whatever you use to open mendy okay yeah and we are go i hope you are ready so answer fast to get more points how many master notes does cassandra cluster need at least three per cluster a free per data center enough to maintain consistency not a single one cassandra is decentralized okay question number rises quickly and time is up so how many master nodes does cassandra cluster need right answer not a single one cassandra is decentralizing the very concept of a master does not exist in cassandra cassandra is a true democracy it doesn't need any masters and answered three pair plaster is definitely wrong so let me see the leaderboard hey thomas was the fastest uh and kelvin following and hina pankaj is also very very close but the battle of battle only begins so we have more questions for you now it's going to be question number two so get focused and answer my question answer first to get more points how data is being distributed in a cassandra cluster all data is replicated to each server by partitions range of partitions per node with address locators using their post mail chat is so quiet everyone is focused on mentee totally makes sense totally makes sense and time is up so sir data is rep distributed by partitions range of partitions per node it's not like all data is replicated to each server take a look apple handles hundreds petabytes of data uh bankrupt good luck with that good luck coming all data to each server uh they will go back even apple would go bankrupt doing things like that it just doesn't work by partitions and each server is responsible for the range or partitions for part of the partitions okay who made a mistake and who is fast enough to get on top of the leaderboard looks like thomas wasn't faster speeds time and kelvin takes over but sai uh some path karumudi was the fastest getting directly to a fourth place that's quite cool and andreas cars holds the third place well well well well question number three i hope you learned it what to do answer fast to get more points which replication factor is recommended i told you a couple of times today already well but mostly in a chat so those who read the chat will have higher chances i also said that a few times okay everyone has a chance that's good that's good which replication factor is recommended time is up and the answer is green and that was quite simple no one votes for 15 or even 42 which said but that's an interesting option of one point half server it's like 1.5 uh beat or something like i cannot really imagine that well the half server would probably not work depending which direction it has been sliced but you know that does not work in cassandra version 4 actually there are cheap quorums with transient replication we can partially relate it to 1.5 server actually i've just realized yeah in a sense a bit of a stretch however yes good so keen up and catch gets to the first place and that's a great performance and sai sam puff is on the second with kelvin on the third thomas was fastest again uh fastest train on the planet you know the fourth place which is still very good and only six points difference to the third place but only third for first second and third place uh places are getting the prizes so thomas keep fighting and we have mars here god of war so that's going to be interesting and we still have a lot of question and that is ladies and gentlemen question number four so answer fast to get more points what is astra db is it maybe a gateway to a stars is it a local in-memory version of apache cassandra is it a cassandra as a service in the cloud or maybe it's a development tool like your ide what is it yeah chat is totally quiet absolutely everyone has another that's good yeah astrodb is a cassandra in the service in the cloud it is not a local in memory version of cassandra is a cloud persistent version of cassandra for sure and it's not a development tool that is for sure good so any of the leaders to make a mistake no our leaders are doing well so i see varun had great questions today thank you varun for the great questions i'll dream now some familiar names animesh oh cool and thomas is fastest again jumping to second place this time right between hina and psy with kelvin on the fourth place something is going to change after this one and that is question number five so answer fast to get more points what is a primary key same as partition key it's the main house key does not apply to no sql databases uniquely identifies a row it is a column in the partition key okay time is almost over and i hope we stress this point enough let's see well still those with the best results will get their price and yes it's uniquely identifies a row it's not the same as a partition key it can be the same as a partition key but actually uh partition key is just a part of a primary key it's not the same show me a leaderboard there should be someone doing mistakes but none of our leaders made it so all of the leaders answered correctly kelvin was the fastest jumping to the third place and moving side some path down to the fourth well is still able to fight for the first three fight on the top position on the leaderboard good so let us move on that's a clause uh that's that's a tight fight like everyone is close and there are many people who are ready to jump right on the top three of a leaderboard question number six so to get more points answer fast what is the partition key then is that a consecutive number applied to each new record maybe it is a designated field in your table to partition your data is it an optional table field for optional partitioning or maybe it is the key to partition this reality from the next oh i like like is it something like yeah sci-fi but most of you made it partition key is a designated field in your table to partition your data and that's the right answer it is not optional it's required and it's not a consecutive number because take a look you can afford consecutive ids and consecutive numbers like in postgre or mysql if you have a single host database but when you have a dozen of servers or maybe hundreds of servers they all will have to agree which number is next just issuing an id will take a minute maybe so that's not what you want to have if your distributed database yeah on a large scale distributed system the least thing the thing you really don't want is unnecessary communication and coordination between nodes so no sequence is there in cassandra no sequences available right well then how is going it with my leaderboard no one made a mistake they are too good it's really a race to the millisecond here next time we have to make it complex here thomas says back hard we want harder questions yeah we need to have harder questions now the fight for the first three places is still hard and hey by the way uh hello rakhavan welcome to the top 10 with the fastest answer this time that's already great now next one and that's going to be question number seven so we are almost on the finishing line answer fast to get more points executing select query without the partition key is the recommended way to receive data the right way if the data was inserted without a partition key a way to full cluster scan are illegal and punishable by loan we have i'm paying very much attention to the answer to this question right right right you know if a lot of people will give the wrong answer we will be fired yes at least we deserve to be please okay so most of you gave the right answer executing select vary without a partition key is a way to full cluster scan great news we can keep our job and that's totally thank you guys there are five people answer it it's illegal and punishable by law and it's not sadly but it should be so i'm totally with you and it should be legal and must be punishable by law i'm with you guys i believe it's it is the right answer and data cannot be inserted without a partition key and partition key cannot be now so you cannot insert data without a partition key and it's for the 100 not recommended way to retrieve data well well well well well well well well well you know oh fire by wow mouse vendor for miss clicking no sequel police is after you run many a b in the nosql police i can be very good in it as an investigator to make interrogations were you using a law filtering in your last project no no we found the traces of a love filtering on your fingers okay this one's great sounds nice oh guys you make me laugh so hard it might make a small movie on that yeah right that's a great idea no sequel police bad boys bad boys what you gonna do well then so a leaderboard one step before the end and there are no huge changes but there are some thomas was the fastest uh well good job that's a second place hina keeps the third kelvin is on the first but with a minor difference raghavan made it to the eighth place already good job and uh green is on the sixth place now the last question last question defines everything i bet uh the leaderboard over top 10 is really really nervous now maybe some of the winners maybe some of the top three of the leaderboard will make a mistake it happened yesterday and it can change everything yes well well well now now even i am now a little bit nervous and i know the answer the air is electric now right right right so electricity so question number eight and i'm starting the countdown transfer fast to get more points in the data modeling framework we start modeling with conceptual data model and application workflow physical data model logical data model copy paste from stock overflow well stack overflow is a good friend to all the developers but in this particular case i wouldn't trust frank speaking yeah you're giving away boom let's see okay so most of you made it right physical data module is the last step and logical data model is a one step before physical data model but we start with conceptual data model so entity relationship diagram and application workflow so workflow diagram and we get to that none of the leaders made a mistake and hina was a little bit faster than kelvin but there are no changes on top of the leaderboard kelvin makes the first place thomas ii and hina pankaj the third now leaders please make a screenshot of your top player of your place and send it to jack fryer at jack.fryer datastax.com uh we will uh show his email in a moment congratulations to beginners i sent i put the email already in the youtube chat just for reference yep thank you so uh if you are on top of the leaderboard first three places we do congratulate you it was a great fight and if you are on the leaderboard you still have a solid reason to be proud of yourself because it was uh quite a competition of dozens of people and you're still on the leaderboard and if you are not on the leaderboard still don't take it too serious first we do workshops every week so you have chances to win your prizes next week and yeah well you know what really matters is your knowledge knowledge is what makes you better knowledge is a true power and today you learned something new which made you better in what you are doing that will help you get better job better job position better job title better salary so that sounds quite good to me even if you didn't want the prices from data starts yeah i will open the window to get your feedback what did you like the most in this workshop what should we improve and i will keep this window open so you can write your answers afterwards but now we switch to the very last slides of stefan oh yes please by the way there is a question what is exactly in the gifts and i'm afraid i'm not sure because there is some rotation of the gift it's probably well there should be a t-shirt probably a mug i don't know exactly what some data stacks um swag for sure yeah i don't remember uh maybe knows he can explain in them okay i'm switching to your screen and by the way thank you for your amazing feedback that so that's very yeah yeah that's very nice perfume transforming yeah okay so you are on the screen okay thank you so um okay again the three of you who made it to the first three positions in the game please send a screenshot of your winning screen to jack fryer and he will get back to you to arrange for the swag but let's go back to topic so you've seen tables partitions data modeling a lot of stuff about cassandra and what's next you might wonder well first thing please go ahead and complete the homework which is some exercises in the readme plus go into these two interactive scenarios and play with them do the practice you will learn even more about data modeling and cql take a screenshot of the final congratulations screen and get ready to go to the submission form and give them all to us and wait a few days for us to grade the homework and give you your nice well-earned badge now that's not the end of the story because you might want to visit datastax.com for even more information more stuff about cassandra developing application data modeling all stuff administration whatever and there are also other hands-on scenarios to experiment to do practice in your browser and a lot of stuff um now something that we already mentioned data stocks is very happy to sponsor your education and your certification so we want you to get apache cassandra certified and to do that to all of you who attended today's workshop we are offering a voucher to go and take the exam for free and get certified now that means that doesn't mean you don't have to study because there is some learning to do otherwise the the certification [Music] would have not have the value it has but still the exam itself which is uh which has a cost is uh on us so please go to this link the dtsxio workshop voucher i might drop it here as well go there and you will be able to don't find it here no alex can you can you paste it into the youtube chat please the workshop voucher link yeah sure easy to copy and paste thank you um so you will be able to get your voucher and that will give you a chance to take the exam for free um that's about the academy and just a quick mention there will be there are three different learning paths in the academy one more aimed at developers one aimed at administrators and then there is also another one on kate sandra which is as i mentioned time ago kubernetes distribution of apache cassandra so yeah so the academy will offer you courses for free there is a common part uh general fundamentals of apache cassandra that that goes more in depth on what we saw today basically and then there are various specializations depending on your learning path and then you will be able to take the exam for free okay so what's coming next because you know we run workshops at least one usually two per week so next week there is a very cool uh workshop about building an e-commerce application so you are invited to go to datasets.com workshops register because it's going to be fun trust me cool and fun um but even more even more important next month that is during the full month of january we will have a boot camp a four episodes bootcamp that will uh guide you through the whole process from introduction to cassandra which will be mostly today's content all the way to building and designing an application and that's going to be cool and it will give you a lot of knowledge and practical know-how to be able to start your own application and by the way when you start writing your application and dealing with apache cassandra and using it we would love to hear back what you did because we are obviously very interested in looking what is the the usage of cassandra out there and we are always proud to showcase if you agree to showcase what you are going to build so the best thing to do is you connect with us on discord maybe and we will we would love to hear what you are building or to guide to give you guidance and or help or whatever might come up that being said please subscribe to our youtube channel and have a look at datasets.com workshops to get informed of the many workshops we are running because we do stuff on application development various languages various technologies and obviously nosql databases as well so another thing is that we have this discord channel i mentioned already so dtsxio slash discord please join us because that is where most of the most of the discussion is going on especially for long-term help and assistance and chat whatever if we want to get to know each other better so join us and i think with the final plea for subscribing",
