video on databases and enjoy a nice edm track we'll get started here soon [Music] me [Music] and welcome everybody to our cassandra certification workshop today i'm david jones joined by david chung hello david chung hey david and hello everybody welcome hello hello now if for those of you who are joining us today hi ayan and hello gordon a go to moore hey evening yes we we do also realize it's not the morning for everybody or the afternoon it's evening so good good to all of good day to all the time zones um but if you can hear us loud and clear give us a thumbs up in the chats let us know that everything sounds good hello baboo good to see that animal yeah yeah the email those just went out today let's say good morning high pratik all right i see oh good there we go i was looking for those thumbs up thank you so much okay good we always like to check that to make sure things are working well from that standpoint all right so let's go ahead and get into it first thing we're going to do today is we're going to go to mendy.com because now if you've been with one of us or if you've been with us in one of our workshops before then you're probably already familiar with mentee but come you know for this workshop instead of us doing just a swag quiz then we're actually going to use mentee throughout the whole thing today um so let me go ahead and pop over to menti let's get you the screen so you can see the code to either scan the qr code with your phone or go to mendy.com and the code is down there at the bottom three seven two one three nine oh five there is no software today iron um this is gonna be pretty much us with lecture and um uh and you doing questions so really you're gonna be in the mentee and if you would once you get the mentee give us a thumbs up let us know you're in there and we'll see these showing up down here in the corner i'll put this back up for you and we'll take a look at the stream just make sure we're going well okay yeah and we will we will definitely address some of those questions cassandra just so you know is the there's no sql database that's um so for the for the cassandra certification right you will totally learn about what cassandra is but it is the nosql distributed database that we are talking about for the cert okay and i see some thumbs up coming in i see a heart thank you for the heart you can give a heart if you want all right now again uh you know for let's see we have we have like 60 something of you in here so i'm just looking for a couple more of those yeah oh i see some of the thumbs up change to hearts it's very sweet of you we appreciate that let me go ahead and put the again we'll put the screen back up so you can uh either go to mentee.com let me put the code in for you mentee.com it's three seven two one zero there's that there you go again use that qr code oh ayan when i say menticode so the the system that we're going to use today for you to do all the questions and everything is going to be in menti so notice the link i just dropped that menti.com and there's that code with the numbers down here 3721 3905 this is the code i'm talking about so when you go to menti.com then it'll ask you for a code you put that code in it'll bring you to the mendy while we're just waiting okay i'll give it just another minute for everyone to get into the mentee uh babu uh asks how many weeks on average will it take to prepare for the certification um so it really depends depends on where you're starting at in your learning path if you're absolutely new to cassandra compared to if you've had some times i'm just going to make a basic assumption that we're talking that that you're absolutely new um i would say that it's probably going to take a couple weeks at least right um you know david i i know you might want to pipe in there uh to go through the academy courses and go through all the materials and get comfortable with it i would i would say a couple weeks definitely i don't know david what do you think yeah we uh when we walk people through that through the academy courses and it takes two courses to prepare for the dev exam and two courses to prepare for the admin exam so one overlaps so you get double duty out of that it takes about three to five weeks depending on how much time you want to spend yeah doing the self-paced assignments that's really the decision yeah that's the that is the deciding factor right if you don't do those and you stick with the videos and the quizzes it take a couple weeks but if you if you really get into it especially in the admin side yeah it would definitely take a little bit more time and in sm i see any coding programming or activity today no we're not going to happen is we're going to explain the process of how you go through um to go go through the process of getting your certification taking the exams all the resources you need we're gonna go through a whole set of practice questions we're gonna have 20 practice questions they are not taken out of the exam otherwise it'd be kind of uh you know a little bit of cheating there but they are every bit is true to the kind of questions that you can expect to get in the real exams and the whole point of this today is to help prepare you just to figure out a little bit more about you all uh first one is how much experience do you have with the patrick cassandra oh you can you know that's a great question you should be able to sm attend this mobile you can do mentee mobile and you can watch this on youtube mobile so that'll be kind of an interesting test case you want to let us know how it goes all right so it looks like the vast majority of folks have never used it before now um and that's fine that's exactly why we do these now we will ask you questions don't be shy right for some of the questions we may have to defer you a little bit to either some of the resources we're going to give you or to one of the other workshops because we for the time that we have we do have to kind of go to a pretty good clip but ask your questions we totally understand that many of you are not very familiar with cassandra right so some of these you may not know the answer just go ahead and give an answer you're not being you know we're quizzing you here but it's not being like you're really quizzed you know you're not being really tested today this is just for practice so you're totally safe with answering whatever all right so you've been to any of our workshops before i know i see some of our regulars that are here today reckoning is sm let's see oh we have a bunch of folks who've been to workshop before wow look at that this is usually this is totally flipped i've never seen this before usually usually it's we have a lot of new folks and mostly um uh mostly folks you know like you know a handful that have been to our workshops before i've never seen this well hello everybody has been one of our workshops thank you for coming back and welcome to the new folks and then what motivates you to get certified you know while everyone's answering this one i can definitely say that if you get a certification a cassandra certification that is totally something to put on your resume right now if anything um we have we see more and more companies like cassandra's pretty widely adopted something like 90 percent of the fortune 100 companies are all using cassandra um you know things that if you pull up your phone i guarantee you have at least one app someone's using cassandra um spotify apple series sony playstation mcdonald's is in there starbucks is in there um home depot blows a bunch of the banks like i mean it just goes on and on and on um the key thing though and why why i'm kind of mentioning this is because one of the things that we hear over and over and over is that many companies like they have adopted cassandra but they would adopt it more they just need more people who actually know how to work with cassandra so there's kind of a shortage of professionals and experts on cassandra so this is a really good way to help get your foot in the door potentially for a job or something like that and sm do we have to pay for the certification now i'm going to talk about all this um that's where the vouchers come in so let me get through some of the material we're going to talk to all of that so for any of you who have questions about the vouchers about him thank you for asking that sm about the vouchers or about how that's going to work we're going to get into that here in a moment all right awesome thank you for answering those questions so what i'd like you to do now leave your mentee open because we're going to do all the practice questions and stuff with the mentee right so we're going to come back to this to definitely leave that open all right all right now the first thing i'd like to do is drop all of you the github repo that we're going to work out of now since so many of you have been with us before um here's the repo you're used to most likely um there we go um you're used to most likely you know where we do some lecture and then we get into some exercises and everything it's a little bit different here this repo is really more for information um so this is if you have questions as we're going through the material like um you know on the vouchers or like what's the the process for the exam we're going to talk about all that but all that information is also in the repo so every link everything you might need even the practice questions by the way are also in the repo so so this is just kind of a resource for you to use that way later on if we're not doing the session you're like oh i don't remember what they said here go to the repo the repo will have your answer sm is the certification real like we'll get it's yes if you pass your your certification exam this is a real cassandra certification um that is accepted out in in the world as as being yes you are either developer admin cassandra certified um so can it help you get better jobs it can it can totally help you get your front the door right you know if you go um i'm obviously i can't speak for the companies that are hiring but i know if i was looking for cassandra professionals i saw somebody had that certification then yes i would look at them a little bit you know i would definitely put a little focus on that person knowing that they've gone through that and they've they've passed their certification okay all right all right so let's get into the agenda so the first thing i'm going to do very quickly is we're just going to go over what certifications are available and what resources you have for those certifications and then we're just going to briefly go over the steps the steps aren't really that bad again the steps are all lined up in the repo that i just gave you um so again if you missed something from the slides or whatever like that you can just go to the repo and check it out then once we do that we're gonna actually get into the practice questions the majority of what we're gonna do today is go through each of the sections with practice questions now you're going to find that there are two different types of certification exam for cassandra there's the developer and admin and there's crossover between them so the ds-201 the foundation piece is relevant to both if you're going to take the development side or the admin side you're going to need those regardless once you get into 210 the admin that's more specific to the admin and 220 with data modeling is actually more specific to the developer certification i would say though across the board we only have a handful of the 210 and 220 the majority of what we're going to do today is in the foundation which both need right so i would i would go through all of them with us today and then we'll finish up with just a couple extra resources yeah and sm what do we need to enter the exam i'm going to talk about all that right now let's see um harsh is there any expression of the certificate no the certificate itself if you if you pass the exam and you get your certificate that does not expire right um the only thing that might come into play is cassandra 4 is getting released this year and there's going to be a new certification for that but that will not invalidate this certification so once you get this it doesn't expire or anything like that right and david the the certificate the certification will say cassandra 3 or the future cassandra 4 what etc but it doesn't actually expire that's right that's right okay so let's take a look at which certification should you get right as i mentioned there's two there's the administrator certification and then there's the developer certification what's the difference here's what it boils down to if you're planning to operate maintain install or run a cassandra cluster the administrator one is probably for you if you are planning to use cassandra maybe you're an application developer and you're going to use cassandra in the back end or you're a data architect or you're you know a designer or something like that but you're not really planning to run the cluster of the database you're not planning to operate and install it but you're planning to use it the developer certification is most likely for you now is there anything limiting you from doing both no it depends on your time it depends on your interest depends on your particular needs so you can you can do one you could do both totally up to you um but again admin is really for those people who are looking to run and operate cassandra the developer one is for mostly application developers and folks looking to use cassandra so what resources do you have um there's actually a ton here um uh matter of fact constantine asked the question are certifications characterized or you know for example should i pass developer before administrator no uh each one is standalone you can do in them in any order totally up to you yeah so from a resources standpoint there's a whole set of resources here um the link at the top that data stacks dot com slash dev certifications um really that's kind of a one stop shop that's gonna list out if you go there it's going to list out all the various things it's similar to what's going on in the repo that we dropped um it's it's through the datasex.com site um and that will that will bring you to all the recent resources that you need right so if anything that's actually a really good place to start is slash dev certifications the github repo you see there on the bottom left is the repo we're working out of today and then finally on the bottom right there you see that academy.datastacks.com we should just go ahead and drink or drink not drink drop that link academy academy.datastax.com i'll go ahead and drop that uh the kate sanders certification isn't you know that's a separate one uh david i don't know if you want to talk to that one at all um but that's not that's not the focus that we're working on today um david is there anything though that you want to talk about with kate sandra yeah in invest car about the kate sanders certification we do have a recorded a workshop like this one on the kate sanders certification so if you search on the datastax developers youtube site you'll find that workshop where we go over the same idea but focused on that that special certification yeah and uh pratik what's the cut-off score to clear the exam 70 you need to pass it with 70 you're going to find that the questions the way we do things today is geared for that same 70 we're gonna kind of test you there okay um and then on the left hand side here if you've got questions uh regarding your you know your own cassandra installations or follow-up you're going through academy and you're like hey i'm running into something or i don't understand something community.datasex.com is like stack overflow for cassandra that's a great place to go ask your questions especially questions that are dealing with like hey i've got this data modeling exercise or hey i'm working on my cluster here um because that's a good really great place for like long form questions on the right hand side if you're not there already um and so many of you been with us before then you're probably more of the discord channel we really suggest to take a look at the discord channel the reason why is because once we're done session the youtube chat stops but the discord does not right so if you've got those follow-up questions or whatever then the discord channel is a really great place to to go and look at that by the way these links and everything the slides themselves are actually in the repo um you'll find them in the slides and you'll find these links in the repo as well so no one's expecting you to like have to take screenshots or something like that okay so the steps so the first thing here as i mentioned is datasacks.com certifications you really want to read through the material there and get yourself familiar with what to expect especially in the exam rules in the process section i'm going to show that to you here in a moment but it's really important that you if you understand upfront what is expected of you the exams are in fact proctored you can take them at any time 24 7 but when you go to take your exam somebody is actually going to be online with you watching you and and everything right and there are a whole list of items that you need to be aware of things like you can't have a second monitor you can't have your phone handy where you can see it you can't be talking to other people while you're taking the exam you cannot get up from your desk or wherever you're taking the exam right so those are things that are really good to know up front and they're all covered in the exam rules and process process section um one thing i'm definitely going to point out make sure you go to the bathroom before you take your exam because you cannot get up from your desk i learned that the hard way um so you don't want to do that don't repeat my mistake um but yeah the key thing here is just to make sure that you do take a look at the site and in particular the exam rules and procs process before you take your exam so there's no surprises then choose a learning path like we said before you can choose either administrator developer you can do both it's totally up to you your particular needs and your time these learning paths by the way are an academy i'm going to show you academy and everything that we're going to present to you today all the resources everything is free right so all the learning materials everything is completely free you don't have to worry about like going through a pay wall or anything like that so i'll show you how to get to one of these learning paths in academy here in a minute and then if you haven't done it already go to daystacks academy sign up again it's free and then you'll you'll be given all of the resources material and there's more in there than just the courses that cover uh the exams so you can spend all sorts of time there's all sorts of videos and you know vms if you want to go through the material like that you know quizzes you could take all that kind of thing now some of you have been asking about certification there's actually a couple different way i'm sorry vouchers there's a couple of different ways to get vouchers it's up to you and how you want to do it one way to get your voucher and the voucher i should i should just point out what those are right so as part of today and if you go through the learning pads you can get yourself a voucher that will give you two free attempts at the certification exams the exams cost 145 dollars per attempt but with these vouchers you'll get two free attempts right so it's important that you get your voucher now one way you can get it today is if you're with us to the end of the session we will drop a form at the end you fill out the form and then with that you know you you use the same email that you registered for today and stuff and you can get a voucher that way another way you can get a voucher is you finish one of the learning paths in academy once you complete the learning path you'll see it checks your progress and everything like that once you complete one of those then you send an email and this is in the repo it's in the information you send an email to academy datastax.com let them know that you finish one of the learning paths and then you can get a voucher that way so there's multiple ways for you to get a voucher something else about the voucher you should know again you get two attempts but you need to use up those attempts before getting another voucher and you're limited to a max total of two vouchers that actually gives you four attempts right so you'll get today we'll give you the ways to get a single voucher that means you get two attempts and and that means you could take one exam pass it wonderful now you have another you have another you know another one left that another attempt that you can use for the other exam or let's say that maybe you don't pass the first one well now you have another attempt right but you must use those up before you can get another voucher so i just want to make sure that that's clear see i see david you're in there answering questions yeah go ahead david yeah the the other thing about that is the vouchers expire after 30 days so don't request one until you're close to being ready to take the exam yeah yeah once you're ready then that's right that's right okay and like i said uh so to get your exam voucher either one we'll drop a form at the end of today or two complete one of the learning paths and then email academy datastax.com another way you can do it actually is you know for those who have been with us before you'll find in the form that'll ask you for a cluster id so if you go and create a database in astra um which is our which is data sex's serverless cassandra as a service platform you know so you can just spin up an uh you know a cassandra cluster up in the cloud in a couple minutes um you'll get a cluster id the voucher the form actually explains how to do this um you can go to a workshop like that one or if you've already got a database you just paste in that cluster id and you you enter that in the form you can get a voucher that way as well okay and then finally once you've done that right so once you've gone through read the rules understand what's expected of you from the exam process process you've you know gone through we highly suggest you unless you are already a cassandra veteran you really need to go through the training materials right all the stuff that you need to know is going to be in the training materials go through those training materials get comfortable make sure you can take the quizzes and you're comfortable with the quizzes and the material once you've done that you've got your voucher then you're you're ready to go and take your certification okay so let's go ahead and take a look at what this process looks like so i'm going to go over to academy so i just want you to notice where i'm at i'm at academy.datasex.com i will go ahead and drop this again for everybody drop it a bunch of times so you have it yeah we just matter of fact and i should point this out too the vouchers are processed every week okay so once you submit for your voucher don't expect that it's just gonna show up right away right we usually we usually process them on fridays and we have to go through everybody in the list and process them all um so i think some of you are noticing that you just got some today that's because we processed them earlier this morning okay okay so once you go into academy now i've already logged in but once you go to academy and you've read your shirt number thing you're going to see a page that looks something like what you see here and in the bottom you're going to see this catalog of all these different courses and such that are in here again these are all free right so you can take any of them that you'd like what i want to point out though is notice the admin course and the developer or learning pads i should say so depending on which one you're choosing then you're going to pick a learning path now if you click on this the learning path is actually a set of courses right so my box is kind of laggy today so don't mind that um so you'll notice that there's a set of courses in here ds101 ds201 ds224 the developer one and i'll blow this up just a little bit make it easier to read hopefully so you just say enroll and you can you know go to any one of these and as you complete the content and everything like that you'll see it'll start to complete and what you want to do is there's be there will be a set of videos and quizzes in each of these right so you're going to start looking at the video go through the video take the quiz so on and so forth and you want to make sure i believe you can't complete them until you score 100 on all of them actually so you want to get really really comfortable with this process and as you go through and do this then what will happen is your learning path will automatically get completed um so once you've completed these all of these then these will be checked off and you'll you'll see that they're done and that's the part that i'm talking about that once you've completed a learning path then you can send the email to academy.datasex.com say hey i used this email i completed this learning path and you can get your voucher that's like i said another way to do it even if you don't use that mechanism to get your voucher for each of the paths you really want to complete these before you take your exam right yes you get two attempts yes that's part of the voucher and yes those are two free attempts but like i said at some point you're gonna max out in how many of those you can get you can only get two vouchers um so you really want to make sure that you're prepared because you don't want to run to a case where you're not getting through it um because then at some point you know if you if you go through all four of them then you're gonna have to start paying so just make sure you're prepared up front okay so let's say then you've completed your learning path you feel comfortable and you're like okay i've got this i'm ready to take my exam what do you do notice down here that there is this i went too far there is this data stack certification course click on that this is going to bring you to the metal system that's with this when you go to log in here it's going to this the test taking system also there's the exam rules here that i talked about a minute ago so you're going to want to go through these now as i mentioned with the exam rules we're not going to read through them all today but again some things to point out a live proctor will watch you through the the whole exam it's a closed book exam you know there's there's all sorts of things that you need to know ahead of time before you take your exam there's also a little widget here in order for you to even take your exam you actually have to enable this what this is going to do if like you use chrome or whatever you have to install a chrome extension and then it's actually going to check it's going to check do you have a second monitor like you know it's going to tell you like hey are you good or not to move forward so you have to go through this process uh in order to be even able to take the test in the first place um and and i'll show you in a second when you get to the spot where you actually take the test you'll have to do this before you can get the button to even show up to tape to take the test they just provide extra links for you to do it here if you want um so i'm suggesting just do these right off the bat and that way when you go to take your test you're all set to go how are we doing on questions david oh oh we lost the skype we did all right well let me make sure to uh get david back in here i don't know what happened to skype but dropped so get me just a second to get david back i appreciate all of your patience okay all right we're getting david back here in just a moment and i see alex is all over the questions thank you alex for that okay great all right just bear with me everybody i'm just making sure uh we can get david back here okay he said he's gonna be back soon so i will just go ahead and continue on and david should pop back in okay so here's what i wanted to show you next so once you click on once you either log in or sign up i've already signed up right so i'm i've just logged in but once you do this let's bring you to the metal system and you're gonna see this certification.metal.com right this is an external provider that provides the test taking software the proctors and all that right like i said it's 24 7. you can come in here and take the test anytime you want that's totally up to you you don't have to schedule it ahead of time or anything it's at your schedule but you will be proctored live now what i'd like to point out though is a couple things here notice that you find out how many questions you have and how much time you have you have 90 minutes total for the whole exam and 60 questions you can take as much time as you want for an individual question but you have 90 minutes total now you're going to find that when we do the practice questions here we're only giving you like a minute and a half per that's because we have to get through so many in a certain time but when you take the actual exam you're not going to have that particular limitation right but it will tell you again how much time you have total and how many questions and everything notice this little widget here in order for this button to you know for you to be able to do this this is that widget that's actually going to check for a second monitor and all that kind of thing and then finally this is really really important you see this little price tag here it says make payment that might be scary you're like wait a minute i thought i got a voucher why do i have to make a payment check it out when you click on the button and you say make payment it's going to give you a spot right here for have a coupon code that's where you enter your voucher once you enter in your voucher successfully that payment will go away and that's where you'll get your two attempts so again you do in fact click on the little tag for 145 and you do say make payment you're not paying anything you put in your coupon code there that's the voucher and then that's it right so you take your test you go through and uh we'll see what happens from that standpoint all righty all right let's see what's going on with dave here all right while we're waiting for david i'm gonna go ahead and start some of our very peaceful uh music and let me see how david is doing if not i'll just start going through some of the questions myself oh i feel like i hear david are you back i am back all right we got david back all right cool cool cool great good timing because i was just about to start another questions all right so here let's go ahead and get some of the questions um mathias um i'm sorry matthias not mathias matthias my bad um the exam is with python java cql cql there's no coding or anything like that even the developer one you're going to go through cql and data modeling we're actually going to give you those practice you're going to see the practice questions right now so after we're done today you should have a really good idea of what to expect from that standpoint oh i'm sorry cedric's not here sm i'm sorry let's see babu will completing the learning path be enough to be prepared for the taking the exam yes all of the material that you will experience in the learning path is is going to be enough to actually take the exam and i'm glad you asked that question because you'll find in a matter of fact let me just show this to you real quick and then we'll get into the questions and start moving so when you go to the learning paths if you go to some of the courses like if i go to um if i go to ds201 here now if i did nothing but take the videos and the quizzes could i use that information to pass the exam yes however i want you to notice over here for those of you now i want to be very clear about this if you're not familiar with vms um a vm virtual machine this is i think this thing's like 3.2 gigs right it takes a lot of resources on your machine you need to have something like oracle virtualbox installed but what this does this will give you a fully configured environment that will bring you through exercises that go through all the materials so if you really want to dig in and learn and really really help solidify the stuff the vms are a good way to go now admittedly though not everybody is going to be able to run them like i said oracle virtualbox takes you know good amount of ram the vm's gonna take some it's 3.2 gigs depending on your connection that might take like you know forever to download or maybe not totally up to you right um but just know that this will separate from going through the material in the videos and then just taking the quizzes this will actually have you do the things that you're learning about all right all right so david what do you think we get into some questions sounds like sounds like a good idea so what we want to do is we we want to come back to your mentees so let's take a look at this first one so go back to your mentee and i just noticed that uh here we go all right so let me get the mentee up as well so if you missed it let me go ahead and bring the code up for you there we go let me pull something back onto my screen my bad there we go here's the code if you weren't in the mentee for some reason i'm gonna go in there with you actually and let's put that code in three seven two one three nine zero five okay so what's going to happen is we're going to go to a question i'm going to say start quiz right let everybody get in here [Music] and so you want to look at the screen i'm going to put up a question like this so number one cql developer and administrator exams i'll read it and then what will happen is i will go ahead and start the quiz like i'm doing now and you should see a countdown and there it goes and then you like i said you'll have about a minute and a half to answer that's just for now because we have to get through the questions so let's do this first one so you want to consider the cql statement you see here create table roller coasters and this and all of these statements and how many rows will the roller coasters table have after executing all of the cql statements this is going to give you kind of a feel for how these work [Music] osm this is not the actual exam don't worry these are just practice questions right this is just for practice to give you a feel for how these actually work yeah this is not the exact we wouldn't just like throw that at you it'd be like really evil and go and the goal here is to show you how we ask questions you know so there's so there are no surprises every form of question that will be on the real exam is on the practice exam that's right that's right so again for those of you brand new to cassandra if you have no clue just think about it for a moment see if you can figure it out give an answer it's no big deal we're gonna explain all of these right so we're gonna go through and start explaining them but yeah it's gonna give you a feel for how these work okay looks like our answers are in and it looks like the majority of you got that correct right so it is c the correct answer is c so let's find out why go for it dude yeah so as we as we look at this um in all of these questions we're going to look at the cql statements here we're defining a table and if you look the table the the first thing i'm going to look at that table is the primary key there's a single field for that primary key called name and now i'm going to look at the inserts there are four inserts the first insert inserts the roller coaster millennium force at cedar point the second one formula ross at ferrari world the third steel dragon 2000 nagoshima spa land and the fourth one millennium forest at cedar point with a different rating so the question is how many rows will there be in in in the roller coasters table after executing all of these cql statements so the first one inserts millennium force the second one in search formula the third one insert steel dragon and the fourth one is crucial you'll notice that the primary key as we said is name and the fourth one uses the same name field as the first insert and what happens in cassandra when that occurs is unlike a relational database you don't get an error what happens is we call it an upsert it actually updates that first row the one with the primary key of millennium force so finally the that first row will be millennium force cedar point seven but only three rows get inserted in into the table one gets updated by that upsert so only three rows the correct answer then is c all righty wonderful all right so we'll go into the next one so again hopefully this will give you an idea of how this is going to kind of feel so i'm going to give you the question and i will go ahead and start that there and we want to consider these cql statements again we have a create table and then a set of insert statements and what is the result of executing all of the cql statements osm will display the leaderboard but not after every question yeah sm unlike our other quizzes this isn't like a swag quiz or anything like that and the leaderboards are really there just to give you a tally of your points because we mentioned in the real exam you need 70 to pass we have 20 questions here today so you need 14 to pass right so we're just giving you a gut check that's all the leaderboards are doing here today so you're not really going to be compared time doesn't matter in this case such like that so [Music] alrighty looks like our answers are in and the correct answer here was d uh again don't worry about there's a there's a spread of folks there we'll go ahead and explain it as well go for it dave yeah so let's take a look we're looking again at a create table statement and the first place that we looks the primary key the primary key consists of artists and title and you'll notice those are both within the the double parentheses so artists and title are the primary key they are all they also make up the partition key and that's crucially important so we look at the four inserts the question is what's the result uh the first insert the beatles in yesterday make up the partition key the second insert the beatles and let it be the third insert abba abba and fernando and the fourth insert frank sinatra and yesterday each of those is a unique combination of our artisan title each of those is a unique partition key so the answer is a table with four partitions and by the way yes i did notice a couple people are answering in the chat don't answer in the chats please answer in mentee so make sure that you're in mentee not the chat all right great let's go on to question three so this is question three i'll go ahead and start that there we should see a countdown going here real soon yep there we go okay so we want to consider the sql statement we see here again it's a create table statement and then which of the following is a valid query for the cars table so [Music] so and melinda i see you have a question what are partitions you know partitions are just a core part of the way cassandra works so as you work through the learning path the ds201 class that we talked about you'll get very quickly into partitions very important concept all right looks like our results are in and the correct answer here was c so let's see why that is sorry ouch yeah right okay so let's let's go ahead and take a look at this one the answers there's a pretty wide spread of answers here so if once again we're going to look at this uh table definition and you i'm going to look again at the primary key notice now the primary key there are four fields make model year in color and the two fields make and model are in the interior parentheses those two fields are the portion of the primary key we call the partition key and year and color that follow are what we call clustering columns and that's going to be crucially important so the question is which of the following is a valid query so only one of them would be a valid query the first one select from cars where make equals forward the the query pattern that we're going to prefer in cassandra that we're going to almost always use is that a query stays within a single partition or a small number of partitions so in order to make a valid query we have to specify the partition well the partition is the make and model so specifying only the make is not sufficient the second one years 1969 colors red those are the clustering columns we have to specify the partition that's a requirement so that when we rule out b c and d both specify make and model ford and mustang so one of those or excuse me both of those could be valid but only one is because we said which one at which of the following and if we look d [Music] specifies the clustering column color the color is the there are two clustering columns year in color color is the last or right most clustering column and the rule is if you specify or constrain any clustering column you have to start with the first or left most so it would be okay to say where make is ford model mustang year 1969 and color red but not just color red so c is correct because it has the partition key for it and mustang and constrains only the for or specifies only the first or left most clustering column year so the correct answer is c okay so now you should notice you probably notice a score on your mentee now again the key thing here is since there's no time based or anything notice that a bunch of people have the same score so the leaderboard's not really meant in this case to be a comparison against each of you it's really get a gut check of where you're at we've had three questions each question is worth a thousand points here so you have if you've gotten them all right you have three thousand right so by the end we'll have 20 of those and if you get 14 or above that that's at 70 so again it's just a gut check to give you kind of a feel of where maybe you are at all right so let's go ahead and move on to question number four where question four there we go all right so you want to consider these cql statements again i have multiple create table statements in this case and now a batch that's interesting and then what is a valid statement about this batch uh uh uh all right looks like the results coming in and the correct answer here was in fact c you know i'll tell you for so many of you being brand new to cassandra right there's i'm glad to see there's a majority getting these right again if you're not it's okay these are practice this is just to give you a feel right of what to expect right dude you always notice this one oh go ahead i was noticing that as well one thing to notice in this particular example uh something that's very much cassandra like but not you won't see in relational world you have two tables here with the same data in them they have the id name department and and the id name and department in both of them but the primary key is configured differently to support different queries uh that's actually common it's deno former denormalization that we do in cassandra so the question is what about these this batch we do two inserts and we're inserting exactly the same data ac1123 joe and legal into both tables the question then is which of these four statements applies well it's two different tables that's two different partitions so right away i believe it's a multi-partition batch i'm going to rule out a and b and the question then is can it be applied well you might ask what would prevent it from being applied well it wouldn't be applied if we omitted one of the fields from the primary key that would prevent it from being applied but all the fields are the primary key for both tables the first table table is just id the second is department id all the fields are provided therefore it's a multi-partition batch and it can be applied and the majority of you got the correct answer c awesome all right moving on to question five go ahead and start that question up we go okay so we want to consider the table definition with a primary key omitted notice it's not there now you're going to want to read these bullets these are the known things right known things about this and what primary key does this table have so you need to figure out the primary key oh gordon if minty crash just reload it yeah just refresh it it should come back if it doesn't let me know that'll be an interesting one and forget don't don't put the answers in the chat make sure you do them in a mentee please all right looks like our answers are in let's go ahead and take a look the correct answer here is in fact b whoa did really well in that one let's go and take a look at why yeah this is a different sort of question because in all the others i've said let's look at the create table and right away we look at the primary key definition in this case we haven't defined the primary key but we've given you some statements we've said it's known that restaurants are uniquely identified by a combination of name city reviewer that tells me right away that the primary key consists of name city and reviewer because the primary key uniquely identifies a road just like it does in a relational database then we said the restaurant reviews are retrieved from the table using a combination of name and city well that tells me that since my my queries are going to be based on name and city that one of two things um one of two things that's happening here either name is the partition key and city is is the first clustering column or city is the partition key and name is the first clustering column or name and city are together the cluster together make up the partition key and the only one that fits that criteria or a criterion is b where name and city make up the partition key the third state statement the third thing that is known is that the table has multi-row partitions what that tells me is that there must be a clustering column and since the primary key is at least contains name city and reviewer uh reviewer can be a clustering column and b fits the criterion criteria just to note it would be possible to create another another primary key that meets these requirements but the only one of the only valid choice among a b c and d is b all right wonderful thank you david moving on to question six let me go ahead and start that there all right so you want to consider the table definition here and the cql query now this is one of those that once you if you get this one wrong once you learn the the way to do this you'll never get it wrong again but which materialized view definition can be used to support the query i'm not going to say this is a trick question it's not but i think that'll make sense what you see the answer is okay uh okay let's see results are in let's take a look the correct answer here was d a little bit of a spread on that one and like i said if you got this one wrong you'll never get it wrong again yeah david's right here there's something that you just need to know on this one uh so we have this table it has a primary key of name but we want to do a query where we want to query where with the where clause we want to specify wins the rule is we that queries have to include the partition key and wins is not the partition key it's not even part of the partition key so that query select from teams by wins where wins equals four we simply um i'm sorry we can't do that from our teams table so we need to create a materialized view teams by wins so what i know is that wins needs to be the partition key because that's what that's the only field that i'm querying on so that rules out a and c right away and the correct choice would be b or d um name is the clustering column in both of those materialized views so that would return multiple rows all the teams with a certain number wins that's what i want and what you have to know is that since we're essentially creating a you know materialize you can think of it as being another table none of the fields or none of the fields of the primary key can be null so creating the materialized view requires us to do a null check on the fields that will be part of the primary key because they don't have to be non-null in the original teams table because they're not in the primary key there so d is the correct answer we have to do the null check and what david said once you remember that and it makes sense because primary key fields can't be null once you remember that you'll get this this one right you'll remember it every time i think yeah yeah exactly once you realize okay yeah i can't have normals there then okay makes that one pretty easy all right so notice the leaderboard again this is the compare each other um this is just more to see where you're at right um so we've had uh six questions up to this point so you could have a total of six thousand points again it's just to get check so let's move on to the next one moving on to question seven question seven we'll go ahead and start that one up there we go all right so let's consider the table definition and the cql query this is another one of those similar to the last one that you'll never get this wrong again if you get it wrong today which secondary index can be used to support the query [Music] [Music] okay answers are in let's see how this one turned out yeah this one's kind of a spread but that's okay you're gonna learn why here in just a moment all right so let's let's take a look at this one once again uh we're gonna look at the primary key of the original table restaurants by city primary key is city and name city is the partition key names the clustering column we can't do the query shown below as is because we're specifying the city that's a partition key that's good but cuisine is not a clustering column so we need to we need to resolve that and when you look at at these the a is the correct answer and as david said this is one that once you know you know and that's because you can picture creating a secondary index almost like creating a magic clustering column adding a special clustering column and you can only specify one column so the first one specifies cuisine is that column that's that's the only one that can be correct and you can now do a query based on the partition key which is the same it's still a city and you can do it based on this new uh magic clustering column as i call called under secondary index and that is cuisine so a is the only correct choice and this was was kind of obvious because you could only build a secondary index on a single column so that ruled out b c and d pretty quickly okay moving on to question eight go ahead and start that all right so which statement describes the where clause in a query all right answers are in that one came through pretty fast correct answer there was in fact a let's take a look at why okay and the reason is oh you want to take a close look at the wording here the answers say where clauses must reference where clauses certainly can reference all you know all of the all of these but they must reference the primary key there's a discussion going on in the chat right now about the previous question and that question was can we do a search just on the secondary index the answer is no uh you you need you do need to specify the partition key which in that with the secondary index the partition key is still the orig the same partition key the secondary index just sort of adds a special clustering column so you you do need to search based on at least the fields the partition key or you end up having to query the entire database which could be right hundreds or even thousands of nodes all right that's right i just i did you all right question nine let's consider these cql statements these two tables and this type notice the type and which enter statement can be used to insert a row in the people table uh um sm i am on discord but i'm not on discord right now i'm watching too many things on my screen to keep track of all of them all right answers are in let's take a look the correct answer here was a this really comes down to a formatting issue doesn't it yeah so just to note some of these questions require you to take a look and think about what happens when something runs or how you might make something work others uh test your understanding of the syntax and so on that's what this question is we have a user defined type called name and we have a table called people that uses name and the real question here is what is the syntax that we use to set the fields of a user-defined type and this is one that a memorization question you kind of just have to know the syntax and the syntax is json so the uh a is the correct answer alrighty let's go ahead and look at 10 but first we'll again look at our leaderboard right so let's see everybody's doing so we should have 9 000 if you've got them all correct so far harsh nailing holding it up cool all righty so question 10. go ahead and start that one so this one's fun this is actually one of those that will give you once you get this right and understand this this is definitely one of those kind of key things to know about something how constant works um you want to consider the cql statements we have a credit table and these statements here pay particular attention to that great table statement and how things are being defined and then what is the result of executing these cql statements [Music] all right answers are in let's see what they look like well that's a really awesome spread there the correct answer is b all right yep this one's a little tricky and that's actually why it's tricky but when you notice it you'll you know you'll you'll look for this kind of stuff in the future which is why we give you one of these practice questions yeah so if you take a look at this one there are a couple key things of course i'm going to look at the username or the primary key which is username and email and then i'm going to look at the at the rest the create table and the crux of this of this question is that the nickname field is static the nickname field is static so i look at the inserts the first insert dc1234 david stacks.com work with the nickname of dave the second one dc1234 same partition all the inserts are the same partition so i know i only have one partition but the emails are different the first one was david datastax.com the second was david gmail.com and that's a clustered column so it tells me that i have two um it tells that tells me that i have two rows in this partition so right away i'm going to rule out c and d then i have an update and we're going to set the nickname to davey the description to school where the username is dc1234 and the emailsdavid gmail.com what it comes down to is where does the nickname davey get set because the nickname field is static that means it has the same value for every row in the partition so static means static or common within or shared within the partition so even though there are two david's on this video and neither of us go by the nickname davey that's correct right david what yeah no that's right i do not go by that name neither do i uh because it's static it gets changed to davey in both rows so the correct answer is b so there's kind of a lot going on there but the key was understanding that static variables are fields of the same value within a partition all right thank you sir all right moving on then to question 11. i'll keep these going notice now um this is going to change you know a lot of the questions so far have been a lot of like cql tables you know how do you what do these look like now this is going to change a little bit where we're going to move a little bit into some of the architecture here okay so you want to consider the two data centers in the diagram and then what is a valid statement about a read request made at a consistency level of local quorum to a coordinator in coordinator node z in paris dc okay it looks like our results are in this one's kind of fun actually and it looks like the vast majority of you got this right that's awesome even for folks who'd not been uh not done cassandra before so yeah i'm really really impressed with that so in this one the key is that the uh that the read request has made a consistency level of local quorum meaning that a quorum of and quote by quorum mean majority more than half of the replicas in the in the paris data center need to respond since the replication factor is three the quorum is two in the best case the failed replica w or the failed node w is not a replica of this data and all three nodes that contain the data are available so that's going to succeed for sure the worst case is that w the failed node is one of the three replicas but that still leaves two replicas on which the data resides so a query would to the paris data center would get back an acknowledgement from the two remaining replicas and it would still succeed so either way uh this query succeeds and is handled totally within the paris data center so the correct answer the correct answer is b and it's the local part that makes it handled yeah within the the paris data center and i'm impressed that so many of you who are new to cassandra got this one right good job all right moving on to question 12 whoops there we go try that again all right so one thing i want to point out about this one there we go um notice here we show you the full block but in your browser when you're taking the actual exam um with the log output you may need to scroll you may need to see a scroll bar so make sure that you if you just notice something like that so you can see the entire trace and you don't miss anything so at what elapsed time is the data persisted so that it will survive an unexpected node shutdown and remembering that these exam questions are to prepare you for taking the exam and the formats offered on the exam david showed you a scroll bar bar on the right it's most likely on this question if your screen's too small you'll see a horizontal scroll bar not a vertical scroll bar oh okay given the way the exam interface works that's right yep thank you for that david in fact in the exam i think the actual question says or question because we have questions similar to this says you may need to scroll horizontally we did get some feedback about that okay i'll see you guys we need to update the slide yeah okay we updated the exam but not the slide okay do okay looks like the results are in correct answer here is c yes let's take a look at why this is actually one of my one of my favorite features of cassandra it's one of the robustness features is really neat actually so we take a look the question is and what elapsed time is the data persisted so it will survive an unexpected node shutdown if you look we have the activities or events and the time the times uh first thing we execute the query at time 0 parse 328 prepare the statement at 690 determining the replicas which replicas will it be sent to at 1834 and appending to the commit log of 21 9 93 the entire point of the commit log is to store uh data so that will survive a node shutdown and when a node starts up it'll continue read the date of the commit log and continue to um to process it and do what it needs to with it so the correct answer is c just one note cassandra is to use a phrase wicked fast originally this slide said 2193 milliseconds and someone said isn't that slow it's like yeah yeah slow that's micro and it's wrong because cassandra is not slow so 2193 microseconds is the correct answer here alrighty thank you thank you moving on to question 13. okay so how is the replication factor configured in cassandra okay answers are in and let's see what it comes out to yes the correct answer here is b for key space yeah there's a little bit of a spread there but most people got this right and if you've done this if you've created a key space in cassandra what you understand is that you must configure the replication factor and strategy at the time of key space creation in fact if you use cqlsh and you start creating a key space code completion will prompt you essentially to fill in replication factor and strategy so replication factor is configured per key space yeah so something uh harsh something to just kind of prove your comment there i know you're asking about secondary indexes we were actually having a conversation in the in the background about this um because david and i had said slightly different things there um when using a secondary index or a storage detach index you can query outside of your partition key right so the key thing with that though is for what david was saying earlier is that from a performance perspective that yes you'd end up having to scan through your nodes so if you're if you have a query that includes only the secondary index and you don't have a partition key well then it doesn't know what partition to look at so it's got to go through all of them um so it's it's never going to be as performant as it would be if you had a flat out denormalized table or something like that however to your your comment about uh the infamous allow filtering yeah don't use that don't do that i mean there are admittedly there are actually certain more advanced cases where you can use allow filtering responsibly but you got to know what that is and how to use that otherwise don't use them um we've seen too many cases of folks who have allowed filtering all over the place in their production queries in their app and wonder why at some point cassandra starts falling over and it's not scaling and it's not fast it's because of allow filtering so don't use that if you do have a case though where you are trying to query outside of your primary key and a secondary index looks like that might work you can use them just know that again it's not going to perform the same as pure denormalized tables right so it depends on your slas and what you need there all righty all right so this leaderboard we're at the next leaderboard here let's see how we're doing all right looks like harsh so far is the only person with everything correct so far and alan right there again i i really shouldn't make the comparison it's not meant for that i'm so used to doing in our normal workshops right so all right so but again it gives you just kind of a feeling for where things are all right so moving over to question 14 so now we'll get into some of the admin pieces there's just a couple of these right so i would say stick through it because then the data modeling ones are going to be really important for those of you looking to take the developer exam all right let's go ahead and start this one all right so what are two options for internet encryption and cassandra now something i want to point out here notice that the question that says choose to now because of the limitations of menti what we're doing right now you can only choose one so the way we've done it is if you choose either one of the two here you'll get it correct in the real exam though if it says choose to it means choose two and the metal exam system will allow you to choose two so be very careful about that um that you don't you know i think it actually forces you right david like i don't think you can choose one in that case well validate out um i don't think it forces you okay so if it says it be yeah make sure you choose two if it says choose two it's been a while since i've taken it so i don't honestly remember nice matthias that's funny all right let's see let's see if answer f is on the screen all right the correct answers were c and e right now again in the real exam you would have need to chosen both c and e for that to be correct so i want to be very clear about that and the other thing about this question is we will never ask you choose all the correct answers if there's more than one we'll tell you how many and we actually tell you twice we say what are two options choose two we don't want the question to be complete to be difficult because you have to guess how many options there are we'll tell you exactly how many read that carefully it does choose to as david says choose two um here we're talking about encryption between nodes and the choices that are available the valid choices are all encrypted all traffic between nodes none no traffic between nodes dc encrypt traffic that crosses data center boundaries between nodes and rack rack is another another uh abstraction like like data center and the idea of a rack goes back to physical data centers where you might have multiple physical racks in a data center and you want to cross rack boundaries in case you had a failure of a common power supply in iraq or something but the only the choices would be all none dc and rack only rack and dc are in this list so c and e are the correct choices okay moving on to question 15. there we go which configuration file is used to set garbage collection properties for cassandra uh do this okay results are in let's take a look and the correct answer here is b [Music] let's take a look at why yeah and actually a wasn't a bad guess right incorrect but not a bad guess because so much of the configuration we do for cassandra is in the cassandra yaml file but jvm options is a file that was designed specifically to put jvm specific settings in to make it easier to find them and configure things like garbage collection memory and other jvm uh settings so the correct answer here is b jvm options yeah and it's good to know that cassandra is built on java right so you know put the java specific stuff over in the jvm options and make that a little nicer all right moving on to 16 we're almost there almost there so close so close this is another one of those questions that once you understand how this works will really help you understand the core of how cassandra works um matter of fact david alluded to what's going on here before uh when we were talking about upserts and how things work in cassandra i was going to give away i was going to give a phrase that would have given the answer but i'm not going to do that yes i'll let you i'll let you all struggle for a moment so yeah so consider the table definition and how a single row is stored in one men table and two ss tables on a cassandra note what are the current values for this row hmm all right answers are in let's see the correct answer here was b this is actually one of my favorite questions actually i really enjoy this one yeah very good so in in this one keep in mind the cassandra store can store data for a row in multiple places um in this case a mem table and two ss ss tables and the phrase that david was waiting to use go ahead david say it say it out loud oh yeah last right wins yeah last right wins and i was waiting to use it too last writer or late latest update uh wins so we look at this this row how do we know it's the same row because id is the primary key and the id is 11 in the mem table ss table are in both ss tables so we're talking about the same row question is what is it what are the current column values for this row and we have to look at the values in all three the score value in the mem table is 75 the score value in the ss tables are 62 and 48 respectively and latest right wins one of the things that so we have to compare the time stamps is what it comes down to one of the things that we'll do in the exam so is not to make it inordinately difficult is if you have to compare timestamps we will make the timestamps differ in the first couple digits you won't have to go out to the 10th digit to go are these two timestamps equal and which one comes first so here i can look uh the mem tables time stamped one three nine the ss table your first digits one two zero the other ss table one one eight so clearly they're different and clearly we can tell the order pretty quickly so the timestamp the newest timestamp for score is the mem tables i would expect 139 so the score is 75. uh the test mem table doesn't have an entry for test that's okay but both ss tables do and the latest timestamp for the test value is from the middle from the top ss table time stamp of one two zero and that's math so the current values for the row obviously the primary key is the same 11 but the test is math and the score is 75 because latest write wins okay all right so let's move on then to question 17. let's start that one up more in the last set of questions here what is a valid statement about a coordinator node handling a query at consistency level three [Music] all right we have our answers in let's take a look correct answer here is d and let's hear it david what's going on wow very good seeing that so many people got got that correct yeah you sure you're all new to cassandra or yeah right you already said you are this is great well if you take a look the consistency level uh is explicitly set to three that was to make the question easier more often we'd set it to something like quorum or local quorum but either way because what does consistency level 3 mean for a read it means that the coordinator node must get back acknowledgements about its about the read the read data from three nodes but what do those acknowledgements look like coordinate doesn't have to talk to all replicas it only needs to send a request to three um read repairs uh kind of a distractor it's not doesn't really fit here the question really comes down to b and d the coordinator node can ask all three replicas for the data but what it really does is it sends a direct request for the data to one of the note one of the replicas and sends digest requests a request for digest of the data to the other replicas well what does the coordinator know do with that it compares the data received with the digest it receives from the others and if they all three agree it sends back a response to the cons the client and we're good what if they don't agree well remember latest write wins it looks at the timestamp and it either has the latest data or one of the digests it receives is later in which case it needs to request the latest data and then it'll perform a read repair in the background but again to be highly performant it's not going to ask for all the data from all the nodes or replicas required by the consistency level it's going to ask for data from one node or one replica and ask for digest from the other so we don't have to wait for three times the data to travel over the network so the correct answer here and uh so many of you got it correct it's not like cassandra experts not newcomers the correct answer is d by the way i don't remember the name but someone in the very very beginning in the youtube chat had asked a question around something like this um and i had stated that you know read repair comes into play when you use something from quorum or above and your consistency level i mean there there's a read repair chance as well that's that's also that's different but if you're if you're issuing a read request and you do it a quorum or above then the process that you see here in d is going to happen regardless it's that digest comparison that that comes into play um that if it sees that for some reason one of the replicas is stale then it'll automatically issue the read repair right so i just want to tie that together to that question that we had in the very beginning this is the very process that i'm talking about all right moving on to question 18. let's go ahead and start this one all right so what is a valid statement about a right made a consistency level local quorum against a key space with a replication factor of three [Music] so um okay answers are in let's go ahead and take a look and the correct answer here is c yeah once once again okay sorry well once again looks like we had the majority of folks got got the correct answer here and the correct answer is c because the coordinated node will always try to write to all replicas but the the consistency level locoquorum with a replication factor of three means as soon as a local quorum of replicas which is two out of three in this case as soon as two replicas acknowledge the right the coordinator node will tell the client that the right succeeded so we always try to write to three but we're only waiting for an ack back from the numbers specified by the consistency level in this case local quorum of three is two so the correct answer here is c okay yeah and this is this is definitely one of what i was going to say a moment ago is this is one of those areas where there's a relationship between consistency level and replication factor right but no matter what your consistency level is when you're writing you're always going to write to the number of replicas you have in your replication factor right so it's it's it there's a again there's a relationship your consistency level is based off replication factor so if i have replication vector at three and then i have a quorum it'll be a majority of three or if i do all it'll be all based off of that right um so just again there's that relationship but when you're writing data you're always going to write to the number of replicas of your replication vector all right let's go to question 19. now these last two these last two are from the data modeling piece these are totally different from all the other ones you've seen so far so we saved those for the end but these are kind of fun and if you've never done anything with chewbacco diagram or anything no worries we'll you know kind of give me a little explanation here let's go ahead and do this but we'll let you struggle first because that's fun all right so you want to consider the chabako diagram that captures the physical data model for investment portfolio data what is the primary key in clustering order of the table trades by asd [Music] all right let's see the correct answer here is in fact d let's take a look at why all right so if you look at this chabot code diagram this is a phys diagram of the physical data model so we've got data types and clustering column orders and all of that uh represented here so the primary key for trades by asd consists of all the columns marked k and all the columns marked c so the k columns make up the partition key and there's only one account and the c columns the columns marked with c make up the clustering columns so the primary key consists of partition key of account that fits a b c and d followed by symbol and trade id and order matters in clustering columns and symbol comes before trade id so i'm going to rule out a and b because they have trade id before symbol order matters and we read the columns from top to bottom in the clustering columns from top to bottom in the character diagram so it could be c or d when i look at that i now need to look at the direction of the clustering columns or the ordering the symbol column is ascending by the way that's the default order and the trade id column is descending so i look at c and d and they both specify the trade id column is descending c doesn't ref doesn't specify the clustering order for the symbol column d does and correctly specifies it as ascending the other rule and we actually had this rule earlier i said in a where clause if you constrain any clustering column you have to start with the first or left most it's the same thing if you divide define clustering order if you define a specific order then you have to start with the left most or first and even though symbol is in the default order it's ascending um the clustering order by clause needs to start by specifying the order for symbol c does not uh it acts as if the default would come into play here but if you specify any you have to specify the first so d specifies the clustering order for symbol in ascending or default order and for trade id in descending order it does both of them so the correct answer here is d all right awesome moving on to question 20. almost there everybody let's do it all right so consider the application workflow diagram for an investment portfolio application which access pattern or patterns are evaluated before an application can evaluate q 3.2 foreign all right let's see the results are in and the correct answer here is a is a this one's tricky and hopefully you learned something from this one and then when you go to actually take your real exam you won't get tripped up on this one let's hear how badly you treat them dave why were you so tricky seriously seriously yeah had to do it for one that was actually the answers were the most spread out across the board yeah they were for this one so uh the question is which axis patterns are very evaluated before an application can access q 3.2 really we're asking what's the what are the prerequisites for q q 3.2 if you notice the diagram uh what you see in the in the diagram is q1 q2 and q3 and the way it's drawn q1 is the prerequisite for q2 and q1 is the prerequisite for q3 q2 and 3 do not have a dependency on each other all right but what about q3.2 where did that even come from you look at the the enumeration of data access patterns below you find out that q.3 is actually made up of several patterns q dot q 3.1 q3.2 q3.3 and so on so i'd like to think of q3 as being a virtual or or abstract pattern which is implemented by q3.1 q3.2 and and each of those individually if you think of it that way then q dot one is the prerequisite for q dot three but q three is all or one of those 3.13.2 and so on so the prerequisite the only prerequisite for q 3.2 is q1 and again you have to take a pretty close look at this and be familiar with uh with the syntax but the correct answer here is a and that brings us to the that was the last question in our sample exam so good job everybody yeah let's see so if you take a look then if you again there were 20 questions total each was a thousand points so if you got if i go back to the leaderboard here for a second um you should see how many total points you had right and passing right if this was a real exam passing would have been 70 or 14 14 000 or more right so if you got 14 000 or more uh then you would have in fact passed the real exam now in the real exam you have 60 questions right you get a little bit more of a spread there but hopefully that gives you kind of a feel right um you know and again when it comes to um going through like and preparing yourself for the exam absolutely absolutely go take a look at the academy courses uh that we've linked you to also these right here this these catacotta courses we have again all this is free these cassandra fundamentals the new data modeling course the this fundamental course actually in catacota um is essentially a uh how would i put it a re-implementation of everything in 201 i believe and the difference what catacota does this is actually really cool and this is especially for those of you who may not be able to use a vm i did see some questions earlier i think i saw somebody trying to use a vm in linux or whatever was running some issues or if you just don't have the resources to do it catacode is really cool because it will actually spin up the cassandra instance for you up in the cloud through your browser all you need is a browser it does everything else for you so you can actually go through all the fundamentals and everything like that there this data modeling course um this has real life use case data modeling use case examples in there it's really an awesome resource to kind of really solidify your knowledge and everything so if you do have a problem running vms at all or if you just want to check them out i highly suggest taking a look at these courses again they're all free and do this along with the academy content right and i think between the two you'll have you'll have everything you need to prepare yourself and and be very ready to take the exam okay as i mentioned before um if you you know if you have following questions or anything like that go to the discord some of you were already there always go to community.datastacks.com especially if you have longer form questions we have folks around the world and stuff and people in the community who will help answer those um always feel free to reach out to us right if you want to hit us up on linkedin or youtube or wherever always feel free to come reach out and with that everybody thank you so much um how are we doing any tailing questions there no it looks like we're good and uh we'll actually give you two minutes back what do you know you get two minutes back but again hopefully you guys got something out of that and that you kind of gives you an idea of what kind of questions to expect and uh let us know definitely when you go to take your exam let us know how you do if you pass go shout about it go put it on your linkedin like you know make sure you you definitely mention us and then we can kind of go ahead and um you know kind of talk about it as well uh up on the social media platforms and give you some good street cred all right with that everybody thank you so much thank you for joining us today and we will see you again next time in our next workshop take care bye thank you and bye-bye always don't forget to click that
