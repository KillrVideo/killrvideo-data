on the cassandra operator um and then of course nothing is good without monitoring so we're going to actually cover some dashboard grafana prometheus monitoring and then kind of wrap up at the end with some additional resources you can all utilize so it should be good here all right so housekeeping and quiz um this particular session we're not going to go deep into what is cassandra how does it work how do we data model how do we be awesome with it uh we're trying to talk more about the cassandra operator in kubernetes what that means is we're talking about kubernetes yeah yeah no much stuff on cassandra today is really we already in casanova inside kubernetes absolutely and if you are curious about cassandra and you want to learn about cassandra content and all of the other things feel free to come on by pretty much any other week we talk about it all the time so um you know stick around for this even if you were hoping for a lot of cassandra stuff i'm sure you'll get something cool out of this but um please do come back we always we always love to educate and enable us as much as we can all right so for today we got a couple things here um of course we've got the stream that's what you're watching right now at least hopefully you are um if you're not uh you know i don't know how you're hearing this so uh getting a little meta there um you got your laptop we're gonna be doing some labs and for that you will need a laptop um we'll get into some more details there but just have one handy um questions there's the discord link it's been posted i believe in the uh youtube and it should be posted momentarily in twitch chat um basically join that discord there's a few rooms um there's the main session there you can just go ahead and type questions there we have a lot of data stacks folks on the line here who are basically there to answer questions you know handle issues make sure things run smoothly and that you get a good experience here that's that's very important there are people helping us answering questions on chat and on discord so yeah you take your time and ask any question that's terrifying lastly we've got a github with all the materials which i believe we are sending links out to momentarily so you guys should all see those um basically anything you do here today we want you to be able to take home and play with and and do again or you know just explore so the githubs are for all of our sessions that we do are available to you guys i strongly encourage you to take advantage of those and you know check them out learn something new and maybe even take them and make them better so we always take suggestions we're going to dive right in kubernetes basics so what is this whole container versus virtual machine like what are these things actually well it's actually pretty cool so virtual machines are basically a guest os that runs on a host so it's if i had say a virtual box or or maybe something from vmware um i could actually host a different os that i'm running on my my you know whatever system i've got as the the base os i could host something completely different um so i could you know run red hat on my windows box or whatever um and that that's kind of a container it looks like a container but the difference between a virtual machine and a container like a docker container for example is that it doesn't have its own os it actually uses the host operating system but then sets up its own container to run inside so it's kind of a a way to stretch your resources a little farther because now instead of all the overhead to actually run that os for each of those um you know buckets that you're you're running your apps in you can just use the operating system of the uh base uh server so it's really really a powerful tool to you know extend your resources a little bit further all right so docker what is docker what does it look like well basically docker is a process this means there is docker d it is a daemon i mean that's at its core it is a running process there's a rest api that wraps around that which allows for interaction from clients and the clients are how we as the operators interact with the rest api pretty simple nothing too crazy there but the cool thing is is that this is where we'll actually start to use a cli to provision containers very very quickly and very efficiently in uh well you'll as you'll see in a moment with kubernetes in a distributed environment so very very cool um data volumes uh connect to these individual containers you've got your networking that that basically you can figure and again we'll take a look at some of these as we progress throughout the the information here but uh just for now keep this picture in your head this is basically what we're going to go through yep okay so architecture we got that client if you remember i said in the last slide that's basically how we are interacting so we are actually issuing um you know cli commands so the docker bill docker pull docker run we're typing those into our cli hitting enter those commands are going to the docker host the docker host is basically the thing that holds all your containers now container are the individual running processes the self-contained you can almost call them sandboxed in a way processes and they are using images to create the correct containers an image is basically like a template in some ways um think of it like a recipe you the image is the pre compiled recipe for how that container is going to be built so dependencies services that you needed ports that you wanted open however you wanted that that particular container configured you set that up in an image and then you can use that image to build a container pretty simple um and then uh yeah that's that's kind of the basic basic concept here yeah um anything i've missed here thank you i think you're good awesome all right so how do we actually what do these commands look like well they get to be pretty complex pretty quickly uh you'll see down here the docker run command i've got we're just starting a cassandra docker container now that's not on one hand a very complex process it's really we're just starting a single process and we're opening a couple ports you'll notice we got our port declarations down there the 7000 and the 9042 we've got an address that we're specifying is the broadcast address nothing that crazy but that's still a lot of typing for a single command to to have in a command line it can get kind of obnoxious pretty quickly um running cassandra also if you'll remember if you know much about cassandra you generally don't have just a single node either so that's that's another point we'll get into in just a moment but uh docker run if you're actually setting things up from the command line is basically how you set up these containers that's where docker compose comes in now docker compose is actually really nifty because we can take everything that that whole command laid out and we can put it into a yaml file and then run our container or set up our our um excuse me set up our container based on that yaml file and so you see we got our port declarations there we have all the things we need to specify to actually set up the container correctly the way we wanted it to now um for those of you who are a little more cassandra experts here you'll notice this particular container is named cassandra seed node this is for a particular kind of node in cassandra so we would actually need a different one a different yaml file if we were setting up a non-seed node so there's there's still some uh thought we have to give to this but this is a lot easier than having to type out a huge seven line command every time i want to provision yeah i simply reference the yaml we're good to go yeah and so indeed you don't have to provide everything in the common line but still we need to have something special for the seed and something special for the cassandra node look at the comment we need to wait that the seed has been started to be able to start the node and this is one of the you know rules in kasura you cannot start everything at the same time and so later on when we dig into kubernetes at some point we need to tell kubernetes no no no if a cassandra node goes down please don't restart it immediately there are some rules to respect okay um yeah yes that's it that's actually that's actually a good point we'll we'll dive into that more in a slide or two here but um honestly there there was a long time where cassandra and kubernetes people were saying don't don't use them together don't they don't fit and part of it's because of the self healing that kubernetes does is actually bad when cassandra's trying to handle its own and just it clashed but there are ways to make that better and we'll get into a couple of those here right okay so docker compose not really production um ready it's not it's good for dev it's actually fantastic for dev i've used it a number of times in dev um but it's only on a single box and it's not it's not something where i can take 50 servers and have a shared resource pool and go out and deploy something i would never really do that that's where kubernetes comes in kubernetes is an open source system for automating deployment scaling and management of containerized applications that basically means it is that one-stop shop where i can take all of the operation stuff that i'd have to deal with in the day-to-day and i could do it through kubernetes over a wide range of hardware so really really cool so what does kubernetes actually look like well some of the features i'm not going to go over all of these but a couple of them that are really really interesting automated rollouts and rollbacks uh so if you have an app for example that um needs to be taken offline and then updated and brought back up you can actually do a number of things with kubernetes so that your application from the user's perspective was never brought down whether it's you know provisioning uh new instances that are are now the updated version and then just spinning down your old ones or a wide variety of other things that there are a lot of tools you have at your disposal to make your operations really really smooth horizontal scaling cassandra people in the room are going yeah of course horizontal scaling is awesome we love horizontal scaling because it gets rid of a lot of the limitations that vertical scaling have especially around things like your uh your wallet so horizontal scaling is really really cool and and literally you want more instances of a particular container in kubernetes you can add more resources and then deploy them it's really that simple um another really really cool one is the service discovery and load balancing now services it's kind of a it's the only place i'm aware of that calls what they call services services everywhere else i would know them as like network connections or something along those lines um they aren't actually a service like you think of from a linux perspective it's literally just how your kubernetes cluster knows about different things so if you have an http you know a web service it would be registered as a web service and then when a particular piece of your application goes hey where's the web service it handles all the routing for you it does that all automatically without you having to sit there and map it out draw it out really really really cool so yeah that's very good so i just interrupt you once again yeah people asking for you know are starting to ask what do i need to install and stuff like that for my exercise so you know use we saw in the in the survey at the beginning we do have linux box ready for you so please ask link to false on discord or if you need to install on your laptop in the github repo i shared the link it's very step by step but don't worry exercise number zero is really make you ready to do the exercise okay we can go awesome all right there we go all right so let's talk some infrastructure here we have this term called a cluster what is a kubernetes cluster very similar to cassandra clusters that is basically your entire single setup of kubernetes so all the things that you have in your deployment that are governed by kubernetes that makes up your cluster we got our master the master basically is what controls the whole thing it's how you actually interact that's where your rest api is actually talking to the master which then goes out and delegates the tasks then you got your nodes nodes are literally just what you think they are they are the workers they you know say i have this many resources the master says i got this job it's going to take this you know this many resources here you go this container goes on this particular node and that that interaction there is all handled automatically that's not something you really need to do now we're going to be using i believe uh cube ctl is the particular one today um really really uh good is isn't there another one called is it mini cube uh um yes so cubesatel is really just a client you know interacting with the cube installation and you can install kubernetes in many you know software kind is one of them minicube is one of them and you do have all the distribution available in the cloud provider coop ctl is really just the client interacting with the api right okay yeah all right so kubernetes control plane this is the master right the master actually uses sed if any of you guys have used xcd this is exactly what you think it is it's it's the key value store and that's basically how it keeps track of everything that's it's back-end store it's got the controller manager and it's got the scheduler the scheduler of course is what takes the the particular pod and and puts it on a specific node and you'll understand a little more of the the um those terms in a minute here in my next slide actually and then of course the api server rest api that all comes together um basically to create the master and you'll see we got all the nodes down there right below that and we'll talk about those right here so kublet is the primary node agent each node in order to be a kubernetes participant needs to have the the kubelet so that's really hard to say actually yeah i never say it out loud i read it but never say it so that's basically what says it just like in cassandra how you need to have an install of cassandra on the box this would be essentially equivalent the cube proxy is the network proxy that runs on each node this is what you remember i mentioned that services discovery that that kubernetes takes care of for you this is what handles a lot of that a lot of the logic for all this just magically talking to what it needs to talk to is at that layer um really really cool now a pod pods are actually really nifty pods are collections of containers that can run on a host now it can be one or it could be many there's you know a single instance of something running inside a pod is just as valid as running 50 instances of something like again if i had a website and i wanted to do some load balancing or distribute the load over a lot of different hardware i could put say 50 instances of this website of the actual web server into a pod and deploy that so pretty nifty yeah um i do have a question on the chat here about master and worker so as far as i know you will install a machine to be a kubernetes master and you can scale up masters and have high availability for kubernetes and there are workers and you can scale out workers but it's not one of the workers that is elected to become a master because as you can see those are not running the same process at all right right it's completely different process absolutely all right name spaces this is where it gets good so if you think about an app and especially something with like micro service architecture right you've got a lot of different moving parts and you maybe have each of them containerized in a different container so you have say you know your database you have your web server you have some uh middle layer maybe some you know other analytics stuff you've got going on on the side these are all part of your app as a whole when you deploy your website or you deploy your app you need all of these things to be up and running well this is where namespaces come in so namespace is basically the logical um it isn't it isn't a physical barrier but it's basically a logical a bucket that we can put all those different pieces in that make up our thing so in the case of cassandra when we're building out something uh you know around cassandra we're going to use the cast operator namespace um if we had you know again a web app we could name it whatever we want there are a bunch of default name spaces i'd like to point out as well um cube system of course being uh being one of those that's used for basically internal kubernetes things you know the kubernetes doing kubernetes um and then default of course being the uh well you know default all right so namespaces provide basically scopes for names same as any programming language you've probably used um it's basically just a way to say this all belongs together all right storage this is one of the really interesting things about cassandra and kubernetes by default most things in kubernetes are pretty much ephemeral they go away they you know they go up and down and it doesn't care if they survive when you have a database that's a problem because generally you do things like store data you don't want to lose in a database and if that storage goes away then your data goes away so you have to actually have a way to have persistent storage now persistent volumes are the way you do that and that's with you we'll be playing with this some today we'll be setting up some persistent volumes it's a resource that's provisioned by an administrator now the individual containers themselves they need a way to connect to that container to that storage so they send out what's called a persistent volume claim basically uh hey i need storage it needs to be associated with me and then it's assigned and then of course storage class is basically the recipe for how are we going to cook this storage up what what is this storage gonna look like what do these volumes need you know what size are they and all those other details that we need to specify that's all done with the storage class yes and that's very important because you can install kubernetes wherever you like any system red hat google but each time the storage class the storage class really depends on your environment the storage class won't be the same on minicube kind google adws each time this is a dedicated specification and this is also the reason why at the beginning of the workshop we do have to create our own storage class absolutely and i i know i uh not so long ago was messing with a little bit of kubernetes on aws and you can even tell all of the all of the keywords i was having to use were aws specific so it's yeah very very specific to what you're actually running this stuff on all right open specification this is an overwhelming slide don't worry don't panic um this is all done for you for this that's i mean basically yeah since it's an open specification there are a lot of different pieces that we can choose for different parts of this whole uh contraption you'll notice there the platform there are a lot of options and we can choose one now i will point out that this makes a lot of kubernetes deployments very unique and and you can't just pick up a container and bring it to a different deployment and say hey all of these things that i provisioned over here it's going to look the same over here if they have any different infrastructure you actually have to set everything up for that so all of the configs and things need to reflect what you're actually running and how you're running it so things aren't exactly portable when it comes to kubernetes but the rest of the apps are all kind of taken care of for you so a bit of a trade-off but um i think a lot of people would agree it's it's well worth it okay all right so you know kubernetes we're done with the workshop we can all go home and uh oh well probably not oh i love yeah yeah so now yeah you can go and pass the cube certification no right right everything you needed to know um no so kubernetes actually there are a lot of public distributions out there um i think it's it's almost every major cloud provider at this point has some flavor uh that they offer um today if you're using a local environment we're going to be using kind and kind is actually very meta it's a let me see if i get this right it's a docker container that runs kubernetes that runs docker containers some oh yeah yep yeah so we're basically running docker to run docker it's pretty cool but what's actually going on in all seriousness if you have your laptop that's a single box and what we want to be you know playing with in kubernetes is a lot of different resources so essentially what we run into is a we have to create a whole bunch of little boxes out of a big box kind does that for us and it's not something you'd ever run in production right because why would you ever do that unless you're actually testing or developing or or doing those sorts of things like we're doing today so that's that's where kind comes in it's a great tool to simulate a large distributed environment okay so as uh as was mentioned a couple times now you can use your laptop i am a huge fan of doing it that way but we also do have these cloud instances if you need them um we should be getting those handed out here yeah it's done it's done we are delivering the the instance one by one i think we we are covered but hey you told for you know most that most of you will use your laptop so let's go right yeah yeah absolutely all right so first workshop i'm gonna hand it over here again and uh we'll keep going yeah so let me do that all right boom okay i should have moved exit okay now i'm sharing my screen all right so let's set up your cluster so i think we have shared 20 times the links from the github repo both on youtube chat and discord now and we will keep doing that so please all together let's go to github.com academy kubernetes dash workshop dash online okay and this is where i am just checking okay so i will do the exercise with you in front of you step by step let's do it quickly so first exercise is really have your environment ready and go to set up your cluster if we give you a linux box the first step to install docker is are already done but for those of you who don't or who are using on your laptop go to set up your cluster and here it is first how to install docker okay if you are using window you do have the link mac os here what you need in in the end you should do docker v this is what i do have all right i do have docker ready on my laptop so i won't go into installation docker step but yeah you can go take your time we do have the linux one then it's all about docker compose okay again included in mac os included in apple and linux is simply a new command to pass now install coupsettel which is the client to communicate to a kubernetes cluster coupe ctel okay so brew install cubesat if you are on mac windows it's uh there is a cubesat for windows you can install the msi to run the full workshop you will need something like 8 mega gigabyte of ram about 8 gigabyte of ram and if you yes and if it's going slow at some point i will tell you maybe this is due to memory issues but with eight guides it gives you good to go okay install watch watch is a nice trick because we will execute some comments that can take some time to run you know before the cluster to be ready it will initialize the pod and so with watch command you can see the pod evolving from one state to another all right and finally kind so kind is kubernetes this is what you're saying yeah i saw a comment there on youtube it's a dark reception yeah the conception something like that so again three commands to install um so i just uh it's really all there we run the the workshop a couple of times so we're pretty sure about the links this work fine chocolate is a nice tool if you are running on windows and you know us on mac and linux are used to install something just with a command line apt-get install blah blah blah you know blue install xyz and in windows you always have the msi to download and exe file and install and it takes forever there is a something called chocolate that you can install once and then now if you want to install something you can do choco install and what you need and there are tons of recipes available for you and kaid is one of them okay and when you're set up you can do kind get get cluster and no cluster found okay this is expected for now my kubernetes off is empty all right so first thing first let's create a kind cluster so first command is really to instantiate our our cluster and i will you know kind of cluster can create cluster kind cassandra and i will use the config setup kind config so what i did i have downloaded the repo git clone or download as a zip i do have everything running available on my laptop and so so do you probably just git clone the repo and i can simply copy paste in command when i am the root at the root of the repo so here for instance you can see that there is set up your cluster matching the path and i can go and execute kind config so maybe you want to know what is kind config i can show it to you opening a new tab so this is simply telling kind i want a kubernetes cluster what a surprise with one control control plane the master and five workers and why do i put multiple workers because with the cass operator we are using today we will have one pod per worker and if we want to run a three node cluster let's have at least three workers and if we want to do more like um dashboarding we will have even more worker for us all right so let's try out i'm going to create my kind cluster with you all right and it's rolling it should take a minute so again you can go to discord and request some cloud instance obviously we cannot you know share the cloud instance link directly on youtube chat this is the reason we put also discord but also in discord we do have some breakout rooms we can ask your question 1 101 no i don't think i mentioned it earlier but kind literally stands for i believe kubernetes indus uh not discord goodness in uh docker oh okay oh yeah kubernetes okay i got it all right so i think if you are uh in the cloud box the kind cluster is also created i'm not 100 sure but yeah you can do kind get clusters and see what you get so it's starting could take a minute and so once done i could do kind get clusters and i should have the kind dash cassandra cluster created for me and you cannot hear my laptop but now the fan just start up and i do have a plane i started a heavy process or something like yeah yeah yeah i do have kind of like a plane okay joining walker nodes all right and compared to setting up your own kubernetes uh this is actually relatively quick i mean if i actually had seven you know five servers or whatever and i was setting this up it would take a little bit longer so kind is actually uh and in the cloud instance kind is already installed you can just go kind get clusters and so we pick kind because in kind you can have multiple workers and maybe you already have used a kubernetes on your laptop using mini cube and by default with mini cube you only have a single worker and this is not enough we need multiple here to do the enzo okay again i'm going slow in the beginning i will speed up later once everybody will will be okay all right so kind get cluster i do have my clusters okay then i will tell coup ctel remember the client you will now use the cluster i've just defined when i execute my command i'm linking coupe ctl with my cluster just to be sure those are two related and now if i start using coupe ctl and we will do a lot of coop setting command i will interact with the kind cluster we've just created so if i for instance do the gate nodes you will see that i do have nodes for workers and i do have the control plane as a master node okay all right let's move forward we do have our cluster setup and if you on the cloud of maybe you you already get bored because it's done for you okay next we are creating a namespace remember we want all our all the resources we created in a single namespace it's easier to find it's easier to filter it's easier to delete you know you provide the namespace and everybody in the namespace is deleted keep it all in the same bucket all in the same bucket yeah please do it nice okay next is what about the storage class i told you storage class is strongly related to the environment you are running so there is a default one in um in kind which is called standard but we want to create our own just to define how much storage we when we have and how does the storage class behave so if i go to storageclass.kind.yaml you can see that it's more or less cloning the standard i just make sure that the volume binding mode is wait for first customer and and now to the default one just to be sure that this volume will be mount when the you know the customer come and ask for it and with that i will simply execute the command to create the storage class based on yaml and i will install that in the namespace so ctl-n for namespace and create my kind my storage class and now if i execute again get storage class i have two of them okay all right i will put that bigger just for everybody to be able to read all right okay are we good tell me we are good on youtube chat with a little hawk on this discord with the same app just to say okay you are all ready to move forward good nice okay and so this is we just did we have created the namespace cass operator and we have defined a storage class named server storage that's it but for now there is nothing and we also know that under the hood there are five nodes ready to take our command and host the pod we want to run it sounds like we have some yaml the bank okay can kind cluster can be set up for gke instance well in gke is already a coupe cluster all right so you will you will define gke to tell i want a plane and uh some workers so it's totally a competitor of kind so it's it would be the same command coupe ctl apply you will apply the say yaml but you cannot use the same storage class yaml and this is the reason why i've provided you in the folder a storage class for mini cube and a storage cloud for jke so if you are running on jke so spun up spin up your cluster to have at least five or five workers the control plane and to instantiate the storage class please use the you know gcepd which is a dedicated provisoner for gke i told you storage class is related to the kubernetes implementation except from that it should be fine semi-aml nothing to worry about okay let's move into kubernetes operators so when a pod starts you know you will create pod so the so as coop ctel you will invoke the api server to create the pod then you will go to etcd in the control plane to store the state then the scheduler will you know start initializing one pod and when the one is there it will start it will go on and communicate with the the worker through the good blood just to be sure that the containers you ask are started and this is important because when we will do the command we will each time look at the states of the pods and see if they are started blocking initializing and they see how you do that you know you do have the pod first initialized pot starting so when the pot starting we do have liveness prob telling us that your pod is you know starting and when the pod is ready to get request you will have the readiness prop telling you that it's ready you know and let's pretend we will start cassandra over the surprise well as soon as the pod is there and uh you will have the line f prod telling you okay the pod is there it's starting and only when cassandra is ready to take request you will have the readiness problem all right okay so that was one step um we keep going with the kubernetes resources so uh you know when you define these are important so you know when you define if you are already using kubernetes for stateless application and this is the first use case you know microservices spring boot and you know all small pieces of software those are stateless and so you will use something called a replica set not on the slide replica set and if one pod you know shut down then kubernetes oh tell oh now my the state of my cluster is not matching the the specification i got in the yaml and i will start a new pod just to match the state it's all about matching the state so by default in kubernetes it's done automatically with the replica set in a stateful set is not as easy why because now you are stateful so when because you are stateful you will use something called a stateful set when you define a stateful set under the hood it will create a pod okay no surprise but also a volume and attach the volume to the pod using a persistent volume claim so storage class is a specification i will use that to instantiate one volume called persistent volume and i will attach the volume to my pod using a pvc and so full disclosure when we will start cassandra node you will have one pod per node and a pvc per node which is a storage for the node those things are since it's not you know since it's stateful those things are always going to be tied together from you know the beginning of their life to the end of their life those resources will always go as a single unit yeah this is and this is how it works you know i like to say kubernetes is a notion of yaml and you need you need to learn how to swim you know and when you feel confident with the yaml yeah you can go hardcore and start implementing in go which is a development language of kubernetes to implement your own stuff so and when you start opening go yeah you really are the you really are the expert now okay okay i will go fast with the service but uh service is kind of uh analysis so instead of invoking something with his ip or names i will use a service with a label and now i would say any pod with this label running this service now with label selector and i will act on multiple pod at the time using the service name and so i had a question before how do we handle seeds how do we handle nodes so to handle seeds we have a delegated service and so this is some policy under the wood that will scale out the seeds there is something called atlas service for that all right so service and poi network policy i can move quickly on this one we won't really interact with those just know that instead of targeting one pod we use some level analysis okay now now when you start a pod you can add some config map okay this is the configurations key value like properties and secret user password store as uh by base some cat or you can also put some files in a secret i was not aware until lately you can totally put some files in there and that makes sense where do we put some certificates if it's not in a secret right yes and yeah i so i got the question also on the chat in a pod you can have multiple containers and you will see with the cassandra in the pod you will have the cassandra container and another container just to provide liveness and readiness probes and having a container just aside another container is a pod this is what we call a side car but i will come to that later okay and now the big deal everything that i showed to you is pre-baked in kubernetes but now when we define our own behavior we need our own resources and with the extension point is in kubernetes is called a customer resource so we'll define you will define something called customer resource definition and provide your specification okay so this sample is specification for the cron tab okay if i want to create contact stuff on cube okay i can create my own crd customer resource definition i define my spec and i uh simply instantiate this resource when i need to in a yammer it will be a custom resource i don't read all the slides remember i give you the slide on the github repo okay and now is what is an operator well for anything related to existing resource in kubernetes in the control plane you do have the scheduler and the controlman controller manager that will look at the state of your pod and i told you if the pod goes down that the controller manager knows and asks the scheduler to start a new stuff but now if you have defined a crd with your own logic you don't want kubernetes to act on it you know you are the one who know what to do and and you know to define all the operations you can do you will create something called an operator and an operator is like a daemon watching some custom resource and listen some events coming from the custom resource and act on the custom resource now the operator is kind of the the leader and it will execute all the command needed to reconciliate the expected state the specification with the current state of kubernetes cluster and now operator is intelligent it's clever he knows that i need to start the my first seed node wait until the seed node is ready only then i can start the new node and so forth and so on so this is the basic uh rules there is in operator but there are a lot of rules uh when to do scale out when you know what is the what is the seed node what is not uh and we will do some of those how to scale up a cluster all right and with that i think we are ready to install the operator so you know in cassandra when you do a deployment you can have multiple uh ring some multiple nodes multiple ring in multiple region you can read and write from everywhere and um the cassandra will replicate the data for you and its work for geographic distribution and also hybrid and multi-cloud deployment have you considered having the same data layer in all the clouds and also on premise and don't have to duplicate the data yeah castle i can do it for you and it's not magic you still have to do some vpc appearing those nodes from one cloud to each other must known each other using an ip but hey it's working all right but you can achieve some crazy durability all right oh yeah yeah he can lose a total data center it's still working some vocabulary about cassandra so the full big stuff is called the cluster each uh ring is called a ring or a data center and now this is and now you understand that why the name of the discord channel is fellowship of the rings and so some installation is a node okay in orange and in cassandra there is some affinity you can tell cassandra that those two nodes live on the same rack on the same physical location for instance or az if you are running in the cloud and with that cassandra know that when it needs to distribute the data among multiple replicas it will pay attention to to avoid as much as possible having many replica in the same rack because there is a you know physical dependency and if you look the rack you have a chance to lose multiple nodes and this is not what we want but the vocabulary is important to understand how we set up the operator for casama all right so your mission should you choose it you uh let's do it again your mission should you choose to accept it is to put cassandra in kubernetes okay related to our famous tv show all right so the cast operator no surprise is the system that will handle all the cassandra management for you ring initialization seed node management rolling reboot store data safe rack-aware scale-ups scale down replace dead nodes and it works with multi-dc cluster it's not a single data center we can have multiple data center multiple rings so how does it works let's see together with exercise number two casoperator all right so i'm going into my demo mode okay and i will go now to my second folder cassandra and i will use deploy cassandra with casa operator first things to do is to install the castle operator okay i'm using a yaml where i all the definition service account secret custom resource is created so that include the custom resource for data center customer data center okay so this is all that has been created and i can watch remember the watch command the one that help you to know what's happening oh it's already down now it's too fast but it would have been created initializing and then running so the pot it's running now i'm okay all right so as you can see i do have some ids when i got my pod and this is my id so let me copy this id for letter command i will open my sublime textbook here just to copy paste okay and now i will describe my pod so describe is a command to show you what's in a pod what's in a kubernetes resource so if i do describe you can see that i do have downloaded the cass operator it's now running okay i do have a secret attached to it and this is all the events happen so pulling the image pulling the image creating the container and starting the container all right if i go back to slide this is what we just created now in our cast operator namespace we have deployed the operator with some secret some custom resource for the operator webhook and security stuff but there is no customer running yet it's we have just installed the operator let's move forward next we are creating a single node cluster so it's very important to go you know see the yaml file okay let's see one node okay so i've opened the specification so the custom resource name cassandra data center this is a new resource we have done a custom resource definition this is the custom resource and in there you define the name of the data center the name of the cluster and as such you can have a cluster with multiple dc you can have multiple clusters and it's all based on those two properties as you can see also we installed cassandra oss we use the server storage class we just defined together and you can overwrite settings in the customer okay so here's some cassandra yaml in the file to to to set up customer and you can override the property okay enough talking i will simply copy paste my request here okay let me create a single node cluster like that applying all right okay so it's resort it's created but now i can watch what's happening here okay so cluster one name of the cluster dc1 name of the data center default name of the rack but i didn't provide any hack in the config file so i will use default sts guess what stateful set so now you understand that you do have a stateful set per rack and 0 name of the pod so i it will set up a single a single node cluster and the pod is named cluster 1 dc1 default sts0 and as you can see i do have two probes readiness probes and uh liveness probe so here it's running but it's still in is so it's it's first it was initializing now it's called running so that means cassandra has been starting so id cassandra start but it's not ready yet cassandra needs about 30 seconds 40 seconds to start depending on your on your machine and so only when i do have two over two probes telling me that the the pod is okay ready to take request that i could go and start doing some magic with it okay two over two now i do have my node running and if you are doing that with me congratulations you have now running your first cassandra node in kubernetes all right the second command is ready to get what's in there just again show the yaml file but using a command line but i show you on the github so that's okay and you can also describe now the full data center and this is what you get okay you get it there's a cluster one you use cason r and we put size equals one okay and this is all the events happening on your cluster okay and again we give you a lot of comment to pass just to list what are the pod what are the data center what are the state full set what are the service just for you to understand what we just did and i can show you with the slide we have defined a yaml file like that and this is what we have defined by applying our yaml we have created dc1 cluster one super user which is the secret dc1 default sts okay the state full set and you know that guy we were watching to start this cluster one dc one default st0 this is a pod and so for this pod a storage class i've been instantiated and a persistent volume claim claim has been attached to this guy also we have a bunch of services so first service is all pod service so you can act on all the pods on the dc one by interactive with this service there is dc1 service to act on the resource pc and also cluster one this one seed service so you also have some dedicated service to handle seats at this service that pots can use to you know contact the seeds when they bootstrap we got a question in the beginning about that okay so let's move on with the exercise so we do have a single node cluster that's nice uh so we can go into uh the pod and do some secret sh magic so should i do okay let's do it let's do it okay so if i want to list my secret okay so the secret is username password defined for my cluster i do have a huge password and a huge username okay username so let me so that's operator odd okay all right that's my command i want my password stuff okay so this is the encoded password okay and because it is because it's a secret it's encoded in base western base 64. so i speak french now uh and so to get the proper uh value for the password i will need to do eco based sourcing decrypt so i will do the command with you up okay so username yes it's also encoded but it's always the same and the username is super user so i can also decipher the username if you wish but it will be cluster one dash super user so i would rather only decipher the password no let's do it i want to give you the time to do it as well so our password is now that's because i've deciphered it okay and the cluster and the username i can go and do that and you know do that and i should have the username cluster1 it was expected okay okay well so with that let's play a little bit with our cluster with you okay okay okay okay i will do some bash comment i will simply contact my pod with his name and go there into with the bash command okay and now i'm here i can do not tool status you know just to see it's a cassandra command telling what is a topology of my cluster boom single node cluster like that all right okay moving on i can also start the secure sh and now very important instead of sql stage localhost i will do seculsh the service name remember the address service this is the name i will secure sh the service name okay and user and password but guess what the password is probably not the same and that's expected okay so my password is this one okay so now let me copy my command with my proper password and wow we are now in the secure sh command so i can you know start playing with all the castle hackerman like described spaces yeah we do have something working okay two two two two describe the space okay uh use killer video one oh yes you can even kill a video oh i can create i will create a key space so let me oh it's it's not there so let me create a key space with you i thought it was there it's oh no no it's not oh yeah yeah okay so let me create my key space dc1 uh replication factor one dc1 because the name of the custom resource is dc1 so the data center name is dc1 and replication factor one yay because uh we do have a single node and i can use this key space use kilometer one and with that i can start creating some tables and inserting some values and hopefully it will work like that and i can select from my users and i should have stuff in there yeah so you and i are in the tables now eric it's wonderful that's funny okay so now let's exit this guy exit exit i exit the pod now let's scale up the cluster okay and to scale to scale out let's say add some pods to scale out we will edit the file so remember i i add this file and i add you know size equal one i can edit the file with something size eagle equals three this is the only things we are changing now the operator will say oh the state that you're asking is three current is two i will add two node to your cluster okay and instead of editing this file i do have the very same file here three nodes okay and i simply change uh size equal three and if you don't trust me i do in front of you a diff and you can see that only size change all right so now let's execute this new guy and see what's happening okay and i will watch okay as you can see now i have two new guys sts-1 sts-2 appearing and it will take some time for them to start up and run and it will take you know a couple of minutes maybe we can watch all the different intermediate states in github i've copy paste all the intermediate state as you can see it could take up to a few minutes to do to start but once done guess what you can go back to the pod do the note tool now you do have the three node okay go back to the secret sh command you know i'll turn the key space because now the key space is replication factor 1 but you can totally alter the key space and put replication factor 3 and now you can describe the key space and now the key space living on the three nodes okay and to show you that i define consistency corral meaning each time i execute a request against with the secure sh i want the majority of the node two of a three to reply and so i will execute trussing on and in the response i expect to have redspawns coming from multiple nodes and there is no other easy way to show you that now your keyspace has been expand to multiple nodes so running two over two one over two all right running two for two okay that was exercise okay i will stay i would let the spot running but okay end of the exercise is really uh you can not only change the size but of course you can change any parameter in your cluster in your node and so the operator will do a rolling restart of your node to get the latest value so let's see now i do have two parts running i'm writing all right so i really want my two notes okay three minutes almost there i know that on the cloud instance uh it's much much faster i mean we have given you some instance like 4x extra large something like that uh next time i will run the also the workshop on the cloud instance as well okay so now everything is running so let's copy paste if the few commands we just show so let me connect back to my pod with the bash okay so two two two describe key spaces we have inserted the data we have okay now the cluster has been upgraded and so i can go back to my cluster okay execute the command to login this is the same oh now i can also do nut tool statues first just to show you that now we do have a three note cluster all healthy yeah cool i can go to cqlsh okay and i will alter my key space here it is i'll turn my key space to 12 3 node all right i will put so now if i describe my key space hey i'm okay i do have replica replication factor three trust me i don't know how to copy paste man no one does oh jeez oh i did a mistake in the textbooks no it could be paste i put the comment all right so now i will set the consistency to column and enable tracing just to get the full stack when i execute a command and now when i want to select from the video you can see that i have contacted multiple nodes okay two two two oh there is a lot going on here but i have ten two four four five three and i have ten two four four four three so two nodes i've answered my question because i asked for forum okay exit exit you don't have to be so as quick as me just i want you to show as much as possible i can also now run the file new config remember new config is a file where i have changed something so here let's pretend i have changed i have added a new a new attribute in my config commit log sync period and so if i apply this new yaml i still have the three nodes but as i change the config the cluster will need a rolling restart so i am planning let's apply the new config okay and so closing this and you know going to watch what's happening which is the rolling restart okay exit exits this is how you scale up this is how you and now you want to watch what's happening so as you can see sts-2 is terminating rolling restart and so it will be start again so yeah i can see question in the meantime okay so okay look at that node number three is mark running but stateful set uh no no the state rotate but the probe readiness probe mark it's not ready yet so nothing happening and only once the pod number three will be ready to go that's not number two will be terminating you know no downtime it's a proper rolling restart oh yeah it's taking forever okay finally and it was instantaneous yeah i almost missing as soon as this guy was running boom the other was terminating boom it was very fast so if you go to slide mode this is what we did now we do have a data center with three nodes and so we have sts 0 sts-1 sts2 okay nothing else change so now if i want to look inside the pod okay you can do the exercise under the hood of course and keep listening to me like nothing special so first things we told you in a pod there are multiple containers that's true for customers because remember in a pod you want to know where the pod is starting and when the pod is ready to take requests those are two different probes liveness readiness okay and so cassandra alone do not allow this probe kubernetes expect some you know http endpoints to be able to invoke and so we have created an open source a sidecar so management api for cassandra this is what it look likes you do have a lot of endpoints available to interact with cassandra in a rest format so of course you do have liveness readiness but you have also version life cycle get the status of the pod holding restart you can also act on the pod through this uh api management as to the sidecar ap management and also busy box which is you know minimal linux distribution to initialize that stuff okay so the api sidecar is also available open source on github slash data stack dpi for apache and you know what um data stacks have implemented the operator for casino insta cluster has implemented an operator for on orange in france telecom communication have implied i also implemented a kubernetes operator for cassandra so you might say oh that's a mess which one should i pick well that's my pleasure to announce that all three's company are working on the unique unified and merged operator that would be part of cassandra 4.0 that's the plan expected this year but you know the purpose is also to have all the bug and all the ticket closed uh to release the 4.0 to be sure that you know you can immediately go into production even if it's marked 4.0 because there are so much work in testing and fixing all the ticket before releasing this version but just to tell you in this case 4.0 all the community is working to have a single or at least a customer resource definition that can match all the operator okay and that way you can pick the one you want or use a unified one so it's competition but for the good cause alright so a lot of things happening so we still have a few minutes to so if you look at the if you look at the github repo you can do much more exercise okay so first is all about cassandra sagon is about kubernetes dashboard dashboard is not working in cloud on there is a limitation with the security in the linux box you can you can define and so if you are on cloud box don't do the dashboard one and then prometheus graphana you do have your cluster running you want to have a dashboard on top of it just to get the request let's try to run this guy and see what it looks like and the materials i told you you do have the slide here they are you do have the image okay you have everything you need to do the workshop on your own later after today so few slide dashboarding i don't do it prometheus graffana in kubernetes are working in the same way as cassandra i mean this is an advanced application you you need an operator to work to make it work and as such you will we will deploy the promoters operator the graffana operator a promoter's instance a graphana instance and this is how it works you define a service monitor in prometheus that will monitor something and what properties will monitor guess what cassandra cassandra or and for this one we will use dsc uh the image of data saks enterprise but it's also available for customers just don't i didn't update the enzyme but you can also have a yaml for cassandra still working but for now we will do data stacks enterprise and it will you know use metrics collector to export http to service monitor i told you we also now provide the same metric exporter for customer simply need to update my yaml to deploy not dsc but custom hotpot okay so let's see and go hands-on mode so prometheus graffana first things to do is to stop the existing uh three node cluster we have and to do that i will deploy a new yaml file and the only thing that changed is i do have not this one i do have a property in the yaml called stopped so how do you stop the full data center and cassandra without deleting simply just update the level providing stop equals true so if i apply this guy it will it will simply stop my cluster and i can see that it's quite fast so now i do have three running okay the pots terminating properly okay and once they will be terminated they will just disappear and yeah that's not enough i will also totally delete the full dc to start with the fresh with a fresh start to do the prometheus one okay and 10 minutes would be enough to [Music] would be enough to have something running i guess yeah it still need to start up okay okay right now i still have my data center with no pods funny right uh operator is still running okay let me delete the resource dc1 because it's still there okay now dc1 has been also deleted all right so now let's install promotives olm means a life cycle manager and it's also it's required to work with the custom resource definition of operators okay so operator is deploying okay okay all right waiting waiting installing as you can see it's all copy paste okay i hope that it's boring what what it's boring who say that [Music] okay so once i've do the life cycle management i will do my install my prometes okay wait a bit for the group to be created i'm not sure kevin few during the exercise because man that's a lot to do in two hours i'll tell you okay operator is installed okay let's do instance okay that's expected already exists because we try to create again the the group okay that's fine or do i copy no i didn't copy sometimes okay let's copy the proper if it's already exist okay this one was already existed i know it was something it's not a big deal it's still starting okay let's do it all right so is it still creating that stuff yeah it could take a bit of time to yeah we might be a bit close but we'll be all right that's play anyway you can still do the command on your own just saying what this guy is still in error well that's repeatedly fine okay okay okay it took about but bunch of time for the operator to start then to be able to install the instance and then finally the service operator okay we are good to go now let's go for grafana okay now let's connect graphana two promoters well that's some comment to pass okay and now the dashboards i'm sure i will have to do the dashboard again but never mind okay [Music] okay and now finally graffana instance that's a lot to install you know olm prometheus operator from service monitor instance then graphene instance graphene operator graphene dashboard connect graffana to kub and you know i told you a notion of yaml all right and so with all that i do have a tons of things running now in mind boom there is a lot running in there so multiple operator okay and grafana prometheus and casama okay so now let's enable port mapping for graphing now ah it's still not running oh man okay so during the initializing files i will also start my data stacks cluster so dsc mini okay now i will directly go to the full stuff dc mini matrix enabled this is the one i want to run and so if i go to this file locally let me so data stacks workspace kubernetes workshop dsc mini enable matrix you know what i will go there and edit and just put the size to one okay just for the cluster to start faster all right let's go and yeah it will start everything will start at its own space base uh and to enable matrix i simply have to provide 10 right spawn here okay and so i will let that start and maybe we should do some stuff okay where is my command to okay board forwarding if i need to all right thank you very much all for your time uh if you like the content subscribe leave us some feedbacks on discord on youtube chat and until then see you [Music] next week thank you very much thank you",
