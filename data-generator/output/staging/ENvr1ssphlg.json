formats to change me on the same page [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign foreign well hello everyone um welcome to this uh this uh next Workshop here uh on um getting started with python and nosql with uh with Apache Cassandra and um Sarma and I are actually going to take you through this so um so yeah let's uh progress just a little bit um for those of you who don't know me um my name is Aaron I'm a developer Advocate um I used to work at a lot of um you know I used to work in e-commerce a lot spent about 10 years or so in that in that space um you know most recently I was the nosql engineering lead for Target where I built out a lot of like big distributed systems um I'm also the host of the Apache Cassandra Corner podcast so hey if you're using Cassandra or ask your DB and you have a great story to tell about it hey reach out I'd love to uh love to work with you on that um and I've also written a couple of books on uh distributed databases as well um so hey let me introduce our special guest Sarma Sarma why don't you tell us about yourself bud hey um nice to be here on this podcast or sorry webcast um thank you very much I started YouTube uh Channel along back I'm happy to have 5 000 subscribers um I also make content for YouTube as well as udemy uh mostly Cassandra related courses or content uh done a lot of Open Source projects which which are helpful for the community and I'm thrilled to be a part of this Workshop today all right excellent so hey um you know with in addition to Sarma and I there's a whole bunch of folks who um you know put work into create creating all this content and um and keeping us online um so so yeah you know I'm just uh just you know one person on a on a bigger team but uh hey just shout out to the rest of the team um especially uh Cedric who's um who's hosting us right now um so yep all right so hey just a little run through on the agenda you know we're going to uh continue our introduction here for just a little bit for some housekeeping things on on the tools we'll be using today um we're gonna talk through some use cases as well as you know the the data models that back those use cases um then we're going to talk like data loading and data Generation Um and then we'll get into like um like serving things out with um you know like a restful API and uh and then that'll that'll be about it and along the way um you know we'll have a few like Hands-On sessions planned um that uh and I suppose I could um click the next slide to uh to kind of talk about some of that um obviously if if you're here and you're watching us you found YouTube um data Stacks developers that's our that's our Channel out there uh we're also going to use mentee today um first of all as a way to get to know you our audience a little bit better but then also at the end to um to kind of have a quiz and the um the top three leaders on the quiz will actually win a coupon to take one of sarma's courses for free um so that's that's an awesome deal by the way um and of course you know we have our we have our Discord as well so if you don't want to um you know if you have an issue that's going on and you don't want to put it in the YouTube chat you can always hit us up on on our Discord Channel and um you know that as well will uh you know there's people in there watching that who can help you out as for the tools today in the chat I already saw someone asking hey is there anything I have to download for this and hey the answer is no um everything we're doing today is going to be on GitHub and gitpod as well as data Stacks Astor DB so everything that we're going to do Hands-On for this Workshop is out in the cloud um so no need to worry about installing anything okay well um let's go ahead and flip over to mentee for the the survey and the quiz oh you know what I should do I should actually like uh I should actually start it shouldn't I yeah let's uh let's do that there we go okay so I've started mentee and if I go over here and say menti it should show the code Maybe oh I wonder if um I wonder if nightbot's not running maybe I bet you that's it oh I have to press I have to press I okay there we go we got that um oh I see two people in there outstanding okay so let me just put the code in the chat as well just so that people see it 43 41 70 29. there we go um and you can join that at uh venti.com uh that should be be good and easy for everyone to get to um it's um you know you can also uh use your phone for this actually I recommend that if um you know you're running the workshop on your computer maybe you want to do mentee on your phone you know that's always always pretty easy to do oh yeah and the QR code um so yeah I can show that with I if if anyone wants to uh wants to see the QR code again that's an easy way to go ahead and uh and get that into your phone all right so we have oh hey we have 66 online so inside mentio 15 16 17 all right we're getting there getting there maybe maybe go uh another minute here just to uh you know give some folks a chance to join all right well um ah hey we got yeah 2021 all right we're getting folks in there you know maybe we'll uh we'll progress to the next screen here just to uh just to kind of get started in the uh in the interest of time and all right there we go okay so of course this is just a uh you know a couple of questions for us to get to know you just two specifically all right so where in the world are you um basically what you can do is you can take a pin here yep and people are already doing it feel free to go ahead and uh you know put down where you are um you know when uh and this is always interesting too because it allows us to see you know where in the world people are joining from and it's kind of cool that uh that you know we can all get together and kind of um you know learn together a little bit so uh so yeah I see yeah lots of folks in India Europe and of course uh US and Canada that's good that's good usually we have a couple in um like Brazil and Africa as well oh yep there's one in South America outstanding all right well I think we've um yeah I think we're I think we're good here let's uh let's jump to the next one the next one is going to be simple now of course this um you know this Workshop is going to be focused on python but you know we we know that all kinds of folks out there um all kinds of developers you know use astrodube and Cassandra so it's helpful for us to know um you know which which language you prefer what's what's your what's your primary language um so feel free to uh to enter that in um I don't see any coming through yet though I wonder if there's a it should be like it should be like creating a word cloud Adam um looks like there is a small bug on the minty side minty page uh it'll it doesn't show anything just the submit button um and what I see is uh what is your primary programming language question mark and then uh the answers are not there oh please enter a word oh yeah you can just put whatever you want in there yeah yes I see Python and CPP and python um PHP yeah yeah the page itself looks blank and white oh okay okay so probably not the most intuitive thing huh all right well of course we're seeing as expected for a python Workshop we are seeing a lot of um a lot of python out there so hey that's good that's good um a lot of folks with Java hey I'm a Java guy myself so love that love that I I see PHP yeah a little bit so that's that's cool all right and obviously we are asking programming language so Cassandra is smaller yeah okay excellent um I think what we can do is uh is move on here okay you know what I'm what I'm surprised about is python came out top like Java is the second you know that's surprising yeah you know we've been um we've been noticing that a lot actually which is um which is why you know it you know we I kind of welcome the chance when when you asked me if we could collaborate on a workshop to um to do this because I I knew that python is one of those that we keep seeing more and more folks wanting to know more about wanting to see more stuff done with python so I'm like oh this would be awesome you know sarma's got that that repo that we can we can bring in and yeah this would be great anyway so yeah so our topics for today um we're gonna be looking at um you know doing some like beginner-ish intermediate level python um and Cassandra of course uh we're gonna work on some data modeling or or specifically you know what we'll do is we'll look at the models that that sarma's built and we'll talk through them a little bit about um you know some of the the reasoning behind um you know certain decisions there and you know well of course we'll go through um the test generation and loading um yes serma did a great job in building something that will like kind of generate this random data um because that's really the really one of the hardest things with testing a big distributed system is getting a lot of data to actually put it through the paces um so we'll we'll kind of show you a little bit about that too um and then of course at the end we're going to expose that data with um some restful services using fast API with python so it's going to be pretty seriously cool all right well of course um you know kind of the uh the main thing behind this all um the main thing on the stat at the bottom of the stack is uh is Apache Cassandra um and for those of you who are who are new to Cassandra you know that that's okay um we're actually going to take you through a nice easy way to work with it today um but the cool thing about Cassandra is that it's it's big data ready it's it's easily linearly scalable um built out to um you know uh support high amounts of like read and write throughput um kind of the kind of the main thing that helps it do that is that um there's no like primary node um all of the nodes uh kind of work together um share data share requests you know any node can handle any transaction and that's actually um one of the things that makes Cassandra so highly available um and so sought after actually is that um you know when you have something that that kind of works like that that where everything is kind of working and um in Synergy you know so to speak is that um you know it it's hard for that for a system like that to go down which is which is really what we need in in today's world is something that's like highly available um and then really of course you know kind of the you know what I think is the coolest feature of Cassandra is the fact that it's it allows for geographical distribution so it's like data center aware so the cool thing is that you can you can have data centers on like East Coast us you know Central Europe and then like Asia Pacific and you can keep all of that data in sync yet local to where your users are that's a that's such a huge Advantage um and then of course you know it's it's like platform and vendor independent you know um Cassandra is an open source tool so nobody really owns it other than the the Apache software Foundation um and you can build it out into into any Cloud um and you can really run it on just about anything um I mean we have we have demos going years back of of people running Cassandra and like raspberry pies I don't recommend that for production but you can do it if you really wanted to so so one thing uh it already covers a lot of points over there um this is the only true masterless uh nosql database pretty much that I just want to point out uh there is there is no other nosql database which is so true masterless you know right all right so of course we talked a little about Cassandra well let's talk about Astor DB because this is what's going to make working with Cassandra really really easy um so essentially asterdb is a database as a service that's built on Apache Cassandra and the cool thing is that you can deploy it to all three major clouds um so no matter where you have your your services built out in um you can have your data like essentially being local to your services which is which is really really important so this is the um you know this is the the database we're going to be using today and if you haven't used it before you'll see just how easy it is to uh to spin this up and get it all get it all connected so um of course we're going to be using the Cassandra python driver um when we fire up our gitpod instance for developing out in the cloud you'll see that it's already going to be installed um however if you're on your own you can install it just by using like the the python package manager you know known as pip it's just a simple pip install Cassandra driver and that should get you the most recent one um otherwise Sarma you know you had a couple of great points in your repo about you know how to get it if if you don't have that that con that um constant internet connection like you know maybe going out and downloading it you know and then bringing it over on a flash drive or whatever um but you made a point about that if you you go the manual route that there might be some additional like Enterprise Linux packages you have to pull down with it or or install so usually um on the Linux servers if they were built properly you will already have those Enterprise Linux packages extra packages already available then when you don't have internet what we need to do is to get the driver as a wheel file which is understood by the python or the PIP install and you just manually install it what I noticed is after installing the driver itself you might not have all the optimizations enabled so we might have to do some extra work but the basic stuff should work yeah and we are talking about only when you don't have internet when you cannot run this pip install live right on the server okay um so hey we've kind of brought you through the introduction let's let's talk about the use cases that uh we're going to be applying this to today so really we just have uh two simple use cases uh we have a very simple employee database actually it's only one table but it but it'll allow us to do some some simple things and convey some understanding rather quickly um and then you know Sarma has a more detailed more more complex like sales uh back-end application that um you know we're gonna be looking at today too and uh and that's where we're going to kind of get into a little more on like the uh the data modeling aspect and why that's important and uh you know why certain decisions are made in terms of building out like uh like your primary keys um so really the employee table is pretty simple um it just keeps track of employee names and employee ID numbers um yeah when we get to the actual table definition you'll you'll see just how how simple that is but that's going to allow us again to do um you know to really familiarize ourselves with the tools and then when we get into something complicated we'll we'll have that Foundation that um that'll help us out there and then the sales application mainly that is meant to keep track of like you know users or customers um as well as like the the products that they can buy and then putting those products together inside of a of an order and um you know kind of processing that through so that's that's really what that what that sales application is is going to be about serma did you want to add anything on that or right so when I was uh when I was working on like you know a random data generator right um every every person here or even a small child understands how to order something online these days and sales is the most easy thing to explain uh because you you have a customer and you have some products to sell and all you do is make that customers buy the products so it is it is such a simple uh concept to explain and that's the reason we picked this and um as we go into the data model we can see how it is actually modeled for Cassandra and that's why uh we'll talk about it as we go all right excellent okay so hey that is actually going to take us to our to our first Hands-On here uh so the main thing that we're going to do is um you know first of all we're going to um to start going through the readme so if you haven't found um let me just make sure if I do a bang GitHub out in the chat that should all right I don't see that coming back um yeah I wonder if nightbot is not running out there here real quick let me oh yeah there it is okay it just took a second slides and instructions okay so that's the link in the in the um the YouTube chat that you want to go to to find the readme where we actually have all these steps laid out so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to create our astrodb instance so the database on the back end um and then we're going to start our um our git pod uh which is like our Cloud development environment so we're just going to do those those couple of steps and then we're going to continue on so let me jump to here there we go oh no that's the wrong repo of course there we go all right I got the right one so the uh the thing you can do in this this uh this step two here is that um we have this create Astra DB database button um and then underneath it you see things like database name for workshops and key space name for sales um and we can we can add that as we go along but that's that's really all there is to it so I'm going to right click here and say open this in a new tab all right so um I am actually going to click on Google to oh hey I already have an account so I'll sign in but if you're brand new this is where you'd create a new account um and again you can also do single sign-in with either Google or uh or GitHub um but I'll actually switch to sign in because I know that I have a uh a existing account and you know what's funny is that that first one uh the the sign up page had the old branding and then of course your the login as you can see here for existing has the new branding that's that's interesting I might have to I might have to take that up with um our Astra folks so I will say signed in with Google and this is going to spin for a little bit and my Aster dashboard should come up here in just a second all right here we go here we go okay um actually you know what I'm gonna do what I should have done let's uh dismiss our messages here um I'm actually going to terminate uh this workshops database so that you can see me build this up from um from scratch there we go let me get rid of my my existing one there all right so now I can uh close that and let's do a create database so now this create database button brings up this window um I'm going to say my database name if I look back at the readme here should be workshops yep all right and my key space name right here should be sales and we'll we'll talk about key spaces in in a little bit and and what that all is um but but essentially that it really just allows you a way for you to like kind of organize your your tables together um for the provider to stay on astrodb's free plan you want to stick with Google that's important and when you hit the drop down here what you'll see is all of the paid regions are are grayed out but the the free regions are actually able to select so for me because I'm in North America I'm going to pick us East one which is Monks Corner South Carolina so I'll click that and then I'll say create database all right so this is going to take a little bit of time here um for for it to come up let me just double check the readme all right so one thing I'm going to do while we're waiting is um you'll notice that I have this this generate token button now when we create a new database it is going to create a default token for us um but that token's not going to have the permissions that we need to do things like you know create tables and edit some things inside the schema so while we're waiting on that let's go ahead and click this generate token and as you can see I get my my token details Auto generated here oh you know it um it was supposed to ask me to pick a role but oh this is the auto generated okay okay okay yeah okay so this one this is the one that's not gonna not gonna have enough so delay my last there [Laughter] let's see here how about I do a um manage organizations I think that's it no ah um aren't you just pick your databases in a default organization I guess yeah right so so now you just click on the settings on the left menu bar yeah I think you're I think you're right that's where the tokens are I wonder if my uh my database is still on its way up though here let me let me click into that once well pending it but says it's okay well let's see here once well it's still creating yeah I think that might be part of it yeah we can even talk about while it is creating it right so basically what I noticed is when we uh want to do anything with Cassandra you set up the servers you have multi-node then you install the software look at Astra DB what we do is just select the organization create a database 45 seconds later you have a database running on a multi-node uh Cassandra basically yeah um so the settings I was talking about is on the left uh you know left navigation panel where you can get the tokens oh is that where that is I suppose you're the one that just created a uh a course on how to go through this yeah and I went through it and I I forgot that yeah sorry folks we've had we've had a bit of a restructuring the dashboard so every now and then I I guess I get a little confused myself so so now if I say token management ah outstanding yeah yeah thank you Sarma do you work for data Stacks or do I no all right so no so the the UI the interface is changing uh are evolving so fast that uh you know sometimes we have to look around but everything is let's go to this select role drop down and I'm going to say database administrator um and you'll notice that I get all these permissions here which is which is great because I'm going to need them and I'm going to say generate token um and your token is going to be generated um so you'll have like your client ID client secret client token um the you can say download token details and it'll actually like download it in a CSV that you can hopefully see at the the corner of my screen here um but really the main thing you're going to need is the token so um let me see here let me grab the token itself and um I'm just going to paste that off screen here but we're going to use it in just a little bit okay so we have our database and we have our token now um if I go back to the readme here you'll see that we have this git pod set up so you can do the same thing we just did with um going out to Astra and creating a new database you can actually you can do a right click on the open in git pod and say open in new tab now now what this should do and um I think I actually had my login credentials are probably my login session is still good out there um if you haven't logged into gitpod before it should ask you to pick your um Hub account and then to authorize that that GitHub account so that it that it can be used by gitpod um and the idea is is that what this is going to do is this is going to pull down uh the repo of um where the readme was that we were just on you'll notice at the bottom here that uh it's installing a few things you can see that the Astra CLI is going in there's the um there's the python Cassandra driver um so this is actually building up um um does anyone real real quick is anyone um watching on how we're doing on on YouTube Just it looks a little choppy on my end foreign yep you choose the database database administrator role yep that's the one you want so for for this Workshop obviously we are going to create tables we are going to do some admin related things we are choosing database administrator role but when we really do it at work for production workloads I would suggest not use the database administrator role for the tokens you have to see what your application is doing obviously Grant limited number of Privileges and when you also select the role it shows all the Privileges it is granting so just make sure you understand what you are giving away with the token you might be giving away too many privileges um YouTube um YouTube video is looking okay Aaron I I don't know if it is choppy for others like we can just get a feedback on the comments like if somebody can say is it looking good or somebody was saying that there's an echo too it's like hearing Darth Vader that's that's pretty funny run the um you know if you look at oh actually you know what the good thing about gitpod here is that um we're already in the readme so the readme that we were just at I don't need to bounce back you know over to my other browser tab um I can just go right down to this next command um which is this Astra setup so let me copy that and paste that command in now of course when you start doing this gitpod's going to ask you or your browser is going to ask you hey do you want to be you don't want to allow copying and pasting and of course you want to say yes um so I'm going to do this um this bash RC uh asterisk setup and what that's going to do is that's going to start the Astra CLI setup in a different session and that's that's important to make sure that um you know you can get all of your your environment variables faster CLI set up properly so this is where it's um it's asking me for an Astra token which I just pulled down before so I'm just going to oh yeah I wouldn't do that lucky that's that's a good idea sermon here let me let me do that there we go and let me adjust my uh screen real estate here there we go yeah no that that's why I have glasses too nope I I totally get it let me paste that token in just like that and the token you want um should have this this um this Astra CS colon prefix on it that's how you know you you're pasting the right thing so if I paste that in um it should say something like hey configuration's been saved um I can do like uh Astra DB list and it should yep there you go show um show all of my my databases I have my my learning one also also in there that's that's in a hibernated state but the workshops one I just created is indeed active so um if I go back up and look here yeah Pastor DB oh yeah yeah here we can we can list out our key spaces as well so if I do Astra DB list Dash key spaces and I want to do that for the workshops database just do that there you go you can see I have that one key space called sales and of course too if I want to see any other like um any other like meta information about the database I can do an Astra DB get workshops and that'll come back and tell me things like yes you're in gcp you know here's your database ID here's your uh you know gcp region that you're in um here's the creation time so I think that's oh yep okay so one of the other important things that we're going to do here is in order for our our python code to connect up to our database instance in Astra it needs two things one it needs that token which we just put into Astra CLI and the other thing it needs is the secure connect bundle so we're going to download that by pasting this command in right here in in Step 3B and I'm going to type it out just so that you can all see it Astra DB and it's download Dash SCB and it's Dash f for file and then we want secure connect workshops.zip and we're pulling that from the workshops database so just like that and when I run this you'll see that in our our project Explorer over here on the left that secure connect bundle has indeed been pulled down um and again that's really important because that's where our python code is going to look for it all right oh hey I'll find now no Echo now oh good all right good job Cedric thank you thank you okay so if I continue to go through here we have a um a DOT EnV file that we're also going to configure um so this command up here we have it we have a excuse me an EnV sample file um really we're just gonna copy that um EnV sample file to a DOT EnV and then we're also going to do a git pod open on it which will allow us to edit it so now you'll notice that we um we have our default um oh I have an X here right mental note is an extra double quote on the end um if you have that um yeah that that's totally my fault but if you have that problem you'll see that this bottom line here will like be in red um so yeah make sure that you make sure that you get rid of that but you'll notice that uh that reference to the secure connect Workshop zip um is right here for our secure connect bundle for our um client ID we are just going to type the word token just like that simple enough that's it just literally the word token and then for a client Secret this is where we're going to paste oh I need to I need to copy my token again I uh I totally missed that hang on all right and this is where we're going to yes paste our token just like that um so yeah so so again my bad on the on the EnV file um so for the folks at home make sure that you're in this uh line number four here make sure you've only got one double quote on the end um and there's a there's a question in the chat on on what is what's in the um you know secure connect bundle um and the the reason that we're we're using that is um typically if you were to go ahead and build up your own connection to Cassandra for like a database running locally or um you know just typically Apache Cassandra you would need um like a username a password you need the connection endpoint um and then if you're using SSL or TLS security which we are you'd need the um like the certificate repository you'd need the um the certificate key and um oh and then it's like the cert file or something like that it's like yeah it's like um I I could go look it up but there are like three components to the TLs secure connection that you need to have yeah it's a trust story that's the word I was looking for thank you sir um but anyway because we we want your connection out to Astra to be a both easy and secure we've gone ahead and built it out and do a secure connect bundle that you can just point it at and um it'll do all the the heavy lifting for you so that's that's the idea with it um I can also add few things here like if you if you see the client ID and client secret that's the credentials you're going to pass from your application to the Astra DB for Authentication but if you look at the user ID passwords here like credentials they're already pre-encrypted meaning astrodb provides you that connection bundle which has the public key and you know the certificates required to decrypt it on the server side so basically the connection bundle has all the certificates and the credentials you're passing using the client ID and client secret yeah thank you sir all right so hey so once we've created this dot EnV file you should be able to do a source.env there we go and now if I say EnV pipe grep Astra all caps I should get back um five lines but um all of the info that I've put in there above and that EnV file um should be here does it use Mutual TLS yes it uses two-way two-way TLS that's right all right so hey oh and and then one last thing we can do before we go back to the presentation um we can actually double check that we have the uh the python driver installed and that's very easy to do with a PIP show Cassandra Dash driver just like that and as you can see I do have version 325.0 installed all right okay I I think we're good um and just to just to remind the python Cassandra driver is completely open source yes all right so let's jump back to our presentation Okay so we've done this um and now hey we're going to talk uh some Cassandra data modeling here this is always fun oh and for some reason my um oh yeah my slide didn't come out quite right um this um you know what I suppose I can you know what you're gonna watch me fix this oh that's right it's hidden by that hey here we go how about we just connect that there all right and then and then I can I can put this back right there we go okay so now much better okay all right so um typically when you're when you're doing relational database modeling um you know one thing that um that that you know we're all taught in school when we first learn how to work with the relational databases is you know that we have we we try and keep our our data like um separate so that it doesn't have any like what they call transitive dependencies I mean the idea is is that our employee data should be separate from our department data and if we want to pull back information about employees and their departments we do a select from employees join on departments um but in Cassandra that's a little bit different um in Cassandra what we're doing is we're actually building a table to suit our queries um so the idea is is that if we want to query an employee with their Department data well we'll just build a table that will hold the all that data together um and the idea is is that yeah we're data modeling for performance tables to suit a query we get fast reads out of that we get a simple data model out of that um you know some people will point out the drawback that yeah in Cassandra you end up um duplicating some data but you know what you have to understand is that the relational database Theory came about from EF cod's paper that he wrote In 1970 when he was a consultant for IBM and even 10 years after that um in 1980 it's like if you wanted one gigabyte of disk you're going to spend a million dollars it was it was that expensive and now it's like I can go to Newegg and I can buy a terabyte drive for forty dollars you know so disk space isn't an issue anymore you know duplicating data isn't isn't this big horrible thing um now it's operational time that's really where the the money is gained and lost so kind of bearing that in mind let's take a look at um this data modeling from a Cassandra approach so we have a we have a sales key space um where we we have an employee table um and we're going to also build out our um our sales tables as well um and and the main thing to remember here is that your key Space is really just a logical structure containing your tables um it's a way to kind of kind of keep tables that support an application together so here's our employee table again you know like I mentioned this is very very simple um you know we're just doing a create table um sales for a key space dot EMP for employees um it has an employee ID that that EMP ID um then it keeps first name and last name and then really the um you know kind of the main thing here is that we're defining our primary key uh by employee ID so that's how we're going to query this table that that's so this table is built um to serve its data is by that ID so that's what we're going to use and we we pull data back on a per employee basis so real quick let's have a look at um the uh the two one simple demos folder and inside it there's this file called 01 cast demo EMP Cassandra table dot cql um and it actually has the um the Cassandra query language definition inside of that um so if I go ahead and open up the readme here and or sorry go back to get pod you can see in my project Explorer on the side I can open up that two one simple demos and inside that 01 demo EMP um oh when this pop-up comes up you can just um say yeah don't show again that's that's fine um but here's where where you can see uh we have that create table syntax um and then of course we're also just inserting um you know like two like some random data into there just so that we have um something in it so it'll insert employees a thousand one and a thousand three of Scott tiger and queen John um and then we'll go ahead um and it'll just do a select from that table just to pull it back and just show what's all in it uh Aaron did you notice who is Scott no I did not that is the oracle's default no way Scott tiger is the password you know Sarma I had no idea before they learned right yeah that that's funny oh let me quick jump back here I I think the um the only other thing I wanted to show in this slide and I know I'm not in presentation mode and I apologize for that but really this is just um hey let's um oh actually we've already done step uh 3A so that'll be easy um for step four in the readme we're going to do these simple employee demo um so let's uh let's let's do that quick so if I go back to the readme here you'll see that I can scroll to them for simple demos so to start this for 4A I'm going to CD directory and um gitpod does have autocomplete and its terminal so you can just hit Tab and uh you know that'll all right so now we're going to do this this get cast cluster info Pi um and really while this is going to do it's a simple you know what I can I can bring it up and show us here too um really all it is is um we're just doing a simple select of cluster name and release version um from the system local table now all Cassandra nodes and all astronauts will actually have this system local table so this makes for a great way to kind of test out your connection just make sure everything's working um and then you'll you'll see it's actually going to put in this uh cluster name and um and uh the the release version on the end here too um so if I go back to um our readme here see I just need to do python get cast and it auto completes I can go ahead and hit enter and if I've done everything right with my security and the EnV file I should see this connected to cndb that's the that's the name of the cluster um and you'll see that it's running this 400 6816 version um so this should be proof to everyone that um that hey we can connect and we're okay so if you're having trouble getting this to to connect up and work please say something in the in the chat um you know we we've got folks walking watching the chat so they can help you out um again you know I think kind of the main thing to watch for was just in that dot EnV file I had an extra double quote on the end so just just make sure you only have the one um but hey as as long as we can you can get this far I think we're in good shape all right so yep so this is the um the response you should get back um now the next step we're going to take is we're going to run that that cql file that we just looked at and we're gonna actually it's actually going to build that table out there into our Astrid database um so I'm going to do this Astra DB cql shell um on the workshops database I'm going to do a dash F per file and then this 01 cast demo EMP Cassandra table cql so I'm going to copy that and then paste that down here and this is going to load our cql uh DML or um or sorry ddl the the data definition language as well as some DML because we we have Scott tiger and queen John in there all right oh it sounds like our audio might be breaking up hmm ugh all right well so the next thing that we can do here is that with this um with this table created um we can go ahead and actually run this read write cast EMP Pi script um and again if I look at that in our project Explorer here um you can see that we're pulling in a database connection um we're in we're creating a prepared statement actually um and then we're inserting a new row into that um that EMP table um and then it looks like sarma's gone ahead and put in like like a random integer to go in there as well as a a uid for both first and last name just to get some random data and uh and get that in there and then it should go ahead and uh and show some of that data on the end here so if I jump back to the readme oh yeah so so quickly on on the python code right um I have seen a lot of people coming from different platforms to Cassandra and when they're writing their job or there is a confusion of home there is a read consistency and there is a right consistency meaning with every query you can have different consistency levels demonstrate that inside the python code you know this is what you would do uh you know right you will have predefined consistency levels which are suitable for your application and then you can just use them at whichever level you need and also all the statements I do a prepared statements because uh that that gives you performance at the application Level it's like a pre-compiled correct pre-compiled prepared statements and then there is a demo of how the consistency levels are used we we basically predefine this consistency levels even before the application code is written um which is in the settings yeah global settings um and obviously you don't want local Quorum you can tweak this yeah while writing you just write it with the consistency of Two And when you're reading you read it with local Quorum uh which whatever is suitable for your application yeah but it's all there in the pipe code that way at least if somebody is looking at a sample code for python all these best practices are already there in the code oh excellent you know and that brings up a good point Sarma is that um I I think I missed putting a slide together on consistency levels but it's it's important to call out in that um that is one of the benefits of Cassandra in that you know you can you can control how many replicas you'll wait for a response from before continuing on and that's that's exactly what something like local Quorum is is doing so yeah no trust me that that consistency needs its own presentation you know it cannot be a single slide all right so I'm gonna run this um python read write cast EMP script and it'll create a session out there okay okay um yeah it did insert that one row um and we're getting um employee 1001 Scott tiger back and if we look at um all the rows that are in here you can see that here's our Auto generated employee that we've uh that we've put out there so yeah that uh that totally worked all right so now if I scroll down a little bit now here now here's here's what the fun part comes in uh we're gonna do a very little bit of uh of working with uh with python with a restful API um so if you've ever used like um fast API or and uvicorn together um essentially what it is is fast API lets you expose your python methods as restful endpoints and uvicorn is a very very um small and simple web server that's just going to help host your uh your python code out um on your on your as a website basically um so I'm going to copy this ubicorn simple demo API app command I'm going to paste that down here and when I run that you'll notice I get it to say Hey you know here's a port available I need a thousand you know do you want to make it public you want to open a browser I can I can say open browser you'll notice that it's detail not found but we'll we'll come back to that um but really what I'm going to do here is you see this this plus right here in my my git POD at the top of my terminal you know more towards the right I'm going to use that to create a new terminal session um and really what I'm going to do from here is interact with my with my yuvicorn web server um so simply put um we're gonna we're gonna run some curl commands now for those who have never used curl it's a um you know like a like a command line web utility um lets you hit um you know like web endpoints from your from the command line very very useful and it's actually very ubiquitous too um I forget his name but I actually follow the guy on Twitter who's the creator of curl um it's basically written by like by like one guy and then you know he's had some other contributors along the way but I mean that utility is so ubiquitous um like if you bought a car in the last five years your car is running curl I guarantee it um so here let me let me go ahead and use Curl quick let's do a curl dash s for uh for silent and x and um if you haven't done a whole lot of um a whole lot of um like web requests before we're gonna do what's called a get request so I'm going to type that in all caps and um for our local IP we could either say localhost or 127.0.0.1 which is uh what I'm going to do just as an example and we want to go to Port 8000 and we want to go to the endpoint of cluster info just like that um and I'm going to jump to the next line because I also want to set a header content type of application Json just like that and if I run this if I did everything right yeah as you can see we get a web response back here with our um with our cluster info you know kind of like we did in that that python script before and the cool thing about this is I can actually take this slash cluster info and I can go to the web browser that opened before that I ignored and I could paste this on the end here and look at that now we're getting our um you know our data actually in a web browser um so so yeah that's that's kind of how this all how this all works together here um and if you want to you know you can take a look at um this simple demo API code um and you can see that hey this is where we're preparing our statement um here's our actual like like cql um we actually I actually did build out an employee object class that that we can use um and right here is where we're exposing this method um to the web so that we can go ahead and use it as a as a viable endpoint so yeah I think we have a couple other examples here once we want to get back to the presentation go ahead Sarah yes um so you know earlier when you started your fast API web server um and and I was working on the git pod earlier for example if you did not capture what port it was running on and everything uh you want to click on the ports tab oh good point right next to the terminal yeah there you go that's very helpful to see what applications are running inside your git pod and here is the quick link to oh these are the ports which are open yep that's right no good call good call all right so now let's say I wanted to add a new employee so um I'm I'm a big hockey fan so of course I'm gonna do Wayne Gretzky um with employee ID number 99. so um again I'm gonna copy this uh this curl command here and I'm gonna go to the use that backslash there to go to the next line I'm going to do a Dash D to send a payload and my payload is going to be a Json of emp8099 first name Wayne last name Gretzky and then I'm also going to send that a header of that that content type application Json and I'll do this and well I do get an employee ID back but the the real thing here is whether or not I can I can query that with uh with curl and do a get request and um and actually actually pull that back um and oh you know important to note I I should call out that when creating that employee I did what's known as a post request um so different from again it's it's where you're actually like creating new data and um and posting it out somewhere that's the that's the idea behind it anyway so if I paste that um that URL here to get employee number 99 it comes back with Wayne Gretzky um and likewise I can grab this employee slash 99 go to my web browser and I'm going to replace this cluster info with employee 99 and it also comes back all right oh and of course I also built a um an endpoint um with a with a limit here um so that um so that uh you know I can pull back like the first n rows of the database um so if I if I do an up arrow on uh on this command here um oh did that I'm not sure what that did but that copied a whole bunch of that's okay I'm gonna start over we'll just we'll just copy this blurb and uh and paste it in there and basically what that's going to do is a get of the top five employees from that table and as you can see here we get our Auto generated employee uh Wayne Gretzky's in there and then Scott tiger and John Queen are in there are in there also so so yeah um and I think that's it all right all right we can we can go back to the presentation so let me um jump back to here yeah well one small thing here sure Adam basically what we covered so far right I just want to give a very quick rundown we spin up our Astra DB we created a key space okay and using the git pod uh we basically had the Astra CLI connect to Astra DB we were able to uh create a new table which we are storing employees in this case yep uh using python code we were randomly able to generate data and put it into the table which is in Astra DB yeah using fast API which which is a Python's component of uh you know HTML or HTTP kind of interface we are able to get and post data into the Astra DB that's right so basically all the data is stored in astrodb we are using python to interact with it and uh I I love the fast API interface basically using python fast API you can take your application and put it on web yeah I mean it's a quick easy way to expose that yeah for sure exactly all right let me shut down my web server here and then I don't think I need that so we can jump back so still talking a little data modeling here here's Sarma but basically this is this is kind of the kind of the data flow um if you will of um of what your what your application sales application looks like so it's like you know we have users users create sales orders orders contain products and products have properties on them like quantity and prices and and things like that yeah so without going into too much detail the inventory system is already in place meaning uh when we have the products table which we'll talk about there is that product quantity on hand the last column right yeah right here um so what happens in the python code is when it is generating the data meaning when the sales are happening it actually goes and deducts the quantity on hand from this table meaning your inventory system is already inbuilt and then yeah let's let's go into the data modeling of these tables which are all sales related tables right so obviously we want to do the business we want to sell something we need products and that's the product stable over here um now primary keys are kept very simple for the products table and the users table we just want to query them by the product ID and product ID is run between like now it's a serial number between one two thousand or one to five thousand whatever uh depending on the system we set up all the other data including the price and quantity on hand are Auto generated at least in this scenario in this you know sales application we are going to use and as you see all the queries we are going to run they they already know which product ID we are looking for let's say uh the select statement will look like select whatever columns you need from the products table where product ID is whatever the exact number it is let's say product ID is five right so uh the data modeling for this table is pretty simple just a single column for a primary key and we know the product ID before we go and look up for the data so that was the reason we have a simple products table yeah all right well let's uh let's have a look at users you know and users is gonna gonna follow a simple or a similar query model I should I should say yeah yeah it's a it's a simple and similar as I said you know uh obviously we have a lot of products what do you do with them you have to sell so so you have the users or customers I just I just did not call them customers uh I just say users okay users who use this system um so every user is assigned a user ID we know the user ID that's why it is a primary key so every select statement which comes into the system will say where user ID is let's say 10. um and then user email ID username phone number platform State all of them are randomly generated but they look like real data because you know all the randomized strings are are somehow there is a pattern to it um and since we need data to be very random meaning not all users will be in the same state so when we generate this user's data randomly it uses other lookup tables to get the what states are available in uh in US basically when I was coding the system I said okay let's start with a single country you know don't confuse it with so many different complicated scenarios even though it is us us you can tweak the data there is there is one simple lookup table data loader SQL file where you can change it to suit for your region let's say you are from uh you're from UK you make it look like UK data so that's not a very difficult thing so that's simple users so you have products you have users let's look at the next table Yeah so this is this one is where it starts to get a little a little tricky but but yeah so here's where we're tracking like actual orders that have gone through the the sales system right um so if you look at all the columns in the orders table um obviously this is the actual sale happening or you can call it as a header Row for the sale um like you know when you generate an invoice who purchased it what time it happened what is the total that kind of information is all present in in this table and earlier as you mentioned uh you know in Cassandra data modeling we would like to keep all the data in one place for whatever you want to query you don't have to do any joins with the other table so if you look at the user data almost the last five six columns which are all user data right we actually put them in this table so that we don't have to go read the user table for getting okay who was this user by the way we know that the sale happened but who is this user right that information is here now we don't have to copy all the columns from the user table but I just chose to put all these columns yeah it's whichever one relevant for the order yeah that totally makes sense exactly exactly um and also in nosql databases it is very common I have seen in past that you know say for example order date you want to break it up your application wants to break it up as okay what was the order hour in which hour did this order go through or what was the order month you just want the month stored as a separate column and it is pretty common practice if you want to break up the date into multiple parts and you store them as separate columns it depends on the application now what I chose to do here is this is a composite primary key you can see there are two columns in the primary key or the partition key and then you have two other columns as clustering columns um so basically the way it is partitioned you take the order date let's say for today and Order hour is let's say eight o'clock in the morning right so whatever orders happened in the eight o'clock hour are stored in one partition and inside the partition using these clustering columns the order timestamp gives us that order so basically all the orders which were placed today in the eight o'clock hour all of those orders are in our in a ascending order properly and then order code is uniquely generated uuid and that provides the uniqueness within the partition yep so so that just basically makes the query now if you want to run some analytics later on I say hey what was the sale for the given hour so here is the perfect scenario where this table will be able to serve you with all the data required for that one hour and you can do your analytics on it let's say what was the popular item which was sold your network um actually actually yeah maybe that's on the next one right correct that is that cannot go to this is how much we generated uh money because there is order total you can just sum it up um so that's the sales orders table where it gives you the high level of what that order contains go ahead to the next if we go on well here's the yep here's here's uh what products were in what order yep on what date yep and this is pretty much uh similar to the previous table uh we want to not just know what so we we have the order date in the partition key as the First Column the second column is the order code which is unique orders so all the orders which were generated on a specific day ah for that order code there will be only one row but there will be multiple products sold to based on that order let's say Aaron is buying something today he has one order in and that order will contain let's say 10 products so that's how the partition will look like so partition will contain all the products in one place and the product ID column which is a clustering column which will provide that uniqueness for each row within the partition okay so I I'm I'm sure we have to you know play with this data models a little bit uh Cassandra data modeling is little bit tricky but over the period of time I have seen that you know your mind just works with right like as you see the tables you'll get used to it and I would I would say just keep doing the data modeling data modeling is one of the trickiest uh well that that's what gives us success yeah that's right that's right yeah okay um so hey kind of the main thing to pull back from these slides we've just looked at is that primary key is is really the integral piece to how you can query data from that table um so that's that's that's kind of the the main thing to remember there all right so hey um we can now look at the the data definition language for the um for the sales create tables cql and if I remember right I think there's a Hands-On immediately after this one too yes yes there is all right so uh yep five and five a so let's uh let's jump back to here for a second um I can close both of those files but I'll leave the um I'll leave the readme open in my project Explorer I'm going to close this two one simple demos directory and expand this three one sales app and I'm going to click on this O2 sales create table cql um and you can see that that we're going to start coming across um a lot of those definitions that we were talking about and beforehand Sarma you also mentioned about creating like lookup tables you know for common data like like States and you know maybe like easier ways to generate email addresses like um like this um and those are the ones that we're going to run across first um oh and yes of course also things for um like product categories you know some other other metadata there but here is the data for our users table um and if we scroll down a little bit more you can see products um as well as our sales orders and sales order products are all in here um so yeah now Sarma at the bottom here you actually do a little bit you do um two Alters to set the default time to live or set a TTL on those tables what's what's the uh the thought behind that so um when we do the Cassandra data modeling uh the most interesting thing Cassandra offers is something called time to live um I I know that many other databases also do this this is a very interesting concept is let's say you you're generating all this test data and some of this let's say for example temperature data right you collect temperature data every five seconds and at the end of the day you just need to keep the you know highest and lowest and you don't care about keeping everything else let's say right and you want to delete it after two days because the data is just invalid so whatever invalid data or like whatever is not useful any longer when you decide to delete it instead of doing delete commands which which put lot of pressure on the system uh Cassandra offers something called time to live and when we use this time to live setting on the table level whatever new data is inserted it comes with a invisible column let's say inside the table with every column there is a timestamp and it says okay this row will disappear after whatever number of seconds so you can see that calculation in the comments this data will be disappearing after every 15 days so the new data after 15 days will be well it will not disappear automatically but there is a lot of process behind it eventually um just to mention you know repair and compaction takes care of it so uh it's it's the garbage collection process you know Java already has garbage collection and that just process was just put into Cassandra well Cassandra is built in Java so the mindset was already there so that's the reason we have the time to live settings here which is also a good demo for like you know how do you do data modeling don't forget that you have TTL and I I still have a lot of people come to me say hey I want to purge data and I would give you the purge scripts I said no let's use the TDL yeah so there you go all right so hey so we've we've had a look at that let's take a look at uh step five here so on my uh my screen here or my terminal I should say I'm your CD um out of the two one directory and then into the three one sales app Auto Sales generator all right um and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to tell um Astor DB cql shell that I want to load um or that I want to run the cql commands that are that are in this uh in this file into my workshops uh database so I'm going to copy that command and paste it here all right so it should make a connection and put everything in there we go and we can also we can also verify this too so if we we do this asteroidb SQL shell workshops workshops sorry with a dash e-flag the dash e will allow us to run one single command um inside of a SQL shell so I'm going to use it to do a describe keyspace sales because that's going to show me all the tables that just got created um actually sequential is so powerful right you can run multiple commands the trick is just semicolon yeah you can pass it with uh with a semicolon in there yeah yeah exactly all right yeah so there's our one of our lookup tables so yeah so another another interesting thing is while obviously it created all these tables I always try to hide things here and there like you remember the spot tiger from if you look at the platforms I I really loved the way we came into smartphones a lot of people forgot that we had blackberries so in the platforms there is an interesting pun about it is the lookup user platform there is a Blackberry entry there well you don't have data yet I guess oh right right because that was just the that was just the um the cql yeah yeah but but you should you should run it I mean you should totally run the select statement if you need to you know what I can get it ready and that way um when we we do it next time it'll be staged up right exactly and that was um yeah look up user platforms and I already typed my key space so I have that in there twice there now that should come back empty yes yes it does okay okay so now that we're kind of kind of focusing on the lookup tables um uh Sarma has a cql file here that that is designed just for that load data in lookup tables so yep let's go ahead and uh run this it's just bunch of insert statements you know pre-canned lookup table data like platforms uh it generates like you uh States like United States all the states in the table all right so now if I tab back to our select from that table I should see some um user platforms including the the Blackberry you mentioned oh yeah look at that and uh and let let me know if you have another favorite from that list well you know I've I've been I've been a uh you know a Linux guy forever you know so that's that's probably the one that I would uh yeah but I would associate with most there yeah look look at Mozilla yeah yeah all right so the other thing we can do too and I've already done a little bit of this of that queer I just ran but you can do an astrodb sequel shell workshops um and actually look at some of these tables individually I'm going to skip that just in the interest of time to uh kind of keep us moving along a little bit here but if you look in the readme I actually do have um you know just some quick examples of of where we've done that all right and the next one is about generating data so I think yeah we just wanted to do five and five a so okay so back to the presentation okay data loading all right so now the idea is to have a look at that three one uh sales app that sales app generate orders pie and global settings Pi those are really the um you know kind of like the the the two the two two files here well the settings is mainly yeah just about you know how many you want to generate of each um the generate orders kind of assumes you've already run generate users and generate products but it but it's really the one that puts everything together here um so if I jump out of this for a second oh and of course right after we're done to that we have our esteps uh 5B 5C and 5D okay okay so let's have a look first of all at our uh our global settings now you have a few of them out here based on like you know t-shirt sizes like large medium small um I've actually put together like kind of a a custom one for this and I was running through this uh this whole thing on Monday and I realized that um you know a thousand users and all those thousands of products and and you know orders was really gonna take more time than we wanted during the workshop um so I went ahead and set users down to 200 which still takes a little bit so you know what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to let that run now while we're talking because that does that does take a little bit of time so let me do this uh this python sales app generate users and I'm going to run this and let it go while we're while we're kind of discussing what's uh what's all Happening Here um so so yeah so Sarma so this is this is where you know you mentioned before about you know defining the um the read write consistency levels um you can control how many users get generated you know numbers of products orders and I like this one this um this Max products per order so it'll like it'll kind of oh is it a minimum of five so it picks either like five or six in this case so I you know the coding such application is very difficult you know what happens is um inside the code there are certain places you have to hard code few values right so now how do you how do you hard code like hard code minimum of two or minimum of three it becomes too small for a random generator you know and we all know that you know on computer computers today even with random generator it's not really random right there is a pattern to it so you know it was a very difficult choice of whether I should have minimum of two minimum of five I just came up with the five okay and if you look at the look at the orders uh minimum of 10 orders right even though it takes little bit of time and I think right now your users are generated and you should you should run the generate products because that is going to generate like thousands not a little bit too yep so so yeah you can just try we're on the step 5B that's that's where we're doing a lot of this go go ahead Sarma now what I was saying is run the generate products and then I'll explain what we are doing in these two steps here right all right very good um so so obviously we built all our uh tables on astrodb we said okay these are all the sales tables we loaded some lookup Data before we start generating sales we need users so in your previous step pattern you generated all the users and on this system you generated 200 random users they're all everywhere spread across us and now now you're generating the products basically you generated 100 products now it is 200 products so you need to sell products and I think you're generating thousand products I think so so yeah yeah so once you have the users and products generated all the data is stored in the Astra DB you can also switch to your Astra dashboard and you can see the reads and writes have increased the storage has increased you can just quickly show the while it is generating right yeah yeah because I just don't want myself to feel like oh we are pushing all this data where is it going it's going into Astra um is my guess yeah and we've definitely done more than than four right requests in just the last year I know I know yeah but eventually you can see this here and and you know uh it's generating all the products right now I think it is generating thousand products I think so I think so yeah do you have questions about the code itself no I I don't I I think this is a this is a really cool idea you know um you know because it it allows you to um to kind of build out products that or sorry data that's that's specific to or a little more specific to what the context of your application is running in um and that's where you look at things like um if you've ever used Cassandra stress Cassandra stress does the same thing but it's purely random you know Cassandra stress has no idea about really what you're trying to do with it um which is why I kind of like this approach of you know coming up with with a good schema you know coming up with you know at least in some cases for the for the lookup tables oh hey it's done um of generating some um some data that that kind of makes sense for your application um we have one question on YouTube I think you should spend like at least one minute talking about it what is local what is local Quorum yes you know what let me kick off step five C here of generate our uh our order data very actually order data is pretty good because you're not generating thousand orders that's true um but you know the the idea with um with local Quorum is that um we're staying to our we're telling our our app that we want to say to our local data center um now our local data center really gets defined if I go back and look at this dot EnV oh no I I we we used to have it in here you know what I bet it's um I bet it's in the secure bundle but anyway it's um it's it's stick it's being sticky to that U.S east one data center for now that's that's kind of the idea there um and so that's what the local part does so that way if you have like an East Data Center and a West data center you know your application in the East isn't jumping to the west to get its data it's staying local to the east um and the Quorum part is really about um you know if you look up the definition of Quorum it's you know it's it's a simple majority uh so the idea is that you do um some integer arithmetic to figure out what um what your Quorum value is so typically in Cassandra and as the default in in Astrid b um we have it set to to place three replicas of each piece of data so what's going to happen is on a query at local Quorum you know if you take Quorum of three three integer division divided by two is one plus one to get a majority is two so that's how you get your your Quorum of two from three replicas so really what what each one of these requests is going to do is when it's when it's going ahead and doing a right to the table it's waiting for a response back that two replicas have been written before it moves on to write the next one um and the same thing on reading you know when you when you read data at Quorum it's sending a request out to all three but it's really only waiting for a response from Two and as long as those two agree bam it's fine and it'll it'll move on so yeah that's a that's a great question all right so hey according to and oh sorry and why while while you're explaining actually I was looking at our secure bundle yeah and there is there is a file in there which is a Json file which tells what is the local data center that's right uh while while we create the token uh and um we also download the secure bundle we actually specify which data center is your default data center if you had multiple data centers right right uh if you had only one data center for Astra DB it might not ask you the question but it puts that in the Json file when you download the sector one rule yeah no that's yeah for sure for sure and that's yeah that's exactly where it where that all gets defined um so yeah so now that we've we've got this let's let's take a look at some of the data that we've uh We've generated here um so I'll do an asterdb uh cql shell and workshops to tell it to go to the um the workshops database um and I can do just a simple use sales to make sure that all of my cql commands um kind of stay in this uh the sales key space and that way I don't have to prepend all of my tables with uh with the sales key space name either but I can do a desk tables and you can see that um hey all of my uh my tables come back here hey this is great um let's just do a quick sampling of of each of the ones that we've we've generated here so if we do a select star from users um now we're going to query without a where clause typically in Cassandra you don't want to do that um but if you if you throw a limit on there at least it'll kind of short circuit that query early um so it's it's not putting a whole lot of stress on your system so I'll do like a limit five on that that users table and as you can see we get uh some users back complete with um oh hey there's a Blackberry user Simon all right [Laughter] but I can do the same then too with um the product so I I do I do have a question here it's it's just true helpful for everyone right we are not putting a where class and you are connected to one coordinator node which will go get the data right so the limit does it does the limit command keeps it in local node or does it still go to the different nodes to gather the data it'll still have to go to the different nodes to to get the data yeah it'll still go based on um on primary token range ownership um and yeah and that all that all depends on again like the hashed values of whatever you're using for your for your partition key so it is going to multiple nodes but it's just it's just kind of stopping itself you know that's the difference between you know doing it five times isn't a big deal doing it five thousand times that you know I I don't know if I do that yeah so you're you're now going into the murmur 3 deep into murmur three yeah um so yeah so hey so hey we've got uh we have products out there um I can take a look at sales underscore orders I think that's what it is right sales orders yeah there we go so we did get some orders created that's uh that's a plus yeah you can you can even limit it to like two rows that'll uh make it look better yeah because we don't have much space here in the car that's a that's a good point yeah and I can do a sales order products I think is what the next one yep there we go there we go so uh so yeah so I I think we're uh I think we're good here um so let's uh progress in our our read me a little bit here um oh yep okay so the next next we can talk about uh using fast API with this so let me jump back to the presentation here yep we've we've generated our data and we've verified our data so we know what's out there all right so now let's let's take a look at our our restful service layer you know using fast API with ubicorn here um I talked a little bit about um you know some of the uh the web request methods um in our previous example we used both uh both get and post um but you can also use put um there there's a debate out there you know about when is the right time to use post when is the right time to use put generally speaking if you're writing new data you're doing a post if you're updating data you're doing a put um and then of course there's there's delete also that one's not used terribly often but um you know you absolutely absolutely can it's it's a you can you can kind of process it in a similar way um as to um as to how you're doing like uh like a write um which really if you think about it delete is a right inside of Cassandra anyway so that's that's not far off um all right so for our restful service layer to to kind of hit these um we have we have several um back-end Services here that that I've exposed um but you know it allows us to pull back um users and products by ID uh we can pull back orders by uh by an ordered date and and an hour um as well as products for an order you know based on a date and then like an order code or an ID um again just based on time I want to save some time for the um the quiz at the end too so I'm not going to go through all of these but I mean feel free to to explore uh this uh this API as much as you want um essentially how each one of these is built you know if I'm going to focus on the um the user by ID service here um essentially what we're doing is we Define our prepared statement ahead of time and we check to see if that prepared statement has already been instantiated um and if it hasn't that's when we go ahead and we run this um session dot prepare along with our cql um and our where Clause going to that user ID equal one um so this is uh this is yeah this is in Python this is how we kind of kind of like set up our our prepared statements brought this up before but remember prepared statements equals faster queries because what happens when you reuse a prepared statement it doesn't have to run it through the parser again it can just go ahead and pull it by that prepared statement ID that it has in Cassandra's uh prepared statement cache and it just goes super quick that way yes exactly it is like a pre-compiled code a lot of people you know even in the training sessions they keep saying python is inter interpreted language but if you go look at your python code after running it there is a hidden folder which has a compiled code in it so and then that gets compiled uh you know to run it quickly it is called Pi cache yeah so you can do some research yeah nice little parallel there all right so also you know to kind of help out with um with our restful call I've created a um you know a user object class here um and again it just kind of has has columns that match or has properties I should say which match the columns in that um that user Cassandra table um so this is uh this is this is pretty simple but um this is where we put it all together this is this is really where we have that um that get user method which is exposed with this slash user slash ID here um so as you can see we uh we get our session which uh which should already be created in the background and remember with with connections and sessions uh with Cassandra you really only ever want to create one and then just reuse that one over and over again that's um we're going ahead and um getting our prepared statement and again remember we've got that check in there that says hey if my prepared statement has already been created there's no sense in re-preparing it we can just reuse it um and then we're doing a return ah oh I didn't want to do that doing a return um where we're we're mapping our um user object model we're mapping it to the actual like um uh rows that are returned and we're doing a four each down here inside of that session execute against that result set to make sure that it's matching all those up as they as they come back um so those are really kind of like the three pieces that make up each one of these Services is is kind of that prepared statement and then like the object model and then the um the method that's exposed uh via restful service all right so really I think this is the last one here wow hands on number six we're moving along is really just to um just to kind of explore that that API there so if I jump out of here let me just see we've got okay yep yep yep all right so if I go back to um my get pod um what I can do is jump down to oh I got ahead of myself here we go ubicorn sales app API all right so I'm just going to paste that command in and what that's going to do is again look for my sales app API pi and we actually just went through some of the code which is which is in that um so we'll be utilizing that in a second here all right so now if I go back to my my other um terminal session here I can do a clear just to you know kind of kind of clear that up a little bit um let's go ahead and pull back a user so I can do a curl here we can we can use that um that user endpoint that we were just looking at I'm pretty sure user 1001 is out there um and again I'm going to want to make sure that I'm setting this um you know content type in the header just so that my my Json looks okay oh it didn't like that oh did we generate only a thousand users oh maybe you know what I bet you I bet you that was it I have to stay under here let me go let me go 101 instead of a thousand okay there we go right I forgot that you generate the user ID sequentially [Laughter] yes so you see this this user is still using Mozilla from Florida yeah yeah let's see up and we can we can also look at um you know some of our our products as well so that same um let's see here although I'm probably going to want to edit this because I'm pretty sure I only generated a thousand products yeah we'll just we'll just do that oh there we go and then let me add in my uh my header on there there we go so you can see this is this product I've pulled back is is under garden tools um and it costs um 37 and 26 Cents and oh oh we only got one on hand actually we have 1356 of them on hand so we're okay we're okay in the uh in the quantity Department there now for orders let's go ahead and actually have this doing a limit five here but uh let's let's just look at um you know and maybe I'll maybe I'll edit that there we go do a two um oh right you know what oh just because I had the extra slash it's because I had the extra slash um and I didn't send the the header along but that's that's okay for now we can we can see what's going on here so um here we see we have our order time stamp um and then we also have our order hour and that's actually going to be important for pulling back orders that were generated in a certain hour which is um what we're going to do next here so I know in the example it says January 1st of or sorry January 20th um which was a date that I put the readme together but you'll want to make sure that um there we go that you're adjusting that date based on what we've just done here so today is February 8th so I'll go 20 23 um and I'll say oh 2-08 and then we'll say our and the hour in GMT I believe was 17 so I'll say that and there we go now we have orders with products coming back here um now we're that we're all done in that hour which is basically all of the orders that we uh that we just generated um and I can actually see using this last one here um products for a specific order if I just go ahead and grab date there and then the date as we know is 2023-02-08 um and our order code let's see if I can quick find an order code in here [Music] um I see it on the 14th line huh don't scroll oh yeah okay here we go thank you Sarma I was having a hard time pulling it out of that that uh text soup there all right so let me put the code in and now if we run that we should get products back for just for a specific order um that we that we placed before so yeah you know like like I said um you know feel free to uh you know like clone this repo you know explore this um yeah so um essentially I think that's about all we've got for the uh the Hands-On serma so if you if you look at closely like the whatever output you got in the previous terminal right um so whatever the order was you see the light bulbs there were nine of the light bulbs which were sold in the top oh yeah look at that and uh product price for each of that light bulb is 43 dollars I don't know why it is so much well you don't have to buy oh well nowadays we have Wi-Fi enabled light bulbs they cost a lot of money yeah so so obviously this data now uh what I was envisioning you know what what I wanted to always do was take this data and do some analytics you know can we do Predictive Analytics like say for example what would be sold tomorrow that would be great uh opportunity and while you are showing all this I was thinking if we had you know obviously it will come come out sometime soon everybody is talking about chat GPT using API during data generation I can say hey tell me about a garden tool right and then use that actual description and the product name put it into a good point yeah you can again it's it's all about that that application context and you can use chat GPT to do that yeah yeah that's not a bad idea all right well I think if I if I bounce back to um our presentation here all right so hey yeah that's uh that's pretty much about it um I think the next thing we've got is the uh is the quiz on mentee so if everybody still has many yeah good stuff sorry what good stuff I'm saying let me jump back to where I have this going all right remember out on mentee we have um I'm gonna put the code in here just so that everyone can see it again there we go 43 41 70 20. oh wait and nightbot's working hey thank you nightbot all right so um we're gonna go ahead and and start the quiz um the idea is is I I think there are five questions in here um that kind of relate to the things that sermon I have shown so far um if you answer faster you'll get more points so it is kind of timed and um the idea is that um the top three winners will get a coupon to take sarma's I think it's I think I think it's called everything you need to know about Apache Cassandra right which is like a it's like a seven hour course on udemy there's a ton of content in that um so that actually is a really really sweet deal um so so yeah and thank you Sarma for uh you know putting those uh putting those coupons up as well and offering those out so that can't long ago like um I think it was like two years ago uh but but still very valid like you know people I have seen like most of the people I interact with they come from the rdbm background right so the course itself is designed in such a way that I'm telling you everything about Cassandra whatever you need to know but if you're coming from rdbms background you can just relate to it like that so it's just useful yeah yeah started here all right so if I move on all right so yes quiz time all right so kind of like a oh you know what you know before we before we dive into this um you know melroy brings up a good point that he doesn't see the purple background let me just punch this into menti and see what I get back here foreign so our code is four three four one seven zero two nine okay okay yep yep and that's that's okay it like reset everybody it looks like ugh I'm sorry about that look yeah let me wait a minute for everybody to jump in so yeah Sarma Sarma go ahead now what I was saying is just five high fives or just high fives I did see that screen before probably you had to just refresh your mentee screen um okay okay and and once you get the the quiz time slide on the minty screen you can just do a thumbs up all right ah yep somebody's there said in this chat I opened a mentee in a new instance and it works so that's that's good to know yep yep um I know we had like like 20 some in there just before and I see 10 now so maybe we'll wait just a second for uh for everyone to get a chance and get uh get squared away in there good I see 11. yep new tab new tab um if that's that's how you say your name uh thank you for for pointing that out that that new tab's a good idea yep yeah so minty looks like we we just have to refresh the browser window or start it fresh okay all right 12 oh 13 14 good good good all right well I think um I think we can get started here um oh so yeah um there there's been an important note posted in the chat the question will show up first on your screen with a delay from YouTube because remember there is like a couple second delay between what Sarma and I say and what we show and what happens up on YouTube you'll want to pay attention to like your phone or your other browser tab or um or something like that just to make sure that you're you're getting in at the right time to answer so all right we got 14 that hasn't changed in a while let's uh let's move on here all right so question one of six oh we got 19 in outstanding and here we go answer faster to get more points which is a true statement about Astra DB it's a database as a service it's built on Apache Cassandra can deploy to AWS gcp and Azure or all of the above that's a trick question I mean I mean technically they're they're all correct but really they're you know yeah yeah it's the it's the all of the above um so yeah yeah and yes like you said uh Cedric you know yep just warming everybody up yep all right all right okay leaderboard from the first question all right all right Watson Dr centipede and Tom are our leaders all right okay moving on for the next question here all right two of six ready ready and remember answer faster to get more points why should you prepare cql statements and prepared statements are required speeds up your queries ensure they're ready for the send stage to properly cook them for guests every now and then we have a goofy one in there I actually pulled this one from another another presentation we had I hope nobody picks that one okay yeah nobody picked that one all right all right to speed up queries most of you got it right outstanding outstanding it's showing the next options for me without the question ugh yeah Miller I'm not sure what could be what could be going on be going on with yours I'm sorry about that a minty is really acting up today yeah yeah for sure all right well let's uh take a look at our leaderboard here all right it is still a battle of of Watson Dr centipede and Tom and Dr centipede was the fastest that time so hey good good good all right let's move on to the next one here all right question three of six oh there's six oh I thought I only had five in there all right I could be wrong all right which cql command should we use to query data are we when we query data cql are we doing a select a get a poll or create actually I think this one's pretty easy but that's that's just me there we go there's a select yep yep yeah I I know the the get could have uh could have been a little on the confusing side uh because we did talk about get for web requests but really again in a web request is doing a select underneath the hood at the uh at the database level all right let's check our leaderboard for any shake up here oh a little bit of a switch yep we've got Pingu joining Watson and Dr centipede in the uh in in the top three here ah millery brings up uh you know a point about you know it's it prevents injection attacks and and that should have been an option well the thing is is that for SQL yes it does for Cassandra cql you can only run one command at a time that way through a prepared statement um it'll stop you it won't it won't let multiple commands run um so that in itself will protect protect that um your typical injection attack but uh but no that's a good point because that that does actually happen in like publicly exposed apis that sit on top of SQL um related databases so I do have a follow-up before you go to the question right um I'm just asking because this came up the SQL injection um the SQL does not allow multiple queries to run or is it the driver which stops you to run in the prepared State you know that's a good point because you can get away with it from from using Astra CLI and from using cql Shell at the command line um I bet it's the that's a good point I I wonder if it's the prepared statement itself and the driver that doesn't allow that that that could be that could be that's my guess too but we have to go back and have a look at that yeah all right question four everybody's ready here what is a key space all right I think I made a point to to call this one out um space to store SSH Keys Secrets management for Astra a dark website for betting on the Super Bowl or a logical structure for containing our tables all right most of you got it yeah there we go logical structure containing our tables outstanding I I think I think we have everyone here today is all Cassandra experts yeah nobody nobody picked that one about betting on the Super Bowl I thought for sure I'd get one to get one person on that now [Laughter] all right okay oh constant learner has jumped up into the top three so hey we're uh we're moving along here um with uh with two questions to go to uh yeah kind of kind of rounded this out all right question five of six here we go here we go which cql directive restricts how many rows are returned from a query is it filter less than limit or top and we went over this one quite a bit oh wow yeah almost everyone got that one that was good that was good all right the top was myself I just wanted to see what happens oh that okay that makes me feel a little bit better okay good good all right so let's see uh let's see how we how we fared this time yeah lots of people got this one right so basically it was a matter of how fast how fast he answered um Watson maintaining that uh that tight lead there um actually Watson's a pretty pretty far ahead of of Pingu and constant learner but you know at this point I think you know a few others could uh we could see a shake up here with this last question um so hey yeah yeah good job everyone all right moving on question six of six this is it this is for everything all right okay just a second here for everything to come through all right everybody ready here we go which part of a table definition determines how that table can be queried is it the clustering order the primary key a secondary index or a foreign key I feel like we did a good job of hitting on this one today but yeah we'll see hey all right we got we got a lot of people got that one there we go there we go but yes the the answer there it definitely is definitely is the the primary key yep all right so our final leaderboard how did we shake up here oh Pingu is our champion followed by Watson and Tom um so so hey yeah go ahead sorry I have a question so do you do you know if minty selects those pictures along with the name it does uh automatically okay then you should remove me from the list I'm watching you're watching what are you doing no I was not I was not sure what happened was when I was trying minty it did not ask me what name and also it did not ask me the watermelon so I just wanted to check that's why I dropped down now you should make a note of who is the three people Pingu yeah Tom and Dr centipede not on Dr sanity that that's right yeah yeah please know that so okay so to claim your coupon uh from Sarma you know I I have instructions what what to do here next so so don't um you know on your phone um is is where you want to um is is where is what you want to um screenshot so yeah so you look at this come on come on hey okay here we go so you see the one that's okay here it'll say you finished third or or whatever you finished or um you know so so we'll accept um you know first second third and fourth this time uh you know because Sarma but um you know like showing the leaderboard like I just had well I mean anybody could take that screenshot right um you know so so basically whatever you've got that says what you what you finished that's what you should take and email that screenshot to me um and I'll make sure that you get your coupon code for uh for serma's course on on udemy all right oh we're at 11 59. wow we are like we're like right on time I didn't even plan that this like this like came out like perfectly all right hey you know I just wanna just wanna put out a plug for our um our Discord server again if you have any questions on Cassandra or ask your DB you know feel free to reach out and uh and hit us up on that um on that Discord server um you know we're we're happy to help you and you know we have folks who watch that you know at all hours of the day so wherever you are in the world it doesn't matter we're we're out there and we can help you um of course you know check out our our data Stacks Developers YouTube page obviously if you're if you're here you know you know where it is but um you know we have all the other videos out there of all the other workshops and some other things that we've done um feel free to have a look at those and uh same thing if you if you find yourself stepping through an older workshop and you have questions you can reach out on Discord and we're happy to help you out um hey I already mentioned Discord but um you know we have um as other resources we have like academy.datastex.com um it's I believe it's driven by like uh catapod where it takes you through kind of like um you know some learning exercises um you know you obviously you've you know our workshops and our YouTube channel are but um you know that that's really kind of the one new thing on here um is that yeah absolutely check out uh datastacks Academy um that'll be uh that'll be a big help to some folks and hey you know you're not alone in your journey again I've talked about Discord a lot but you know again there's our our Discord URL um feel free to ask questions that are development related out on um the Cassandra tag and stack Overflow if they're infer related you know like um hey you know why is uh why is my repair hanging that's a good question for DBA stack exchange again in the Cassandra tag um and of course I can't talk enough about sarma's courses you know check them out on on udemy um he's um Aura mad uh that's his uh that says user out there if you go to udemy user or a med you'll you'll find Sarma out there um with uh with uh you know all those other courses he's just putting out there on um on asterdb that's uh that that's really good too I've run through that one so so yeah all right with that um I think I think we're all done we're good to go uh Sarma thank you so much for taking you know time out of your data to join us here and um you know help us present uh you know some of the some of the content that you've created and just yeah you know thanks for thanks for everything you do in the community too bud you know we really appreciate it thank you for the support you know I'm excited to be here today um I'm I'm also will be available to answer questions on GitHub like somebody has issues I can uh reply and uh thank you to Cedric for managing it in the background yeah he's a rock star thank you very much Aaron all right hey thanks everyone have a great day bye-bye [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]",
