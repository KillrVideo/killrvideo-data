[Music] in stone my data needs a place to grow because darling we're just getting old you know it's time to go [Music] i need to set my data free to meet new people and new possibilities [Music] breaking up is hard to do it's time to de-normalize yet that's the truth [Music] breaking up is hard to do time to try something new [Music] and hello everyone welcome to this workshop hello i'm stefano and with me is cedric hi cedric how are you doing ah i'm good i'm good i'm so so happy to be on screen with you today uh it has been a long time we we were both on screen at the same time that's super cool yeah so let us start with the sound check do you guys hear us all right please give us a thumbs up if you can hear both of us loud and clear please please please okay tell us yeah okay so we do have a yes okay great so so okay so you see we started with a different song this time ronald you were expecting some different song but we surprise you all the time so okay it's not my favorite though okay we do have better i shared the playlist in the youtube chat we do have a lot of cool songs okay so um we are together for two hours i'm cedric glenvein and i'm leading the developer advocacy my data stacks you see my contact here you can invite me only kidding github twitter i would be happy to have you in my network i'm a java geek i created eight years ago a java framework called ff4j feature flipping for java and you know with me stefano yeah so i'm stefano many of you know me already i am a developer advocate at data stocks i love distributed systems i love apache cassandra and i like to teach so here i am please get in touch with me and somebody would like to you to sing yes i'm not very good at singing i have to say okay uh it's not only me and stefano on screen as usual we do have the full advocate team with us so answering your question uh on the youtube chat and more i will explain that in a minute and we are spread across the world so uh this is how the how big the family is and you know we keep growing yes absolutely okay a little bit of housekeeping uh if this is the first time you attend so we are live on youtube uh i think we also have the backend stream on twitch uh if some some things go wrong but twitch is really really for a backup go so we will monitor your question on youtube as we just did right now uh but at the end of the session if you still have questions or you are recording you are watching to a recording right now you cannot ask the question directly we do have a discord room with 17 000 people there and we will answer your question over the weeks uh so here you do have the link as well and to access those link you we do have a nice adjunct in the chat called uh nightboat and you will see with a cl exclamation mark discord you will get the link and we will see multiple links will be provided to you today the games are back we will uh play a game together at the end winners will get the swag we have the the swag machine back again so the three winners of the quiz at the end will get some swag shipped uh to them for free but pay attention the question will be exactly on what we do today so what are we doing we as usual we are doing coding uh database stuff you don't have to install anything all the instructions are on github uh it's a step-by-step instruction you can read it's pretty well explained to get the link exclamation mark github so this is where we start we will need a database astradibi and we will start by creating the database because it will take a few minutes to initialize we will code a bit in the id web-based code gitpod vs code in the cloud for you no need to install anything and we will also deploy our application today so we do have netlify that will help us not only deploy but also code more information in the two hours to come okay last piece of housekeeping so we do have the game in the end also we give you homework if you want homework is not complicated that's really answering a couple of questions and uploading some imaging proving that you did the steps uh and see we do have more than 10 badges now we should do some leather board to see who has the most badges uh so today is last row second we will do the tick tock clone workshop so uh hopefully at the end you will have a clone of tick tock working for you uh with not all the features okay we're talking about clone that really just uh um a skeleton of the app what it looks like how it works uh do not expect to take over the world with you're just a demo in two hours okay uh surprise surprise surprise today is full of surprise uh last but not least it's you know it's the same givings month so november 25th it's thank giving uh north america mostly uh do do like this thanksgiving but you know all the world could benefit of that month so we are starting today a lottery for three weeks so ending uh 25th of november when you can win some gift cards oh i see a typo here so the winner will can give a 500 second and third will have 250 and so to participate to this lottery is you know if you engage with with us the more stuff you do the more point you will get so here you see the uh link dts6 dot io slash stacksgiving you will see a form like that and you will have some questions that give you one point like subscribe to the youtube channel subscribe to twitter share a post activities that give you five points a little bit more engaging like doing the homework for instance doing a blog post on linkedin and for the most motivated among you with all the learning that will you have today and the way the weeks be after and before just build something of your own and get 10 points so it will be no cheating we will choose the winner live all together mid december so the most of you did the more points and the more chance to win you will have okay it's not the first time we are winning these uh thanksgiv this lottery uh so hopefully uh um we will have so uh three happy winners uh in a couple of weeks so good luck everyone engage with us and let's get rolling with the content for today so today your mission is to build a tick-tock clone okay your mission is to deploy a tiktok clone into production not only dev today on the global cdn using was not the most robust and scalable no sql database on the planet and you do have two hours easy right so thanks you for coming and see you in two hours yeah i think they should be able to do that right so come on it should be easy yeah let's wait a bit okay now of course we are here with you and we will build that together yeah so uh this is a so it's a clone of uh tick tock so it's a social media a type of application and i would like to give you a hint about the architecture of such an application so um if you're a beginner or never did any kind of architecture there are multiple ways and diagrams and methodologies to do to build an architectures like togaf dodaf so department of defense uh created that in in the usa again or simply uml so i i like and i use togaf in the past that that's great it's a kind of a toolbox and each time each step of the architecture definition you just have some some some diagram you you can you can you can use and as you can see in the middle it's always about the requirements okay so if we want a social media with millions of users okay we are uh eating something big we would like something to be very very scalable that could on under millions of users and you know thousands of users connected at the same time that's what we want to do even in the two-hour picking the good technology we could do that okay the app should run on multiple devices it's a social media we expect people to run that on their mobile app or a mobile phone or web and of course it needs to be real time okay so if you uh less beginner you say okay so we need the app this is the overall layers of an app you do have the user interface communicate it to back end and in between services really specialized for the user interface and with a backend comes a database where you will ingest and get all the data coming from your post user or whatever okay so let's dig into that for the user interface you know i told you just before that we will need something that fit with the mobile and the web so uh for that we chose the javascript stack because javascript is cool so we pick the framework react and you know javascript because it's also web right we we did a workshop in the past only for mobile it was a react native framework a react native workshop we built a to-do list at that time but for now let's just do the react javascript pieces which is you know the most used front-end technology as of today for the services well react javascript like to talk to rest services rest apis so we will do our best for the services to be rest okay multiple way to implement those rest services and you will see later how we do for the back end okay you might think oh let's pick a relational database you know of course not i mean just with the title of this workshop you know that it's not the case but why why can't you use mysql postgresql oracle to run a social media well a rational database has been designed 50 50 years ago now to do a lot of things a lot of transaction per second with acid transaction be able to store a lot a lot of volume of data but it has been designed for single machine okay and at some point with so many users so many interaction transactions in real time you reach kind of the limitation of the relational database by design so no sql for those who don't know means not only sql okay it has nothing to do with the way to interact with the database that really a way an architecture point of view so no surprise that no sql databases has been introduced by social media companies facebook linkedin and google okay each one bringing it its own facebook broke apache cassandra and this is what we will use today so why do you want to use a nosql database because it has been designed by default to scale and with so many users across the world we would like to have multiple servers across the world plus in social media there are video text audio a variety of data so no sql fit the volume velocity and variety this is a 3v you may also have heard about 3v for big data that's the same thing okay so my last slide for the design i premise and then you can start doing stuff and building stuff so which technology web and mobile javascript react okay we picked that because it is the way our user will use our program our application which data model well social media you can have instructor uh kind of document ish so json because it's uh it's javascript in the first place and there you maybe sometimes you have some some structures sometimes it's just random data so we would like to use a document oriented data model so we will log document and json while no sql i told you already because we need a distributed system we will have variety of data high volume i throughput and for this range of use case cassandra can fit very well because you can have nodes across the world it's geographic distribution there is no master again on this channel you have dozens of video explaining why cassandra is cool and how it works internally for today let's know that this is the database we pick uh and we pick it because it's fit our use case everywhere big great scalability distributed across the world okay a lot of blah blah blah but you know that's needed to understand where we are going and why i will ask you very soon to for you to create the database astra where cassandra fit in so because you know cassandra is there and because this is the piece that will take the most time to start so astradibi uh so i think you can use the the code exclamation mark uh astra in the chat right now to get the link to to go there for today it's a database as a service so you don't have to install anything that's that's the way of doing things in those interactive workshop so you will go there create an instance when you create the instance not only you will have a cassandra ready to go running for you but also a set of apis remember we are using javascript is better if you interact with the database using uh api the other way to interact with database are the drivers but here we can use api so how is that possible still in astradb platform there is a data gateway a proxy on top of the database that exposed for you the api it's called stargate it's open source you can run it yourself if you wish stargate dot io and also in the web interface we will have tools and uh you know screen for us to interact with the data much much easier than just you know doing playing all queries uh with a terminal right and uh with that without uh further due i think we can go all to github so you do have the link with um yeah so let me invoke again the github link and yeah so so shall we start with registering astradb um yes yes before that i just saw a few questions on the chat that might be please worth commenting on ronald asks for the slides and um the slides used today in the presentation let me tell you the slides are in the github repository maybe one good thing cedric i remember you added a few slides in the recent presentation so you might want to update them or you did it already action taken so these are the updated slides including the new material very good uh there is another question about whether it's possible to so serge asks if it's possible to do today's workshop with angular and typescript instead of react in javascript well actually yes the answer is yes you take you start from scratch and you write your client in a different uh framework why not it's actually it's a very good exercise and there should be nothing against that in principle um the point is that today uh we are not focusing much on writing the code we will have a look at some parts of the code but the code basically is there already for us to to inspect and deploy and play with uh the actual construction of the client is covered in in a video that is linked in the repository by our friend anya akubov who is a well uh well-known and talented developer uh influencer i would say oh yes and she she created this clone the code and she explained that very well in in her video uh then basically in this workshop we take from that point and we make it run on netlify with astrid b and we explain explained infrastructure parts so that's just to uh clarify things now yes sorry um you know just just also to set the expectations so in two hours uh we cannot really do live coding okay so we do have the code ready for you and what we expect you to do is to understand the code and how it has been done today with react but technically speaking there is nothing preventing you to recode that on a typescript angular absolutely um yeah so for those of you who are new to react we have a a nice introduction to react which is a repository in itself with the instructions for you know to get started with with react today we probably we assumed some familiarity even though that's not the the main focus the code but as i said we will have we will be having a look at some parts of the code that namely uh those most related to the infrastructural part uh yeah the infrastructure we deploy on so but one thing at a time let's start with astra db because as cedric said first thing we need a database and then we will store our posts our data back in the application on that so let me switch on my monitor you should see now here so this is the screen you see if you follow the astra registration link uh you can so we start with these then we go to having a look at the repository so if you follow the astra registration link you you can here sign up if you don't have an account yet this is uh so name email password or you can sign up with github or google you just sign up now um i already have an account so i will skip signing up and magically i'm already logged in uh but uh obviously you probably have to log in to sign up and log in at this point you will have uh so this is the main screen in astra db uh something that we would like to stress is that using asteroid b is free is free to up to a very high level of a free tier that affords you a monthly free level of usage that amounts to 80 gigabytes storage and maybe for 40 millions yeah that's a lot right something like that so you can actually run real stuff within the free tier so okay so here uh on the left if you're logged in on the left you will see a dashboard listing your databases now you see i have already some some of them you probably want no no big deal because there is this button you see this button on the left create database and we start by creating the database so if you click here you will be able to insert a database name a key space name and other details so now let me give you okay this is all described in the repository and i will give you the link again in a second but for the moment stick with me and please do not be creative too much so everything will work very smoothly without having to modify anything in in the code so for database name we suggest using workshops and for key space name tick tock underscore key space so okay what is a database well uh it is a database but what is a key space you might wonder a key space is a grouping of tables so in the terminology of cassandra and astra dv is built on apache cassandra in the terminology of cassandra a key space is a group of tables so it is a useful way to group together tables that belong to the same application for example so if we have multiple tables serving the tiktok clone we put all of them in the same key space which you know allows for quick handling of common features such as uh yeah distribution of the data and stuff like that but anyway that's not so important for us today but please use this name so everything works out of the box so key space is like a relational database well like a schema if you wish a schema is like so it is a group it's a logic sorry a group of related tables but it's not relational so cassandra and astrid b is non-relational so yeah there's a big difference there but more on that maybe later or in other workshops more uh to the point now we have to select a provider a cloud provider and a region so no big difference here you can choose whatever you want i prefer aws today and since i'm based in europe i will choose an area that is europe middle east and i will go i want my database to live in germany so i click on frankfurt but that's really up to you okay so database name keyspace name cloud provider region and area and region now i can click create database so behind the scenes when i click this button a lot of stuff happens handled by data stocks machines in their own cloud provider accounts some containers are created and other things happen and ta-da we are back to the dashboard and you see i have these new database workshops here and if you look and at this list on the on the right workshops is here and it will be in the status of pending you should be able to see that here it is pending which means that it is being initialized that takes a couple of minutes or so and while we wait i please ask you to give me a thumbs up in the youtube chat or in discord if you manage to get to this point uh let me repeat that all instructions are given very in a detailed way in the github repository so you create database remember the right database name and key space name choose your area and region and just click create database if you get to this point and you see your workshop database in pending state that's great and that's step one done for you we do have a lot of uh it's very good don't worry if it's not active yet your database it will just take a few minutes more while it's been created and initialized ready to accept our data exactly you know we are starting a cassandra instance so it's a distributed database so multiple servers are started for you three three servers for a single one of you so yeah it could take a few minutes to start but as soon as we uh i mean we can let these database impending state do a little bit of slide again uh but you know i promise most of the of the theory is at the beginning so let me just uh before before we move to the slides let me just answer uh stannislav if i saw it right yes you can watch this video later because it's recorded and you will be able to watch it anytime at this link so don't worry okay the other thing sorry cedric but this is i would like to give it now there is i let me repeat the link to the repository this is the repository and just very quickly because uh so here everything is detailed and listed so if you scroll down there are questions links to slides and stuff there are instructions for the homework as cedric said already if you want to get a nice juicy badge please do the homework so you will learn a bit more and then there is the actual proceeding of today's workshops and we are at step one create astrodb instance you see there is everything everything is set is written here database name keyspace name and everything and there is also a nice visual guide to show you what you should do okay so i will keep this repository here for uh reference because we will basically follow the steps along interleaved with the slides and with that i will go back to cedric yeah you know um that is spending for most people we are not in a hurry let's not rush so just two more questions before me going to to to the theory one um uh got a question just asking uh what we what will which data will be in the last in the datastax data server data center i will make it and which data will be on adws because when you start a database we ask you to pick one cloud providers right so your data will be in the cloud provider so if you pick aws what will happen is the astra platform will invoke the kubernetes service inside aws name aks and start the pod there so the cassandra nodes cassandra pods will be spun up there but you know i think the security now the system now has a lot of compliance suck to compliance security for sure but even more highest level of security okay and second question yeah no astra db is not rational uh it's uh based on cassandra and um colon oriented so no no relation okay so that's for the database that base is initializing uh what about now your app okay we will do a react application we will do a bunch of javascript do not worry i will ask you how do we want to deploy this javascript because again we want to deal with millions of developers so having just a application server like node could be hard to do because you will have to start a lot of nodes servers across the world to have your application to be very performant so what can we do to cope with that well so let's get rolling the answer to that it's called the jam stack so let me go here and share the link with you here yeah so sharing all the links so jam stack is a knack running for javascript maybe i should make that bigger so javascript api and markup so the javascript is the one you love could be react angular view whatever you will code your app as you like using your favorite javascript language the api is also something you are pretty in use could be rest could be graphql could be you know the jrpc could be the way you love to invoke your backend services and the markup uh is uh where you will store your content you know like the text the the paragraph the metadata and in the jab stack you can split all the context all the content like text sentence and touch with the code it does not to be in the same pages so what will happen with these javascript and markup you will have something called a static page generator something that take your code and generate render and optimize your website even before deployment the idea is like kind of a compilation to have at the end a website that is the smallest as possible and the most efficient as possible so today we will do javascript app and then we will click a button and we will do the static page generation okay that's the first step when we do have our website optimize what we want to do what we want to do is to upload this optimized website to something called a cdn cdn content data network all the websites are using that to be as fast as possible so you do have servers across all the world so providing by your cdm provisor provider so big names like akamai or varnish so so so you know some tools and that isn't available across the world and you just upload your website and because it has been rendered your website is static so when you when you access the application you will download all the static piece from a cdn and it could be super super fast from that standpoint then you will interact with uh some some backend just to fetch only the data but you don't have to download and render view each time the views each time it has it's done once you download that and now you can only make the the ui change providing the data so we are moving from something with client web server application server databases the diagram you see here on the left to jam stack where you your clients or your browser will access the url download all the static files or gs html and most will work locally and you will just invoke some api endpoints to fetch the data you need and you make you can scale the api as you need and you can locate the apis where you want so that's the the good the the the most important things to understand because you pre-render the app there will be super fast to load you decouple the views and the apis because now the views is static generated on the cdn the apis are dedicated and you move to the cdn to have the static website as close as possible to your user to be as fast as possible why is cool well i won't read i give you the pleasure to to read but today as the jam stack implementation we will use something called netlify okay so we will build something and as soon as you see the netlify command this is in fact a jam stack pieces where you want to deploy and render your application okay uh and with that i think uh now would be the time to do a lot of amazon i think you do have all the pcs you have the uh the architectures the database and jam stack it's maybe a bit uh mysterious uh still but you know we are here to answer your question and now this is you to do it so let's do it with a photo yeah very good so um before we go on i've seen a question on discord and i think said that you should you would be the best person to answer someone aap asks uh if it's possible to do jumpstart with java spring oh that's a funny question in a sense because the j in jam stocks stands for javascript right yeah uh i i you know so maybe there are some transparent solutions but not out of the box i guess no not really i i wish you know i'm a java guy i'm a spring lover you have no idea how much i love spring uh but you know still with spring uh you need to execute some java so you need a you know you need a gps server to run stuff then you know not not really because we spring you'd have a fat jar so it's all included so you can totally uh you you could potentially totally uh have the jar distributed across the world but it cannot run in a browser you still need a gvm and the gvm will be at the server side so unfortunately uh no for the view i don't think you can use something like java but java could be used for the api part yeah well if there were an api part a server but in this case as you will see we there is a clever way to make without having to deploy and manage yourself server side which is cool one step less to worry about okay so let me go back to my screen and there we go okay so i've seen many of you in the meantime reported your database became active as minded so that's good to know and we will keep the database there waiting for us later now let's switch to the repository and thank you luca because with good timing you you invoked the nightbot command to get to the repository which i will show here and you will find you'll find the link let me write that on discord as well just just for everyone to be able to follow here so it seems we are having time to do everything carefully today okay so um okay so you've you just saw what uh what is the the goal architecture what is the role of petify as cedric said this might be a bit uh mysterious to you still but let's start with doing and you see in the repository at step 2 you will see this nice green button deployed on netlify now i advise you to click on it maybe even better you might click opening it in a new tab so right click middle button click whatever let me just open it in a new tab and let's go to this new tab so what happens oh sorry open link in your tab here okay so what happens is a lot of things actually um you are redirected to netlify website where you probably have to uh authenticate with your github account and as you see i have to give permission to netlify to access my github stuff and go ahead and do that okay so this window closes and you can just save and deploy so it basically this window this this model is asking me is it okay if i net if i make a copy of the repository in your github with this name yes it is okay save and deploy now something starts when you hit save and deploy [Music] a few things start actually first a site is created in netlify in my account because i magically have a netify account just by connecting with my github with uh you know a single sign on i have my own team whatever it is it's a and this theme contains this site what is a site for netlify it is exactly um what cedric was speaking about it's mainly a cdn that is so it is a part of a cdn ready to serve my static content it will be ready to serve my static content when once there is some static content to be served according to the jumpstart logic and you see in this moment behind the scenes not only is the site created but also the key tab so the content of the repository is being built and actually deployed and when this is over uh behind the scenes a repository is created in my github with the contents of what i am deploying so this is all listed here so what does the notify deploy button do create a new repository for you on github create a site on netlify and a site will be available at a particular domain a custom domain different from for for each one of you and it will link the two together because what something that netlify also supports is continuous deployment so it is it is able to link you can link um your code base and the deployment so let's go back to netlify and now if you click on site deploy in progress here you will access some more details on these new site that you created and if you click on this master here this is the deploy that is going on let's click on this and you will see a long growing log of how deploying is going because this deploy takes a few minutes and as we were speaking this was proceeding for you as it was for me um let me scroll this deploy so what happens for those of you familiar with uh node a lot of dependencies are going to be installed and downloaded then build process starts you see a netlife special let's say customized build process happens which basically uh plays the jump stack so it creates the static part that will be then made available in the network cdn under the domain of your site that's not all there is to see because there is also this part functions bounding which is the most interesting in a sense because this is uh connected to the serverless function part of the netlife deploy we will see them later at length uh the last part is deploy site so this is the actual step where the content the static content is made available in the cdn and then when build is complete some post-processing stuff occurs and this now this just finished it takes a few minutes probably it has finished for you as well okay um okay sustainable let me go back to this in a second to your question but the point is that when you see pushing to repository and then finish processing the deploy is finished and in a second we will see okay deploy logs are currently unavailable that's funny probably i think the deploy is probably going all anyway even though you can't access the logs i hope but this is really something i never saw yeah the first time i see their own research i think the deployment is going anyway so hello sar nice to see you welcome so okay someone is asking how do you how you get to this page okay let's start from the beginning you see there is my team here on the top of netlify page that you see my team and i have many in principle i can have many sites now this is my site heuristic angle part yours will have a different name i don't know curious salamander whatever click on this so you go to that one site no uh you see be below the the so this is the domain name don't click that yet because there's not much to see actually but if you go below that there is this deploys from github if you click on the github no that's the wrong thing sorry you are here sorry below that production deploys so you see this production master this is the deploy that was going on [Music] for you and if you click on that well it's finished so you can scroll all the logs and in particular you might want to check maybe i can try to make this bigger you might want to check that the logs finish with this success and finalizing finalizing part so you can actually navigate your netlify in several ways in particular i can go back to my site and you see there is a lot of stuff there are functions we will see them later functions are part of this deployment and you see some names add at data edit post these are uh parts of the tiktok clone that we will see later uh but if you go to the site and you can inspect um i can't find ah here site settings you can look at site settings somewhere here there should be domain management i think somewhere you should be able to see environments you might also add some environment variables to your deployment but this we will do in a cooler way anyway you can actually take your time and navigate everything neglify has to offer the important thing is that now we have to go to your own copy of the repository on your github which is a very important remark so let me go back to my team i will start from the beginning my team my sites this is my site i click on this and here you see this github there is a link saying github if you click on it look i'm finished i ended up on github but pay attention this is not the data starts devs github repository this is my own look this is my own github account so uh we were saying that netlify deploy button does makes a copy of the repo and that's it so this is the original repository you see there is data stacks that's the one i started from then i did all of the netlife thing and here please make sure that you have you are on your own github from this point on so to avoid mistakes let me close the data stocks that's copy now by the way this is not a fork this is just a independent copy of the repository and it is the one that will be the base for your network deployments anyway i would like you to give me a thumbs up if you are on your github repository so you will see something different than my name here you will see your name but in particular make sure this is not data stack steps and as we wait for you to give me a thumbs up yes i'm on the right github i will scroll down because that's exactly the same as the other readme obviously and we will go to where we were in the other identical rhythmic so let's give folks a couple of minutes to make sure everyone is on the right path here yes exactly okay let's see thumbs up should i be in get a blob regular github should be fine cool i mean maybe it was a confusion with gitlab and github yeah so please use github yes the instructions later are made for we will jump we will use gitlab later sorry gitbot there are too many companies so many git regular github now so this is just a repository on github yeah you know during the time things are initializing maybe i can just uh go back to my screen and just for me to show uh the diagram just to to to show what you did to two in a visual yes so here we are so step one you created an astra instance so this is the the box in orange on the the bottom right hand corner so you created the instance and i told you on top of the three note cassandra we will play and use the api layer which is rest okay second button you clicked was deploy to netlify the green one and so you sign up to the netlify website you fork the github repo and now your github repo is uploaded and pushed to netlify now we will have a netlify app with a strange name so spooky spider sorry and uh it's generated automatically you can change the name by the way when you when you are done and it will be here so you will have on one hand a website uh almost complete and on the other end a database but nothing in between so now our work uh we'd be using something else to edit the code just to reconcile reconciliate reconciliate those two yeah i think uh [Music] yes i think we can we can now go back and open git pod i think okay uh i see okay let me go back to mine i see kaiser has a problem i'm not sure i understand what that is invalid foreign so maybe but you are you already started the next step i guess because git pod should not have been touched until step four here i think okay continue with default configuration okay ah it's not i'm not sure i know what this is what's going on here maybe it's maybe rugs yeah you can yeah right rex is on it so let's let's let's keep so let's keep moving let's see it's a local issue and or everybody else okay good so uh one way or the other uh you are now in your own github repository so make sure it is yours i say that already but as you see also in in the readme we we make it very uh highlight very much at this point and it's time to start git pod so what is git pod uh cedric said that it is a very nice and handy ide in the browser that works well for everyone without the need of installing anything and to do that we have to find a button in the readme so please scroll down in point four uh now there might be a a small trick here that i will highlight in a second but the important point is that there is a button that we will find here yeah there's a question on safari already one second because that's important okay uh i yeah sorry okay there there is so let's look for this git pod button make sure you are in your github and then you can hope open this click here and there is a nice button now i suggest you to open this in a new tab again so let me open this button let me click this button in a new tab and magically a new window opens over to git pod now before starting the git pod it asks me to um to single sign on with github i prefer to go with github because there is where i have my stuff but so if you click maybe i try to make it bigger if you click continue with github or whatever ways to authenticate yourself now you probably have you see two there is a some single sign-on magic going on and now what happens is that gitbot is creating an ide for me in uh well actually in its cloud and i will access it in the browser now let's go back because this is the easy path and this works for those of you who use i think it's chrome and firefox but i appreciate that there are many browsers out there and unfortunately this integration is not working for everyone but you know what you have to do you can take yeah that's maybe we we should have a nightbot command to that i think yeah git pod so the trick is that you have just to build manually an url yeah cedric's thank you you just pasted the solution so if you have say safari and this this integration with the referrer trick does not work you construct by hand this url which is https gitpodio slash pound symbol and then you just paste the whole url to your github and you open this link in a new window now either way either way you end up with uh something like this now i think i have a dark mode on so you might see it with a white background but that's a yes that's another thing and if you draw the question so if a git pod is initializing uh you're good to go if you got an error uh reference not found now you need to use the the trick the trick i i gave you on the youtube chat yeah so okay so what happens basically in this uh ide in the cloud your repo is being cloned some initial scripts are being run in particular dependencies are installed for you and as you see when this is over and you can see this let's do this here when this is over you will see the ide looking like this so on the left you have a file explorer on the top you have basically a file editor and this opens the readme already for your convenience and at the bottom there is a nice console an actual console i can type commands in them in it so i hope you can see i try to make this bigger but that might yeah maybe this is slightly better for you to read let's see okay so there is a lot of stuff here and this is basically a clone of the repository you see there is the same things that are in my github now before going on maybe just uh the curiosity this magic of gitbot relies on among other things and all of the automation kindly offered by gitbot all of this relies on this tiny file gitbot.yaml that i will open just for you to satisfy your curiosity this is why you are here anywhere satisfies the heroes so you see there is a bunch of commands that are executed when the gitpod ide is started and basically a new container is created for you and some commands are run in that in that and this amounts to ensuring there is a certain version of node installing npm installing some commands and then installing all dependencies required by this project and that's basically it plus a few other options how to treat open ports and and so on but this is just i mean you are invited to look into the git body ammo and learn to set up your own git pod integrations for your repositories there is actually much more than that that you could do here okay so let's go back to the readme here and uh maybe just as a test you can run commands here and one a very nice command is git remote minus v why i'm doing that yeah it yeah sustainable gitpod is this well it's based on visual studio and it has the same look and feel and ui basically yes it is a visual studio in the browser more or less so if you type this git remote minus v this is yet another way to make sure you are yourself and you are not data stock steps which is something that you can see here so we already asked for enough thumbs up on this point so let's just go on and we are ready to start stuff so first thing i would like to npm install minus g netify dash cli this is just a very important node dependency and this is basically a package that offers integration with netlify not only integration but also some kind of emulation as far as serverless functions are concerned and well i advise you to run this npm install minus g netlife cli this is all given in the in the readme anyway and now the gitbot is there for us to use except one thing because now it's time to ensure we can access our database from here and that's an important point because you see uh let's recap what we did so far we created a database right and a key space ready to host our data our tables our the data which is the backing the application the the tiktok clone and we have an ide where we will start the application in development mode but we have to teach this application the code here in the in the git pod basically the code in development mode we have to teach it how to reach the database and since this is a database in the cloud there will be some form of authentication at play indeed so let's do that let me go back to astra and i've been auto locked out but that's okay let me very quickly use my service account and there we are okay so one thing of astra is that if you leave the window inactive for some time as we do in workshops you might be just auto locked out as a security measure so you just log in again no problem and there we are okay so how so we need to create a token what is a token a token is a authentication format form for accessing the database from outside it is similar to a user password combination but it is a token it is a very long string that contains and encodes some information and it will be just given to astra when we connect from outside and that will grant us access to the database actually there are tokens for with various degree of permission what we need is a rather powerful token because we will also need to create tables and stuff so let's go okay um you can start with your main astra dashboard you see there is your workshop db and by now it is sure active now if you scroll all the way to the right there is this nice three dots menu here and generate a token here in the menu so click on generate a token and you will be able to generate a token now you have to select a role i was i just said you have you can grant your token different levels of permission what we need now is and look for it database administrator so a pretty powerful role probably in a real production level application you will have different roles you will distribute them with minimal you know granting minimum minimal powers to various actors but now we just create one token with database administrator and if you click generate token here is your token well actually when you generate a token you have different things depending on the way you connect to astra you will need to use one or the other so this information will not be shown again to you out of security so if you want to keep this and i advise you to do so you can click on download token details and you will be able to download a csv file and store it please in a secure location you will be able to save it somewhere yeah and please do not stream your token on youtube yes and do not uh commit it to github or whatever because it's uh obviously it's the keys to your database imperative i know you would have to delete your own yes absolutely but now you see it's not completely shown i think it goes on here so but yes i would usually after every workshop we do delete that so if you click on the clipboard icon here you can copy it and in particular you see there is a client id a client secret and a token what we need today and that depends on how we connect to the database what we need today is the token now let me keep the token in my secret text editor here you can't see it but just out of convenience okay so please make sure you have your token somewhere at least stored somewhere but you will need it very soon and that's it so we have the token uh that's a very important step so i'm asking you to give me a thumbs up if you get your token so database administrator is the the role you have to choose and i will maybe walk you through the steps once more from the start so you are in your astrology it's tricky yeah you are in your rastadb main dashboard here is your workshops database you scroll to the right and there is this three dots menu you generate a token here you select a role database administrator and you click generate token okay i see many uh thumbs up again let me just stress this that generating the token is explained in detail in the readme so if you get lost or if you want to repeat the practice as a self-service thing later it's all very clearly explained and while we wait another minute let me tell you one thing in case your token is somehow leaked because you paste a screenshot on a public chat or whatever and oops the token is there no problem because you can go to your token management dashboard and you can revoke the token um obviously then your application might stop working and you have to do stuff you have to maybe replace the token in your application which means redeploy and whatnot but okay that's uh usual ordinary maintenance in a sense let's say data leak response action okay so uh we generate application token and this will be later used to connect with the database very nice okay so let's go there and connect with the database so you have your token and i'm in the meantime i see several thumbs up so we can go ahead let me go back to github sorry to git pod okay uh today we are mixing them up all the time so we are in our ide star yeah yeah they have a very sound similar name to similar so we just installed netlify cli there is also something else that we are about to run and this command is this long command look maybe i can try to make this bigger yet npm exec astro setup so this astro setup is a very useful command and right i can't paste like this here sorry windows so npm exact astro setup and then after that we give it two arguments one is the database name you remember we used workshops and second is the key space name which is tick-tock underscore key space now if you run this command it will ask you something can i install astro setup yes you can blah blah blah installing installing installing and get take your token ready because the next question will be install netlify cli gives error okay so chuck cara that should have been the previous command and install minus g so okay rugs maybe you can help choker yeah netflix make sure you are in the proper folder the one with the the file name package.json yeah this is where you i think that's in is a my it's a global installation anyway so it's an npm installed minus g so it should be but yeah actually you should have started the git pod in that directory anyway uh that's just globally okay okay so okay back to uh back to us um this uh npm exact astra setup will ask you for your token and let me paste it ah now you can see it in its entirety then i have to delete it afterwards so okay you paste your token you hit enter and then for you something very nice happens you see i didn't do anything else because this astro setup connects with my astra checks that i have the right database that checks that i have the right key space gets a lot of tiny stuff and creates a nice file a nice file that you can see if you do ls minus a you can see this file dot in dot m this has been created by astro setup and maybe it's worth to open it in the file editor in git pod you see astro setup is an environment files and that defines a few environment variables that contain details and secrets on how to connect to your own astra database in particular there is the token but not only that there is you see also the region and key space name and everything okay so there we are um maybe i can ask you for a thumbs up if you manage to have your dot m file created and you can check that its contents are something similar to what you see here sorry did you manage to get it automatically give me invalid token before i can even introduce the token that's funny so sustainable maybe yeah i mean if if you got that uh delete any dot env file and try again just paste the whole command make sure you don't paste an enter a new line character at the beginning or the end of the copied token because maybe that might scramble your input to the script something like that so if ctrl v doesn't work okay maybe right here right and paste if you're on linux probably middle click should also work but git but is a bit tricky because i think it intercepts mouse events at some level so it might be playing tricks anyway okay so at least someone is following along and we go ahead so we have our dot env done yeah so what does that start stop do we just explain that it's time to start the application now we are about to start it in development mode what so that means netlify is not yet involved we are running everything well in this case i'm running everything in git pod and if you for some reason are not using gitpod but you're running on your local machine everything is running in your local machine and mind that the client will be served from the development process and the functions the serverless functions will actually be running on your machine as well or on git pod as well because we are in development so let me do that natalify dev this is all explained in the readme if you hit netlify dev something happens namely the project is being prepared and served in development mode from a server running here in your own git pod and magically there will be so this server will be will be exposed as a you see as a local host port which actually gitpod renames in its own way to make it available in the browser but that's a detail you see i am seeing my own ticktop clone maybe i will open it in a new tab just to see it better and there we go we are very much seeing our own and i hope you do so too we are seeing our own tik tok clone nice this is okay if you look at the address you notice that this is the same address as my git pod with uh prefix with the port number so it is some magic that github does for you but no no not so important now the thing is that you are seeing your tick tock clone and there is some level of interaction now you can create new post you can follow and play the movies also yeah let me remind the codes to this is ready ready for you to inspect and if you are curious as to how the code was built i suggest you to watch the two hours video by anyakubov who does a very great job at over explaining and building from scratch to this clone but let's go back to git pod okay so we are running in development mode um um you know again uh uh it was a long a lot of steps maybe i could explain those steps with uh just a slide and yes because the right point to sus to pause here if you are stuck please let us know in the chat in the meantime let me switch to your slides yeah i see my screen okay so um the first things we did was to click that opening gitpod button it opened a vs code in the cloud uh all package ready to go all the extension by the way we did not say that but in this git pod uh you do have npm okay you you did it you tried it you also have python you also have uh java maven docker it's there just try all the commands in the terminal it works that's just amazing and you can also install new stuff yes some extent yeah okay uh from that first command was astra setup so astra setup ask you for a token with this token in go to astra pick all the parameters the the the metadata we need your database name your database id the key space name everything's needed to interact with the database uh all the this step has been done for you with the astra setup script and the attach astra setup script all need need the token okay and then we run something called netlify dev to run the app inside git pod as you can see there is no link between git pod to netlify yet and not no link from netlify to astra but this is coming this is now what we will do make sure that all this config that for now is only at gitpod level to make that available in the others components okay so sean is asking where we stopped in the in the steps right so well we have run step seven connecting to the database we have run step eight launching the application in development mode so no netify involved yet and now it's time to connect to netlify so doing the actual deploy because so far could have been running on my machine whatever but now it's time to go and deploy okay so back to you okay thank you because now i'll go back to my screen so step nine to answer sean we are starting step nine okay so let me go to git pod and let's ctrl c to stop the development mode because now we are about to get serious maybe i can okay i can also close this just for to make it clearer to follow and what do i have to do okay first i have to make uh this uh this command shell aware that i have an account on netlify so let me do netlify login and this is a trick because netify login would open a browser page to make me do authorization so to make me authorize gitpod to access my netlify but within gitpod i i cannot this is a window that cannot be opened in this simple browser that is embedded in gitpod so if you see these and you will be sure to click so you do netlify login this opens this window in the mini browser within gitput make sure you click open site in your window and there we go now an application name network cli is asking for permission so sorry yes authorized something is stuck in my throat okay if you authorize you can close this window sorry my voice is funny but should be okay i will do the voiceover okay i will just so now stefano is clicking on authorize you can see that the authorize was not properly open on gitpod itself you really had to open that on a new tab authorized and now if you see the log you can keep going with netlife thank you cedric i should be back so when when when you authorized uh git pod to access netlify you can close the window let me also close this one which anyway would not be working and in your console you should see you are now logged in to your netlify account so subsequent operations that you do in this shell will be aware i talk too much but there is so much to say something so anything you will do later in this console will be aware of your uh login to netlify namely so jerome told us you talk too much yeah yeah but there is so much to say okay so now that this shell has access to uh our netlify let me do the next step natalify link this will make me uh this will make my git pod or anyway my development environment aware of that one particular site on netlify so you should just see the first answer how do you want to link this folder to a site you should just use current that should be enough and if everything works you see directory linked and you will see magically your own curious salamander link here ready for you and indeed this is what happened for me so i'm done well almost done yeah thank you david they already asked me to sing but they don't know what they're asking for so okay now netlify is so this gitpod or actually the development environment in this directory is able to uh isn't that is aware of which particular site i'm going to push or to deploy to and this we did with netlify link now next step in the readme after netlify link there is an important point to do because i have to inject the environment variables over from this git pod to netlify so far we've been running the application in development mode and there so locally here in gitput and everything had access to these environment variables but over in netlify there is nothing yet you remember that i showed you some place to insert environment variables in netlify you could do that by hand with mouse point and click but we are much cooler than that and we just we are yes and we just netlifym import.m by the way this envel file obviously will be in your git ignore all the time that's why uh we have to inject it in the right way to get to to over to uh netlify indeed if you run this network import f command these variables will be made available in the environment in netlify ready for your functions to pick them up in particular say the token and stuff like that and so they will be able to access the database we're almost done because we just have to do netlify build which is a build process so this will take your source code and bundle it in the way ready to be static stuff ready to be served in the jumpstart philosophy over in the cdn not only that but also the functions because there are the functions and this will be something we are going to speak about very soon okay so the magic of this uh okay so well let's speak let's say something about the function while this works because as as we already saw before in in the netlify logs not only is the client application bundled into static content ready to be served but also you see here them again function bundling what are those functions well uh there are a few slides on that but basically these are parts of the code that are in this repo but they are not part of the client namely they will be run as in serverless way they will be run uh within the network infrastructure as we deploy to production and this is what we are going to do so last step netlify deploy dash dash prod sorry deploy dash dash pro and if you enter this command everything that has been bundled and built so far is going to be pushed to your own netlify website and there we go so we can open this site just by looking at this website url but we are cool so on netlify open column site and there we go now again i don't like this very small window so let me open this link in a big window but that's a no big difference okay there we are this is our netflix clone sorry our tick tock clone netflix was six two weeks ago and you have the recording in the youtube channel oh that's a good time to say hey if you enjoy the content and the interactivity and such yeah consider to subscribe to the channels we do stuff every week so if you're interested you're welcome jump on board okay so this is the same uh it has the same appearance as the tiktok clone we saw earlier but if you look at the address bar this is now a real url so it is something running in netlify again each one of you will have a different link but the point is that this is running in the jumpstart logic so the content is so the the client is a static stuff served by the cdn and the back end there is no back-end in the sense of a server an api you have to deploy and run because this is handled as a set of serverless functions running actually they are lambda functions aws lambda if i remember correctly but the point is that they are handled by the netlife infrastructure for you so you have the very good news that you don't have to deal with infrastructure back-end infrastructure yourself you just write some code some small basically stateless functions that serve some purpose and they will be run by you for you by netlify and with that we basically got to the goal of today netify application up and running tick tock clone running and i think i should stop here and let cedric do some more remarks with on the slides right eventually you know i like your voice but you know give me five minutes okay so there we go uh to be honest not even five minutes uh so using all the command netlify build deploy import of we push the config.off to the netlify website so now the netlify website does know how to connect to astra what is the token what is the url and uh you do have a full-fledged website running for free by the way no charge and this tick-tock website will run you know forever same for the astra db you have no charge so if you want to create a small project for you it's great you know this stuff is free okay um so the app is running so now let's dig into one of the pieces called the serverless function okay so let's go with that so serverless does not mean you don't need any server or in fresh structure anymore yeah i wish it would be the case but no no no that's not it so serverless really i mean just mean that you will create some code a javascript code just a function as the name stated on a dedicated folder in your app just with that when you deploy your code netlify will know oh this folder contains function every single function in that folder should be exposed as an api and the api creation definition exposition is done by netlify itself this is not you to code and it's called serverless serverless mean it will be instantiate and executed only when needed and the more power you need the more capacity netlify will provide you it will auto scale scale out if they need more power or scale down if the less power is needed uh so i think you do have something like 120 000 coal for free for per month so you're totally good but then uh you you will uh get the the app will will shut down and you will be asked to provide more and to be honest that's serverless and auto scaling is the the best way to have a cheap application because if nobody using your app sorry for you but at least you pay nothing because the app the api is not invoked and you are not charged at all okay so this function is interpreted and exposed as an api so this is the overall architecture of today so the client is web it's a react app you see using git pod that we deployed the web server there a folder is called function anil xposed serverless function that's the box in orange of my screen so the react app will only talk to react app will not talk to to the rest service under the hood so we will see now that inside these rest inside this serverless function the only code that you will find is invoke astra insert some data retrieve some data so yeah sometimes it's called a bff it's a back end for front end that it's kind of a back end just as close as possible to the front and here okay and that's netlify magic to instantiate the function when the front end need it and with that back to you i think i don't use my five minute yeah you are very sharp on time okay so let's let's move to uh the functions part because you just saw what the functions are and so the important point is that when you start i reiterate because that's a very important point one of the main take-home home points of today when you deploy in the network on netflix the functions will be run by netlify in its own serverless way you don't care of them you don't have to maintain the infrastructure and they will run there by the way you might find it interesting that after we did the injection of the environment variable let me go back to netlify and refresh just for to make sure if you go to site settings and you go to maybe it's build and deploy environment look we never edit we never inserted those variables here but the import environment from gitpod over made all of the relevant uh environment variables appear here in in netlify for the serverless functions to use so it's it's for real everything is as we said okay so let's go back to netlify um you remember we quickly looked at the gitpod yaml that is a secret yaml file with some information on for for how should git but pick up your repository and make this edit or this ide start in a similar way there is this file netrify tamil which is a very small simple file just it just says hey netlify in the folder called functions you will find javascript modules each one of them will be functions to expose as an api as an endpoint and let's go looking at this folder because this is outside of the client part it is part of the project but it's somewhere else so you see let me show you in the file explorer top level directory functions it contains something called utils what is contains astra client js now this is a small small piece of javascript code and it is something that offer exposes an important function a synchronous function called get collection now the get collection relies on get astra clients in turn and get after clients is a function that uses these dependencies astro.js collections which is part of the sdk to interact with the collections api of astrodb you remember stargate builds a document sort of schema less so to speak a schema less interface on top of astra db which is basically as cassandra a column database so a schema full but thanks to stargate in particular to the document api you can access it in a schema-less way just inserting and reading documents whatever they are indeed in javascript in node you access this layer this api with the astrojs collections package and this is how you do it so just for you to to have an idea this is where we read environment variables and give them to initialization of the client the client is then basically kept cached and returned you see there is here a document clients collection tick-tock posts this is where a reference to the collection because this is where a reference to the collections is returned to those who need it so this function get collection will just return a reference to the collection i say collection and not table because this is the customary language when it comes to document store but basically there is a table underlying that but anyway so these get collection is in turn used by the functions so you see in this functions directory we have add js add data edit and posts each one of them will be exposed exactly as its own as a as an endpoint as an api endpoint without the need to do anything and in particular let's look at these posts here so you see this syntax is pretty standard for for netlify serverless functions and this is the behavior to associate to an endpoint called something something something slash posts so the module name gives the name to the endpoint and what does this endpoint do well it gets a reference to the collection as we saw and it calls a method find to get every document in the collection and then it returns it formatted in a particular way now in this very moment these functions are running so i should be able to i think if i remember by heart that should be dot netlife [Music] slash functions slash posts yes so there we go so you see thanks to the network magic every single one of those modules in the functions directory is exposed as its own individual endpoint and well maybe i try to make this bigger but if you look at the results maybe i should also make the address bar bigger but i don't know how to do it so maybe i will just point out that this is no secret and it is expected and it is shown somewhere i remember it in the readme i can't seem to see it maybe later that was explained somewhere yes because we are yeah here create an endpoint at so and so so this function endpoint this post endpoint will just return all posts you just saw the code and indeed these are you see these are documents this is how my browser formats basically a json containing a list of post documents okay so we with that i think the basic idea behind serverless functions and how to implement them for netlify is this because there are functions that do similar things there is one used to edit uh one a post so maybe change from follow to unfollow one to add data we will come to that sec in a second one to add a single post so this is the one called when you post a new a new item in in the tick tock in particular at the data uh does a dirty trick because this is the one that is called at the beginning when the page loads and it will secretly populate the database for you because we if you remember we never inserted by hand any of the posts you actually see here in your tik tok clone so what does add data do it just contains explicitly the list of posts and it will then these are sample posts but this is not where they will be read during the applica the application execute so when the application runs these are just written once to the database and then they will be served with the post endpoint that actually reads from your document database from your collection so the post in in the in the application when it's running come from the database so the full the full functioning uh the real root of the data is realized that's important to notice okay so um do we have time to have a quick look at the swagger api i think so because there's i think you can yeah yeah yeah um let's keep time for the game yes of course but i think we good let's say we can take another five five minutes or so to okay i think i've been locked out again but that's no problem that should work okay okay so if you go to your astra console you click on your database workshops and maybe something that we didn't remark earlier is that you have several tabs here to interact with your database you can look at its health you can actually spawn a secure console to interact a shell to interact with the database but that's not the only way to connect with your database from this ui because if you click on the connect tab you see there is a list of ways to speak with your database from various languages with various sdks in particular i draw your attention to the first case document api which is already here so this is uh there is a bit of explanation how to access the documents as we did for the tiktok clone so how to access that layer provided by stargate that makes tables in your database accessible as if it were schema-less documents this is not only explanations because if you if you look here there is a swagger ui now we don't have time to go much in detail but let me click on this link which opens a nice web interface that serves both as as documentation of all endpoints for the document api and it also works as a interactive tryout panel where uh interface where i can play with these endpoints so look at this one maybe i try to make this bigger namespace namespace id collections this is the endpoint so we are now trying the interface of astradb that offers the document api so this is these are the same http we will be trying the same http endpoints that the serverless functions use to speak with astra obviously now we are doing we are using this this swagger ui we might be doing curl we might be using postman whatever in principle you could also write your node serverless functions code to do explicit requests but there is an sdk for that that makes it much easier so why not go with that but just for you to have an idea what's going on if you choose this endpoint say list collections in a namespace and you click try it out you are able to run request to shoot requests directly here in this interface importantly i have to paste my token because otherwise how could i authenticate and i've if i remember i don't remember the name of the key space so it should be tick-tock underscore key space yes so here we go so you have to put information but then if you click execute look what happened here i have my answer and my answer is there is a single table called tktk posts very good that's not all there is to it i really i still have one or two minutes so let me go to search documents in a collection so this is another end point part of the various endpoints in the in the document api i'll try it out i'll give it the token so this is an end point that gives me the actual documents in the collection and incidentally this is exactly the end point used in the posts serverless function but again i'm not doing requests i'm doing i'm using the sdk in the code but here as a to better see what's going on let us build explicitly the request so i have to put a token namespace id is the key space tick tock space collection id you remember it was dktk posts and that is already enough maybe i can put a page size that i want four items per page and i execute now if you see these are exactly our tick tock posts coming from the database as documents as json basically through the document api offered by stargate and now we you see while you build this request you also see it built as a curl command so there's nothing magical going on this is just a curl command an http request just straight at the target layer and its response will be exactly what you see here documents and if you go back to the functions these users.find which returns the posts as you saw uh is re so that relies on the on the collections sdk but behind the scenes what it does is it handles that very same http request uh there might be something more to play with but i leave that to you your curiosity and your browsing of the repository readme because i think we are now approaching the end of today's workshop so let me go back to your slides cedric if that's okay yes um yeah with the a slide i was doing right now uh from a question from do we go abr just hey can you give us give us another view before wrapping wrapping up and playing the game so that with me my two minute wrap up with my brand new support can i switch to your screen already or please oh yes oh sorry wrong button oops here we go there you are oh yeah not sure yeah okay so uh first things we did we create the database astradibi with cassandra out of the box provided inside astradb you also have an api layer so this is uh let me let me show you this is my astro database i do have multiple database here and i can interact with cassandra on top of cassandra you do have tools like swagger to interact with this api i am inside astra okay second step we created something in netlify a website by uploading code we add on github so if we go there go to netlify here that's the netlife ui i do have a couple of websites i probably have multiple here multiple application deploy we just upload that okay cool step 3 we open the code in gitpod not really broadening the code but mostly getting everything needed to interact with astradibi okay so we did astra setup netlifydev and netlify deploy to push the code and especially the configuration on the website because all the code were there already we only push the configuration part of the code was some function so in the code there is a folder called function and if you go there you have multiple javascript file one per function and if you go here just say hey expose function and if you look at what's these functions doing it will invoke astra under the hood okay so these function invoke the api exposed by astra the one that stefano showed at the very end with the swagger ui swagger ui is a web client to interact with the api just to show you what the api is doing and with that we do have a full-fledged app working with the website x deploy on the cloud and the database also running on the cloud for free i also had the question how many uh what is the what is the free limit so on the netlify site it's 120 000 query a month and on astra db 40 query queries a month and up to 40 gigabytes of data this credit is renewed every month so for any project student project end of end of school project even small production more than enough nothing charged we have never asked you any credit card so if you reach that limit simply the database will go will ibernate okay okay uh enough talking 10 minutes before the end right on time for the game okay and after the game uh it will be giveaways like venture lottery and stuff like that so you know you want to stay with us up to the end now it's all the fun thank you so stay with us up to now so the game the game the game okay so let me move to the game screen then so now it's your time to join so go to mentee.com as the screen stated so either on your mobile phone or a new browser and use the code 36541208 pre so let me copy that or you can also scan the qr code on screen and your phone will root you to the home screen of the game we will ask you questions make sure to read the question on your phone not youtube because the the fastest the faster you answer the more points you get and uh youtube does have a one or two second delay so uh looking at your phone will give you the most chance to win and when you are on the screen of the game crush the thumb up button just for me to know how many of you are here okay so let's see if i stay 15 i see 18 oh my my head is probably hiding the number of oh wait 22. let me move you a bit yeah can you oh thank you so i see i see more than 80 people with us so so those who stay with us up to the end now is your chance to win some swag for free i only 32 can we jump up to 40 just for the game yeah let's make this a top challenge yeah it's 32 hour limit okay i'm good with that i will go with 32 that will be our 30 oh you know what maybe people are already on the next screen entering their name so let's see so let me go three quiz time introduction to cassandra five question okay keep moving i should wait for players okay so we do have four question okay so i see you 34 now and four question it will be a short game so hopefully you pay attention during this two hour and uh and we could we could uh we could play yeah um can we have a little bit of music maybe i can yes that's a good point let me start it i usually forget about the quiz music but i can you should be hearing that so not you know cedric but you yeah i'm the only one okay anyway i think we do have the quota we have wait two three minutes uh let's move to the game okay so answer look at your phone to get the the question as fast as soon as possible question one what is astra a carb i hope it's a local in memory database it's cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a development tool [Music] yeah most of you have the good answer that's great it's indeed cassandra as the service in the cloud this is how we use it today there is more we also have pulsar a streaming service there for you as well for free uh but you know it's customer it's not really a development tool because it's a real database so let's see uh who was the fastest technically astra is also a car by opel but let's say this was in a different context so i don't know if that counts it's also a movie okay okay i see some some returning names that i know so mohit was the fastest for the first question okay so three more questions to go nothing is is uh done right now so look at your phone are you ready let's go what is stargate it's a tv show it's an api framework it's the game way to the star it's a new video game so are you a geek like me no well i might say we have a whole workshop on stargate and that might that might be still in several meanings exactly so uh again it is an api framework but it's also come on a tv show you know with captain o'neill general o'neill yeah 10th season in the 90s yeah i'm hold but i love that that series and movie and movie okay keep going so game let's okay so yeah it's a close competition second cubs third japano emmanuel jeremy duigou sam mader okay so two more questions to go um people is so focused now they're not even listening at us anymore okay next question be fast but be also correct yeah which api allows you to save and search schema-less json in cassandra document api json api rest api graphql api and i think you talk about it at the very end yeah exactly which one to use yeah what is the right name and what is yeah let's see yeah it's yeah i'm not surprised we we keep talking about the rest api and you know only the end we just unveiled that we were using the document api of start hey not all the question needs to be the easiest yeah okay there are many many right answers so i think we did a decent job yeah yeah exactly exactly so good job cool yeah that's that's cool that's cool okay cubs oh so much suspense you know each time it's it's a it's a new it's a new leader okay so now stop playing close to each other by the way so really still an open competition this is the final question okay final question let's do it what is the main benefits of using a serverless function i only need one function to retrieve my data no back-end infrastructure needed unknown serverless functions are only for local development let's see let's see we stressed this point quite enough and it shows exactly congratulations all right okay so no suspense who win the competition for today we will have three winners so let's see of whom was super fast but yeah it was not enough so cubs uni 64 and jack up congratulations you are our winners for today so make a screenshot now of your win you know we tend to have more winners than winners make a screenshot of your win now and um send an email to jack.fryer.com to ask for the swag yeah and as stated you need to make a screenshot of your mentee screen so congratulations yep so third three first place so uh congratulations for the winners so in the last two minutes now it's all about so if you enjoy and want to do the homework we do have a link in the gita repo how to do the homework you will get asked a few questions regarding what we did and ask you to upload uh your you know just your app your app running or provide the url of your tick tock app running and we will review your work and give you that nice badge that you can brag on um on linkedin speaking of that remember i told you don't forget to submit yeah that's a good point i told you in the beginning uh we developed the lottery starting today for three weeks having a badge is five points and you know you can review some existing uh workshop to get more badges uh you can brag on linkedin with it that's even more one point but yeah please please please make some noise uh uh tell your friend that's those workshops are cool and we will keep doing them speaking of which sorry cedric one very quick point rugs mentioned one thing in the chat we want to we address everyone who attended already other workshops earlier we changed the way we accept homework submissions so now it's a private uh there's a private form and your data is not is provide privately given to us so pay attention the submission method is different and we think it's better for you so go ahead and try it yeah definitively now you don't need to share your email to everybody and you know that's you will get some some some real question yeah it's it's overall better for everyone but you know happy to have any feedback after that on discord or anything we like to keep improved so tell us if this feel better uh okay so what are we doing next week uh stefano okay so uh next week we will have a new workshop based on building your own multiplayer real-time video game and it's about spiders and it will use astra streaming so it will use a streaming platform that is now part of astra it's not the database it is the streaming part and yeah there will be lots of fun and you will have fun building and running your own multiplayer real-time game so and this time we will all play together live that it's yeah spiders that's funny yeah okay so join only just to play the game and get a new badge or whatever yes and you know with that i think we completed all the the step we show all the love so if you enjoyed the session today consider to subscribe the like button as usual that keep us coming back every week for new topic uh hope you enjoyed the energy the interactivity we all love doing those and uh hope to see you next

strange stuff so please have a look at this link okay mohit those are friendly spiders cartoon spiders don't worry no no realistic graphics in the game so should be fine for you okay okay last slide on this code and with that we are done for today thank you very much so thank you everyone see you next time thank you for being with us so far and bye bye bye bye and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats you",
