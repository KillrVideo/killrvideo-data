    "text": "[Music] i'm jamie king and we're going to discuss data modeling with apache cassandra you're probably used to your relational data model where you basically make a table for every object in your domain but with data modeling and apache cassandra we model for performance which actually means we're modeling for how the hardware behaves which we will study throughout this whole entire modeling process here's a slide you've seen before this is essentially our map between here and creating some create table statements for apache cassandra what we'll discuss in this section is conceptual data modeling which is essentially taking all the objects in your domain determining their attributes and how all of them are related together here's an example conceptual data model you can see we have a video and an actor and a relationship type in the middle we'll talk about these in details in the next few slides this is an abstract view of your domain when you're doing conceptual data modeling you don't need to worry about what technology you're modeling for you just want to look at your domain and say what are the objects here how are they related and what attributes are involved as well in data modeling it's good to just stand back and understand all the objects in your domain often we just want to jump in and solve the problem but with the data modeling process we can step back and say oh this is what we're trying to accomplish this is what we need to store these are how the objects are related these are the relationships that are necessary and so forth one huge advantage to conceptual data modeling is that anyone can be involved they don't have to have a technical background hopefully you have the product owners the developers architects whoever's going to be on your team to deliver the final product they can all understand conceptual data modeling because essentially you're just identifying the objects and the relationships each object here has their own attributes so video has id a video has a title a description actors have names which we further broken down into other attributes such as first name and last name you may be thinking hold on name is a natural key for an actor why didn't we pick a natural key for video well if you think about it several movies have different remakes throughout the years for example alice in wonderland several versions have come out throughout the years by the way johnny depp was in a lot of them now hold on actor names aren't necessarily unique well let's just say in killer video domain we decided they were so in general all objects will have several attributes so you can think of them like fields but we're going to further break these attributes down into different attribute types first of all there are key attributes these are the attributes which identify each instance of whatever object they are attached to videos have ids and actors have names you may have noticed that name has first name and last name we call this a composite attribute because this attribute is made up of other attributes don't get too carried away with this though if having attributes have composite attributes which have composite attributes which have the that gets complex it's just nice to be able to break attributes down into further attributes if necessary going back to alice in wonderland is it a comedy or is it a fantasy it could be considered both notice attributes can have multiple values we call these multi-valued attributes you denote these with double circles around the attribute types it's natural to think about keys as far as objects are concerned we're used to giving objects such as video a unique id but here you can see that we actually need to determine the key of our relationship types you'll use this later when we get down to the physical data modeling level here is an entity relationship model this is essentially what you can draw on the whiteboard or on some paper do on napkin if you want to at lunch it doesn't really matter the three main parts of this model are the entity types the relationship types and the attribute types which is just a fancy way of saying objects relationships and their attributes first you need to identify all of your entity types in this you can see we have a video and an actor go figure killer video has videos killer video has actors those are two of the objects in the killer video domain in between these two objects we have a relationship type if you read the relationship from left to right you read the word on the top instead of the word on the bottom if you read from right to left then read the phrase on the bottom in this case video features actor or read the other way actor is featured by video one of my favorite actors is johnny depp go figure i don't know why i really like pirates of the caribbean so pirates of the caribbean featured johnny depp or you could read it from right to left johnny depp appeared in pirates of the caribbean every time two objects participate in a relationship type we call that an instance of the relationship how many times this particular object can participate in the relationship determines that object's cardinality within the relationship that was a mouthful let me see if i can explain further for example here videos features actors well each video will have several actors and each actor can participate in several videos for example johnny depp he was in pirates of the caribbean one pirates of the caribbean two so on and so forth johnny depp's in several movies on the other hand pirates of the caribbean has several actors such as kiera knightley orlando bloom and also our beloved johnny depp now you may be thinking why did we choose m and n here instead of just saying m and m that makes me hungry for chocolate anyway don't stress it the reason is is because every movie can have several actors but the actor doesn't necessarily participate in the same number of movies as each movie has actors yeah sounds kind of weird i know but essentially the numbers can be different between the two fun fact did you know where pirates of the caribbean had its first showing mexico city the cardinality on that movie has first showing as one-to-one meaning each movie only has one for showing go figure the next relationship type of user uploads video the cardinality for that is one to many notice the uploads relationship type also has an attribute of timestamp the cardinality on our last relationship type is actor appears in video notice this is a many-to-many relationship type the way we determine the key of a relationship type is by looking at the cardinality of the relationship type with the one-to-one relationship you can actually just take the key off of either one of the participating object types think about the movie pirates the caribbean pirates of the caribbean could have an id of one and first showing could have an id of let's say a well pirates of the caribbean would only show up once in this relationship type and first showing would also show up once in this relationship type as well both ids in this instance of the relationship will be unique so it doesn't matter which side you want to pick to represent the unique key for your relationship type with user uploads video users can upload several videos for example if i used my account to upload to killer video i could upload 10 videos of my cat my user id would show up multiple times in that relationship type however each video that i upload would have a unique id so in that relationship type we would take the unique id off of the actual videos that i uploaded not off of the user instance because the user instance will be duplicated for each instance of a video that we upload actor appears in video as little bit tricky because johnny depp can appear in several videos and each video can have several actors thus their ids will show up multiple times in several instances of that relationship type in order to get a unique instance we actually have to pull both keys from both sides of the relationship type and combine them together here's an example of a weak entity type notice the double outlines don't make these more complicated than they need to be in order for an object to exist the parent object and the weak entity type must also exist let's look at an example with this diagram video has encoding if the video disappears then the encoding disappears with it that's really all there is to it all right are you ready to hit the whiteboard in this exercise we have a data model that we need your help filling in",
