    "text": "hello everyone my name is david joy and i'm here to talk to you about stargate what we're going to do here is a quick demo of stargate with astra using postman so stargate is an api framework or sort of like a gateway that we have recently released from datastax and what it allows you to do is have various apis framework and programming language sit in one space that allows you to connect to your cassandra uh products so it can be data stacks enterprise it can be open source cassandra or the managed services of offering that is astra what i have here is a couple of options uh i have an authentication api i have apis for rest for making rest calls uh i have document api and document apis is something that typically is not something that we have heard about or used typically with cassandra but document apis are something that now you would be able to use with uh stargate and uh with with cassandra we also have graphql apis available through stargate that we will be using to connect to astra and cassandra so in today's demo i'm going to show you how these apis really work and we will not go too deep into it there's plenty of documentation available to see how it works a couple of things that i want to talk to you about here is that what i have is i have automated a few things so for example if in postman i've created an environment for stargate and if you can see i have updated my database information here and this database information is basically your astra cluster id uh astra's region information my username and password for that database and the key space to which i am writing or creating tables or i'm writing data and we have token information which is basically the authentication token and table information and some other information for for variables so let's start off by looking at authentication api so we have to do a post request to this endpoint and if you can notice here is i'm passing the variable db that comes from our stargate uh you know environment similarly the region is getting called so the variable is essentially calling it and what we are doing is we are hitting the rest v1 auth api and along with this what i've also done is i've written a small test script what it does is when whatever the response we are getting we are going to take that response and save it into this token file and update the token in the environment so that ways when you run the subsequent rest api calls or graphql or document apis you don't have to add or update the token information so what let's let's have a quick look at what happens so let's and it has sent an auth token this odd token has been read because of this script and has been updated in our environment so you see it's the same or token that is available here so let's go into rest api's create table uh endpoint and what you can notice is it's pretty much the same thing all the way till b1 and after that we have to mention key space which key space we want to create the table in and then the table information now we want to pass column information and column definition and what is the partition key all of that information so we are sending that as a json so make sure that you select a text make it raw and then change it to json and what you will also have to see is that i've already automated the x cassandra token information that needs to be sent along with the header and the token information is now automated because it's coming from the target environment that we have set so making some of the things easier so let's just create and in this particular case cannot add already exists the main reason why this error really came was because we already have the table so for the purposes of the demo what i've done is i've dropped the table and i'm going to send the request again through the rest apis create table endpoint so let's do that and when you try to do it for the first time because you're creating a table it takes a bit longer maybe three seconds if you can see here and we have created this table and now let's go into the insert data into the table endpoint and now we're here and what you can notice here is what we have to do is you're passing an instance statement in through the body uh so let's do this let's create id one let's do joe harvill h31 and we are creating a small collection here in the form of a map and all of that we are sending so same thing all the way to tables and after that you have to mention the table name that is also updated from our environment and then sending uh calling the rows uh endpoint so overall let's just send it this data has been created successfully added let's do one more thing let's add another user ie3 all right so we have added three records now into um the the database through the insert endpoint now let's retrieve that so again the difference between this request and this request is pretty much the same except for the fact that you're going to do a get request instead of post everything else is the same except for the fact that after the rose url you have to add the primary key so i'm setting the prime to key um last it was one so if you can come here we notice is that we have all the information that we loaded for joe it's getting retrieved coming back as a json which is amazing because that's how i wanted again i'm searching for a primary key with two primary key with three and the data is getting updated so so it's super easy now with this rest endpoints you can also search and query by creating a filter query or a submit query and that you can actually pass as the whole query as a json file so if you see here what i want is i want just the id the first name and the last name and age and i'm searching for id equals to one which is my partition key and the operator is equal to and i'm sending it with the url in the same url except for the fact that instead of sending the primary key or the partition key i'm sending actually the query uh as a as a part of the body and again if you see the header the token is getting uh updated that information is already there so if you send this what you see is only those specific columns have been read and we have the information the way we want it now let's go and update a record so let's let's go and update maybe uh for row number two let's change my name to like somebody else right and and let's just do this and as soon as you do this you see that information has been updated we can go back and do a get request with this and you see that person's name has been changed my name is was david and now it's been changed so different urls different endpoints available with rest apis and it's made things so much more easier so now as you were saying the key thing here to remember when you're updating it that the request that you have is basically a put request and not a post or a get so make sure you do that again everything else is pretty much the same and now let's delete the record so let's look at drop the third row in our astra table and let's just send the partition key again the difference is it's basically the put request the same end point except for the fact that the request that you're sending is a is a delete instead of a put so and we're sending row three and again and that has completed if you can now go and try to retrieve third record that record has gone i mean just to verify you know let's add don's information again and now if we go back and search for it that data is available so all these endpoints actually make life so much more easier for developers to interact with the database uh and in our case astra is managed by cassandra so you can focus on developing with these endpoints so this is rest apis and rest api is a very popular and a technique that many developers are using but let's go to the next layer that is document apis now document api is basically comes in the state where you have a json uh and a payload these these payloads have 10 documents sub documents or 20 sub documents and they can keep changing and you don't want to go and deal with you know changing your schema or your table definition all the time and you don't want to focus on dealing with the overhead of the requirements of the database but you just want to deal with uh have a document drop it retrieve it that kind of a scenario so typically which document api is what we are seeing is you have a json all right so here i have a game document which is basically a json of game and that is there's information about uh that game you know current state some audience size different round uh basically different sub documents available for that game and it's in the form of a json and i just want to load this and not deal with creating uh the table so before i uh you know start creating this document let's go and see if there is any data already available well as you can see there is no data available right now for this document in astra all right so here i have a json payload uh that has some information about a game so for hockey we have some information and for that game we have various sub documents uh available so the key thing here is to be able to use an endpoint to load this json payload right and this document into astra so what we're going to do is we are going to start using the document api so in this particular case if you can notice this everything is the same all the way to rest except for the fact that from this point on we have version two of the document api or version two api so version 2 apis are all correlated to document api so what we have to do here is that use v2 and namespace basically which means is a collection of collections uh give your key space where you want to create this collection basically this document and it will create a table uh you have to give a collection name which is games and that is sort of like a name for the table and then i'm sending the most important thing is to send a document id and the document id is is and has to be unique otherwise you will end up into problems so so i'm creating a document uh called hundred uh document id called 100 and now i'm going to do a put request for this url with this payload and and that's what's happening and when you do it for the first time it'll take some more time because it's first creating the table in astra and then loading this data so it'll take a bit time for the first time but any subsequent updates or inserts into this uh table will not take a long time so we have created this document and if you can go to the get request or like fetch a specific document using the document id it's pretty much the same document if you see here it's the same document however what is happening is it's a get request instead of a post request so or a put request we do send and we can see all of that data has been fetched back from astra so let's do this let's try to search for 101 which is an id that we have not created and we send the request you see we did not get any data so let's go and create 101 document let's uh call this chess and let's just change the document or the audience size we make it 70 and let's keep everything else the same and we do a center question you see because the table is already created in astra this request is way more faster so now we search for 101 and you see this data for document id 1 with all the data for chess is retrieved very quickly so now let's talk about sub documents and that's sometimes you want to get a specific document out of a json and not deal with getting the whole payload back to you so you want specific payload so right so what we want to do is if you see we have this json document available we want to get only the votes sub document only this information so what i can do is or only question sub document so i'm just getting that sub document from this document so i can just go in here and just type in questions and this should get me only the sub document called questions and as you can see we have all of that data retrieved and if i look for another sub document that called it's called votes for the same document id uh when we do get request i don't get any data so that means this data is not available so you want to maybe update this data and developers may want to update this data so what you can do is go to this next endpoint that is available in stargates document api that is called patch and in this one it's basically the same url that you were seeing before what we have to do is we have to send the document id as well as which sub document we want to update however instead of doing get request we do a patch request and in this what we are doing is we are sending the payload that we want to update for votes so this is what i want to update 400 i never created that let's make this change for 101 and let's just call it we call it eks for some reason and just just update this both these records have been updated and now let's fetch the votes um go to the sub document uh api that we have and just search for words and as you can see we have got just that information that we just updated all right so look at that 401 also we updated rwq and eks and we got just that information so now let's talk about fetching all documents in a collection so fetching all documents the collection is something that we can do but let's talk about it from a perspective of pagination right so you have let's suppose 20 documents available that come and you don't want to have and present all these 20 documents you want to just get five documents per page so we have these parameters that we can send with what we can do now with the patterns field if you see we were so far dealing with you know headers we were we had body now we go into patterns we can add a page size parameter and say i just want you know five uh documents so here because we have two documents let's just do one as page size and i'm adding some a feature called fields to get only specific documents out of that out of that document so i want the document id and i want the game code that's it and i want to get just one page and what we're doing here is uh just doing a send request uh sending it just doing a get request so what you can see here is we got one game code so now let's change this to two and we send it as you as soon as we do it you see that we have got two game codes because i've changed the number of documents i want to see based on the page size we can also save the page state so if we go back and do page one save that information and basically copy that completely that page state come here and just basically enable that and update that paid state what we would now do is when we hit this get request we would get the next document because the paid state has was saved and you see automatically we got the 101 uh document as well as the game code for that so it's it's it's made things so much more easier so for developers trying to use these variables you know these features and these documents you know it's it's so much more simpler and uh making things more easier for them to you know develop rather than focus on you know operational decision making so now let's do let's do search with some where conditions so again i am searching the entire collection so as you can notice uh everything is the same all the way till games because i'm i want to search all documents uh typically we would want you to send a partition id or a document id so that you can search specifically but just for demonstration we can look for wherever the audience size is maybe greater than 60 and i add a wear parameter and i can create audience size uh parameter here and uh audience size is my document id and i'm saying get more than this thing and i don't want to see hockey and i'm okay with everything that is popping out so as you can see chess had more than uh 60 uh so automatically we got that data and i'm specifically searching for game code status and questions uh as a field that i want to output so it's made things so much more easier by having and by using this api so there are various features available uh if you load this uh postman json into your uh into your postman application you would be able to play around with various variables all right so let's go and delete some records so we already had a document called 100.1 so it's if you see here it's actually the same api except for the fact that instead of get it's a delete so it's the same thing we're changing this and we're making a delete and we're doing a delete request and now when you try to do a fetch that data has been removed all right so let's talk about the graphql apis and there are multiple uh you know endpoints again again available for uh the graphql api uh there is one for retrieving the schema information there is one for reading data and like that pretty much the same thing that you can do with rest we can load some data using the graphql api we can create a table with the graphql api but what i want to do here is show you that once you create a table anyways either you do it with the create statement in sql or you use the rest api um that you rest api to create a table you will still be able to retrieve the schema information using the graphql api so let's do that the first thing to note here is that when you're doing retrieve uh schema information you want to send the graphql schema so if even just to compare here you had api slash rest v1 and everything else in the retrieve schema or for the graphql apis the api is not rest it's graphql hyphen schema and i think you can also use just slash graphql also maybe let's try that okay so i think we just have to use schema here so let's just call this and we're doing a post request and this is basically getting us all the information of the graphql however along with that we also have to send the get tables information we have to send the key space information that is remote telemetry and the name the table name column kind basic all the information that i want to fetch out so this is a typical graphql query that i'm passing along with this endpoint and as you can see i've got the table schema definition as and if you noticed we did not create this table using graphql this was created using the rest endpoint but we are able to get all the information the way we want it right so this is amazing again uh we created a games table so there's games table and it's information also coming in so it's really good now let's go to reading a data date and reading data using uh graphql so again i'm i want to read from remote elementary am sending the graphql query i want to read the site from cyclists table i want to read maybe id one which is my partition id and all i want is the id first name and page and if you want you know let's just change this let's add age also last name and age and let's just send it as you can notice we got all the information through the graphql api again things are so much quicker you see graphql key space it's all good right and now let's try to insert some data and again when we are trying to insert we want to uh put in some information that's uh not from the same uh partition key so i'm going to create a new i partition called id equal to 4 first name is jj jack h31 france and i am saving all of that information and inserting it and i'm inserting another one let's do it five let's just call it derrick and uh let's just call him fisher for now and now we are loading we are basically using the mutation method that is available through graphql and sending this insert statement which is typical of what you would do with uh you know graphql so we are inserting again between read and uh and insert it's the same end point but what matters is in graphql is the fact that you are sending a query here a query here whereas with graphql you're sending a mutation so send and as we can see all of this data was created let's do a retrieve this retrieve this data or see if this data has been loaded just to a send request or a post request with the graphql and you see with that data has been created let's do this let's look for the other one that we updated for jj and that data has also been updated so various cool things that you can do with graphql as well again whatever you want to do as a developer you can go and choose rest api document graph fuel whatever the use case is the thing is it's been made so simple for you using uh you know stargate uh so now let's try to retrieve some data and we've spoken about pagination in document let's talk about pagination in graphql so the thing is what you will have to do is is pass options and options as with page size and the page state and what i'm trying to retrieve here is i know we have almost four or five documents four or five rows in that table right now and let's just stick to page size one so what we will do is do query remove affiliation and as you can see we got this information so now let's copy this page state from here update this over here to go to the next record and as you can see we got the next record so that ways things have been made so much more easier you can remove page state if you want and just get two records actually and when you do that you see we got two different records using graphql so various things that you can do in graphql sometimes people and folks or developers want to focus on uh having multiple queries that they want to send at the same time but also associate that or create aliases so here what we are able to do is we are sending a query this query is basically searching for id1 getting that first name and associating that with alias esm and we are also running another query with id equal to two and getting that first name and aliasing that with the equal with da as the alias so same thing doing a post request we send that you can see we got all of that information so you can do multiple things so if you have a use case where you're you have different applications have different pages you want to compare two applications and get that information associate that or give an alias to those information or data that you can do with the graphql api using this alias method and i'm not going to talk to you about fragments because i'm still working that but let's do update the update row using graphql so again it's the same thing instead of doing mutation instead of doing query we will do mutations uh and here i have cyclist information i'm doing update this is important to send updates and then the table information what value you want to update what information that is so i'm just going to change this to herman for first name and if it exists keep it as true and get that information so we will also get some value as a result we see that that information has been updated there is an acknowledgement if we go and try to see the data using the read read requests and what you would see automatically is that the first name has been updated we can also go into delete row and what we will do is go into the body and i'm saying i want to delete same thing everything is the same except for the fact that instead of update you are sending delete delete the cycle is stable uh from the cycle stable value equal to id is equal to two let's do this let's actually we change id one uh and let's delete id one and we're getting an acknowledgement back and this shows that the value has been deleted successfully if you go and try to retrieve id1 it's gone so let's do two and see the data is available so multiple ways to use uh cassandra now using rest apis using document apis using graphql api so you have all these features available you can do so much more and the possibilities of developing and accelerating your development cycles have increased tremendously so i'm really happy uh that this has been useful information for you so please uh reach out to us if you have any other questions or use this for your demos for more information please go to stargate.io there's lots of information and documentation available there is a github link that has lots of examples that you can use and again this is the new way and the new wave on how you can use cassandra we are here to help you out hope this video has helped you good day you",
