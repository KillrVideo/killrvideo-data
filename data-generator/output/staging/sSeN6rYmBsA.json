    "text": "hi everyone I'm Patrick McFadden Apache Cassandra committer and my name is David Bonacci I'm the wiki uh at data stacks and have been working in the data and ml space for a while from Google starting a company and exiting to data stacks and I'm excited to be with you here today uh talking about uh what's next for Apache Cassandra with such a great speaker like Patrick yeah so Deborah let's talk about what's new for Apache Cassandra use cases and um this is going to be a fun talk I think so let's go so we have two growing trends for Cassandra if you're paying attention in the community it may be somewhat obvious but there's another part that isn't so when we talk about growing Trends Cassandra has been a transactional database for a long time and so that's been more of the traditional use cases you know back in your web app or your mobile app or something like that and that's a great use case for Cassandra because it's a database that stays online it's fast it scales it does all those things but just like everything else you know things change uh the industry changes we move forward and so as a database we're going to start moving forward as well because this is just what our industry does so the first actual big Trend that we can see with this is cloud native and when I say cloud native I know that's a huge topic but it's about how we use Cassandra and it's projects like Kate Sandra um but it's also deploying Cassandra in the cloud you using Cassandra in the cloud API based making it easy to do security and it's I think this is what we see in Cloud native which is making things simpler and again this is the theme for Cassandra forward is how are we making things simpler how are we making it more accessible for everyone Cloud native is trying to make that happen for everybody and everybody gets an access via just an API instead of having to install it say on your laptop or having to manually install things Cloud native is going to open up a lot more use cases just from ease of use the other one which is not quite as obvious and this is what we're here to talk about is how Cassandra is backing a lot of AI and ml use cases and this is not a surprise for some of you but probably a surprise for a lot of you and that's just because the largest companies in the world have been doing this already you know if you think of like the companies that have been using Cassandra for a long time which is like Netflix's and Ubers uh actually exactly Netflix and Uber um that is those are two companies that have been doing things with Cassandra for a long time in a transactional space but now they're using Cassandra for other things and it's backing machine learning so when you're using Netflix or when you're using Uber yes you're getting transactional data right out of Cassandra but they're also using that transactional data in really useful in new ways and that's what we want to show off today a little bit and it's it's not something thing that they talk a lot about Uber has and they've talked a lot about this this project they call Michelangelo but this is exactly what we're uh where they're making a difference with AI and ml workloads with something like Cassandra now we could talk about how they traditionally work but this is this is a actual uh slide from the Michelangelo team at Uber and how you could see Cassandra is being mixed in all over the place as a feature store as a model repo where their actual data is so if you think about when you're using Uber and you're creating data by taking rides or doing Uber Eats or things like that it goes through this system and this has been some of their secret sauce for a long time this has been around for a long time and you get to use Cassandra every day in new and wet new ways but what about you so let's get into this like I think this is probably one of the things that you could see out there today and that is uh we talk about this uh project called beast and you may have heard some discussion about it in the Cassandra world because Beast is adopting Cassandra as a model repo these two was brought uh from the teams from Uber in gojek and so the some of the Michelangelo team is actually working on Feast this is something you can do today and it uses Cassandra obviously so that's just something you can go play with today but there's more to this I think so DeVore why I mean let's get into that like there obviously these companies are investing a lot of engineering time and they're doing some really cool work but why didn't why would they do this other than it's a cool thing to put on hackernick yeah so uh I think it's a great topic to start with uh is is around talking why what's the business use case of a real-time ML and particularly real-time ML on operational data in Cassandra I think it comes down to uh realization that most of the impact from recommendations from personalization comes from data that is very recent that fundamentally we are when we open an app or open in a website we are here to complete the task to complete a job and when we come tomorrow we come in a different context and if machine learning is going to help us it has to do something within the session and this is where it comes down to in-session personalization and you you see that in so many things right so Netflix is here on the slide but you know you can imagine a use case where uh you know you like one genre of movies but you have tonight somebody coming over and you're looking for something else your your session is different than your normal thing because you have somebody coming over or an e-commerce world you may be buying something for yourself but you know you're when you're buying a gift it does not follow the pattern it's a different session so in so many cases uh you will find that what what why we come to a digital experience is to complete a task and even though we have certain tasks that we uh do frequently there are many sessions and many opportunities that don't follow the pattern and if we build quality models that can actually provide in session personalization really real-time ml we can make a difference and what people have been figuring out how to do this on top of Cassandra and other systems has been really amazing and I think you know Pioneers in this space have been on on this journey for a while and you know Patrick and I are excited to bring this type of technology to everybody to make it easy to achieve these types of results uh in session personalization real impact with with machine learning um you know easily to to everyone Patrick so Devore I mean I I think Netflix is pretty famous for uh you know the recommendations like so many years ago remember they had their their uh some sort of a contest where they were trying to get like one like point one percent better recommendation but that was done in a batch you know that was done in the back end I think they even used Hadoop right so like Netflix has been already established in this world but of course they want to use on Cassandra because that's where all their transactional data is but maybe you could talk about how we got here yeah so for sure all right like obviously uh ml is hard you have to do a lot of data processing training doing it at scale is difficult right and so obviously when people started uh on this process there there was a more like a standard architecture of how to do it which typically include uh uh putting uh data as it comes into a data warehouse of some kind doing some feature Transformations populating a feature store training the model figuring out some predictions you know putting it perhaps in a in some kind of production level store and then calling that production level store from the API this is kind of how people usually started uh you know a few years ago uh and this worked obviously some people found success and it's not particularly you know surprising but uh obviously there is increased cost in how this is run complexity and there is a latency from kind of events coming into predictions coming out right uh which diminishes the impact of the of the whole infrastructure and so while this is achievable today there are lots of software that help you do this right like um we are looking to uh to to increase the impact and reduce the cost and complexity at the same time so this is what I think I think most of us have thought about like this is where data scientists live and things like that but this is also like if I like to use your Netflix analogy like whenever I want to see whenever I'm watching movies and also and I change my genre like like I think you use an example like I love documentaries and a friend comes over and I started watching comedies I don't want it to start recommending comedies in a couple of weeks like I I think I need that happening a lot faster so this will not work right that will this type of system will have like if this is a nightly job as it's kind of figured out here right like the minimum latency would be you know one day type of thing or average latency will be one day unless you are just around midnight perhaps uh doing something right and so we can definitely do better we can simplify yet have increased the impact uh with kind of newer approaches to this uh you know problems of of real-time ml and then you know Patrick and I are excited to to to be working on this problem of machine learning on Cassandra right it's really about bringing machine learning to where the data is obviously this data is super powerful it's transactional data that it captures users actions users interests by by this operational data kind of reveals what the user wants and that is really powerful in a machine learning use case and so what we can do is obviously use uh more kind of real-time systems uh event-based data streaming systems to to extract features faster as the data comes in and populate an online feature store that can you know using something like a real-time prediction service give real-time predictions that we can call from the application um um and kind of have real-time predictions obviously we are not talking about training in real time training still happens you know periodically right for drift and other reasons uh nightly weekly or whatever the kind of business requirements need right so that is still happening periodically not in real time but we are providing a real-time data real-time features to models which then produce real-time predictions and obviously here we can have things like in session personalization where like end-to-end latencies are kind of quite low uh right like sub second uh latencies that can kind of obviously increase impact uh simplify the architecture uh of of the entire system but really it's about increased impact it's about what uh personalization is possible and what is the business impact of those personalizations that we are most excited about yeah that I used to call these people a data procrastinators um but uh Cassandra people are not procrastinators it's how many petabytes of data is out there um in Cassandra databases and moving a petabyte of data to where you need to do analytics that's pretty expensive and impossible I think um so I love the idea of like hey Cassandra's sitting here it's doing its work so let's bring the ml to where the data is all right and talk a little bit about Cascada so before starting a data Stacks I was co-founder and CEO of uh of Cascada which built a really key component of this real-time ml stack it's really uh uh an iterative feature engine built for real time right it can connect once to to event-based data including real-time event-based data compute features easily which is like aggregations over this event data and then connect them to any kind of real-time serving system or a prediction service to product produce real-time predictions right and so we can create and serve features at scale from massive amounts of event-based data the the key thing of making this work in our opinion is about uh certain unique time-based capabilities it's about calculating features at the right point in time labeling them at another point in time and then serving them uh uh you know in the future so why does this matter like let's talk for a second like how these models from event-based data work it's about the model is capable of predicting the future by uh looking in the past who has or which situations match the context match the experience makes the situation that the user is facing and then obviously statistically we know what happens it's really about learning from past behavior from past users that's that were in a similar context that ex that exhibited similar Behavior inside the application that we can see and predict what is going to happen in the future and so that Insight enables that really good models are built from this data type it's about calculating features at the right point in time and extracting context in those features right because that gives behavioral traits that help us predict the future when new folks new users uh face similar situations right that's key and uh Cascada technology makes it easy to do that from you know jupyter notebooks and python client libraries and making making it easy to do it reliably in production where features are checked in its code and I've been working on the system for for a for a while now and we are kind of excited to to bring it in an integrated uh with the rest of Cassandra Community uh across the board Patrick so I I loved I the idea of time-based data because time series data and Cassandra have been a thing for so long right and um but I always did all data is eventually time series data right it's it's like when did it happen at what point of time especially transaction data so like in in the case of like going back to this Netflix example like is this where we we look at what I have watched over time and trying to make something new out of that information or like how would that fit in with that model like I just changed my viewing habits yeah so how the model will work is the model will find other people in the past who have done similar behavioral shift so imagine you love documentaries right you're not the only person in the world that loves documentaries and then you kind of start on one day start searching for comedies trust me you are not the first person who likes the documentaries and started searching for comedies one day there is like a lot of people in the world good I don't feel like I'm called out then okay because that's my mood right right so there are many people who have done that usage pattern in the past and the event basic that contains uh information about did you actually watch the movie to the end did you not what did you do about it did you switch after like where certain types of movies more like than others from people that used to that that watch more documentaries at the same time right all of that is available in historical data from other people facing that context shift that context change and because of that the model can pick up on these things when we when we do features right and then I can predict what is helpful to you right now what is the good recommendation that you are actually like enjoy have a good time and come back that's the power that the model can do because the data contains information from other people going through the same journey and we know what was successful in the past and what wasn't so we can give you a good advice and good recommendation right now for you that's really cool because I feel like that's actually a little more human you know it's not so rigid it's taking advantage of the fact that I'm kind of random humans are random we do things we change that by our abilities but other people do that too so I mean that's really cool and all that data will be in Cassandra that that is in Cassandra totally right so this is pretty easy right we connect to real-time events compute features uh store features uh pass it through a prediction service get real-time predictions it's pretty easy all right like the technology has matured that this should be achievable to all of us inside kind of data communities particularly uh Cassandra Community given that Cassandra has been an operational store for this data for a long time that's really cool I mean I I think this has been a theme with Cassandra forward and making this easy I this is going to help so many folks because it hasn't been easy up to this point right I mean you've got to have a lot of background I mean look at all the the the top jobs and the hiring and the big companies that are doing it um they're looking for lots of experience and the top Engineers to pull this off so is that really the is that where we're headed in the future is this is just so easy that it's it's just like any other function you use in programming I mean certainly we are going down this path right so if you want to build a cool app right like it's no longer that the app is just you know a real-time app that produces you know reasonable information uh that is up to date it is about how to build smart apps that have a flywheel that take off the apps that get smarter with usage we just talked about this Netflix use case right like imagine an app starting from zero obviously you don't have data but as soon as the data comes in we know what works and we can steer our users in a journey that actually gets them to succeed gets them to come back right and it's very hard I think gonna be in the future to succeed with an app without these smart capabilities that kind of gets you into the right Journey To Succeed to like the app right and so obviously I think we are we are chasing how easily how easy we can make it to to empower people to build really good high growth apps that that kind of become smarter as more people use it and obviously that creates a flywheel that that makes the app thrive right and I think that's you know that's a really really good uh Vision that that I think we are on yeah because I mean I can't think of an app that wouldn't need this in the future um I mean every app that I use has some sort of machine learning AI component in it at this point um even my stopwatch I think and then kind of we can make an announcement here I think in conclusion uh that everything that we talked about here is or will very shortly be open source uh so the entire Cascada system uh is coming to open source this month um so the entire core of the system to compute real-time features uh increasing access to real-time AI available as part of Open Source uh you know immediately innovating together getting contributions uh and so we are excited to bring this technology to and integrate deeply with the Cassandra community that's the great way to end this is like yeah all that cool stuff open source and that that's what really makes it easy for easier for people to use it's the freeze and freedom freeze and beer here you go um and I I'm really excited that this is happening soon um and I guess it's just watch the space it'll be announced soon all right all right well I think we're at the end of this presentation um so Deborah thanks for joining me today and um this has been really it's exciting to end on this note um really cool it was great being with you Patrick and look forward to doing many of these uh in the months and years to come great well thanks everyone for joining us for this session and thanks again for joining us for Cassandra forward and we'll see you out there soon",
