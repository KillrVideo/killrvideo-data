    "text": "[Music] let's take a whirlwind tour of the astra user interface log in and click on the dashboard link in the top left corner of the screen at the top of the dashboard you can see your current payment plan and your remaining credit balance you can click the add payment button if you want to fill in your credit card information down here is a list of the databases you have created you can see the amount of resources this database has consumed there are two main types of screens to the astra user interface the dashboard screen and database specific screens in the top left corner you can navigate between these screens notice in the very top left corner there is a drop down menu dealing with organizations to understand what organizations are in astra let's look at this diagram in astra an organization has users roles tokens and databases databases contain key spaces and key spaces contain tables if the term key space is foreign to you don't let it frighten you a key space is just a container of tables you can assign roles to users which authorizes users to perform various activities roles have privileges which authorize users to perform specific activities for example certain privileges let users create databases or read and write data to tables back to the organizations drop down menu select the organization settings option we see from the navigation on the left that we can manage users roles tokens billing and notifications we see the user management option allows us to invite other users to join this organization the role management option lets us define custom roles each organization comes with a set of predefined roles which we will see here in a moment but if you want to customize a role specifically for your organization click the add custom role button when you click the button you see the list of permissions you can add to the custom role and down at the bottom of the list you see that you can limit these privileges to specific key spaces let's click on the token management option we use application tokens to access aster databases from your application here you see a list of tokens notice that each token has a client id and a role the client id is like a username and the role designates which scopes or privileges this client may perform we can create a new application token by selecting a role and clicking generate token when we select the role we see the list of privileges associated with the role generating a token creates a new client id a client secret and a token you use the client id in secret if you want to access your database using cqlsh which is a cql command shell but for access using the apis you can use the token with this button you can download these credential values as a csv file which is important because for security reasons once we leave the screen there will be no way to retrieve these values again however if you need to you can always delete a token here and generate a new one we'll skip the billing and payment option because we're using our free credit but if you decide to set up payments you can enter your credit card info here you don't need to be concerned with security setting as that applies to legacy databases that were created before the current token-based system notifications allow you to receive emails when specific events occur to get back to the dashboard click on the astra link up here let's click on the database name to see that screen on the databases screen again we see the resources consumed by the database notice these tabs across the top currently we are looking at the overview tab the health tab shows us various database performance metrics so you can monitor your database the connect tab gives us various ways to connect to the database for example we see we can use various apis or we can connect using various programming languages as we click on these connections on the left we see the instructions for how to use them on the right after we complete the user interface tour you might want to come back and explore these connections in detail down here we also see some other tools we can use including the javascript sdk the next tab is the cql console cql is the cassandra query language it looks a lot like sql you don't have to know cql to use astra but if you do this console is very helpful from the setting tab you can perform two operations parking a database and deleting a database parking a database takes the database offline you can always unpark the database when you need to use it again deleting a database completely removes all data and metadata you can delete a database but remember once you delete it the data is gone forever oh yeah one last thing you can find all of the aster documentation by clicking on this icon down here that concludes our tour of the astra user interface since astra is simple to use we're able to keep the tour short now we recommend that you click on the connect tab and explore how to create and use astrodb tables",
