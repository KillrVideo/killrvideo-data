    "text": "hello everyone welcome to the cassandra cloud native workshop series i'm alex walshner today with me eric ramirez and jeremy hanna and we are going to speak about the testing for your nosql application and specifically for cassandra first of all hi eric hi jeremy hello hello how are you going yeah that i see that should be good so could you please confirm what you hear us loud and clear so we can start all good perfect perfect and uh so to introduce ourselves in just two words you know eric already eric is our question master and answer master at the community.datastarts.com and one of our greatest experts in everything related to cassandra and well you know eric already you've seen him but jeremy is a new person here let's say in our studio view 12 studio so jeremy could you please introduce yourself i'm jeremy hanna i've been at data stacks for about eight years now in the cassandra community since about 2010 so happy to help out in any way that i can and we're we're discussing a subject that is uh a fascinating topic of benchmarking your data models and i worked on the team that put some of these tooling uh some of these tools together and has have we've used it internally for the last about five years and so hopefully that can give everybody a little bit of background yeah so as you see we are really happy we are really lucky to have the person like that here and you know what this series service uh workshop is very important because well cassandra gives us a lot of great benefits but with the data model done done wrong you can ruin everything so testing for your data mode data model and testing with nosql bench specifically in this case is a very very good way to set up your uh database to be efficient so let's move on um we said already about the crew so you see some people at the screen but there are more people actually answering questions at discord and youtube so that's the full team working with you today except of david david is sleeping because he's in the united states i guess and see you next wednesday with our guys and so what's happening today here that's workshop series about the cloud native applications not only cassandra if you are with us for a while already you know what we did apache cassandra to weeks one and two we did microservices and rest api applications at week three and four weeks five and six were dedicated for kubernetes and cassandra and kubernetes and our application kubernetes and now we are at the week seven it's all about testing all about checking if your database is ready to handle the pressure and work efficiently and week 8 is going to be about the cloud systems like google compute engine and others and well hopefully after that you will be much more cloud native when you were in the beginning and some of the housekeeping and setup so don't forget we use multiple resources because this workshop service involves multiple resources and tools we have live streams at youtube at twitch if you prefer to which you may watch us there but we usually don't answer questions there we don't have so much people to answer everywhere we prefer discord so for life questions the best place to be is the discord and you may ask questions at youtube chat as well for the materials and help everything is published at the data stacks community so community.datastart.com we have a big resources set at the cassandra workshop series at the data stacks academy and uh our humane hero for the week for the weeks is astra cassandra as a service and today our main tool is going to be katakurda if you don't know what makata koda is have no worries it's very fine it's a very nice tool to do exercises and trainings and learn something new and catacomb is not only about the cassandra but there are very a lot of different uh learning tools and learning uh ways to work with very different technologies lots of kubernetes tutorials there as well a lot regarding kubernetes as well exactly good so and if you're all wondering where all the links are it's just right on the screen on my right shoulder bitly slash cassandra workshop materials because i know that lots of people are always asking where the links are and yeah all the materials you can find uh well that's a short link beat dot lee slash cassandra workshop materials that's on the screen close to germany and now uh to do the exercises for today you will need to sign up at katakota it's a great project free project for you and that's a really good place to check out the courses they offer but now very important if you will try to watch the workshop today and do katakura at the same time mostly probably you will fail at least at something or maybe at the both so we do ask you again we do ask you to first watch your workshop and then do the exercises and if you're afraid to have your answer you to have your questions and answer it please have no worries because again discord and the community.datastage.com we are here for you good so nosql bench today we speak about a testing data model and making some pressure on cassandra with that and the main tool for us is the nosql bench what is it and why we think of uh doing that nosql bench is a performance testing tool for the nosql ecosystem it's not only for cassandra but it supports different drivers so you can support and you can test very many different systems you may want to have you may want to test and that's what makes it great and it's open source tool so today we obviously going to test noise clear bench with cassandra and there are very many different ways to uh use nosql bench with different bases you can work with astra you can work with you can work with data stacks enterprise you can work with kafka and many others already there and many hours to come so why benchmark because there are situations and data models then your database will look like these uh drug on the right and if the data model done wrong uh whatever however good cassandra is if you have hot spots if your data model is not perfect some sort of servers are busy and some are idling you never can be successful and moreover you want to know on the you you want to know that before doing uh your deployments in production so you want to do benchmarking of your data model before pushing any changes to the production you want to have it all the on the staging as well to be able to test it all and well it's very not easy to do because if you don't have proper tools you're going to be in deep problems so no sql bench of course so uh the nosql bench uh tooling makes it very nice to say i have a cluster that i've stood up and i'm wondering how far i can push that cluster and then i have my data model that i know that i'm going to have and i want to generate data against the data model and push that against the cluster before i even start putting load real load on the cluster so i can test to see what throughput i can get i can test to see how it's going to affect the cluster at different read write ratios all sorts of different things and then i can also test it um when it comes to how is this gonna to be affected by having you know 100 gigabytes on the server versus a terabyte on the server so all these different patterns you can you can test with no sql bench with detailed results yep thanks you thanks jeremy so well and yeah um uh that's no no sql bench is not just a single tool but way we can say it is um together as we will use it today you will see we have kind an ecosystem of the tools working together so all of the tests shown by nosql bench you can see in the graphana for example at the right screen so you can see everything not just in the numbers but already visualize it so this tool is very convenient to go with okay so uh a lot of words but let's speak about how we execute commands and you have two tools to go to do that you can do it locally at your laptop or you can do it on katakura today i'm going to do it on kotakodan to share it with you and to see how we are doing that so if you are doing it locally not now but after a workshop as we say uh you can go at github.com data stacks academy cassandra workshop series go to week seven and step one executing commands and i'm going to go to catacodo.com datastax courses nosql bench intro no sql bench yep good so i will start scenario it will take a moment to set up the things now katakuri will start up cassandra i will make it a bit bigger um how katakana works why cassandra starts we have a moment on the left side you see the instructions and steps on the right side you see terminal and that's like a command line terminal you may be using color hopefully you're using already i guess and on the left side we have instructions like what we are supposed to do and s cassandra is running already first uh command i want to execute will be a node tool status and instead of copy pasting i can simply click on this command and it will be executed automatically very convenient thank you katakura okay so we see what something is happening let's take a look what we have noticed not to status if you are not familiar but you should already because it's week seven we have data center one we have one node that's enough for us for a beginning and it's in abnormal state at the local host and well it seems like it's operational now we are going to download the nosql bench i simply press this button and it makes uh we get to download the latest release of nosql bench so it's going to download nosql bench for me and installation of the nosql bench is a very very simple thing i first download this executable and then i just set the permissions to be able to run it so i set it up as an executable file if you are a linux guy or girl you know that already if you don't know what's going on here right now answer is very simple i simply set up an execution beat for this file we downloaded so it's just so it to be executable very well and now we can do a very simple workload very simple test we prepare it for you we can start it with nb sql or iot so nb is the common to run uh nosql bench and securely i iot i'm sorry it's something we prepared for you and we will make a deep dive into that in some seconds this is a pre-built bundle jvm with nb which is an executable on windows and mac you download the nb.jar which is in the the course materials and you'll be running java jar and b.jar and then the commands are identical that what um alex is saying right now exactly you do need java 14 on windows and mac thank you jeremy yep so um it will take some time i just wanted to show you how do we run that so at this moment i will stop it i don't need it right now and benchmark creates a key space we use uh to analyze the data so in this case i want temporarily to re to remove this key space just as a little cleanup because we don't need it at this point okay and first step is over we just downloaded uh and executed our first nosql about bench command so we want to do some more things in the previous step we run a pre-packaged benchmark in the reminder of this scenario we will show how to unpackage and customize tests because well you don't need our tests you want to have your own tests for your data first we will start by creating a shama for our test so real cassandra workload read and write two tables our simulated benchmark workload also needs tables for the read and write activity the schema we are setting up is the target for the simulated workload what does that mean we just need some data and real shama to execute the testing and first we execute this command that's nb so nosql bench run driver driver will be cql because well we are working with cassandra via cassandra very language and workload will be cql key value and we run only ever only text face shema so i don't run the full workload and all the big scenarios but only the face shema part good and there is a question what's the workload file in our example sql key value is a file what is bundled into the executable this file describes the various operations our test will perform if you want to see the file you can extract it with nb copy sql value don't run through this file in this scenario but we want you to know so you can extract this workload from the in b if you want to research for that good so something has happened and uh let's see what's in the baselines now okay so we created some tables and what tables do we have well first base lines is a simple key space with simple strategy replication one so nothing super no surprises here as we have single node cluster and we have um baselines a key value table with key and value so it's going to be pretty simple example for us this one and uh that's all there to creating a test chamber so we prepare it for that for testing at the step three of the catacodon scenario we are going to write some test data so we have shaman but now we want to have test data let's load some data into our newly created table as you may have guessed we can use nosql bench for west for that too before the load before we load the data we want to review the activity no sql spellbench will generate we do this by setting driver as to the out give it a try so you remember the last comment we did was driver cql so cassandra language everything what we did was executed as sql in the end but now we said driver as to the out it's very good and very convenient for debugging things so start is like run but as in chronos where run is synchronous driver as the doubt says push everything to the ester out not to cassandra workload we specify which workload we are going to use and text face ramp up it's a target so um we do only part of the uh wall workload and cycles 10 tells how many times to run the target so this phase ramp up we will dive into the files in a moment good and we see so that's my output it's very simple uh that's basically going to insert some data and we can now so just to reiterate this is with the drivers um set to stdr if it was set to cql it will execute cql commands but when it's to std out all it will do is just um uh display to you what it's about to do um yeah one important point to um to talk about here is that the the data that it generates is deterministic so you can run it as many times as you want it will always generate the same amount of the same data the same values right it's it's random with the distributions that you specify when we look at the recipe you can get a feel for that but at the same time when you do count equals 10 between 1 and 10 if we ran that same command again it would have identical results and that's important when you're doing benchmarking because then you're not we're wondering about okay is the random distribution different this time than last time and that's all based on the cycles the cycle is the seed or the random data and so if you're on cycle one that will generate that'll be the random seed and that will generate the same values on cycle one no matter what yep great so now finally i want to load this data uh to my uh database and to do that i have to update driver and set it instead of sd out so not just print their comments but execute them and instead of s doubt i say cql and it will help me to do all the job a lot the data to cassandra it's ready and now i want to see what's in the database and well all my values what were prepared and deterministically prepared as you've seen here they are with me good so um now we have data in our benchmark model so we can move on uh to proceed with that first thing we do uh we do the real benchmark for the data we prepared shama and data already let's run it and it may take some time so let's walk through the steps i'm doing here nb start driver sql workload sql key value text phase main cycles 100 000 cycle rate 5000 frets 50 progress console to second and indeed we are seeing some progress happening right now while it's going on let's walk through the options we gave so start executes the workload statements asynchronously okay we covered that which workload we are going to use security sql key value workload we prepare it tax phase main if you run it like without tax phase main is going to execute the full workload but don't forget we already prepared shema and data so we don't have to do it again that's why we specify with text we are going to do only the main phase and do the test by itself cycles 100 000 it tells nosql bench to run the section 100 000 times okay clear cycle rate limits the test to 5000 operations per second and we are going to do it in 50 frets so for the proper concurrency and progress console to second is very simple we are setting progress to a console so you see what's going on right now and two seconds means what we are going to update it at this rate good and the benchmark is almost done so um just to reiterate so the the tags um makes the determination in terms of when you specify which phase in the yaml or in the in the workload you want to execute so there's typically these three so there's the the schema face that alex was talking about where it creates the table schema there's the ramp up phase where you're inserting data into the into your tables and then the main phase which is when you're actually doing the load testing work the benchmarking work one other point for that um the phases uh so you have like a schema set up you have things like ramp up so if you're saying okay i want to have a like when i'm doing my load testing i don't want to load tests into an empty database right i want to have a ramp up phase where it kind of puts some data in there because there's background processes that happen once you already have data and then when you're querying the data if you're getting empty data that's kind of a an outlier in terms of of performance and so a ramp up phase is meant to give you a baseline of data before you move forward so you can have like you know a billion data points to start off maybe or a hundred thousand data points to start off and then what the main phase might be is to say now that we've gotten a baseline of data let's push this up and and this would emulate or simulate normal operations against the cluster now that you have kind of some data that's already in there yeah thank you so much hell we are really lucky to have you here with us good and so now we have this test executed but we don't have any interesting results so far so let's move on to the next step and the last step of this introduction into nosql bench understanding the results when we run the test in the beginning nor sql bench tells us about logging so here we see in the every scenario we have logging to logs scenario blah blah blah so that's going basically to be the year month date and so on uh and all the results are written there good and i will not recreate it because we just did that i will move on and i want to see the log file and see some performance metrics so ah wait a moment i need to remove old locks and where it puts them ah locks of course oh my god looks so i will switch to this folder and we have some old logs here so i'm going to open the last one and the last one was this one so my comment will be to open the file but instead of opening all locks i will open the last log and that's going to be okay of course i'm already in the logs folder scenario up boot 41 good so with our grab time timer we see some first results here and uh jeremy would you say would you have a word on what's the most important for us here let me move out of the way thank you so you can see that there's a variety of different metrics that are being tracked at any given time um let me get back to uh so you have like p99 so if you're interested in the p99 or the p and the or the 99.9 percentile then those are obviously you need to make sure that your read queries for instance or your read write mixture happens within that um within that range you can also see the max and some of the statistical details that you might be interested in thank you uh eric you can get back so out here so what's the difference between nosql bench and ycsb i couldn't take that one it's it's nosql bench has really meant we saw a lot of deficiencies and how why a csv was kind of you can always mess with statistics and you can always kind of fudge the results based on what you're doing so we noticed that it just wasn't as flexible as it needed to be and this was kind of a way that we could contribute to the community in terms of having a standard way that was very true to the data models and true to the data stores in terms of benchmarking oycsp was a good effort but i think this addresses a number of the shortcomings that ycsb had okay so let's move on so first i have two things to say here first uh some of you uh maybe oh okay i got it percentiles results uh 99 95 and so on and some of you must be what are all those numbers that's always like that at these workshops because we have people with very different background so first of all don't be afraid of those numbers they're basically very simple and uh they specify like how many of the queries received their answer within some time so percentile 95 means what 95 of the queries received the result within this time and now percentile 99 receive it what 99 of my queries receive it to a response between not higher than this time for example but still not very right so in this in this example it's 702 microseconds so it's less than one millisecond indeed i should have specified the measurement unit so it's milliseconds in this time and uh last thing uh those numbers are convenient to use only for people with a very very huge experience who can read that easily but we want to have things easier no sql bench is very well integrated with grafana to see just to have it all visualized and we we will see it very soon next exercise we are going so we did some comments already that's great but well we want those comments to be more well visualized and we have some great two great tools to do that so to watch some metrics and to watch some results and pressure on your system we will use some external tools and today we speak about grafana and prometheus some of you may be familiar already with them with the last workshops we used them to watch some of the results and system states at the last workshops but if you didn't that's very fine it's easy to say we have graffana is a great visualization tool basically you can give to it any kind of data and save a way how it should be visualize it and which kind of graphs we visualize it for example and you have it very nice you will see it in a moment and also prometheus is a kind of a database we are using to collect the data to show it later in grafana so to do so i'm going again to the catacodon and we have it data stocks courses no sql bench intro no sql bench graphana and we also have all the required things at the github.com at data stacks academic cassandra workshop series but don't dare to do it right now do it after the workshop so i'm getting to katakuram and i start this scenario so what we will do here uh we will run nosql bench against the cassandra cluster and view the stats and that's a very interesting scenario actually that's my favorite scenario for these uh workshop and you soon will see why so we are getting ready we start up cassandra and uh we run nosql bench very soon so it may take a moment so while that's loading um so it's not just the nosql bench that we have on catacota we've got some uh quite a number of um tutorials for say your first java application uh you know there's some data modeling stuff in there um reporting some of the academy courses as well onto um catacoda and you can access them from datasacks.com exactly thank you eric so okay i have my cassandra ready very well and i'm going to execute nodetool status to see what cassandra is up and normal so cassandra is here and ready to do the job now i do interesting thing i run the command which looks pretty familiar so no sql bench cql iot cycle rate 100 progress console 15 seconds docker metrics something looks familiar here like cycle rate or no sql bench or progress console 15 seconds but something is new and that's the docker matrix it means what uh it's an a built-in nosql bench command which means which means we will export statistical data so we can see it in external tools like grafana a nosql bench supports different metrics and different reporting methods including csv if you may need that and hdr but the docker metrics is the easiest to use and definitely easiest for us to use to see the results uh easier to see us don't know how to say it better so we have benchmark running we are going to look at the stats with the docker matrix option no sql bench downloads and launches some additional docker containers to support grafana so we don't embed grafana to this nbe but we use it as an external tool which we run with the docker commands as a docker container and in the lock message we see something already what we have grafana and prometheus running and available in our browser at 000 and host 1990 and we have them right here and we have grafana here and primitives here okay prometheus looks a bit unready but for us the most important thing is graffanam and i'm trying to login it was admin and password what was the password secret admin as well yep good and i will not set these one admin as well yeah correct and grafana is here and it set ups the step no i will not change my password never mind good so we click to home and we go to no sql bench wait a moment for me it's a little bit okay i think it will be easier to use like that so i can i open the same grafana but in my normal browser window and i will make it a little bigger for you to see yes now it looks better when what i want to do is to find now okay we are at home already but i don't see my nosql bench search yes i think i have to because well i don't see my oh something wrong okay something went wrong uh yeah so um what happened is that your session expired from the looks of it so you might need to just refresh it refresh the browser and start again yeah so you guys will notice that um that will happen too that if you're idle for a bit your catacotta scenario will timeout you just need to refresh well then then it's even good what it's happened [Music] yes it may be easier with your local environment but well that's definitely in this case you don't have to if you go with catacod you don't have to install all the things on your local machine maybe we have some questions to answer at discord or youtube while my catacod is starting yes so one of the questions some on discord that jeremy answered this um when we installed no secure bench does it install cassandra and the answer is no so when we're doing the catacotta scenario we're pre-loading stuff for you so that you can just um easily get started doing stuff so we do the same thing for say like when you're you're trying out cqlsh for the first time and you know when you do a cql scenario we preload cassandra a cassandra instance in the background so that it's ready to go by the time you're ready next question is prometheus for performance metrics prometheus collects the data so it collects the so it works with things like collect d to collect uh raw data and then we we send that data to grafana this isn't a datastax technology nothing to do with cassandra so you know if you have if you're monitoring stuff with prometheus and collectd you can send that data to the grafana and grafana will help you visualize the data and do aggregates like graph graphing and stuff how do we how do we do performance tuning uh there's a there's a metrics collector for apache cassandra we we tend to call it mcac mcac that also the data that it collects you can also export it to prometheus and then eventually grafana helps you monitor things like you know disk utilization cpu utilization you know read and write metrics read latencies write latencies heap utilization it it monitors lots of stuff um let me ping the the url hang on in the chat yep i wanted to add what mcac is a great tool which was open source at recently and now it's the easiest really easiest way to collect the metrics information uh for okay uh guys eric jeremy if i will have no luck with katakurdan maybe you can show this workload with grafana on your laptop let's see if i can get that running in parallel okay great thank you so if you will be able to share your screen when i will put your screen over mine and show how it works from your laptop okay let's see if this goes and then i'll start to do the prep for this in the background okay okay while it starts i wanted to have a word on katakura in general so it's not starting too quick for me but in general just for you to know there are very many of different uh courses and materials you may want to see regarding kubernetes as well and some continuous integration you definitely may be interested and so on and so forth and of course data stocks uh uses these uh you use catacota a lot so we can see what there are a lot of courses what also may be useful for you to see data stocks well yeah buy data stocks that's what i'm looking for and there are very many different things regarding astra revo about apache kafka connector for cassandra about kubernetes separator for cassandra and so on and so forth so a lot of things you may want to see and much more actually regarding the things what may be interesting for you like snitches okay we are moving some content there grouping that so it's going to be available in some moments uh jeremy how it goes could you show us how it works i'm running it actually locally but let me get it into the catacora i think it's probably better i will put your screen over mine so let's see and it's still loading on katakura for you okay so let me share my screen on skype then uh i'll be right back i can't share my screen outside until i restart it so one second so sorry for the delay but at least now you see it's a real life workshop no cheating no videos but a real life workshop and where is the price to pay for the workshops like that let's see let me try and share yes everything is okay uh are you ready to share your screen yes yes into a new window so it's not gonna interfere looks like it's running now wait a second are you running it are you running it aaron am i running sorry again i think eric is running i think eric is running it at this point eric are you sharing your screen yep some some sharing okay and it's running and it's running at the moment i'm just waiting for grafana to come up it seems like it's a problem of the catacota hopefully everyone can see the screen yeah yeah why don't i share my screen really quick and see if that helps so so let's take a look here take a look here okay you can see on my screen yes we can see your screen yep okay so we have some distributions we have the client overhead here so the we have the execute the bind the read input so it's kind of laying it out in terms of each individual request what's taking the time so the the execute is taking the most time of 200 microseconds you have the cycle count you can see it's always increasing because we're always going up the service time distribution the in the different percentiles and then the time range so the max is so the the cql iot max is going to be at 173 milliseconds um and the min is 2 milliseconds so you get an idea of some of the the metrics that are being collected from uh noah's fuel bench as it's executing and those get those get exported to here one thing that we found in other places is you can do some some tagging or some annotations within grafana as well so if like you're running a load and and you're completing the ramp up load and you've said say i'm going to bed i'm gonna that's what we did for some sizing testing is i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna have it ramp up and and create like a billion data points and then from that point i'm going to create from 1 billion to 10 billion data points to have like the main the main course of the of running um you can put in annotations to say okay i'm done with it the the um the the ramp up and i'm going into the main and and you can put the annotations in inside grafana as well um so hopefully this gives some idea of let me uh put this out of the way um let's see some of these don't really have a good uh basis for our discussion here but we can see in in this one the service time range the ramp up max of 416 milliseconds um and then you can you can kind of decompose that to say the execution and the bind uh take so much of the time so if you're wondering what's taking the majority of the time in each step so just to go through some of the um some of the graphs in that dashboard that jeremy's showing so the so the ops graph in the top left is the is the rate of um reads and writes per second that that's happening on uh the cluster that uh nosql benches i'm recording the second one is the error count now because we're running it locally and um you know there's only a single node in the back end we don't expect any error counts to show up so that's um something that's really important because if you're seeing errors um on the dashboard the graffana dashboard you really need to investigate on the back end meaning that you need to investigate on the cassandra side of things that you know if if any of the nodes for example can't cope with um the amount of rights that nosql bench is um sending it so that's that's something that you need to be aware of the service time is um the the percentiles of the the data that the metrics that are getting collected so it's how quickly your cassandra database based on the benchmarking that you're doing against the table it's how quickly it's responding to the requests so typically you don't want to see any anything that takes you know more than one second i think in um in jeremy's example you know he's showing that it's topping out at 400 milliseconds which in cassandra terms that's that slow yeah i have a lot running on my laptop right now um and then the fourth one um in the top right there so this this is a graph that's really important um you never want to see the the opt rights distribution to be more than one because if it's more than one it means that uh no sql bench is retrying the the the requests meaning that there's something wrong with the cluster that it has to retries whether it's nodes are unresponsive or the disks can't keep up with the writes you never want to see it more than one and then these are the the decomposed client overhead for the p75 and the p99 requests hopefully we want to expand that so it provides a sanity check to ensure that the client processing time is low and predictable so in case you're wondering about like is it you know is it the overhead that's causing the problems in this case or the the latency you can do kind of a real-time trace to see what is taking what's taking the time okay so i think we are done with this step jeremy eric do you want to show anything else regarding the graffana um maybe just to point out that the bottom right the cycle count is uh it's a nice one as well to kind of observe so you should see that the graph the you know the trajectories that it's growing so for example if you were doing like a million cycles you should see that you know it grows up and goes up to a million because if it doesn't again there's something's gone wrong with your benchmarking okay and i have a question we use off center is it possible to replicate the same i think i know the answer but still um not not directly so that you're not exporting so graphon is more of a general general purpose metrics collector uh collection system whereas op center monitors generally just cassandra the cluster itself and so op center is not going to be able to do like the nosql bench metrics themselves that's more for something that's external to cassandra you can monitor cassandra with grafana but you can also monitor other processes like this this tool that's acting as a kind of a proxy application to cassandra and that's what it's really measuring at this point this is the service time that each request is taking and and it wouldn't make sense to to do so right because what we're doing with nosql bench is that you're benchmarking against your database you you don't normally run benchmarking in production so you wouldn't want that data to be populated in off-center because you know it doesn't make sense but i would maybe adjust the question i think it's not so much about the ops center by itself but more about data stacks enterprise so uh should could i use no sql bench with data stacks enterprise uh yes you can use it with gold this is how we do internal testing against data sex enterprise and cassandra um we've opened sources so the cassandra ecosystem can do regular testing against cassandra as well so whenever we have a large customer that has a very specific use case and they're trying to say i want to generate this load with five data centers and and um and this specific data model we can go ahead and and simulate all of the specifics about that situation taking down data centers taking down links and that sort of thing so um nosql bench is very good at that that sort of use case okay great thank you so and let's move on so i'm switching back to my screen yep welcome back and we did exercise metrics with grafana half with katakota half locally thanks jeremy again and moving back to the next steps uh then all we did was prepare it so thanks everyone working at the workshop to prepare all we need to show how nosql bench works but we want to do some steps on our own and now finally we want to do custom workloads so i already have my custom workloads screen prepared and i hope it's not that like it was last time very well so it's a new scenario in catacoda no sql bench custom workloads and first thing we are going to do is to extract a workload the benchmarking workloads we run in previous scenarios were pre-packaged so you download them kinda together with the nosql bench in this scenario we will build our own workload first thing we have to do is we have to execute the nodes tool status to ensure our cassandra is up and running and it looks like it's up and running now we will list and workloads to see what we have in the uh pre-packaged workloads uh jeremy let me move you a little bit so we will not hide the data sorry so yes now jeremy will not hide the data from you good and we have uh a list of the workloads included here so what's we see in the output first activities baseline cql iot dse iot workload which more optimal for data stacks enterprise next one activities best baseline cql io team workload emulates a time series data model and access patterns what is the time series data model everything what relates to the data arriving like from the time event for example reports from sensors in iot for example but there are very many uh time series uh data workload stock taker again uh stock taker is another example of our um time series data so anything that you're constantly writing stuff but you're not updating it yes that's about more rights than reads and slow amount of a low amount of updates we have activities baselines cqa sql key value it's a key value based workload so not the most used way maybe with cassandra but still known use case cql tab tabular tabular workload with partitions clusters and data fields kinda a traditional workload for cassandra i would say activities mongodb basic uuid activities mongodb basics so again no sql bench is not about cassandra or at least not only about cassandra using proper drivers we can test nearly every nosql database you can imagine and that's what we have here i'm a bit curious why it's so small give me a moment it's snoops get back get the back yes better good so i will open text a bit more very well now um what we are going to do we are going to extract an existing workload so we will not create a new one out from nothing but we will use existing workload to do so we go with nosql bench copy sql io team it's done and now i'm going to inspect the extracted file so that's the sql iot file i'm opening it right here so and we see some things explaining this file and well there is no need to explain what's the description i guess everyone understands we have two scenarios here default and astra default you could guess as the main scenario will be run here and astra if you want to run it with astra database not for not not with the local cassandra node we have some bindings preparation what will be the id uh what will be sensor name station id and so on and we have some blocks so uh face shamma define it and how exactly to prepare the shema so we create key space and we create table that's the face shema and we prepare everything we need in shema astra looks a little bit different then ramp up we will write with consistency level local quorum and we insert some data define it in the bindings bindings um some verifications we may need and that's the phase main and we define here a ratio and consistency level and statements we are going to execute and that was the read part because uh in the iot uh scenario in this case you not only write but you also read but that's i guess mostly going to be uh right active scenario and well you see read ratio is going to be one and right ratio is going to be nine so we write much more when we read and here there are uh exact steps we are going to do to make the insert statements and that's the wall sql iot file workload it's basically 137 lines and it's pretty simple it may look not so obvious in the beginning but you will get used to it and it gives you newly unlimited ways to test your database for these kind of issues and now we can execute this workload with the following so i'm running nb dot sql io team stop no i want it to run with the progress yes so just while you're doing that um alex maybe we can explain how the bindings are used in the statements yes yes yes give me a second i will make it larger and you will explain that so for each variable i think that is going to be inserted into the database yeah if you can see that okay for each variable that's inserted into the database you have things like [Music] hash line to string so what it does is each binding takes as an input the cycle and then it takes that cycle and then runs it through [Music] the the method like you've highlighted the sensor name is a hash line to string and so it takes the cycle the current cycle that you're on of the you know 10 million cycles or whatever and then uses that as as a hash line to string so it says whatever whatever the cycle was [Music] get that line of the the variable words text file and and then you can do mods you can do distributions so the sensor value is going to take a cycle that you're currently on and then take the the normal distribution between 0 and 5 and then add 100 so it's going to be between the 100 and 105 for that cycle or for that for that value you have about 100 different stations that you're operating on and then 10 000 different sources within that station i believe and then you have basically a payload of data at the bottom and so just to try to say uh there there needs to be a little bit more payload than just these values so it could have some deeper sensor value but this is just kind of trying to emulate that the time is the elapsed time let's see if you want to chime in here too eric i'm trying to just remember so if we just scroll down a tiny bit alex to just so we can show some of the statements and how the how the bindings are used in the statements themselves sorry so here we've got the insert um happening so see how you've got the curly brackets in the values section of the insert statement so this is the actual cql and it it substitutes so for example for the machine id it substitutes the the output of the function that's in the bindings defined for that machine id column and and similarly for the for the select statement a little bit further down on the screen um it does the same thing so when it constructs the filter for the the select statement again it uses the bindings for the different columns and those are the cql statements that get run by uh nosql bench right and what i was describing above is how it takes whatever cycle that you're currently on and translating that to data that would be indicative of of whatever data you're trying to emulate or simulate and we've got a question from um discord from the al so the question was how do i see the ddls remember at the very start we had the driver equals stdf it will show you the actual cql statements that will get run if you specify that as opposed to driver equals cql yeah it's kind of like a dry run right um and question on youtube how do we do it against our existing application workload you can in fact run it against your existing data right you can be running against your data or you can generate data like what this is is doing the other thing that you can do is it's not just meant for working against cassandra directly what you can also do is there's an activity type of of kafka and so you can integrate with kafka and and um i think that there's something to um you write out to the port and then the port intercepts that and then and then uh adds that to the topic i believe something like that we've we've integrated it with with kafka and spark streaming as well um to be able to to ingest essentially simulate ingestion of data through kafka and spark streaming in batches yep great and i wanted to add one more thing regarding the execution of this file and execution of workloads with no sql bench do you remember in the very beginning at the first steps at catacoda we first prepared shama when we ramp up ramped it up with the data and then we do the main taste the main phase so when you run um nosql bench without any phases specified that's uh it will do a full scenario all the steps identified here but when you work with the existing data when you don't need to do a shama creation or the ramp up then you just may want to use only the main scenario without creating of anything and then you can run it specifying the uh tag face uh face like that's let me scroll yes face main directly going to the exact workload with testing good so i think i will switch back very well and and and just an item of you know what you mentioned earlier as well is to say that when you look at the ratio within that phase the main phase for instance you'll have read steps and right steps and you can combine the reads and writes in a single single single phase and then and then uh the ratio is like you said like you said there's nine rights to one lead in the iot sentence and you can combine multiple reads to say if i have microservices that are doing different different types of freezing under the same data you could put those in the same phase as well so that you can emu or simulate exactly what your application would be doing at any given time good so now we are going to create create a test shema the first thing a workload wants to do is to create the necessary tables for the benchmark let's build an example workload to create the iot key space and tables alpha you would normally start with an existing file and modify it in this example we are going to build the file from scratch so we can discuss each piece just just um checking again alex i think um we've lost sound can you just give us a thumbs up if it's back on sound should be good down thanks thanks good so first we are going to open sql iot basic share my yaml which is pretty empty and that's how it should be and then they put the comment at the top of the file which shows how to run the workload and the description of a workload and it's very simple it just defines the description and a comment explaining how to run this file but we cannot execute this file yet because it has only description defined so we want to have something more then we are going to add some more things we may need here so um we need to add some blocks good and we define the text and face shamma it looks better and we will need params uh prepare it false so we will not use prepared statements and finally oh my god it works very easily right you're not using this statement to create the schema and i have to copy the statements yes good so i have text defined for this block and param a parameter define it and i have some statements so statement i will have statements to create key space i will i have statements to create key space create table and truncate table in case we will not need it anymore i want to run these workload file so i first have to stop the previous one okay it's almost done hey there you know sql bench is very busy running my previous workload so doesn't want to stop it just while um alex is doing that we've got um for those who are staying so we've only got a few minutes left so for those who are staying we've got an ama session so you can ask us anything we'll stay for another half an hour we'll do a quick break after the session and then we'll go for another half an hour and you can just you can ask us anything during that half an hour you are very right we are almost out of time that's the last workload uh that's the last thing we want to show you today but we have something special uh for you with david and i want you to sh i want you to see that before you leave so i will stop this presentation for a second and show you what david prepared for you because it's very important to see we discussed it a lot in the past how important is uh to make not only proper data model but also usage of this model and the first rule of the cassandra is do not use a low filtering in production so david prepared something for you to seem um like why exactly and with no sql bench no square bench is a great tool to visualize well not visualize to run this workload and with grafana we can see how exactly it affects the system so we have five minutes before the schedule time i want to show this thing and i want you to see because it's very very very important so in this example i'm going to use nosql bench to kind of tease out what might happen in a case where i want to performance test against the data model one with my normal correct query access pattern using a correct partition key in my select statement and another using an anti pattern with allow filtering and this is one of the really neat features of nosql bench it allows me to run a scenario where i can compare both of these access patterns in the same performance run to see what this does to the performance of my database now in this particular case i have a six node cassandra cluster that's running and i just want to point out that the data load on this cluster is not very big right i don't even have a terabyte of data in the full cluster and this is a six node cluster so that's actually pretty big for the amount of data that i have now i'm using nosql bench right now to actually run a scenario where i am writing many thousands of operations a second or i'm also writing and reading to the database and that's what we're seeing here so we we can look at our write latency our read latency and such now what i want to do though is i want to kick off a phase that i've created for an anti-pattern now i'm just going to let that run for a moment while that's running i'm going to explain something so if you take a look at this particular command line parameter you'll see this workload cql iot killer video and within it i'm talking to one of the hosts that's in my cluster over here and this tags equals phase main ante right what this is about so i'm going to the main anti phase of this file so what i'm going to do is i'm going to look here this is the cql iot killer video yaml i just want to point out that there is a phase called main ante here we go and check this out so right above it is the regular main phase that's the one that i was just running a moment ago when we looked at the metrics notice here that again we have a select statement against some table but the machine id and the sensor name are my partition keys they're a composite key and i'm using them properly in the second one though notice i have my phase main ante look what we're doing here though this time in my where clause i'm not actually providing something that is in my key at all and i'm using allow filtering to allow it to run otherwise it would give me an error and that's what i'm running right now so the real fun is to see what kind of difference will i see in my data now again because this is all configured in a single workload file in no sql bench i can very easily switch between these different patterns to see what will happen so now the data does lag behind just a little bit but you can already start to see that i have an uptick here my range slices and my coordinator range read latency you can see that this one from being essentially a flat line right for this whole run that i did until a nice uptick and you can see that this is actually starting to come up as well how about if i pull this down to five minutes it's also interesting to note that the amount of reads and writes that i'm able to perform have also dropped off right so if you notice before i had a good clip going with these but now they have dropped off significantly you can see now as well that my read latency is starting to go up okay so now that a little time has elapsed notice that the read latency has increased significantly up to 6 seconds and even 4 seconds for our p95s that's really pretty high and you'll see the same thing for our rate latency and again the decrease in the amount of operations we're actually able to handle so i can stop that scenario and then just switch it back over to the main scenario and as that runs then the data will come down you'll see that the re-latency will drop as we go back to again a correct query pattern as compared to the anti-pattern that we brought into play and so that's it just wanted to illustrate uh one way that you can use nosql bench to help kind of explore different query access patterns all in one go while looking at the metrics for your cassandra cluster okay i think we are back and many thanks to david okay i think we are back and many things okay sorry for the sound one thing can i can i uh so um i think that not only can you test your data model but you can also test the cluster as it well obviously as as it relates to the data model and the patterns of data data querying that you're going to do such as what david just showed but also if you're trying to burn in your cluster as well you can use one of the baked in activities to say is my cluster tuned correctly and so you could say for cql iot cql key value cql tabular you can run that and then change a setting in your cluster to say what if i change the compaction throughput in my cassandra.yaml will that make a difference in terms of how the cl the cluster performs you can do that and then change that and then run one of these baked in scenarios or you can run one of the scenarios that more matches your use case and see if that makes a difference in terms of throughput or in query latency as david was describing yep thank you so uh we are start to get uh a bit out of time but you've seen all the most important things today so now we just want to show the end up with the custom workload we prepare it already the first block so don't forget no scale bench workload consists of blocks and we just define it in this tiny file the first block which has a tag face shema which has params parameter prepared false and three statements define it create space create key space create table and truncate table and we want to execute that and i run it with nosql bench run driver sql workload specifying my file threads auto and cycles free so it's not going to be too active and it will create key space and create table for me and accordingly to i have no errors so far it will be fine for me and i have it's executed good we can try to take a look at the locks okay yes and lock is general going to be like that some reports for us now it's not important the main thing no errors so yes everything is executed and first block of our custom workload works well let's move on then now we are going to write some test data so we have shamma but sham is not enough to do some testing so we want to put some data into the shema when benchmarking we are attempting to emulate the normal performance how it looks like with a realistic or almost realistic workload this includes access patterns data density per node and many other factors so the ramp up phase brings the test system to the uh situation of the loaded data and be ready for the test and now we want to build an example ramp up workload file so uh before the workloads we had was in a single file but now we want to isolate them to keep them simple and readable so now secular iot basic shema is our shema file and we are going to have sql iot basic ramp up yaml file so it will have a data creation steps and we put a description to it it's going to be the same simple description workload emulates a time series data model and ramps up data after shama creation good now we define again a block so block is the main entity for us and it will have a tag phase ramp up so we can specify this phase and we have to prepare the bindings bindings were explained already by our great speakers and by things are basically the data we are going to use and for different kinds of data we are going to use different kinds of bindings and in the insert trump app we have only one simple statement uh inserting the required data in the consistency level local quorum so we don't need anything else and now we are going to have these executed so we created the shema already and now we want this shamma to be loaded with the data and i run this command so it will be noise quilt bench run cassandra query language driver workload is basic ramp up the file we just created frets auto cycles 100 000 and put progress to the console so what we are doing right now we are inserting the test data which particular data is defined and the bindings how exactly do we insert that using the insert ramp up statement so it may take some time but in the end we have our workloads executed and all the data is inserted gentlemen we may need some time to put the data in so maybe there are any questions you would answer eric jeremy are there any questions you would answer there aren't any at the moment just waiting for anyone if you've got any questions okay but uh we are mostly done okay so it doesn't matter we are good yes uh so this step is completed and we created the shamma at the previous step and we loaded the data uh at the at least step so we can move on and this one is going to be the step 4 and we are very close to the end now we are going to create a sql iot basic main file and it's completely empty but we start to put the content so let's take a look what we have right now we have a file very short one with a description and one block is defined this block is tagged it will have tag in phase main it has some bindings so machine id and sensor name and this way we indicate a read workload at the system so select read select all from baselines iot the machine id is and sensor name is we are reading iot data given we know machine id and sensor name very well oops yes and when i run this workload what i do so i run using driver sql i specify the workload sql iot basic main that's the file we created and for now it executes only read workload reading the data we created before in the ramp up phase meanwhile i can close all files oops okay okay katakuri is not happy with me today all right all right how about we take a quick break and then be back for questions yes um meanwhile let us have a five minutes break and i will prepare all the steps to show you the last step of this scenario so five minutes break it's now i don't know your hour but i know your time hopefully for me it's 11 10 and consider your time we meet again five minutes later and i will create the workload for us uh to run the last step of this example so welcome back eric very on time so okay so what's 11 16 for me that means what five minutes break is over and we are going to proceed and meanwhile i've just finished it with um secure iot basic main file so this workload i've prepared with the read only workload was successfully executed and finally i can show you the last step of the workload we are doing yes putting it all together so at this point you could actually stop with the shema ramp up in main main face files and simply work with those you could execute those workloads with the following commands and everything would work fine we use iot basic shama yaml to define the shaman we can use iot basic run-up file to load uh schema with the data and we can use sql iot basic main to execute the read on list scenario and we put that to three different files because we wanted to keep them small and understandable and each file defines one block so all together we see what our workload consists of three blocks and now uh we want to build some more as we have secure iot basic all yaml file and that's basically all what we have but with some more kind of data and united together and now we can run file specifying the text so for example instead of running different files at a different time i can use this file specifying the exact step i want to execute for example in this case i want to actually execute workload i specify my united file secure iot basic all but i specify that tech and i want to use ramp up only so it will only load data for me for example and uh now we may uh define the different blocks and different scenarios so let me scroll down a little bit oops and i will stop this one because we don't need it right now yes good and i'm going to add one more line well not one more line but some more lines i'm adding scenarios scenarios allow me to define well scenarios it's the easiest way to explain that and yes one block is redundant i have to remove that and now i have a default scenario so i may not only run that simple step specifying a tag or a wall file but i can simply run this file and as i have the default scenario it will do all the things and it knows what exactly to do so i specified right first i run shamma block with some settings second i run the ramp up block with some settings and finally i run main block with some settings and then i can execute these just specifying the scenario name so i'm running this file secure iot basic all with all the phases we united together i specify the scenario i want to execute and i ask to put the progress to the console with every one second and basically we are done with this topic congratulations so and the very last steps last point homework we want uh your homework to be very simple this time because you did a great work over all the last weeks so first thing we do we do the exercises of a week seven so that's you do it all in catacoda just what i did right now or you do it with uh locally and validation form of the week link to the validation form of the week should be in the video description under us uh at the youtube but if you i hope you have it there if it's not delivered there then you know where to ask because we have well these materials at the community.datastax.com astra caton reminder astra caton is going in we have four weeks to build real cassandra applications and date is now set after the eight week workshop august 20th so we have not so much time one week left so you're going to do your work quickly and it's going to be over at 12 p.m pst pst is pacific standard time i believe and august 26th we will do and ask me ask you anything special episode last episode of the cassandra workshop series we have a lot of surprises and we are known swinners and we have a lot of fun and we are done for today we stay here for 10-15 more minutes to answer all the questions and that's we are very happy to have you with us thank you for joining us and let's get some questions answer it so um really good question from krishna so can we do can we handle this part of the benchmarking using no sql bench so that's a really good one so typically what you would do is you would run a a benchmark for against your data model without encryption enabled and then after you've completed that run you do another you set up encryption and then you run another benchmarking and then you can compare so typically depending on you know depending on the stuff that you do it can range anywhere from 10 to 15 percent overhead i think in my experience it's usually more that it's going to be cpu bound um the other constant question that we keep getting asked when are we gonna are we gonna do an operations or an administrator workshop yes that's in the works that um it seems like there's a high demand for it um but like i said when we were doing the kubernetes um workshops um you know the the future is not in being an administrator because um you can easily be replaced with the with an uh kubernetes operator now um what you do can you know uh installing cassandra configuring cassandra you know deploying cassandra maintaining cassandra all of that can now be done with the kubernetes operator you know um we've you've been replaced by software so um if you if you if you want to have a future in cassandra you need to be a developer in in any um in any technology really doesn't not just cassandra so uh i have to strongly disagree at this point um well we can say what artificial intelligence could replace iterations or developers but it may happen only in one case when managers or customers will be able to explain their requirements in a clear obvious simple manner and from my experience it's going to happen approximately never so i do think what operations and developers all of us will be still required in the future but well future will show there is a question would it be a good idea to get into kubernetes when well we see what the future is in the clouds and we see what uh many many companies migrate more and more and more and more people start to use microservices and containers and so on and currently it looks like docker swarm has lost this competition and kubernetes is definitely the industry standard to run um orchestration and management over data centers with containers so it's definitely a good idea at least to understand what's the kubernetes and how it's going to work uh i'm not i cannot recommend you all to jump to kubernetes because well it's not for every project let's say but at least understand what is it and what it does and why you may need that that's definitely a very good idea a lot of companies keep asking us how to deploy [Music] in a kubernetes cluster it's a in thing at the moment and one more thing we keep talking about the kubernetes but it's like talking about the very high level things although we still have low level things um to cover and you cannot successfully manage your kubernetes if you don't understand what's the docker and what's the docker container is and we are about to run a next series uh much shorter when we swan a door to docker dedicated so we will walk through through the darker things in a quiet pace with no hurry with no pressure like like we did for this workshop series trying to push all the knowledge in the world to your poor brains it will be much slower and we will cover from the very beginning what a container why you may need that how docker works how do you use that what's the docker compose and when you need that and then finally when you may need the kubernetes and how you develop applications with docker because i've seen so many companies using docker in so weird way following all the possible anti-patterns working with docker so we will cover things like that this course is not announced yet but we are about to announce that so i expect it to start somewhere in the middle of september maybe end of september and i expect it to take approximately four weeks so it will be introduction to docker and getting deeper with docker yes uh two uh people asked us how do we subscribe for these kind of things and answer is first follow us at the youtube and like our workshops at the youtube that's a great motivator for us to keep doing the things your subscriptions and your likes that's very close to eric there is a button under the ramirez subscribe and like and you have to press this button thank you yes and the second thing if anyone would be able to get the link to our eventbrite page on the eventbrite that's the main page for us to announce all the events and we have you can go to eventbrite.com i can actually show you as long as i'm sharing my screen yes that's the eventbrite and there is the data stocks and we have some events coming in so cassandra cloud native workshop series is the one you uh attending right now uh there is an uh chinese specific event dedicated for cassandra version 4 tomorrow but well most of you i guess don't speak chinese if you do that's a very good place to do and you can press the follow button here and you will receive notifications of our upcoming events and if we don't have any more questions i would end up with that okay i see the last question [Music] can we expect cassandra related webinar which mainly focuses on the administration tasks kumar manish so thank you for the question we receive a lot of questions like that we work to deliver this kind of content as well because cassandra administration especially not especially at scale is not easy so far i can only recommend uh give me a moment now okay so far i can only recommend academy.datastax.com there is a course for maintenance and operations eric do you remember the number of this course it was two zero ds20201 four um foundations and two two one zero four uh operations uh so uh two one zero for operations it explains a lot and now it's the best place to learn the operation and maintenance with cassandra any more questions we are about to end for today so thank you so thanks very much again for joining us uh this week um really good to see um you know we've got um huge support out there people that attend every single week uh-huh and i have last question for today i am from oracle dba background we are getting into no sql stuff now learning it on our own and doing some proof of concepts so an optimal path would be learn container kubernetes and nosql my answer is well maybe eric has his own answer my answer is no those two are very different lanes very different ways so you can do only one of them you can do both of them you can do one by one you can do at the same time they aren't directly related to each other so you can do cassandra completely with containers you can do cassandra completely without kubernetes it's not related technically anyhow and um right whatever is more it doesn't solve your problems learning containers doesn't solve it uh learning about containers and kubernetes doesn't solve your nosql problem so uh focus on nosql if that's the problem that you're trying to solve yes uh this way so i would there are no dependencies on these paths and you can start with nosql proceed with containerization or start with containerization then proceed to know well those are very different fields they aren't related directly i would say all right all right i think that's it i think that's it yes i think we are done for today okay the owl is typing maybe the last one we don't have a concrete problem to solve just self-learning thanks again for the info well my position you have to learn both a bit uh to be an up-to-date developer or be up-to-date dba yeah thank you all for attending uh sorry for some sound issues we will fix them by the next workshop and it was a big pleasure to be with all of you here thank you for coming thank you for answering questions uh thank you for being with us and see you next week ciao",
