  "title": "Reactive Apps with Quarkus + Responsive Data with Cassandra = Developer Nirvana!",
  "description": "Our install-free Cassandra workshops touch upon how Cassandra is an ideal platform for instantaneous data access. Quarkus is a Java framework and runtime built on technologies and standards familiar to most Java developers. It's reactive at its core, boasting extremely fast boot times and low memory utilization, while providing near-instant scale-up. This is critical for JVM apps when running on high-density container platforms such as Kubernetes. It offers a great developer experience, with capabilities such as live coding, continuous testing, and so on. If you’re a Spring or Java developer/architect, this workshop is meant for you!! Even if you’re a novice Java developer you will be able to follow along and level up your skills.\n\nWhile this demo won’t transform you into a power cloud-native programmer or architect overnight, you’ll learn by doing and taking some baby steps towards the transition. In this session, you’ll start from scratch by installing GraalVM and will learn how to hook up your Quarkus app to AstraDB and end up packaging it as a native app (goodbye JVM), all from a cloud-based IDE. You will also look at features of the platform such as hot reloading, debugging, etc., which make development a joy again!\n\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs",

    "text": "hello and welcome to the demo on building micro services with quarkus and cassandra uh in the words of the famous programmer nicholas worth programs is equal to algorithms plus data structures and in a world where speed matters quarkx is about a reactive platform and cassandra is really about responsive data and used together it's a great combination for microservices my name is raghavan srinivas i go by rags and i am a developer advocate at datastax so the agenda for this demo is pretty simple we have a brief presentation followed by mainly live coding we will have a workshop later in october where you can get hands-on with the same material and we'll touch on the same aspects of the workshop but it will be at a fairly high level in this demo so the inner loop is where there are maximum productivity gains immediate feedback as you know is very critical in the loop and we'll see this in action today this is really fundamentally new to java programmers uh to be able to see immediate results but even though it's might be might look different and the platform does new things it's still java and you know you can still use your favorite ide whatever it is intellij or visual studio you know i myself use visual studio in this demo but you can use really anything you want of course the second part of the programming equation i talked about before is responsive data cassandra has always been known for its performance the biggest criticism for cassandra was that it was hard to get started but astra makes it really really easy by providing a cassandra as a service in the cloud without really any maintenance headaches there is even a free tier without a credit card that developers love to use basically leverages the uh quarkus cassandra extension um which we'll see in in today's demo as well so with that said let's jump straight into the demo so before i start the demo i just want to give a little bit of background it's a fairly simple application basically it's a simple to-do application which stores the data in cassandra so what we'll do is we'll look at the platform briefly and then deploy it into communities like any typical microservices application would uh and also see how a native app can be generated so what a native app means you know the jvm is done right you know you're not even going to use the jvm but it's going to work exactly the same way and again we'll be fairly high level here but we'll go more in depth in the workshop so with that said let me jump straight into the demo so like i said it's all java so it it is really you you know leveraging maven um you know which most java programs do so to be able to use this basically what i'm doing here is i'm i'm running a target called quarkus dev and and essentially i'm skipping tests here uh but you know uh quarkus frame framework is great for testing as well but in the interest of simplicity i'm just doing a build without running the tests and you'll see here essentially what is happening is you know it's building it and providing access to this particular port 5005 for debugging i'm not going to do debugging but you know um what i'll show here is that kind of hot reloading the hot uh code reloading so to be able to do that i'm going to go into visual studio okay and you if you want to pay attention here you know look at this 4kb on github right and you can see that this program is already running okay so this program is running um and what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a very simple change okay so fork me i'm going to say today okay on github okay and as soon as i hit my save you should be able to see that change reflected there um you know you can see the ribbon here got changed uh and and you know essentially what it did was uh uh picked up the changes a lot of things happened under the under the covers but we don't really need to worry about that we can also get some information on um the quarkus framework itself um like for example um you know about prometheus uh micrometer metrics uh it leverages rest easy and so on and so forth so let's go back um and look at this uh actually let's do one more thing which is like look at what are the different options for example you can do testing we can force the restart uh we can do uh toggle the live reload and so on like any microservice you know this could be invoked from another service as well just to kind of simulate that what i'm going to do here is i'm going to um essentially uh invoke or a invoke a service which inserts it to do okay the inserting to do is done using astra as you can see here i'm using astra um you know it provides me with my sql sql console and all that i'm doing here is i'm inserting into to-do list and what are the different fields like list id id whether it's completed or not and what's the title okay and we'll take a moment to kind of go through this right so my coach tells me do this you know from another service right so i'm going to take a look at this um and you know if i uh look at the you know the entries you will see that you know this this entry got added right so if i go back to my program okay and just run it again okay refresh it you should be able to see this okay so coach said do this right i'm gonna say okay i did this and i'm going to clear it right so that's pretty much how this program works and how you know the microservices approach um the nice thing about this is kind of the reloading part and and also you know like i said you can do debugging and all that i'm not going to show them all of that because just don't have the time right now um so with that let's move to the next one which is really about containerizing this application so containerizing this application is pretty straightforward all that i'm going to do is i'm going to do a docker push and i leverage a plugin called jib okay and what i'm doing here is i'm pushing the container image and again i'm skipping the tests okay so so what's going to happen here is if i go back to my docker hub repository it's going to automatically push this so you can see here there is a quarkus cassandra okay and if you notice you'll see that you know it was about an hour ago right and eventually this is going to push here and you will see a latest version of this containerized image okay so give it a moment okay do you see here it was updated a few seconds ago right from from another now one of the cool things it does it also generates um you know the kubernete manifests and all that i need to do to be able to run it in a container is just apply this okay so so what it's doing is it generated the manifest okay and we can take a look at that manifest in a second maybe we can take a look at it right now okay and if you go into target okay and look at humanities okay and communities.yamo you'll see here that it's generating this it just generated it for us so how do i [Music] stand up the container is just you know run this right and pretty soon this should be up and running so let's take a look at the services if only you can spell it all right and it should be up and running so it's notice it's running on port 80 right i'm running it basically on my local docker desktop you really can run it anywhere including like a gate center or cluster if you want but essentially what this is doing is again connecting to you know the astrodb right so so if i do this it should not work because you know it's the previous invocation that we got it off right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to run the um dockerized version or the kubernetes version and you'll see here that you know i am able to um invoke my containerized application so as simple as that to be able to do a containerized application but we can go one step further right and to be able to do that um so let me go ahead and delete this because i don't think i need this okay and what i'm going to do here is i'm going to generate a native image and to run the native image all that i do is again package it i'm not going to do a clean and it's going to take a while to build but but you will see a lot of things happening all right the build completed and essentially what it did was use jni right and generated the native image to be able to run the native image all that i need to do is run the image just like that right so i this is the astro demo runner and uh that's pretty much it so it's running the quarks framework it's asking me to open up the port and now i'm ready to run it so now if i go back to localhost this should not be running because this is the previous incantation so now if i run 8080 it should be bringing up the latest native image and that's pretty much it to running a native image very straightforward to do so what we did in the light coding was essentially looked at the platform which is really java leveraging maven the ide that you're used to and then what we did was we built a you know a java image right a jar and essentially um you know saw how we could do hot roll uh hot reloading debugging and so on uh and then what we did was we containerized it because you know you're using it as a micro services it's really about like i said fast programs and fast data and and to be able to kind of put put that together uh and the last part that we did was um you know you can generate it as a native image and maybe even containerize that so there are you know make make the startup really really fast which is one of the key things that you want to do in microservices you can try to try it out yourself you know pretty straightforward there are a number of quick starts that quarkx provides uh and then like i said you know you can look at the quarkus matrix by just putting the slash q slash dev on the path um astra is very easy to use all that i did was i used a secure connect bundle to be able to connect uh to the particular astra database which is on the um you know in the cloud uh and we are gonna again have a quercus and cassandra workshop later in october uh that you're welcome to attend uh with that said thank you very much",
