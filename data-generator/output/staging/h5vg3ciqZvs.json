change [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah there we go so oh okay now finally hello and welcome everyone uh hi stefanon hi hi alex hello everybody so welcome welcome uh that's uh introduction to nosql databases prepared and done by data stacks developer relations developer advocates that's alex volchnev and stefano latinim and we are happy to greet you here today we are happy to have you with us and that's amazing what we all meet at this uh dev park so welcome let's start um that's going to be introduction to nosql databases and welcome to the data stacks workshop as part of dev hacks that's going to be one of the first events or sub-events parts of deaf hack and we hope with this one and all the hours will be very educative successful and interesting for you helping you to be better so let's go today the film alex volchniv and stefano lattini developer advocates and data stacks we work with nosql databases for many many many years if we unite our experience it's going to be like quite big numbers and we are happy to be here with you and talk to you today um a bit of housekeeping for this workshop our primary stream platform is youtube and that's mostly probably where are you watching us right now but we always have a plan b as experienced engineers we always have plan b plan b is twitch if anything goes wrong for you on youtube you can switch to our twitch data stack steps and see us them but well then we don't monitor comments there we don't answer questions there now about questions we have two platforms to answer questions youtube chat and discord for today our primary discord is this discord of dev hacks so that's the place where we'll be answering questions and youtube chat of course too but as soon as stream is over youtube chat will be closed so if you want to keep in contact with us you can use dev hacks discord server or you can use our data stacks discord server and then finally we use a special platform to ask questions now you can ask our questions and that's great we have multiple people in the chats to answer those but we also want to be able to ask questions to you and to do that we use menti.com mentor.com is a great platform it's completely anonymous you don't have to put your lucky put your email or mobile phone number maybe i don't know credit card nothing like that you just jump in and participate on any muslim and we are going to do it actually very soon now regarding the hands-on part we want you to push the buttons we want you um to do the work because you know what theory is great but without practice theory is mostly almost useless so we want you to push for buttons and do the exercises for today i will show you some things and i want you to do them as well and we have two places for you to do that our github repo which has all the workshops steps presentations slides but also practical steps for you to follow and today we are going to work with astra astrodb which is a nosql database um based on apache sound but supports many different data models to work with you will see it soon and astrodb is database as a service you don't have to install anything it's all available in the cloud and that's on the data stock site to keep things running maintain them upgrade operating systems update databases and so on so that's quite amazing and you don't pay for that that's also very nice so now some of you are going to go the full path watch all the recordings and do the practice as well and you know what you are the best if you do that oh that's amazing and we will we want to make it visible to the world we want to share your achievement to do so we are using participation certificates or achievement unlocked pages so if you complete the video on so watch the stream if you do all the homework steps practice all the practice steps you get your page to break on linkedin or i don't know maybe facebook maybe instagram and that's quite cool i will explain later in the end how exactly do you do the homework and how you're going to get this page and now last minute before we start i want you to answer my questions so how do you do that you go to mentee.com and enter code 3802 um z seven two five sorry i've tried to switch to german no uh three eight zero two zero seven two five or just scan this qr code next to uh stefano oh i'm hiding uh sorry i'm hiding the test i'm writing it in the chat anyway oh thank you yeah so anyway that's in the chat so go to mendy.com enter code 3802.0725 or scan the qr code next to stefano and let's start because sooner you answer our questions sooner we will start answering yours what do you think now i'm going to ask the first question meanwhile before starting few questions to adapt content and our talking points which role describes you the best please answer using mendy.com not on the youtube chat okay student really makes sense front-end developers okay back-end developer that's great we have no administrators and mostly students so welcome that is great and that's great you know what you're trying to do something outside of your university or college or whatever you are taking it's great like curious people i usually get the better jobs higher salaries and so on so keep learning outside of the university as well okay we have one administrator and so on and i see kennedy asks is there any homework well yes yeah that's a good question yes and no so there are practice steps to complete you can do them during a workshop or after that first focusing on listening to us when you do it after the home workshop you can consider it as a homework so what's mine so we have mostly students and that's perfectly fine we are happy to greet everyone and that's an amazing so are you using nosql databases today are you using any kind of a nosql databases today no no sequel no reason to be sorry about that you see no sql is great but it's like not the real requirement for many projects maybe all good sql will be completely enough some people have experience with document oriented db okay good and while we are waiting for your answers i will say you one more thing special thing and the end of this workshop we are going to run a quiz a competition they are not only answering uh questions but you have to do it fast give the right answers and then the top three winners top three people on the leaderboard will get their prizes prizes from data stocks a little bit of swag and that's amazing so jump into mentee to get familiar with that and therefore you will be able to win the prize if you don't know how to use mentee you will have smaller chances now okay some people have experience with document oriented db i think i will not fail if i will mention mostly probably you are you mean by document oriented beam i believe let's move on have you attended one of our workshops before data stacks devs are doing a lot of workshops sometimes we do multiple workshops per week like this one was quite quite intense we did how many workshops we did this week one two three four this is the third this is the fifth i believe the fifth yeah streaming on monday one per day right certification on tuesday um spring um and java twice no simple wednesday first day and this one yeah so it's a workshop number five day one per working day so i see some people who never attended our workshops before okay i hope you will love it and we see some guests who already has attended our workshops welcome now a quick question nosql databases are schema-less true false it depends okay our opinions true what do you think false true it depends okay so it looks like there are different options and i see people answering in youtube chat please answer on main team mostly no schemas or false quite contradictive but interesting we have nearly perfect distribution over those options and six people say it depends four people say it's true and four people say it's false who is right and who is wrong soon we will see i will not give you the answer right now then what is exactly no sequel do your best i know most of you have no idea what's why you are in this workshop i want to see your answers what do you think it is okay database multiple groups of databases no one have answered a group of databases which is weird so it looks like we you see we just had some people who attended our workshops already and some people who didn't and the distribution looks very similar yeah i believe oh finally okay yeah i believe that's not a coincidence but there is a relation between those facts and there are seven people answer it it's a database i bet that by the end of today's workshop this uh the answers will be more concentrated into one one answer yes yes exactly so we are going uh to tell you something within next hour and something and we will see what will you think in the end and finally how many nosql databases exist which kind of suggests an answer to a previous question dozens hundreds okay less than ten any more answers what do you think two people think what less than ten seven people think dozens five people think hundreds well accordingly to the database engines.com and their researches there are over 200 of nosql databases and the right answer to the previous question there are hundreds of nosql databases and the right answer to a question before that uh there are it's a groups of families of databases so multiple groups of databases and finally right answer to a question is nosql schema-less answer is it depends as there are multiple hundreds of databases of course they are different they are created to solve different problems they behave differently and you may use some of them for different use cases so answer is no sql databases and neither schema-less nor schema full but it depends on each and every particular databases you touch well thank you quiz is uh sorry not please but our first questions are done and now we are going to proceed don't close main team don't close 90 because we will do a quiz a competition and then so keep menti open you will need it sometime later and let's go to the next slides uh so this one we will do a little bit later and we start with the first topic definitions and objectives of no signal what is it how it works why do we need that and so on so first i see we have a lot of students and we have a lot of people with different background and different understanding of of a practical field in the software development what is the database by itself database is a software to save things and retrieve them later with queries usually with queries but usually but not necessarily and databases is a very important thing take any project uh you have been using i don't know uh website of your university facebook whatever you're using instagram you are watching netflix you are using uber you are using mostly probably some application to order pizza all of them literally all of them are using databases and some of them are using many different databases at once good so that's all our workshop is over we are going to see you we will be happy to see you next week no of course that's not all we are just starting so thinking of a database we have to consider multiple things and multiple layers what make this database usually we can split every database in three or better to say four layers so only three layers are shown on this slide why i'm talking about four you see the trick is every database also has its clients clients are usually the part what is integrated into your application and then you use it to communicate with the database so we have external clients connecting to an interface of a database so what is an interface of a database format language transport those are tools to help you to communicate with a database store information and then retrieve it so transport is usually some network connection language when we speak about relational databases it's mostly probably going to be sql standard query language and format well it very depends on the database so second layer or in a execution layer consisting of parser analyzer and dispatcher those are the tools what analyzing your queries what parse your queries analyze your queries and execute them so that's why it's called execution layers it's something uh what's uh brings what to execute operations right and storage finally is the place where we store datum so there are some indexing tools and there is a disk usually it's a disk it can be also in memory because sometimes you may want to use in memory databases or engines to store your data now there is an uh interesting point uh we for many many many years we were using relational and only relational databases literally for dozens of years for dozens literally people were using mostly relational databases and it always was completely enough so relational databases i won't introduce them because we expect you to have this basic understanding of what's that but those usually are databases using databases using standard query language and they are relational so they have foreign keys you can use joins and so on and so forth and now there is a tree people use it to think of there is a very relational database so we have mysql sqlite postgres oracle ms server so databases like that they're very different architecturally they are very different from the operations point of view but as a developer as someone who just writes sql queries i can save but from the developers point of view they look mostly the same why because they share the same idea relational database management systems and they use the same language like a little bit of dialects of the same language but the if you know like my sequel sql you are going to be able to understand postgre sql um immediately there will be some minor deviations because of the same standard they extend let's say a little bit and then we start to speak about nosql and data and people think okay there are sql databases they are all the same they're not the same but from a developer's point of view they look the same and there are some others no sql databases and they are all the same and here comes a huge mistake because they are different too to each other and that's very important points there is basically no think like no sequel no sequel doesn't exist workshop is over goodbye not again uh no or there is a whole family of workshops yeah yeah so there are many very different databases and groups of databases there are many different time series databases there are multiple graph databases there are multiple document databases and so on and so forth there are many there are a lot of databases in each of each categories and there are even some more categories we don't discuss today because we have only two hours so and here comes that rig on the left side we have sql databases relational databases on the right side we have no sql database and they are different some of them schema less some of them schema full some of them are designed to support only time serious data so they are kind of good very good storage to store evans would always have some timestamp in that like logs or like your internet of things reports anything what has time series some of them are very good for handling documents like what was mentioned already a couple of times today and so on and so forth for so those are different so i bet now you are able to answer a question is no sql schema-less or schema full i hope good so and why it happened why for many many dozens of years sql databases were enough and now finally we have hundreds of different databases of a very different types there are two main stories sql is a one type of the database which is good in a little bit of everything what do i mean by a little bit of everything there are two sides of one line online transaction processing online analytical processing like you know you have one dollar and you can spend it on your database and you can spend uh some part of it or all of it for it to be very fast and you can spend some part of it for to be very smart but you cannot have more you have only one dollar and those traditional relational databases are a little bit of everything it means what we put like 50 cents into speed 50 cents into smartness and they are as a result multi-purpose or general purpose database what does that mean we are able to handle otp they handle they are able to handle all up workloads but wait alex what do you mean oltp and what do you mean all up okay so answer is simple the trick is database cannot be good in everything otp site means database has to be very very quick it means you need answers now right now if your database is slow your application is slow your customers unhappy they go to your competitor you don't want it you need to have a fast database right but um also typical for otp more or less simple queries because you cannot have dozens and dozens of joins if you want to have your answers quick joins uh not very you cannot run them in parallel joints are slow on big data joints extremely slow and you cannot afford complex queries so we have some limitations here and second part where is when you store retrieve data they don't change often of course business changes your workloads changes you have you introduce new features you have new queries but it happen over months over years sometimes over weeks it doesn't happen every five minutes so oltp is about being fast online transaction processing then on the right side we have all up online analytical processing and it's about being smart typical for all up complex queries then you are going to retrieve data over years uh depending on your customer i don't know whatever um preferences depending on the any operations he or she did last year but for some specific month or not that month and bought something from the sports uh department of your e-commerce store for example and so on so queries are complex but on the good side answers can wait usually people who work with all upside of things those are analytics of your companies and they're getting paid for their job they're not customers but employees as long as they are getting money they will still stick to you and they are ready to wait for your database to return the answer so on a lab site you usually usually can wait but one complication queries tend to change you are very often tend to change ad hoc queries so um it means what you can run something completely opposite to a previous one never even expected after a few few minutes so queries tend to change over time traditional databases are a little bit of everything 50 50 but for different solutions sometimes you need your database to be extremely fast and you invent databases like cassandra or dynamodb to be on oltp side of things they're not really good under alap workloads they're actually very bad at them but then you can get your answers and creatively quickly and there are some more databases what are good for olaf workloads and they may be not so fast but they are able to answer your questions that was the first reason why we introduced more databases than just traditional relational databases because this uh one size fits all was not any more of a case don't forget uh some years ago internet was very slow and it doesn't matter if your database is slow fast still uh clients network connection going to be not higher than 56k um kilobits per second now it's not the thing anymore and that's why we are introducing more different databases to be more performant for example second one second idea is about the limitations for example relational databases always expect you to have schema always but maybe you don't really know what are you going to store then you it's hard to use relational databases really so limitations by purpose they're too multi-purpose to be fast and those um schema full always even if you don't need that but maybe you will be good with documents or maybe you're just going to store simple k value pairs then you don't need those and you don't need uh of course foreign keys and relations and joins for time series databases so that's very important story and that's very important to understand purposes and performance and ability to scale and handle the big data that's what matter in the modern world so relational databases i as i said were in the middle of everything bound to input output capacity storage well somewhere in the middle for output ability to handle a lot of transactions not really cpu bound ability to execute a lot of computational operations not really and streaming with a lot of operations also from the evan streaming point of view we have a dedicated workshop of that by the way for event streaming actually even not a workshop but a full series of workshops um they are in the middle of the thing and they are good as long as they fit your use case uh but the trick is at some point um you need more and first of all i want to mention capacity so storage the space amount of the data you can store in all relational databases or old relational databases mysql postgre oracle and so on the originally developed as a single host database running on some kind of a mainframe on a huge server but you know even hugest upper servers still has some limits and then you scale more and more it's getting expensive very soon and still there is some limits relational databases are nation naturally relation naturally single host and they have scalable scaling limits so they don't fit in the scaling story and well how it goes with the not only sql databases and yes by the way uh best um best explanation for the abbreviation is not no sql but not only sql because currently some of them it's you see borders um a little bit not so strict now so one of the best things what no sql databases may offer to you is a better scalability so are they better to handle higher volume and amount of digital data in the world grows tremendously basically doubles every two years we are going to have over 200 zettabytes of data in a couple of years already and from the volume we need um we have to be able to store more data so it goes to be able to scale out to store more data and then velocity so for output its ability to execute more operations per second than best of the relational databases can do by the price of course it's all doesn't come it's not because relational databases are bad they are good when you use them properly in their own use case so velocity for output no sql databases can do more but by the price of missing joys of missing relations for example and finally the last feature of a not only sql databases you have to know is variety ability to work with different formats we still can have tables we can have key values we can have documents flexible documents and so on and so forth so the main idea is 3v volume velocity variety there are the cores of nosql databases and there are multiple important things for us to consider one of the biggest for us and one of the most important ideas you need to know is known as cap theorem um suggested by eric brewer many years ago the cep theorem is about distributed systems and that's very important to understand the story of relational databases starts with a single server most of the modern nosql databases are distributed so we are expected to be executed on the multiple servers and that changes a lot so what exactly take a look cp theorem what it says it says whatever distributed system has three properties three features consistency availability and partition tolerance what does that mean very easy consistency means what you always get most up-to-date answer imagine i store a value in the database and set it one to value one when i update it uh to value two and finally i update it into a value three and then i'm getting some more when i'm getting this value from the database which value i'm going to get hopefully value number three and if i always get a value num value frame it means what database is consistent but if i get value 2 or maybe even value 1 that means what database is not consistent value was changed but i still get the outdated information let me call it consistency availability is quite easy availability means what i get answer at all so if my day if i add database for something but database never answers it means what database is not available at the moment and then finally partition tolerance don't forget we speak about distributed solutions it means what the your database is launched multiple times on different servers and uh there is a network connection between them and partition tolerance is the ability of a system to survive network partitioning what is network partitioning network partitioning is then there is a missing connection between some or a part of my server nodes database nodes to others so network between my database servers are splitted they cannot reach each other anymore it's called network partitioning and partition tolerance is the ability of a system to survive it so why i'm talking about that what's the essence of cep theorem it means what under bad circumstances in case of any issues in case of any problems you can have only two of the capabilities at once not free so when rainbow and sun is shining and birds are singing and everything is fine your database is consistent available and partition tolerance but when something goes wrong power outage storm earthquake whatever else happening you have to decide where you're gonna be and there are only three options consistent and partition tolerant available and partition tolerant available and consistent boom boom boom and you can pick only one of them now there is no chance we can draw partition tolerance network partition partitioning may happen in any moment of a time if our database cannot survive it we don't need it so for all of the databases we always decide between ca and cp and that goes to every distributed system and that's very important to understand it's actually not even about the database that's about every application maybe you are being developed if you are developing a distributed system you need to know this theorem very well otherwise you will inevitably fail so now uh getting to the moment of how many of nosql databases you see that on the screen there are many of them and those are very different some of them are even more or less relational and you can have joints in relations but some more over that and some of them are more all up like hp vertica for example and some of them are designed to be very fast but maybe not so but not support things like relations joints and so on like cassandra or big table okay so main types of uh nosql uh those are i would say four so don't forget there are like eight of different types today we cover four because we have only two hours column oriented tabular document key value and graph so for today as a practical part for the practical parts we will use astra db one of the most openly asked questions hey i want to do exercises but i have no time today how can i do that our answer is you can do it today tomorrow this weekend next weekend next month astrodb stays available and you have 25 dollars per month credit so you can do it today or next year doesn't matter to us you can you have to just register you get your 25 per month credit and you can use it without any problems now why do we use astrodb there are hundreds of databases they all are different types and some of them even support multiple types and that's why we picked astrodybin you can have multiple types to access to data so document key value and cassandra base it's so column oriented tabular working just so just running one instance of astrodb you can you kind of have multiple kinds of different databases so that's very good place for us to start it will consist of multiple part so first as a storage uh we will use aws microsoft azure or google cloud not only storage versa but of course database servers but astra is serverless so it's my headache not yours i hope you are thankful so and the base and the as the foundation of this system is other cloud providers are aws azure and google cloud then the second or the first floor ground floor of this system is apache cassandra apache cassandra is one of the best nosql databases for the high load fast operations otp kind of workout by the way notice now you know what the oltp means isn't that amazing and then as apache cassandra is supports on the sequel we have a special thing called stargate overvet what is the stargate stargate is a data gateway it has as a first floor glow on ground floor cassandra but when you hack you can access data in cassandra using different cool tools using different apis rest api no questions document api a way to go graphql you are welcome so single database but many ways to communicate and many ways to use this data that's why we pick it for the best of the best nosql solution serverless solutions at the moment and working with a database we will use today's swagger ui graphql playground and some more tools you will see good so we i want to go quickly via the first databases we have a lot of topics to cover today so let's go our first guest one of the best of the nosql databases is apache cassandra if you remember oltp to a lab line cassandra is strong on oltp databases it means it designed to work with the data of any sites biggest companies like biggest cassandra users we know are apple and huawei and they use they store in cassandra hundreds petabytes of data and now think that's not about videos or not about pictures not about music because for this kind of a binary data you better not use a database but from object storage so literally hundreds of petabytes of digital information perfectly handled by this database so that's an amazing one and still get the answer between milliseconds sometimes in single digit milliseconds so it's very fast and very scalable on any size of data what are the main ideas from the modal point of view it stores tables it stores tables normal tables like sql tables so it's schema full and still perfectly nosql because it's not schema what's the sense of the nosql and it distributes data over multiple servers because it's a distributed database and data is stored on disk like a normal database not in memory now very important thing as cassandra is used to store petabytes of data terabytes of data there is not a single server to store so much information using local disks just local disk of such sites don't exist and then we have to spread data over multiple servers and then to ask for this data if you have hundreds of servers and a lot a lot of data when you need to know which data you are going to retrieve so we always request with a partition key that's one of the solid limitations but you know what if you want to dispatch petabytes and still able uh transfer within millisecond yoon going to have some limitations of course where the price to pay uh then ability to use secondary indices is possible but there are also some limitations and there is no joins so one query may access one and only one table how it works and there are multiple databases like that so we will discuss cassandra is a little bit more details but there are more solutions so we can discuss cassandra google cloud bigtable amazon key spaces they claim it to be cassandra like it's not cassandra-like but okay for now and then apache each by hbase there are maybe some more but we will go into cassandra specific there is a question from ashutosh yadav will be getting resources for basics because i'm a front-end developer and this is like a bouncer for me so man first of all i understand your feeling i know how it feels when you have no background with a database and we throw you into this workshop it's not going to be easy so now try to get as much you as you can get i bet there are some more people feeling exactly like you right now this workshop will be recorded so you can rewatch it but of course it's better to start with the basics fundamentals of a database in general and then proceed to nosql but don't quit you can make it and we are there to answer questions i see there are stefano latini david gellardy and cedric lewin when i've seen to answering your questions so thank you all guys keep asking okay so very very quickly going through cassandra it's a distributed decentralized database and usually we speak about cassandra clusters because it makes no sense to run cassandra on a single node you won't get all the benefits of it group of cassandra servers group of cassandra nodes build a data center or a ring and multiple data centers together build a cluster you can have cluster of a single data center now data is distributed take a look on the right side on they have a table so yes cassandra has tables we discussed it of a country city and population now we have multiple countries we have multiple cities and we have many different values for population and we are going to distribute this table how do we do it we don't just throw data randomly to different servers it makes no sense we use so-called partitions and to spread data we use a partition key now take a look when i distribute this data it will be grouped based on a country why because country is designated partition key of course every server may support more than one partition eur usually there are billions of partitions per server that's perfectly fine so here we have tables handling partitions of assem and here we have multiple partitions per database so data is distributed it means if we have to store more data we had 100 terabytes now we are going to have 200 terabytes uh scaling is very easy just add more servers into the cluster and cassandra will take care of it and reshuffle data to a multiple servers but you know what that's not enough basically um if you use cassandra like this and one server goes down and that's just a question of time you know network is lagging power is lagging whatever happens boom you cannot the then this part of the data will be not available and that's bad and your clients will be unhappy when will go to your competitor and so on and so forth how do we solve that we replicate our data what is replication it means what's the same part of a data every row or better to say partition because cassandra parades partitions will be stored on multiple servers so replication factor has a replication factor means how many replicas or copies of our data we are going to have on uh in the cluster replication factor 1 means what every partition is stored on a single node and that's how it looks but so you see it's unreliable when you have 100 servers it's just a question of time when one of them will be not available or maybe two or maybe more so obviously you can go with replication factor two and it means what every partition is stored onto different servers but the recommended replication factor is free recommended application factor is free and that means what every partition is replicated to three different servers do you remember me talking about cap theorem exactly that story now we are going to be highly available because we have our data storage on three different servers but under some circumstances one of those servers may have been not really fully updated because it was out or because of network lag or anything cassandra of course has multiple layers of protection for inconsistency how works spreading of the data across the server then you are trying to update your table like write something for example add information for new york and los angeles you are going uh to put this data into your database into your cluster and in this case these uh data this data is not stored on the server what was contacted and it's not a problem at all it could have been problem if you are trying to write data into a secondary node on mysql or  you will get an exception it's not possible cassandra is not like that because cassandra is decentralized and every server is able to react on any query is it write or read doesn't matter so this node now call it we have a query and this node will be the query coordinator query coordinator calculates those sir which servers are responsible for this piece of data and sends this data to all proper servers and we are good and if anything at the right moment happens but one of the replica nodes not able to catch up not able to get this information then the query coordinator will store so-called hinted handoff and dispatch these data to the failed node as soon as it recovers this mechanism is known as hinted handoff and that's the first layer of defense from inconsistency in cassandra but very much more and to finish this story may one of the best features of cassandra what people really like if a traditional relational databases like for example uh mysql let's say you want to have multiple data centers over the world and you want to have your data stored in the united states in europe and in asia you're going to be deep deep deep deep deep in troubles first of all because it's just not a simple story as someone who did that i can tell you and second of all it's a double heart if you want to have multiple active data centers so normally if you really if you're working with a relational database you have to you need to have designated servers this server is going to be my primary server or write server or master server like we used to call them and those all others will be red only or slave servers and the same with data centers you can make it working when you have one active data center and one passive data center so uh with cassandra is not like that because cassandra is decentralized always active and every data center in this cluster and that's a single cluster is going to be active active active active always um and you can have it easily running all across the world you are going by uber to the airport you are taking uber your data in europe for example your data handled by apache cassandra or better to stay as a datastax enterprise which is the same but a little bit better let's say and store it in the european data center while you're applying data distributed to other data centers then in california you're getting uber to get to your um destination and again it's going to be the same cassandra cluster but another data center because uber has very strict requirements and slas on how fast your data will be delivered to you and that's how it works now you know and the same goes to hybrid cloud and multi-cloud solutions cassandra's platform agnostic so you can run it on any cloud or any uh or on premise or in microsoft azure google cloud aws simultaneously good so um working with the use cases you always need to understand when to use to hammer is a great tool range is a great tool but when you are going to knock things with your wrench that's not going to work the best way you need hammer for that and it will be hard to assemble i don't know an engine with the help of a hammer uh well i can do it but i'm russian so if you want to assemble an engine with a hammer you will need some help better just use french okay now so scalability everything what goes to high for output or high volume or both heavy writes and heavy reads that's all goes to cassandra very well availability formation critical no data loss and always on you've seen you may have multiple data centers over the world and that's quite easy to organize not maybe cheap because you may need multiple data centers on premises with cloud is going to be a little bit easier but that's doable then distributed for global presence multiple data centers over the world or wherever cloud mobility maybe you want to be able to move your data from one region to another it happens or get your data away from some regions with gdpr for example and modern cloud applications whatever relates to kubernetes whatever goes to clouds very fast apis multi-cloud hybrid cloud and so on that's all a very good story so now let's uh push some buttons we are going to go to uh to get your astra instance um using this address data stacks dot io dash astra dash uh slash sorry slash astra dash dev hacks and you will grab your database instance like i will do and this is a repository we will use to work with the data and password practical steps now what exactly do you do right now there are two options first you do all the steps right now second option you watch me doing that and then you do the same steps after the workshop whatever is better that's for you to decide but do the steps without them you won't get your participation page and not be able to brag like you will tell your friends or colleagues hey i visited such an amazing webinar and how you're going to prove that you don't have a page you cannot prove that no one will believe you so do the practice steps you will get the page and you will be able to prove you was here and that's amazing thank you good so i'm going to go to astra and get my instance how do you do that you follow this link d t s x dot i o slash astra okay big a and i made a mistake there is a typo boom astra dash def hex i don't really know if uppercase is important in this story but let's take a look it works for me hopefully it works for you as well of course i already have my astron so i will just jump in i'm using my private account why because data stock sponsors 25 dollars to every monthly to every astro user for you too and when you will create an account you will see this pay as you go as long as you don't reach your production limits if as long as you don't reach millions and millions of queries per month you don't pay i haven't even specified my payment method because i'm not going i'm just using it for free good and second one we will need is github.com datasteps workshop introduction to no sql so let's go git oops button too much github.com data stacks steps flash workshop introduction to no sql i will make it a little bit bigger so our first exercise our first practice step is to create astra database instance and by the way let me send you a link it's it has been sent already by my colleagues and it's available in the event description but i will do it and actually i will do it three times so you don't miss that no way first exercise is to create astra database instance astra is the simplest way to run cassandra cassandra with zero operations at all it's our headache and we create all the and we execute all the required operations for hume now and oh sorry i will make a step to the side manish wants to see how internals of cassandra work man i just love this question it's incredible cassandra is so great we have a dedicated workshop introduction to cassandra but you want to get deeper when we have a full course on apache cassandra at the academy.datastax.com and it's free i will say word about that in the end so uh we going to uh create astrodb first you have to register using the link we send in the chat astra dash dev hex please using this particular link and you have to sign in into astrodb what i did we have to create pay as you go plan you don't pay if you are not reaching production like workloads on web for the nose for that now when you are creating a database you have to remember something for the database name please use nosql database for the keyspace name please use nosql one you can try to change those but then next practical steps in this lab are going to be harder for you when uh next thing for provider in region i will better show you this one that is right so no sqldb no simple one i'm going to create so you will see what i will be doing i will be doing so i push the create database button i already have some but nothing never hurts to have one more and my database is going to be no sql so sorry it should be nosql db no simple underscore db that's better and key space name is going to be no sql one is that right that is right speed now i have to choose a provider and region there are three providers google cloud amazon web services and microsoft azure and you can pick whatever you like the most i am a certifier i am a certified google cloud architect so i will choose google cloud just because of this reason feel free to pick asia or aws that's completely fine to me now area for area i will choose europe and for region i will choose belgium just because it's the closest one to me so where um latency will be the smallest one and then i push gray database it may take some time because it's now in pending state and the list of my databases it's the last one nosql database it's in pending state but well it takes some time to launch a new instance for you we can walk through the next steps in a while for the table or databases in a tabular database we store tables astrodb services based on apache cassandra and now we will work apache cassandra natively using cql cassandra querial language there is a very important point when you first see sql and sql together you think like they look so similar sql is the same like sql and i know it's a sql already so i will be good using cassandra no big mistake big mistake uh sql indeed designed to look very similar to sql so it will be easier to learn but it's different because database is different so if you're going to use cassandra better attend our intro to cassandra workshop or full course at the academy.datastax.com really makes sense so to work with our database we have to connect to that and we will be able to start using that how do we do that first okay this database is um pending so i will switch to another database just because it's active and but it will look the same think what me what i need right now call it a sql console sql console is obviously the console to use sql very easy and the very important thing in cassandra are key spaces so i'm going to describe uh for that i'm going to say describe or a better type of fool you can type desk it will work too e spaces i have some key spaces here and most of them are system key spaces so that's very clear data key space is what cassandra needs to handle your thing but i can also use them key space what we created during the class so i see no sql database is it active okay status active i will switch to nosql db because it will has the key space we need to proceed with this work again i'm switch it to no sqldb describe key spaces oops is a says it's always like that when you are typing things when someone watches on you you always make typo alone i usually don't do them so we have this nosql one that's the key space we have created in the beginning now i say use no sql1 and now notice i'm using a tab to use this autocomplete feature okay now i'm in this key space and i can say describe tables but you know what it's empty so what do we do next and the part of this exercise we described key spaces now we can create table we are going to use create table if not exist videos video id email title upload urls text frames and so on so you see sql looks very similar to sql i create able to store my data there so i'm going to paste this data on and execute that and my table exists if i ask now to describe tables oops describe tables i have my table videos and i can say describe table videos and get the description of my table and there is much more information when i give because well cassandra uses some reasonable defaults but there is a lot of things i can change okay so what goes next i now want to work with the data so i'm going to insert some entries on the first table i will just copy paste that and those might look quite familiar to you insert into values same like in sql very similar here as well so okay now i'm going to read this data select all from videos and i'm getting my rows now you won now you know what i just did a huge mistake what is a huge mistake working with cassandra you always have to remember what you may be working with the data of a huge size cassandra was originally developed in facebook to handle facebook size project problems and never do like that never use asterisk in your queries because it could be a very very very bad idea so i can do something different i can for example do like that video id url and that's already much better you never know how much data you are going to have here um yeah and uh shashank parihar is very right we don't specify partition key in this query and that's bad but i'm just showing how do you work with cql but a good point shashank you are right so when we can read um all the data using some particular id okay so that's quite familiar that's exactly like you would work with sql now what's the difference i will create a new table users by city now we are going to very interesting point you need to understand i'm creating the stable if not exist user by city and it's going to have city first name last name email and primary key will be city last name email i will explain it in a moment now please ignore clustering order by it's just not important for us right now okay table is ready i will need some data to show what i want to show i've inserted some users good so we can take a look at them following our previous job select all from users by city and we have some users cedric jackets and gelardi cedric lundvan the yellow jackets david gilardi very well so now i'm going to do a simple thing select all from users by city that city equals paris focus it's very important step when i query data the city is paris i get my data right now take a look at the trick i will select all from users by city where last name last aim is gilardi hi david i know you are watching us no data what the hell what happened why there is no typo if you mean that last name is last name and gelardi as a gelardi why data is not shown let's take a look a raw invalid request error from server code2200 invalid query cannot execute with query as it might involve data filtering and this may have in predictable performance if you want to execute with query despite the performance use allow filtering first do not use a low filtering i mean yes if i add that it will work of course i'm copy pasting a low filtering now data is returned but what really happened here take a look don't forget cassandra and many others databases it's basically the same limitation in our distributed databases it's not only for cassandra in dynamo you would have the same is the trick is your data is spread across multiple servers sometimes across a lot of servers and the partition key so the value based on which we distribute data is the city you see here uh city in the sql syntax key in this parenthesis means it's going to be our partition key partition key is something what defines data distribution over cluster yeah i believe i've just answered a question therefore we spread our data by cts on multiple servers when i do a request specifying city then a cluster event driver so sqlsh we are using right now just knows which particular server to ask and then that's easy i go directly to the server i ask for data i get data i get back but this request without a city just by last name emits a partition key as a result a cassandra driver doesn't know which particular server to ask as long as you have one two three it can go and ask oh but it's going to be not really performant and efficient and now take a look that's very that's the essence of this story doing your queries without specifying your partition key is like order pizza without specifying your full address like you give just a city and just a street name but you don't give your house number or your apartment number i don't know about you guys but when i order pizza i always specify the full address if i don't do that then delivery boy will have to ring every bell on my street and ask everyone hey sir have you ordered pizza hmm have you ordered pizza well my street is quite small so it will take maybe additionally half an hour and i will get a cold pizza i don't like that so you better specify the full address right you don't have to do it in a traditional relational databases because they are not ready to work with the data of such scale try to put multiple petabytes in your my sequel i will be very curious to see that working cassandra's amber is able to handle that but now you need to understand the partitioning very well so how do i then query data without allow filtering if i don't want to force my database to do stupid things how do i query data very easy i always have to add a partition key so i specify there ct equals something i need to know in advance and last name equals gelardi and sequoia city for gerlar gelardi is orlando and now everything is fine okay i have a low filtering enabled yeah now without allow filtering i still get david information so think of partitions partitions are essential that's very important and uh there is a nice point from vibe half like uh last name is a partition key so uh it's it's a long story data modeling we have a dedicated workshop on only data modeling for apache cassandra and we have again dedicated data modeling course at the academy also free also quite interesting thing to learn so this way you will understand how do you um structure your data working with nosql uh and again that's about cassandra but it's not cassandra specific because it's the same goes to other distributed databases like big table from google like dynamodb from aws and so on so this idea is always the same you partition your data you need to know a partition key to be efficient cool so i believe we are done and those examples a bit more detailed we enable tracing so you can see how exactly this statement works but we won't do it right now because we still have to do some more things so uh stefano how it goes with the questions i will have any important questions to answer right now it's all been handled by me and david actually david and i are having a sort of competition who is faster in history and we are head to head but yeah there have been a few questions uh to to clarify what is the role of the partition key in designing a table and in storing the data and retrieving them and yeah that was more or less the most relevant discussion that was going on good everyone thank you for asking the questions you are the best yeah good so well when we are going to the next part and next part is the document database what are the data what are the document databases and when do we need them so uh you have seen what cassandra is schema full and there are tables there are streak table definitions and so on and so forth uh in some situations you are in the heart you are in the hard situation because you don't know what exactly you are going to store because your different documents you are going to store different information you are going to store will have different schema different fields and you have no idea you cannot predict them in advance and yes i mean databases like mongodb which is mostly probably the most famous database for nosql out of nosql databases but there are also many others like couchbase kinda elastic which is a bit different and so on so okay what are the main features of a documentary database documents are structured data but with no schema now there is a trick do you want to know a little bit more than others uh you are in this workshop that means for me yes now i will tell you um pink what most of developers don't know or at least a lot of developers don't know databases like so in particular are not schema-less seriously there is a schema but it's a polymorphic schema so proper name for is a polymorphic schema but not schema-less because schema exists it's just not available to you as a user but it exists it store it on the disk and schema is there it just will be polymorphic so different per per document you store but we can say it's schema full polymorphic schema full quite funny yes you use it to think what  is schema-less it's not exactly this way but out of the topic today so documents are structured but we have no predicted schema documentary and databases can support multiple formats but the traditional one most widely used is json so usually we store databases as jsons and a group of documents of same nature are stored together as collections so requesting the data we usually request by key by the id of the collection and the id of your document and we can request an over fields or paths in the document typical use cases mainly reads less rights document storage with a structure but no predefined schema often use it easier for front-end because of the json which is traditional for transferring data so things like that take a look things always come with some costs and if anyone tells you this database is the best database point a point don't listen to him and just don't trust him there is no thing like a best database but what's the correct phrase best database for something that's a valid phrase because well yes there are some use cases this database better than other for example mongom is very good uh storing structural data with no predefined schema great perfect and cassandra can do that well can with a stargate but by default not does that mean what  is better than cassandra it depends on your use case for example  is not decentralized has primary server primary replicas primary server secondary servers secondary us read only you cannot write to secondary and yes you can scale secondary but you cannot really scale primary you are really limited on that so if your operations include a lot of reads but small amount of rights may work for you you are going to write a lot and read a lot  cannot scale as you need there is always price to pay considerations to consider and limitations to know so think of limitations like that better than talking about documentary and databases i want to proceed to the next exercise we are going to do today for document oriented databases we want to install because we already have astra and astrum is up a cassandra as a service which has stargate enabled i told you to you already what is a target stargate is a data gateway which helps you to have multiple apis over cassandra and one of them is document exactly like for example or some other databases so let's take a look at the third exercise document databases so first of all uh okay this part i will skip to you and we will proceed exactly to api part first thing i will need is i will have to create an application token and you will have to do the same and that's how we do that it's expanded into the documentation so you have it's all available to do on your own but i'm going to current organization and i'm going to organization settings in the organization taking is settings i have token management and i have application tokens i select a role and in my case i will simply use database administrator i will generate token now tokens are secret don't show your tokens to anyone don't paste you don't copy don't make screenshots with your tokens as a part of your homework that's a secret information now i'm showing that openly just because i'm going anyway to delete this talk token immediately after the workshop but in general consider token to be like a password so that's the token i need it starts with astra cs double point and then some long long line of everything good i have token now i'm going to get to my database good my database is nosql database go to connect tab we were in sql console now we go to connect and we're going to document api which explains how do we connect and work using documents first you have to create an application token is discussed and then how you work it with command line interface but what i need is a little bit more on the bottom is swagger ui so every one of you will have different uh url here for uh to launch swagger and most of you may answer now what is swagger idea is very simple swagger is the tool to execute api calls and you can use swagger to connect to many different applications or systems or databases those provide api a stargate provide document api to cassandra we will use with document api using swagger you can use postman it also will work but our api is counted on them is prepared to work with swagger but postpone postmode will work too but you will just have to copy paste all the things so there are multiple operations what you can do what we are going to do as a part of that it's all explained in the part frame and my first one will be create a new empty collection don't forget documents are part of the collections and to store document i have to create a collection first i've i've seen some of you have experience with mulligan mostly probably so now you see the idea is exactly the same first i have to create an empty collection in the namespace how do i do that i go to swagger ui i find the documents part it has to be documents and now oh i have to make it a little bit bigger i think now it's better i have to find create a collection that's my part post blah blah blah blah blah blah blah create an empty empty collection in the namespace so i'm going to create this one things we will need first to use api we will need token i have to push try it out button swagger is used for documentation but you can also use it to execute queries and i put my token here so token return it from the authorization endpoint x cassandra token that's what i create just now namespace id is the namespace of keyspace we created in the beginning that's going to be no sql1 and now body object.json with the name of a collection may be empty so do i have to create okay i have to create a name and collection as a part of this exercise and okay that is good i will create this collection and i will call this collection videos and now i push the button execute it's a huge button boom so where is my answer collection videos already exist oh okay make sense yes i will just call it videos one okay we are good i hope some of you know http transfer codes already if you don't code 201 makes successfully created and indeed we can see what 201 is created in the response examples so my collection has been created very well i will copy paste my token i will need it for my next request and now i can list collections in namespace so i'm going here i'm i'm go pushing try it out button paste my token i have to specify a namespace id it's nosql1 if you are following the instructions and i'm going to execute this one and while it does token should contain three parts but only provided sorry what was wrong with okay i will put paste it again i think i just mixed something token management okay i cannot copy paste it because it was already i will have to generate a new one okay it doesn't matter one more one less i have to wipe them all anyway so i'm getting to swagger ui and put it here hopefully this time it's full namespace will be no sql one execute yeah now it's better so now you see i have some collections already the videos that's why it wasn't created users by ctm videos one and that's my collection videos one i've just created very well so and final thing i want to do with the documents here is i'm going to create a new document i already have my collection and i want to create new one so first i will close this thing and i have to find yeah create a new document that's the thing i need click on that try it out first i specify cassandra token next i specify namespace id no sql1 now i have to specify collection id video it was videos one right i hope so and json document so body is going to be the exact document i'm going to store so in this case i will simply copy paste this example so video id email title upload url frames text formats and so on i put it to swagger ui i put it to the body and that's it why schema-less because i can easily add something here so you see we never define a schema for that and that's very important so this one has email title upload url frames text formats and i can right here add something i don't know whatever it was topic because it's a video so topic video may have some topic and topic will be a databases right so now i can push the button execute and see my answer and response code is 201 and document id is specified so 201 successfully created my document is present obviously now i can use this document id to retrieve data from the database um we are i want to be on schedule so we will have to move on but those steps you will have to do on your own make screenshots of them and by paste it to your homework submission so you will get your page well then so let's move on to the next slide i think we will need k value databases now so key value databases do i have a water i forgot to get some water what are they by the way are there any questions we have to discuss no it's all good it's all clear yep yep exactly so very well well then here william from all of the databases key value databases are simplest from the data structure point of view because you have the key so id you have a value string or integer and that's it so this idea is uh very simple and this simplicity brings you great power uh power is like as the tabular databases key value databases are very scalable and therefore is it ready to handle really a lot of information being spread all across the world like dynamodb for example so what are the things about the key values we have to discuss first of all key value is like a distributed hash table or a hash map one key one value very simple keys hashed into buckets those basically the same as partitions in cassandra it's uh similar to tabular but with a single value you kinda can consider it like a very simplified from a data structure cassandra we can say typical operations are very simple create read update delete value can be a single value can be a list but of the same type very often to use as a cache or a distributed cache use it to store user sessions use it to cache data use it to use it for many different things what includes just just to be able to retrieve data extremely quickly and you obviously obviously need to know a key in order to be able to retrieve some data so those are great databases and very oftenly used most of the most known is radius so this one is the most known key value database dynamic db from amazon web services is also quite known and cassandra can also work this way basically if you use one single volume yes uh radius is uh very often used to store user sessions absolutely you see uh that's a good point by the way so let me explain something uh saurabh tiaghi i hope i pronounce your name right sorry if i don't user sessions really what's the story working with a single instance application one instance of your application launched on a single server you very often store user sessions in files or in memory depending on what's your situation how much of a persistence you want to have and it all goes great as long as you have 10 customers but when you have uh 10 hundred thousand but when you have 100 100 000 when you have one millions of customers and so on and so forth your poor application at some point start to work very slow or doesn't work at all then you have to scale up you buy a bigger server and migrate your application to this newer bigger server right that's called uh vertical scaling so you replace old ones smaller with one bigger and vertical scaling is a great one but it has some downsides it's getting very expensive very soon and there are still single point of failure because if server is down your application is not available so it's much better than you have when you can run second instance or your application on another server maybe even in another region it's great but then you run into troubles if your customer makes a query and query goes to makes a request and your request goes to a first instance of your application user session will be stored on this server and then your customer executes a query to s again and it's being routed to a second server second server doesn't have this user session and it asks like who are you what are you doing here i don't know you please login you save a problem and as a result um you have two options first you're gonna need actually um sticky session slot balancer in front of your servers so this one will remember which user works with each server it's a solution but maybe not the best because as soon as first server will be down which will happen at some moment of time your sessions will be lost and to um evade um easy to dodge this situation you can use radius or memcached or whatever cassandra but i would avoid this with cassandra but yeah but something like radius works for best to store user sessions exactly and it's a great tool so your servers identifying a user will get user session not from file or from local memory but from radius radius is lightning fast especially in in memory mode when it's not persisting data on disk and only working in memory it's extremely fast only downside if it lost power when all data in memory will be lost of course but at least that's a price to pay for the performance so again that's not too much to discuss about a key value databases from the developer point of view so i will switch quickly to the key value databases practical steps and now we will use a very interesting thing mostly probably most of you don't know at all it's called uh graphql so working with data is you can you may use different apis and sorry there is an incredible question i know what mostly probably stefano and david are both typing questions but i will be the fastest and answer first it's about few steps above is cassandra has strong consistency like dynamodb sorry alex i already uh but please please go ahead because this is a very important point yes so first of all with dynamite beam it's more complicated second of all uh cassandra i mean many people call cassandra eventually consistent ap available and partition tolerant but not consistent but it's a mistake uh cassandra don't call please don't call cassandra eventually consistent it's a mistake a proper name for cassandra is configurably consistent because you can specify which particular level of consistency you require right now for this particular query okay so okay in this competition stefano was the first alex was the second and david didn't pinch sorry david next time next time yeah good yeah we love competitions so good uh i won't stop for their questions now uh graphql for this exercise we are going to use graphql it's a very powerful tool to work with different kinds of a datum and we will use graphql playground you will see how it works so first of all i won't need a swagger so i will close the swagger i will need my token still so copy and now i will go to astra connect so that sounds already familiar to you use my database nosql dbm connect and i will use graphql api and there is a graphql playground so um you know rest mostly probably rest as a way to communicate with data using http verbs put post delete as verbs to manipulate data you know what rest may be good but it's very simple graphql allows you to make much more complex operations with the data and well you will see it in a moment now very important as it stated in the documentation add your token from your application token to http header sessions on the bottom of graphql playground window please that matters if you don't do that that won't work that's my graphql schema and i hope you can see it yes there is a http headers in the bottom i open them and there is a x cassandra token populate me so i'm going to populate this one as it asks and put my token here so i have my token populated now i'm going to there are a few two tabs and you have to switch to a proper tab accordingly i work with graphql schema tab so this one operates with a schema and i'm going to request for key spaces different names get to getting their names and i have those key spaces some system and some what i've created name name system system schema no sql one and so on i cannot request without anything i just have always to have something in here so it will know what exactly i'm going to retrieve from the data now okay click here paste it in the browser now we are ready to go uh we are going to create a table so there are still tables but those tables are very simple key value key value so i'm going to copy paste this mutation and put it to a graphql schema tab let's take a look at that mutation mutation means what we are going to change something looks quite simple now mutation identifier kv particular mutation create table space name nosql1 tablespace name key value you can change it but then you have to change next queries accordingly now partition key so the keys we are going to use name will be key and type will be basic text and values we are going to work value you know what key value table with key value columns sounds too bad to me so i will call it i will call this table name sessions and first one will be user and second one will be session now i'm going to execute this one boom as we executed mutation we get data data is answer when what exactly happened kv notice kv kv kv is an identifier of vibration this mutation name it kv and as a result it's going to return me status of the mutation i've executed kv is true so success table has been created okay what comes next we can check the data in the sql console but it's not important right now now we want to populate the table now very important point notice what i work because it's an api it uses um these uh ue rights first step works with graphql schema and i've just created table now i want to work with the data i switch to graphql tab and it uses another path because i work with data and response undo not successful status code 401 because http header is not complete so i'm going to grab my token [Music] i'm going to grab my token put it here and http headers are complete now i can work with my data here so i will take pump good token is completed now i'm going to navigate to new key space nosql once take a look this uh one is going to work with a system key space but i will need no sql one yeah now it's fine response not successful received status quote if was i right what's going on okay that looks good to me let me check that oh okay that's a typo indeed no sql1 right good so there we type on now i'm going to get some data i'm going to insert some values there okay that's the query i'm going to execute what will be the type of a query you must know already in graphql you use mutation and mutation will be insert to kv insert 2k volume but we will use a proper table so insert key mutation value sequel one give me a moment insert k there you on type mutation so one key is going to be user right and name will be session yeah alex probably you have to change did you change the name the name of the table right yeah i changed the name of the table so probably you should change also yeah the initial part of the mutation the insert key value you are right thank you oh so it's going to be you you went the hard path yeah starting changing to have a little fun right yeah that makes sense yeah and you see suggestion works that's amazing yeah it's always a bit funny in graphql this syntax where you build new identifiers yeah good so i'm going to execute a volume [Music] session yeah so that's a good part of the graphql it's self documentable let's say and it highlights my mistakes session because it knows the schema of this table i'm going to execute that and yeah we got these so information is stored very well and so check the console it's not important we don't want to execute that okay so working with key values with graphql is a more advanced way and not always supported by all the databases let's say but the general idea for them is very simple you have key you can value you knowing this k you can retrieve this value or overwrite that if i'm going to change some data it will be completely fine i can now update the value for the session [Music] and now i have this data key to to be updated so it's very simple uh only one key the data will be overwritten if you use the same key there is no duplication there is no exception it's just considered as an update good so we have 10 minutes and i see what like most of you stayed with us till the end of this workshop and that's just incredible so following that i want to run the game i want to run the quiz and no actually you know what i will go briefly through graphql databases and then we will run the qs i want you to i want us to cover graph databases we will be a few minutes over time but i hope you are finding that so grab databases what are the story of a graph databases why do they need them [Music] that's a very interesting point take a look we use it to call relational databases relational right relational databases are relational yes or no yes there are relations but if we think of that rhythm we will find a little problem relations exist in relational databases but they are second class citizen seriously relation cannot have any properties relation is a very simple uh thing it can't has properties it always um it basically even has no names if you want to have many too many you may need some intermediate database intermediate table to keep this many-to-many relation and so on and so forth so relational databases are relational but not relational enough that's funny story uh so if we would create graph databases those times many many dozens years ago they would be called relational databases because here in graph databases relation is the first class citizen relation is uh has the same importance as entity um in relational databases so in relational we have entities and some secondary relations between them in graph databases relations are as important as entities what does that matter it matter it means what relations can has its own properties for example when it was created imagine you have um friends a table of uh your users you are developing a social network you are developing someone what will overcome and take down facebook please do that i don't like facebook i hope your social network application will take over facebook one day it would be great and um you are doing a friendship with so one cause one user adds another one to friends that's obviously going to be a relation between them in the database but tell me i think if you are going to set this friendship between two people you need you also what want to add a day when it happened and so you will congratulate them with their friendships uh in them relational databases you can do it without creating a new table uh which will put also relation direction and the time right not like that in a graph databases because every relation between two entities can have as much properties as you need in graph databases data is represented as a graph with vertices and edges they both are very important they both have all the features of properties search indexes and so on and so forth its dd graph databases are best for highly connected data sets and they are great to discover simple and complex relationships between objects for example when we speak of find all movies what my friends have watched already but i didn't or find all movies i like it and some others people like it and there is one movie or some movies i didn't i haven't seen at all the point is your for you and your friends might have different tastes of movies you prefer horrors all of your friends hate horrors for example and you want to find a new great horror people on netflix uh setting those ratings like like like like dislike there are a lot of people who set for likes to the same films you do you set for likes and dislikes to the same movies you said dislikes they could have been your friends but you live in the united states they live in i don't know china and well whatever country is and you will never meet them in real life you will ever ever never meet them in the internet or maybe on our workshop that would be great but they still have exactly the same taste of movies they like the same using graph databases we can execute queries like first find people those like the same movies as i do and then find out of the movies they like find the movies i haven't seen that is a powerful tool guys like that's a really powerful tool um so we can find data based on filters on attributes of both entities and their relations and entities may have different relations so one person may like another person and one person can dislike another place a person you don't have you don't need multiple tables for that but still one user user user one entity user uh but multiple different relations between them multiple different ages uh and vertices so uh use cases well there are many social networks sure customer 3660 sure internet of things analyzing the results i would say personalization absolutely recommendation absolutely use it in health care use it in path finding use it in security and especially fraud detection that's also very powerful tool for the frown detection to try to find like unusual usage of your mastercard or visa somewhere in unexpected place for example or in unexpected scenario and most known databases for graphql is amazon neptune on aws and now for j also data stocks enterprise has a graph capability so things like that i'm very sorry i have no time left to run a live debug for you uh for the graph databases but good thing you can do it on your own and research with great possibility great options of a graph database only thing you need is to have docker if you can install docker you can run our demo and that's indeed a great one so i do recommend you to do it even if you don't give a anything about our page still go take exactly the graph databases demo because it's the best one out of all um today's show and you will need docker for that if you can have it on your machine it's great if you can't then go use it on cloud instance if you can do it but you want to do it then please find me on linkedin and i will help you by the way speaking of linkedin please add me to your friends we spent two hours already together so we are almost colleagues and we are going to proceed to a quiz because we have two minutes left and quiz is not started yet and that's wrong i want every one of you to be able to win the prizes i see we have almost three we have almost 30 custom users at this moment so let us switch to a quiz hey you know what as it's the end of a workshop you deserve some music very well so it's a quiz time it's introduction to nosql and please jump into the menu use the code it's on top three eight zero two zero seven two five i want literally everyone to jump into a quiz otherwise it will be too simple competition for those who already in and i want everyone to have chance to win cool so we are about to start we have 10 questions and you will have a low time uh to answer every one of them because it's a quiz already so you have to answer fast now there is a little trick mostly pro the easiest way to use pnt is to use it with your mobile phone you can have it on your laptop as well that's not for story but what matters you are watching us mostly probably with youtube and youtube has a delay something we cannot fix it's on youtube side so if you want to have chance to win watch more mentee now than your youtube because in mendy you will get questions approximately one second before uh on than on youtube i see we have 15 people on them uh and like please do you need one more second to join or uh we have like help of a crew not joining quick quiz this time don't make these uh somebody else's arriving some people are jumping in okay one more join it and we will start one more one more one more i see all the people okay okay that's answer two let's start in my place it's 6 p.m friday night and i want already to go for the weekend so we will start now okay yeah but for the for the attendant the weekend will be a full coding weekend right so yeah yeah yeah that's only the beginning yeah okay so i hope we did a good warm-up to you now you are full of new knowledge yeah don't worry about the homework this weekend you will be busy with coding but uh for the homework it's completely fine to do it somewhere next week so first you do a hackathon then you sleep a couple of days and after that you can proceed with no sql okay yeah let's go then that's 18 people and i'm starting countdown so answer fast to get more point question number one why no sql look at your phone because the relational model is inconsistent just to piece of the previous generation to overcome scaling and structural limitations because new is better always no matter what time is up and i want to see the leaderboard and most of you gave the right answer to overcome scaling limitations and structural limitations indeed and it's not because relational model is inconsistent quite opposite relational model is very consistent and supports data integrity very well don't forget nosql is great but it's not the time to throw your sql to a trash bin sql is still alive and great for many use cases absolutely so most of you gave the right answer but who was the fastest one roona gave a answer fastest and that's a great result shem is on the second place with only two points difference that's nothing and kanha core uh sorry core gown car is on the third place with sebastian just one point below so let's take a look what's going on and what's your question number two answer fast to get more points in a distributed system you can have at the same time consistency availability and partition tolerance ca or cp or ap a working and non-working system or don't worry be ap and what's your answer is that so easy or are you going to make the mistake okay so it wasn't easy no no ladies and gentlemen remember the cap theorem in the distributed system you can have at the same time ca or cp or ap but you cannot have c a and p simultaneously you have to decide so now we will have some changes and it was a mistake for han kangha and sebastian and sao will use these chants roonak was fastest again great result sam is on the second place still but sao gets to the third one and sweetheart and gandu made no mistake and they are holding the top five but only three winners will get the prizes so question number three answer fast to get more points a key value database qflk database supports complex relations and joints perfect for doing complex analytics perfect from for caching expensive computations always stores valuable cryptographic keys okay time is up and write answer both key value databases uh are perfect for caching expensive computations it's not for complex analytics and not for complex relations in joints and not always store valuable cryptographic keys definitely for example users and sessions yeah so and sam it was a mistake gandu avinash oh my god it looks like is changing and take a look runak was fastest again isn't that incredible performance that's very good result don't make a mistake and you will keep your first place sao is on the second and three tier on the third with scheme on the fourth and there is a nice difference already so it will be not easy to make it back to the top frame let's move on so you know what answer fast to get more points what is astra it's local in memory version of cassandra its cassandra is a service in the cloud it's a development tool it's a movie with brad pitt okay what is astronomy what time is up and oops something went wrong okay i will have to reload the page i'm sorry okay good so most of you answer it correctly cassandra is a service in the cloud that's what astra and there is a movie astra view of brad pitt pool named ad astra but it's not a local in memory version so now most of you gave the right answer but who was the fastest swiss time don't tell me it was runak i hope to see a new name this time okay avinash was the fastest and that's ninth place and shem is back shem is back shem is on the third place again well done runak sausham and udai saikaran is very close oh that's uh that's quite a minor difference so the battle goes on the show goes on and that's a question number five so answer fast to get more points what is stargate stargate is a new mario game stargate is a tv show stargate is a data gateway to give you rest graphql api on cassandra stargate is a gateway to stars okay time is up and well it was too easy but you know what stargate indeed was a tv show so second answer is also right but of course in the today's context we mean data gateway to give you multiple apis over cassandra and how it goes on the leaderboard so no mistakes between leaders and who was the fastest swiss time runak is fastest again ok so no changes no changes at this moment at least on top maybe next question will be harder answer fast to get more points and we will know your data set is highly connected and needs a lot of joins what do you use column oriented relational graph document key value and aspirin you may need some if you will pick the right the wrong database for your use case definitely and the best database for relations is graph database not relational database sorry and definitely not a key value database so that's going to be some changes on the leaderboard oh my god that was a white that was a white and how it looks on the end roonac is fastest again i cannot believe that's a great result would i psych iran uses the mistake of others and gets to the second place directly that's good and sao is on the third place with piper on the fourth ready to fight for the third one and shem is on fifth that's amazing so let's take a look where it goes question number seven you have to answer fast if you want to get more points you need a distributed cache to store simple values what do you use column relational graph document key value and other chance i hope you will make no mistake no fat fingers because this question is very simple we discuss it today for sure time is up and the right answer is a key value database distributed cash for simple values that's a key value database nice answers yeah most of you made it so no mistake oh my god shem i cannot believe that basically gives you zero chance to get back to the top three yeah now leader is roonak with the fastest answer and six thousand six hundred thirty points that's incredible your dice side quran made one single mistake is on the second and sao is on the third with also only one mistake okay my path is ready to battle for the third place with some difference but it's something doable considering we still have some questions left but not too many only free so answer fast to get more points you need to store and retrieve json documents from an id what can you use column relational graph document key value and our chance so time is almost over how it goes okay document json documents that's definitely for document databases so how it goes would i psyche run say goodbye that's going to be fourth place sao was the fastest swiss time and vibe half took his chance using udai's mistake and gets to the top three but you know what it still may be a fight in the end because well difference is not so big so let me see the leaderboard okay leaderboard is done that's a question number nine we have only two questions left and let's go countdown starts answer fast to get more points you need a scalable database with heavy writes and heavy reads which one do you use column graph document key value or another chance i would i in phone mistakenly touched i'm sorry ah that happens to people don't forget we run a lot of workshops every week so use your chance on our next workshop meanwhile time is up and this time we had two right answers both column oriented and key value databases are good for heavywrite read operations so if you have more structure it big data rich data you may think of column oriented and key value is will work well for more simple scenarios so roonak i bet keeps the first place with papastas transfer sau is on the second and wife half parque on the third with pradeep on the fourth but this gap is way too big almost 600 points it will be really hard to get on the top three for pradeep and sam is well also is on the same boat maybe some of the leaders will make a mistake you never know but you know ladies and gentlemen i'm going to launch the last question question number 10 you know what to do answer fast to get more points no sql databases are schema-less true false it depends time is over and the right answer is it depends that's the right answer so no sql databases can be schema full no sql basis databases can be schema-less as a result it depends on each and particular databases you consider and i want to see oh my god okay yeah this is always a tough question yeah so and we have a winner we have a winner grunack with the most of the right answers and 900 with 9532 points that's great performance roona gets to the first place uh and that's definitely incredible performance because second place has finished with almost 7 000 points so runa gets a truly a great performance sao on the second place and wipe up on the third one i congratulate those three please contact jack fryer as a jack dot friar at datastax.com send him a screenshot of your mentee winners screen and send him then a screenshot and get your prizes now few last slides for you to consider first one this workshop what do you like the most what should we improve answer using main team and um i will keep this slide open so we will see uh what do you like the most and what should we improve and i will meanwhile switch to the last slide to help you more options so many done smack winners uh first second third place contact jack fryer that's been said uh developer resources uh learn at the datastax.com and at the academy.datastax.com join community.datastax.com it's like a stack overflow but dedicated for cassandra and related topics connect with us follow us at datastaxdevs especially on youtube it's a primary channel for us slides and exercises for this workshop are available at github.com data tax devs workshop introduction to nosql homework a lot of you asked about the homework and how do you get the certificate answer is very simple i will show it to you in this repository we pasted already dozens of times data stacks devs workshop intro to nosql at github there is a special [Music] participation certificate homework part what explains everything to get the participation certificate complete the following steps complete the practice steps of this workshop as explained below steps one to four are mandatory step five graph is optional but i do recommend you to try to do it it's really a gem take a screenshot of the last completed step for either step 4 or 5. when taking screenshots please check what you do not screenshot your astra database key or at least delete wiki afterwards complete this notice there is a second link complete try it out scenario by the link and make a screenshot of scenario completed screen submit the practice here attaching the screenshots so you will have this homework assignment page where you paste your screenshots full the name pull the email linkedin profile and submit it we have already almost 200 people who get this page issued and i want you to be in this list very well now what do we do next uh data starts now so cassandra is great but fur is a big problem for businesses we don't have enough engineers cassandra ready cassandra enabled and that's going to be you data stacks sponsors your education and certification for apache cassandra so at the academy.datastax.com you can pass the courses for apache cassandra for free and then pass the proper certification depending if you want to be a developer or administrator or maybe you interested in running cassandra on kubernetes so go claim your voucher using this link datastax.io workshop voucher or scan this qr code get your voucher and you will have a free certification normally cost 145 each attempt you will have voucher for two attempts so basically it's almost 300 dollar value we do these workshops weekly and for different topics so subscribe to us and like us on youtube and you subscribe at datastax.com workshops join our discord community of almost 13 000 members fellowship of the cassandra rings next week workshop build a netflix clone with graphql react and nosql database you're familiar with already astrum or cassandra plus stargate you can use it not necessarily with astra but on your own conference open online conference cassandra day india july the 10th mark the date and register at datastax.io cassandra day india and there go that's going to be great we already have speakers from netflix and verizon and we are going to have more so i will be happy to see you then and that was it so we are done yeah i think we are done good congratulations to everybody for following through until the end and for taking part in the quiz to the winners and everybody else we hope you learned something that will be useful for you maybe this weekend already who knows so enjoy your coding weekend yep uh uh wipe half just contact jack i hope we will be fine with that um we did great you did great so many people start with our state with us till the end we are happy to see you like it so much and please jump in for our next workshops we will be happy to see you again catch us on linkedin and then i believe we are done yeah good a little bit of music for you in the end and you did a great job thank you see you again yeah see you next time bye-bye [Music] on the same page [Music] [Music] cool [Music] oh
