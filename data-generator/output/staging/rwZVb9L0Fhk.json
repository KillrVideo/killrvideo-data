    "text": "hey welcome to the Davis tax distributed data show I am here live with Valerie we are here at accelerate of datas taxes from near pachi Cassandra conference and Valerie why don't you tell us a little bit more about yourself from data stacks this is the distributed data show sure hi I'm Valerie param Thompson I work for Pythium which is a database consultancy based in Ottawa most of our people are Carolina oh that's great I I'm in Charlotte okay yeah fellow North Carolinians yeah so how did you start working at Pippin so I was working for another company and the person who owned that company came in to Pippy and so brought me with her so that was really great yeah and when I first came I started working with my sequel I've been in my sequel DBA and developer for a very long time and I also work with so a little bit of know sequel as well I joined the cassandra team about eight 12 to 18 months ago okay and it's been a great experience it's a great product yeah that's great to hear so in terms of getting into Cassandra was that a company-wide decision are you still using some other databases like you mentioned so Pythian is a service company that started as oracle but also does sequel server my sequel  cassandra devops big data everything right yeah so as far as the company itself didn't transition to Cassandra but there was a Cassandra team so I transition to Cassandra gosh yeah okay very cool very cool it was was your transition into Cassandra something that you wanted to do personally yeah I did I always think that the more technologies you can learn and you know really get into I don't mean you know just go take a class but the more that you can really do hands-on work with any technology really it makes you a better technologist overall even a turn horse up yeah yeah the more tools you have in your toolbox yeah more different ways of seeing things and since my focus is databases I want to see different ways of doing data storage that's awesome very cool so over a Pythian what are you currently working on so something I wrapped up pretty recently was I updated the SS table documentation for the Cassandra project so you know when I was on the my sequel teams as a lead if somebody came in and they didn't understand a piece of something you know the first thing I said well you get to be the documenter right like that will actually teach you how to do it and so when I was looking at SS table tools I didn't quite understand what all of them did and the great thing of well there's two things about documentation and Cassandra is that there's so much of it oh yeah I'm but a lot of it's outdated and it's not anybody's fault it's just that Cassandra has grown very quickly and there's just a lot of documentation out there and some of it just applies to 1.2 yeah yeah so and I think the features have grown so much that people haven't had a chance to update documentation right it gets deep higher it sighs I get that right so anyway so I jumped into it and I just you know set up a bunch of docker machines and tried everything out tried every single feature figured out which ones were working weren't working yeah and I worked on that and I learned a lot about as this table and I think it also or the SS table tools and I think it also really was a good contribution yeah yeah I think especially as a DBA and with development on my end I know that having to actually work with the project and actually get your hands dirty and try to code something it's how you learn the best so that's really great yeah and I know you had mentioned JMX tables earlier on what's that about yeah so jmx to nobles are something you can use to either get information about Cassandra well about any Java program but about Cassandra and also change Cassandra configuration so it's read and write but again it's not I found it was not super well or going are documented so I thought you know that's another chance to really dig in and understand something at a really low level a little and it's also a really good chance to do automation right so our companies like all about automation yeah and I thought if you could figure out a way to read it read each of those variables and then decide on a preset reason to tune up or down right some of that could be automated some of it might not you know who might not be automated yeah but then you could at least be able to have a report and see which things could be tuned very easily so that's I'm in the middle of that now oh that's great yeah but I've got a fair amount of that done yeah yeah so so getting back to the esses table dogs what what were some problems that you ran across so I I guess the process was it was everyone made it really easy so I wouldn't really describe it as a problem but it was it was different than what I was used to well so I'm used to using github and you know pulling things down making changes are committing back and it's slightly different with the Cassandra project especially the Docs because there are they're all rst files so it's it's a generated type of documentation which I understand and some of the Cassandra tools are actually generated from the help files from within the tools themselves oh wow you know like if you're the command line you do slash dev - hey trace so they come from there so I started so first of all I went to the JIRA project and I saw that someone had asked for the documentation to be updated and I thought well that's a great way to contribute so I dug in and I was gonna have a create a generation file or program to do that but then in discussion in the JIRA ticket we decided that it would probably be better to add some examples and those probably wouldn't fit in the help file yeah so I created individual rst files once I did that though I was able to just give my link to my repo and then a committer Jeff dursa was able to commit it for me oh wow so yeah that's bad part was easy yeah nobody yeah everyone was very helpful I think having you know code snippets as well explaining what your what the writing is saying yeah for a visual person like myself that is so crucial so that's great that that's something that you're implementing yeah so with jmx to animals did you have any problems there or any sort of caveats not really any problems but you know there's there's ten ways to do everything in Cassandra right you can use the SS table tools you can use no tool you can use Jam acts you can sometimes go in the database and look for them for the status so there's just a lot of ways to do it so for and so for each of those tuna bowls in my giant spreadsheet you don't have the best way to get it the fastest way so that was really learning experience as well wow that's awesome so in terms of documentation as a whole how much of your work time would you say is consumed writing Docs well my manager has been really accepting of me doing this you know we all have a little time to either work contributing code to different projects or you know building new automation tools I am one of the few people who really likes to do documentation so I get to do that so I what percentage of my job right now I don't know maybe fibers yeah not so much okay but not it waves I don't know sometimes I have more time yes yeah I was gonna say I need to introduce you to our docs team because I'm sure that they would love to talk to you Oh something they're very passionate about yeah great yeah so also in terms of any lessons learned throughout these two projects of yours what are some key takeaways that the audience might want to know I think definitely contributing Cassandra is a really it's a welcoming thing you know you can certainly get into open source projects where they might say they want you to help but like it's hard or you know they're not super welcoming I think the entire Kassandra a group is very welcoming there's lots of conversation that's you know helpful in the mailing list and there's just lots of ways to get involved so I would say if you want to contribute an open source this is a really good project to get into and there's lots of opportunity for documentation now this summer they're doing google season of docs and that is going it's supposed to really you know change the whole documentation for Cassandra so I'm excited to see what comes out of that yeah but there's opportunity to work with that as well lassy yeah it seems like we'll have to bring you on for another DDS show once that comes out so we can talk more about it yeah so in terms of what you're working on next I know we have touched base a little bit about Facebook would you mind telling us a little bit more about that yeah absolutely so my team manager Pedro Vidigal and I are presenting on to our capacity planning for Cassandra using Facebook profit so Facebook profit is a forecasting tool and you can use it very easily and like a jupiter notebook or any kind of python project and get some really good visualization forecasting things for example server resources which is really important to Cassandra oh that's awesome yeah so we're talking tomorrow at I believe it's 10:45 oh that's great yeah awesome so are you actually going to be speaking yeah oh that's great awesome awesome well we'll be sure to look out for your talk tomorrow and Valerie thank you so much for your time yeah I appreciate it thank you thanks",
