Denise Gosnell hi Denise hey David thank you so much how are you oh that's wonderful not near you and and myself gave Joan Gilardi so um so for all the watching right now you know bear with us for a moment as we do this first of our as our graphing code show livestream so really what just to kind of break this down and what we're gonna do so Denise and Matias I'm still not gonna attempt to say Matisse's last name group Shilla oh there you go doing that one right he's gonna get so so both Denise and Matias have recently written in a Riley book I'm specifically on graph and I'm not gonna go too much into that because I'm not the expert there that is Denise and so I'll let her talk to that but from from a noobs standpoint right from coming in a few if you're first learning graph about graph whether its data stacks graph or graph database ins in general one of the hardest parts right can be that kind of starting off point like it can get really intense really fast mm-hm and it can get really complicated and even before you know I like nice so I like to you know say nice things about our Mateus and that kind of deal but some even even separate from that um when I had gotten a pre version of the book and I was going through it one of the things that really struck me was actually how well thought-out the examples were and how good it would be for folks that are just starting into Graf you know we've for a couple years now with the dev rel team you know we've been doing stuff where we've had our developer Day events we've done graph curriculum and such and you know it's one of those it can get really difficult really quick and I actually really really enjoy the way that the book kind of lays this stuff out so we're gonna denise is gonna school me she is going to bring me through the book and not only just through the book we're not gonna do reading time for Denise but okay so you over here no you get your glasses ready were you ready for that right but uh but she's actually gonna bring me through the book and they they not only created a book yeah but there is a whole github repo with all sorts of exercises real concrete use cases everything so we're gonna every week we're gonna step through this thing and Denise is gonna school me I've said enough I'm gonna stop nice yes tell us tell us yeah no I uh this is gonna be this is gonna be fun and just a kinda level set um we're watching a few places right here so we want you guys to be asking as many questions as possible I'm watching live on Twitter and I'm watching live on YouTube hello I saw someone say hi on YouTube so we're glad that you guys are joining us so here's what we're gonna do we want to get everyone's hands dirty into the code that we created for just trying to understand how to use graph technology and think about connected data so as a part of that we figured that we would have a good time with me kind of giving David just like a straight up tour on how to use all the assets and just kind of start at the beginning so for the next 40 minutes or so our goal is we're gonna try and screen well first off we're going to screen share with David and we're going to show you how to get access to the docker containers to pull to pull the docker containers down I'm going to kind of give you guys a tour of everything that we have pre baked and ready for you and that's essentially going to almost be a tour from chapter like three through 12 in the book so you have an idea of all of the examples that we're gonna be digging into over the coming weeks and then depending on where we are I thought we'd get started right at chapter 3 where we introduced the idea that a graph query is the reverse of sequel where was sequel it's all about select from where and we get started in chapter 3 saying that graph is kind of the reverse of that it's where from select or kind of where join select and that's where I maybe we'll get started today we'll see we'll kind of see how far we get along so that's kind of the plan and I'll keep monitoring for questions across our various channels but I'm excited to give you guys a you know a front row tour into all of the code and everything that we wrote so awesome alright so with that I guess should I sure yeah yeah anyone watching this is your your kind of getting like a behind-the-scenes tour of how I have been how David and I have been working together to create content together or to kind of create these examples and we realized that if we're gonna be diving so deeply into all this like let's just screen share and let everyone else follow along so really this is gonna be pretty pretty informal yeah and to that but following along that I'm pretty sure is totally doable you know like I'm like maybe some workshops where we're throwing a lot of information at folks and kind of expect that there's gonna be a little homework in that kind of deal denise is literally walking me through this in real-time so you'll get to see my like missed keystrokes and everything that's gonna be wonderful yeah I'm so sorry can I share my screen that's about I I think one of my one of my favorites favorite professors at the University of Tennessee his name is doctor dr. Jim plank and he need live codes all of his classes and I've always got one yeah I've always found that to be one of the easiest ways to learn and follow along so it's kind of a theme here we're gonna have David be digging in live coding following everything and we'll see how it goes okay cool all right so hopefully at this moment I'm just double checking screens and stuff you guys should see my screen now for those of you who are following along right what I have done is I did cheat a little bit not too much though I swear is you know just so we don't have a scenario where you are watching me like download a bunch of doctors and such like that I'll hold on real quick and getting some odd audio from somewhere please that might have that might have been me I was trying to follow along sorry oh I was like which window is doing it I thought that was me doing the to myself so um that's great so what I did is again instead of watching paint dry and you know watching me download a bunch of doctors and such I have at least started up the the the the containers and stuff once right so I've gone through that step that's it right from other than that we're essentially gonna be starting from scratch and just break it down a little bit here so the first thing I want you to notice is if you take a look at this URL that I'm looking at right now github comm / DX / graft book um that is where all of the materials that we're gonna be working through exist right so you can go to graph book it's all open and and this is really cool for those of you who are familiar at all with using Deus Ex studio or whatever when you're working with metric Sandra and Dave sex Enterprise you'll be very familiar with the notebooks and everything for those of you who are not you don't need to worry about it the way that Denis and team have set this up and we'll step through in a moment it's all enabled through docker write everything we're able to do or everything we're going to do I can just do literally by cloning the repo and then saying docker compose up and that's it it's it's that simple the whole point it's like get you up and running right so that's the first resource the second thing this is probably not needed but it's something I as a developer I kind of do if I'm doing things in docker I tend to have the dashboard up that's what you see here you can see I'm loaded at least once right so if I need to look at logs or do anything you'll see when that goes green and then finally I have a terminal I'm using I term - I have a terminal setup where I'm actually gonna be issuing the commands right so it's really just the the web page here and then the terminals where I'm gonna be working out of okay so Denise I was gonna start just stepping through but before I do that was there anything that you wanted to have me do or kind of point out while we're here again so what you've done is you went to github you cloned the repository and you ran docker compose up I know I actually have docker I do not have it up so I can do that now if you want me to yeah that would be great so if you could go ahead and kind of spin up the container that contains all the examples that would be awesome that's right okay now one thing I would like to point out for those of you who are familiar with using docker and dr. compose you might see Oh where's his - Dee well in this particular case I actually want all of the log information to come to the foreground and I want to interact with it there just so you guys can see what's going on right um matter of fact if I so there we go if I don't do that then you're not gonna see all this wonderful output I don't know again that's kind of something that's maybe a little geeky on my own I like to see the output and kind of see what's going on so I am just running in the foreground you know per the instructions actually you see if you scroll down here a little bit in the docker QuickStart section right it'll say okay go ahead go get the thing and then run your duck and compose up this is literally what I'm doing right now by the way if you don't use the git command you can always in any github repository you can just say clone or download and say download zip or you can just clone that there so you get clone that link all right so we're doing our doctrine compose up we can see it's starting to run we can see we have a bunch of output and then the next part of this is once this gets up you're gonna see they have this link if you notice the link when I highlight there is actually going to localhost 9 0 9 1 right so it's gonna go to my own I'm gonna go ahead and launch that and there we go ok so I have a bunch of notebooks hopefully do you seeing that yep perfect I am and I was I'm following along looking for questions both again on Twitter and on YouTube if anyone has questions so thank you guys so much for sending those and I'll keep monitoring that's why I'm looking at 18-thousand directions right now ok so this is to me I remember writing this book over the past year and a half like that 1991 where studio home pages that's basically where I feel like I lived for the past year and a half so right there so right there you're you're getting a quick glimpse into all of the assets that we have available and you'll the first thing you notice that they're all appended according to the chapter so we're gonna eventually start with chapter 3 but let it let me just give you a quick tour of everything that's in here so chapter 3 chapter 4 and chapter 5 are a package they walk you through the idea of building a customer 360 application it's basically where most people get started when they're wanting to explore the idea of using graph technology so those those notebooks all go together because they're telling us a sequential story chapter 6 and 7 are the next pair that go together and then it's eight nine and ten and twelve so let me tell you just really briefly about all four of these use cases well as I already mentioned three four and five are the idea of moving from relational technology into using graph technology for customer 360 application the basic premise is you have data in different silos around your company and you're trying to bring all of your strong IDs together to say hey this is my customer and I want to know everything about that across all of my different data sources and so that's the story that will walk through starting today starting at chapter 3 a little bit further down the road we'll get to chapter 6 and 7 which is where we will be introducing having time series data as a graph in Cassandra which is just really awesome once you kind of get to see the really cool things you can do when you're modeling time series data in a graph and and what you can do with that so when we're getting to that application the questions that we're trying to answer are well what happens if a cell phone tower fails how do I figure out what what components are what sensors on my network are no longer going to be able to connect to that tower because it failed and it actually requires a dynamic distributed graph in order to answer that question and that's we're going to be getting into and we get to 6 for chapters 8 & 9 we moved to the third most popular use case we're using graph technology with which is pathfinding it's the idea it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon problem where everyone always wants to know well how am I connected to this person in my network and so we're gonna explore pathfinding in the notebooks four eight and nine in the context of exchanging Bitcoin on on the Bitcoin OTC network and there's some really cool really cool ways that you have to flip the ratings of how much you trust somebody because in order to do a shortest path problem you can't just aggregate the trust scores as you go cuz it turns into a longest path problem so anyways we'll get to all those details when we get there and then at the very end in chapters 10 and 12 we're going to be showing you how to build a real production recommendation system and I say real and production because the idea of following users and movies to create that collaborative filtering example that a lot of the graph folks talk about you need to have two systems you need to have one that is doing the deeper analytics in a more say offline offline analytics cluster and then you need to be pushing the shortcut edges or the actual recommendations to be declaring them real time like when you're looking at your app on Netflix and you want to say oh this is the recommended movie that you or the recommended content so that's we're going to be getting to at the very end of this journey and that's going to tie back into the number of partitions it requires in Cassandra to run those types of queries so there's going to be a lot of content and a lot of coding and that's the tour of the four stories that we're going to do we're going to do customer 360 hierarchical data with time series paths with Bitcoin data and then we're going to do collaborative filtering with movie recommendations some good David one for those use cases right the ones that you just spelled out that we're gonna go through and all the notebooks right okay now I'm gonna play a little bit of straight-man here a little fourth wall is I understand it those use cases aren't just like arbitrary use cases that you guys like it let's do these right these are actually use cases and concrete examples from what you guys over so many years have experienced that people are trying to do with graph like in the real world is that correct yeah it David that's really great absolutely and when Matias and I were thinking about how to organize this we wanted a stream line into the templates of what types of graph projects made it into production because there are so many beautiful examples of really interesting ways to use connected data to solve a problem but from our experience over the past ten years of working with teams around the world a lot of these problems maybe didn't end up with the business value that people wanted or they just didn't end up getting sponsored so they kind of fell to that crack of a cool idea but not going to end up in production what we did is we quick the common templates from what we have seen move into production and that essentially became the four stories that we told in this book the customer 360 used a hierarchical data path finding and then collaborative filtering I see cool okay the next question and you kind of touched on this as you were explaining and kind of giving me the the rundown the notebooks I noticed this difference between some notebooks have dev and some have prod I see Devon prod Devon problem seeing this a lot and I think what I heard you say was something along the lines of there are maybe ways that you would explore your graph or whatever in development that you wouldn't do in production and there's going to be some different things you would do in production say from an analytic standpoint or whatever so okay so I'm gonna make an assumption let's see if I got this right so I have a feeling that what we're gonna see in the dev notebooks are exactly those like how do I explore how don't you know as a developer especially when you're first figuring out your traversals your queries whatever you might do things a little bit differently than you do into the optimized production so is that where we're gonna see you guys provided essentially examples on both ends exactly that's exactly it okay so yeah so for if we focus in on like three four and five there's a this is the only example that had three and the reason it had three was because after three was like kind of like the relational versus graph bake-off chapter so the chapter 3 really is just getting started with like the fundamentals of doing graph type queries where we introduce the idea that gremlin really is just where join select or the opposite of that select from you know that select from where statement that is super popular and that exact same dev prod pattern follows throughout every other use case in the book so 3 & 4 are development helping you think through your data design queries and think about how you're going to use your data and your graph technology to solve your question and then in chapter 5 we lifted the final version of the query to essentially kind of talk about the production style of how you want to partition your data and the other types of guardrails that you might want to put on your query when you run it in prod and we follow that same thing just like you said for everything else so like chapter 6 is development ok for 7 is production chapter 8 is development chapter 9 is production chapter 10 is development I just slipped in some entity resolution stuff in chapter 11 and then we go to chapter 12 is production okay okay awesome and actually and for those folks out there who you know have been using graph for a little bit of time right and I'm giving a little bit of a preview on something I'm cheating just a little bit cuz I honestly I have not gone through the vast majority of this material but I've gone through just a little bit of it cuz I wanted to get a feel right because the whole idea is that Sinise is bringing me through this fresh but one thing I did notice for the developers out there and I got really excited when I saw especially for the times that I was doing stuff in graph development is this usage of dev this this dev object that you can use that essentially kind of flips some switches to put you in like a development mode very easily just by using that object as compared to having to switch a bunch of configuration parameters and such like that I thought that was particularly neat so I assume we're gonna see a lot of those the dev yeah yeah so why don't we go ahead and open up the let's get a pair of chapter 3 notebook and we can treat it yeah we can show one thing I think we should point out here is that since we're using the docker image in at any point Denise if I'm incorrect with what I'm saying just shoot me down live everywhere I'm nicely correct you know no you can shoot me down just do it okay but wait hey but I'm pretty much done so since we're using the docker image another thing the docker image does for you actually and we pop over real quick notice that the docker image is not the only way that you can do this if you want to you could actually load down like the the DSC 6:8 tar ball and go about it like that or you could do this in your own graph and such like that here's here's the difference right the docker image comes with everything pre-baked all the graphs are created the data is loaded and all that it is uber fast from the time when I wrote when I ran docker compose up I actually you know I did like I said I did this the other day and I was like I went two days later I was like it's all the data already in here and she's like yeah I'm like oh because that makes it so you can literally spin this thing up in like five minutes and get going in the notebooks right yeah if you if you don't have that you have to do some other manual work you know yeah yeah it's a David to your point I'm looking at the docker I'm looking at the github repository if you could scroll to the plot yeah perfect so then essentially right there you have two directories inside the github repository so for some of you following along who are just gonna take the docker compose route I would go that route because everything's going to be loaded for you and specifically what it's doing is it's going inside this data directory and the github repository and we wrote so if you could click on that we wrote some loading scripts perfect yeah so we essentially we wrote loading scripts for all of the data associated by chapter and I think if you click on chapter 10 that is the biggest one yeah so chapter 10 you can see we've got a tarball of data so we don't need to download that here but you can see that on chapter 10 there's a loading script that that is a way that it shows you how to load the data and eventually in these live streams David and I will get into loading data but we won't do it on this first one but I wanted to pull out chapter 10 as an example because we merged two datasets together for the recommendations that are at the end of this at the end of the book we merge together cackles movies so about I think that are they pretty much the ground truth they have the most the most movies out there about three hundred fifty thousand three hundred six thousand if I'm remembering correctly and then we merge that with the movie lens data and the movie lens data has about 20 million ratings between some users of movie lens and movies so we merged those twos datasets together and provided all of that data in the tarball that you're showing here now right and so when you use the docker setup it's adding the schema into your graphs which now you if you're thinking along you've got a graph for basically every chapter a graph for chapter 3 a graph for chapter 4 a graph for chapter 5 all the way through chapter 12 and great those graphs it sets up the schema and then it loads the data for you so that when we're doing some of these livestreams we can get right to coding and thinking about how you want to write gremlin to answer your questions and I mean really prefer to go into the loading in the schema at some point but just not today yeah and like I just want to point that out because one of the first things that happens is when you come to the chapter 3 notebook III know for myself being somebody who in his historically used studio with graph and I did not create any schema yet when I used the docker image I came here and I was like wait it didn't ask me it didn't prompts me to create it and then I look and as I was mess around like wait there's a schema already here I'm like oh this stuff is already in place so just something I want to point out for those who may be familiar with this kind of stuff already and you're taking a look you're like wait a minute where why am I not getting these things is because it's all there it's all there when you use the docker image right and on YouTube I am putting a link to where you can get the chapter 3 chapter 4 and chapter 5 PDF for free so if you did want to long I just put that link on the on the YouTube comments first the people who are watching there and I think that's actually turning out to be the easiest place for people to be sending in questions so I've got Twitter and YouTube up but sending questions through YouTube on at data stocks and devs if you're wondering where to follow so you can ask us questions but yeah so David to your point here's the notebook and we can start we can start diving into some of the questions or some of the queries so if you could maybe scroll down let's do it to the I have an image that's pulling in the graph schema perfect you might have to make that a little wider awesome you know it's funny this like there's maybe I don't know it's a couple second lag but I'm hearing I hear I did it and then I heard you after you know so I felt like I had a moments of maybe trying to read your mind a little bit Oh while we're reading the mind of Denice Gosnell anyway okay so David here's what we're doing in Chapter three so in Chapter three well I'm gonna step back for two seconds in Chapter one we spent a lot of time talking about when to use graph technology and why it would be useful in Chapter two we introduced all of the vocabulary and we introduced something called the graph schema language or the GSL so all of the vocabulary and all of the notation that we're getting ready to walk through is outlined and explained and will you know will define it in context but it all builds up so that this picture means something because everything you're looking at here can be directly translated into schema statements just like an ard so we probably want to go into a future episode where we really dive into all the details of the graph schema language and how we're using these images to essentially make the erd for graphs because that's also a part of what we're doing here but okay once you get into chapter 3 it's like the common question it's it's the debate that Matthias and I have to essentially moderate every time we try and help people get started with graph technology and that debate is always well why not just use our DBMS for this relationship would do just as well so the example that we're walking through here essentially in the text we do the entire example in Postgres and so what we're picking up here in the notebook is the exact same example but starting with just using data stacks graph so what you look at here you're looking at you're looking at graph schema and in graph schema there are three things there's vertex labels edge labels and properties and David you I think you kind of already know some of these bits yeah yeah but let's pretend that I don't okay okay cool cool so in this graph schema you can see on the vertex labels if you kind of read them that we're talking about a banking example so we have customers and these customers own they own accounts they use credit cards and they also Oh some loans in this fictitious Bank that we're modeling right right what we want to do in this notebook is to show how simple it is to combine graph databases with graph query languages to answer the question of tell me everything about this customer and that's really what we're building up to in this example so I'm good mm-hmm cool so far all there yep all right let's go down and like you said the schema is already in the database and you kind of get a glimpse at your first few schema statements there where you can see that each of those vertex labels become part of the schema that we're making in this block and protip for studio I think it's ctrl L turns on line numbers oh yeah well gave me a line see the ctrl L or command L is how you get your line numbers in a well well control I'll be the first thing that's okay I'm not a Mac but for some reason I had to do that multiple times I'm not sure what happened to my numbers whew dude pro tip I could not be navigating studio without line numbers turned on that's a good point yeah it'll help this kind of pinpoint exactly what we're talking about yep so when you're when you're starting with your graph your graph schema just like in any other database you have to you have to say what piece of data uniquely identifies this vertex where a vertex just represents like a single entity and as you can see online where does that line for where we find the partition key yeah yeah so the light so the partition key for this customer is going to be an ID they're just some customer ID and that's all that that is meaning that just says that this customer ID is going to represent this unique entity or this unique vertex in my graph database and in something to just kind of stay here right is that this graph database that we are working with for Davis X graph is built on top of Apache Cassandra it is so this partition for those who are familiar with the magic of Sandra right and again correct me if we're wrong but this partition is going to be the same kind of it's a partition right so we are this is our partition key essentially customer ID is that correct correct correct that is correct and a question that just came in from YouTube hey on KITT it's good to see you another question just came in do we need DSC to use Cassandra to use Cassandra graph can we use graph on top of Cassandra without DSC the answer for that question all the examples that you're going through here do require data sex enterprise and using graph on top of data stacks enterprise that all is available in this docker container setup though so you have the ability to play with this on your desktop licensor yeah you just download it yeah yeah yeah yeah so good question thanks for that comment thanks for bring that in so right so this just set up our schema our vertex labels and I mean you can still execute the schema statements it's not going to mess anything up in the database so those wonderful if not exists right that kind of exactly was it that part and I can see it being executed over here and in saying here's the actual underlying cql statement that's kind of fun yep yep cool so that's I think that's why I like that stuff so we just made for vertex labels in the graph one for customer one for their accounts their loans and then their credit cards and we gave them all give unique keys and in these vertex labels then correspond to what we were looking at here loan customer account and credit cards we're creating these vertices correct correct okay okay so the other three things we need to make now are those edges so it's gonna make the edges hmm right the edges the Ozone's role and you is okay so there you go whenever you're making edges you just want to say that you're connecting this edge label connects from this and then you provide the vertex label and then to and you provide the vertex label it's connecting so we're going from cost merchants to loans and that's the first edge that you're making and that's I mean that's like really simple so I've those are literally the vertex labels we just created so that's it we're just connecting one from another word we're essentially taking this schema this visual representation of the graph or saying I want to connect from this to this with that edge yes and the parcel in there was you know Oh customer to loan okay yep yep yep absolutely so the only real difference here is on that last edge label the O's edge label you can see that we have a property on that one okay yep that's the only difference between the two and I see right so we we go into detail and we're writing about this in the book but the idea is that a customer can can own an account right and you might have multiple roles so you could be the creator of that account or you could be an authorized user you could be the owner like there's many different ways that you could you could actually control that account and it's and this is also a very very deep modeling discussion that you can get into but you see how that that line from customer to account is a double line I was gonna ask you about that because it just I mean all these others look kind of similar and when I looked at the edge statements they didn't have properties but this one had the property and have the double line so yeah that's exactly why I scroll back up here by the okay I was gonna ask you yeah um no worries and there there isn't standard notation to describe this so we kind of invented this notation we'll see if it takes off but here's the idea in case an arrow what does it mean to do it it's okay I should say double line sorry anyway the idea here is that between like David if you're in the database and we have the David vertex and we have the account vertex the double line means that you want there to be multiple edges between David and the account so David is the owner David is the authorized user and David is the I don't know something else the creator of other anything right so David dick essentially has multiple roles here correct and we are representing that with multiple edges from the customer to account yes because when you're doing graph data modeling at the schema level and to people who are following this is probably the most important thing to know about data modeling with graphs everything starts at many-to-many there's no I there's this the the idea of something being one-to-many or one-to-one and graph databases does not make sense so what we're doing here is we're giving you a way to take a many many relationship but then provide multiple edges between two individual vertices and that's what we're doing down there in those schema statements when you have cluster by role because now if you add an edge you have the ability to have many edges from David to his account so that's what's happening on that yeah on that line right there okay okay cool all right you know all right I think yeah we were here all right so we've got our schema right we've got our what we've got our vertex is we have our edges and I'm going to assume by this next section we're gonna put stuff in it yep yep yep okay so inserting some data and that's what's happening here so David do you want to do want to give a give a go at what's going on with this gremlin gremlin statement well let's see so the first thing is I do see a reference to gee it looks like we're adding a vertex so we've okay so we set up our schema right so we set that up and now we're going to put some data in there absolutely so we're gonna add a customer vertex it's going to have a property here I see we're giving an idea of customer zero it's gonna have a name of Michael so I'm making a base assumption that after we do this if we order then you know look at our graph we would actually see now that we have a customer vertex with those two properties well look you know I don't know if we'd actually show the ID or not but we'd at least have the customer vertex what a property name in Michael absolutely absolutely and that's all that's all accurate and that next statement that terminal statement at the end called next that's a way to execute this gremlin statement and then store the resulting object into the variable name like I did this yes yes yeah so actually if you click on studios graph visualization feature you can see it in the database do you see that yeah that one there you go there's your customer yeah and then everything I guess oh good if you could click on the settings wheel I'm not the settings bill for the visualization that one yeah change yeah yeah you might change from labels yep you can change name I guess I could then there's a global fault uh no worries I just wanted to show show people how to how to do that yeah if you don't want these like very verbose and curse names right notice now as Denise and instructed me we use the with the mustard language I believe and you can specify what the actual property name is there and now it says it's much prettier now right some weird reference yeah exactly okay great so we have built our schema we have inserted a vertex let's go add some more cuz I think when I think in this book we had five people that we were inserting so let's scroll down and insert some more which I think we move on to ah yes so this one right here this pop quiz why did that fail it looks like there's no reference to the IDE exactly so this is Cassandra under the hood so if you don't provide the full key you can't insert data oh okay so let's okay let's let's further the sound a little bit you know because we talked about this a lot in our Cassandra development workshops right that one thing is absolutely required in Cassandra and that's that partition key right so so what I'm what I think I just saw here is that by not providing that partition ID or that partition key in this case this this would be similar to what would happen is if I try to insert something like this directly into a Cassandra table and I didn't provide partition key it's gonna yell at me yeah that's so that's what I believe I'm seeing here yep that's it okay now do we want to fix this or did you guys just put this in here as an example is hey hey I just put in his example this entire series is learning through failing so there's a there's a if you want to fail a lot whenever I started getting you like getting used to working with gremlin and graph technology I felt like almost for every one query I figured out I had probably 10 massive failures right before it so that is that is the development experience and I kind of come from the camp of if you're not breaking things you're not coding hard enough no I actually think this test is a really good example it illustrates again the fact that this this is this is Cassandra right this is Cassandra under the hood yeah so if you keep that in mind and you you kind of understand some of the some of the reasoning behind things are some of the constraints things like again partition keys and why you need those then it starts to make sense why you might get this error and why that happens and then it's that much easier is you're going on to not make that mistake again so I think that's a good example cool so for those of you who are still following along or maybe have jumped in the big thing that we're trying to get to today is doing a graph query that shows you how graph languages are the reverse of sequel where sequel is like select from where and we're eventually building up to show you that graph queries are the reverse where from select or I like to call it where joins select so that's kind of where we're navigating to and david has inserted one vertex into the database so far and we're gonna go down and we're gonna add some more vertices and add some edges okay all right so you want me to do these yep yep yep so what are we adding here well it looks like to me now we're starting to fill it out a little bit right and by the way I'm just gonna pull up our schema it's a little easier for me because I have squirrel memory syndrome and here we go hopefully you guys can see that well enough right so so we were just a moment ago we were doing things we were setting up inserting some data from the customer to account right but it looks like now we're starting to feel some things a little bit adding another accountant here with an ID of account 14 then adding a lone vertex yet loan 32 and then adding credit cards again we're starting to to fill this out a little bit more yeah so we only have four vertices in the graph we have Michael and then the fourth the three things about him so in the next go let's go ahead and add the edges that we connect them together okay right I see so we've added these vertices now we want to add edges which makes sense right you can't you can't I would assume that you have to have some vertices before you can add edges absolutely Rossi's you can't say like add an edge from this customer to a loan when there's nothing over there so okay okay so in this case because I feel like you're gonna ask me it looks like we're adding an owns edge owns from Michael to account for teens from a customer to account and then we're giving it a you know using that that one property the role property we talked about is primary yeah and then we can have hos so that's gonna be from Michael alone 32 so Michael then owes on a particular loan and then for uses we're gonna add a uses edge again from Michael to our CCR credit card so Michael uses some credit card he owed on some loan and he owns an account and it has the primary role so we're getting out of that yep yep that's it that's it okay and I assume that if we look at our visualization here we'll start to scroll a little bit there we go right actually while we're here let's go to our global defaults I'm assuming his credit card what's it what's it some I didn't see if the name of the property was it name again I think it's CC underscore none like no Meza no there goes yep yep yeah cool all right to make that nicer so we can see here now this if I'm right though we're not at this point we're not really traversing the graph in trying to explore it we're just getting the output from when we added this so I believe we're only gonna see the very last one that's in this case correct compared to if I were to actually queried my graph right please you do still have to see now I've got Michael I've got that vertice again you can see when I hover over it and the left-hand side that it's a customer vertex that uses what the uses edge over to this particular credit card okay that we created before okay do you think you could make I'm going in question here on Twitter open on Twitter on YouTube can you make your screen a little bit larger some people are saying that they're having a hard time yeah let's try it apparently see how crazy I can go with this is it our people having a hard time making reading the text is that what's going on yes yeah really it's we got a we got a comment here that it's not as clear so maybe if we make a little larger that would help how's that I blew it up a little bit well I just responded on YouTube I will see me if that makes it better thanks for that thank you guys yes thank you for letting us know and I'll zoom in a little bit here so you guys can see the scheme a little better okay hopefully that works better I can do the same over here while we're here awesome awesome all right well let's uh let's keep on going because I think that about ten minutes left in this livestream and we are so close to getting through our aircraft our first graph query so at this point we've added Michael and his information and we're using the docker set up we don't have to go through and out all the rest of the ones because they're already in there but what is happening is that in the in the book we're telling a bigger story we have five characters so this is Maria roan meet Maria we're adding Maria anything and yeah you can execute them if you'd like but because you're using the talker setup it's already already loaded right right so who do I see so really we're just this is us this is you know rinse and repeat right we're essentially just adding more data more varied data going through the same mechanisms that we just the same syntax and everything other than it's different data is what it is exactly exactly so we have another character named Rasika we added rashik owes data we have Jaime okay Jaime's data and lastly I remember alia yep the Leah's daily oh yeah okay okay awesome so we have five people now we have five people in the database and there it is there's everybody so if you want to is that a hidden gremlin query oh yes this looks like it yep Oh I see something already that's fun I don't know if we're gonna talk about today but I see you're using dev dot yes yeah so for anyone following along who has been a user of graph data before David just picked it out we have a feature in our next product over here called dev and dev is a new graph traversal source that just means that when you start a graph traversal with dev dot it's gonna basically let you walk through your graph index free and we deployed that so that I mean shout out thank you so much to Brian Cooke who did that for us just for this book graphically but we did that because so many people were you you want to make sure you have a place to explore your data but then you also want to have a harden traversal source that only allows you to do production quality traversals so we split that up and we teach all the development chapters in the graph book just using the dev traversal source which you can see here pulls out every vertex and every edge and the graphs that you can get a visualization of the data we have which are there's our five people and it looks like we have some shared accounts and credit cards for some of the people in our story because you can you see three connected components the green vertices are one connected component the orange vertices are the next connected component and then the blue vertices are the third connected component so something I'm noticing here again making the connection with Cassandra and again asking you to correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like looks like here we're literally pulling all of the vertices and then stepping out along all of all edges really both eat right so this is this is like I just did a select star wife I'm just I'm doing a full scan right here right okay select star across every table in the entire database so I would notice it in production you would never do that in production exactly that's exactly what I was driving at is that this is this is the same thing that we talked about right in the workshops when we say yes you on a small data set if you're doing a quick test can you do a select star just get an idea what's there fine but you never really want to use that especially as you start to scale up your data because we've only got like you know a dozen data points here maybe or something like that but imagine if you had a billion right imagine if you had a thousand node cluster that you on this and you did this right so that's also something help me understand with dev I I'm making a guess at what I think some of dev is doing right because I know that in previous examples graph you would have to explicitly configure certain parameters to enable to get the functionality that you're getting dev right now it looks like dev is just doing that for you you know maybe we're taking yeah I do easy to walk around your entire graph with no indexes essentially okay yeah we're before you have to specifically tell it to allow to do that allows scanning allow all sorts of things so it's letting you do it yeah so so it sounds like great dev but dev has no protections right if we had a billion rows in this thing we actually just tried to do this we would just scan them all regardless correct and behind the scenes we won't be able to use dev in a full cluster so there's a few other guardrails good okay we'll get there then okay we'll get there cool so let's keep and it's our first let's get to our first query so the way that I like to think about graph queries is that they list we're gonna basically do this one example and this will kind of be the end of today's live stream since we've done so much okay but understanding graph queries graph data graph technology it's all about being able to answer higher-level business questions so this entire notebook and every every question in this book is doing query driven design the very first question that we're setting up is can you tell me which credit cards this customer uses and it looks like we're using Michael customer 0 this first this first example so you have to kind of think back to our schema and imagine just like you would if you were in a new city and using Google Maps you kind of have to imagine how you're gonna use these edges to walk around your data and that's what we're doing here we're starting at the customer we're walking over the edge code uses and once you walk over that edge called users you're standing on a credit card and so you want to get credit card number and this exact process is the is beautifully the reverse of select from where and that's why you see all those comments anything that's a double slash and then it's grayed out that's how you do comments and the ground one or the groovy programming languages so I provided lots of comments that you guys can see the mindset that we're trying to teach on how to use this query language so that first line is essentially where you're starting your traversal I want to start on customer zero the second line you go down to out users and you're saying I need to join everything to you like I'm gonna follow this join through the uses edge and now once you walk over that edge you're standing on credit cards and you want to select their credit card number and so that that is exactly how I see graphed reversals they're the reverse of select from where it's where join select yeah and I see now in your comments where you get the where join select you there you go it's like a like oh okay that makes sense okay yeah so I think you probably could run that one that one should be ready to go right yeah buddy so yep okay so I mean and just to kind of reiterate so you know looking at the schema right so we start with a customer obviously we identified customer zero then she said we're gonna say we're gonna go out uses and I see that our edges we didn't really talk about their ship at the edges have directionality and you know so they go from customer credit card so I'm gonna go out uses that brings me to a credit card where you said if I imagine I have like a little gremlin I'm standing on the credit card now and I'm getting the value of whatever the property there is in this case that's EC numb yep and it might be the next one but I think most people who want to do these queries they want to essentially do a select star of accounts so there we're walking specific edges so let's keep scrolling cuz I'm looking for the query that's like everything because that that's one where it gets really fun okay we might want to start there next time I'm going I forgot about this this little section yeah I forgot about this section so you'll we only have a few minutes left so we'll just kind of markers where to start next time but especially that question of start on customer 0 go out and we're providing the parameters of which edge you can essentially leave that blank and it'll go out all edges and that's the way to essentially do for star about everything connected but we'll start there negative a so okay okay awesome alright so with that let me see if I cannot you know I realized I I this thing has a little widget to hide there we go shirring I lost the widget to hit a little widget on the bottom of the screen sharing I lost I'm like I'm yeah so for her let's still have a few people following on the live streams thanks so much for saying all the way through this so we did a lot we for those of you who may be joined halfway through David shows you where to go to get started which is gonna be get hot github.com /data stacks forward slash graph - book we use the docker compose setup to pull up the containers so all of the data and schema is ready to go yep that's it right there and when we had that up we took a tour of the whole book which this book tours the four most popular patterns of people who are using graph technology in production applications those patterns are customer 360 hierarchical data paths and then collaborative filtering so they throughout these tutorials these live streams were eventually going to get through all of that and today we started with the very beginning which is doing customer 360 and we kind of just took a quick tour through one of those notebooks to doing our first gremlin query where we like to think about gremlin queries as the reverse of sequel where sequel is select from where and we kind of did a gremlin query which was where join select so that that is everything that we did during this first hour livestream so what do you think David how'd that go I I think that's a good I think that's a good place and we'll give folks a moment to digest things um one thing I do want to point out for those of you and we're gonna do this later on the series but for those of you who really like to kind of get your hands dirty or something like that it is worth even though the the docker image is set up to provide everything for you I think it's worth to actually step through how to load the data and use the bulk loader and do that I think it's very informative again we're gonna do later on in the series but if you have to get your hands dirty the instructions are all there and and we'll do more but anyway No thank you guys and thank you Denise for starting this up and and like getting through this first iteration we are gonna continue to go through the whole thing yeah every week we're gonna do it we're gonna do with you please bring yourself bring your friends bring your questions most off because like you get this kind of time to pick Denise's brain and you know it's it's unique in each time thanks anyway with that everyone thank you thank you guys for joining and we'll see you again next week thank you so much David [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]",
