database apache cassandra i'm cedric linven i'm leading the developer advocacy team i data stacks you have me you have seen me a lot of time multiple times multiple weeks we are there one week over two doing those live uh this is my coordinate uh twitter linkedin uh github i would be happy to have you in my network never hesitate to invite me so i'm a certified cassandra expert trainer speaker java geek doing a lot of coding uh building apis micro services uh integration and a lot in spring lately but not only and today with me we do have peter hi peter hi celery salute welcome everyone thanks for joining us uh so i work with sailor uh i use i run san francisco java user group i work at data stacks to help developers succeed with apache cassandra stargate kate sandra all of our open source technologies uh and a long time um spring framework uh person from uh also from elastic a number of other places and i'm very very excited to be here today basically former uh career app dev person and now turned database guy so uh yes as cedric said i'd love to have you in my network please find me on linkedin or twitter uh and let's get started thanks for having me today say drake oh pleasure pleasure to share we will have so much fun together all right okay so a little bit of housekeeping it's not only me and peter on screen as usual to prepare the content that hosting the session that answers alive this is the distributed team across the world uh see try to bring some diversity here and there okay it's a live workshop it's an interactive workshop never hesitate to ask questions either on the youtube chat but when the session ends uh so does the chat so we we scored room where you can ask a question all day long and it's so discord the link should be in this description below but we also have a robot in the youtube chat that will help you with the links you will need today so for instance exclamation mark github will give you all the instructions exclamation mark discord will give you the discord link okay i myself will play a little in the chat and give you a couple of comments but rex peter and more could help you with that so interactive we will play a game together and in two minutes i will switch my screen to ask you question live you will participate i will ask you a question and you will see your answer showing on my screen we are live both on youtube and twitch but twitch is really just a backup really we are mostly looking at the youtube and the chat for the question it's a workshop and we are trying to say not a webinar we expect you to do the exercises with us because hey why not you know and you don't have nothing to install for that all the instruction slide are on github for you can download everything and we will use cassandra no sql database of course and you don't have to install it either we'll use a cloud product called astradb which uh this is where cassandra lives okay and if we need to code a little bit we tend to use git pod for this very workshop there is no code so no git pod we can skip that part there is no just to attend the session on youtube but there is better at the end of the session we will give you an assignment some homeworks very easy a very small form three question and you were just showing us that you did the the the end zone with us and we will redeem you this nice batch that you can and you can brag on linkedin or wherever you want with it so pretty cool almost seeing 600 people now having this uh batch so stay tuned stay up to the end and we will explain you how to submit the form in the end i told you about queen with you uh let's discuss all together okay let me ask you at home a few questions so to participate you open a new tab or you use your phone you scan the qr code or if you uh open a new tab you go to mentee.com and you enter the code on screen 57881593 uh i told you about some comments so let me do uh mentee just for you to copy paste the code from the youtube chat okay so uh i think i do a three question in the beginning very fast uh just to assess what is your level what do we expect from the station where are you from there is no competition with these three first questions but at the end of the session again we will play a game together with five or six questions and this time if you answer fast you get more and the better the best among you will get some swag shipped to their location for free so again stay up to the end so let's how many people do we have i see 31 with me right now on 20 and on youtube we are one android so come on i could wait a couple more minutes but not too long we do have a full packed agenda so let's have let's say alf i will write up to 60 people with me with menti so again open a new tab menti.com enter the code and the code is at the top of my screen the code has been provided to you in the youtube chat 5788-1593 okay i see it's not moving any really anymore so 56 57 okay so again in the beginning no uh no competition so we can start and you can catch up okay so the question first question i do have for you today is where are you from here is the map put your location on the map and let's see all together where people are dying from or watching the youtube live from it cannot be more live than this right okay oh look at that distributed across the world so both north america and india um i like always to say thank you for people in asia to join it's maybe it's not being late for you so uh we will try to stay uh on time but sometime we we we are just a bit lonely looks like a few folks from brazil too yeah look at that uh europe as well okay cool see it's live and now we we have 70 people with us on the mentee pretty cool uh so almost everyone joined the 90s that's super cool all right uh question number two is oh oh just did i oh okay so for some reason it was my only question yeah pretty strange i'm pretty sure i had that question where are you from you know and what is the level in cassandra but never mind hey that's the alia of the life no big deal keep this window open at the end and this time i'm sure look at this quiz we will come back here at the end and i will ask you a question uh and if you want fast you get the points and bragging rights so yeah so yeah not sure why i missed those two questions but never mind it's not a big deal you understand how it works how many works so you will be fine at the end so this is no sequel specialization what is apache cassandra uh how the distributed system work and the capital ram create your own partition with cassandra data modeling and playing the game together peter is the guru today we'll do mostly the talks and i will be the spanzer and i think now without further ado i will let peter hang over and i will just uh hiding in the back awesome thank you thank you cedric uh all right let me share my screen okay is that coming through let me see yeah you are now cool you're the best awesome awesome all right uh thanks again for having me yeah so i was just a super quick you know a primer uh interesting uh cedric was uh presenting this at a recent uh she loves data conference uh over the weekend i thought it was kind of interesting as a as a reminder about databases that that they aren't in fact this monolithic architecture right is that you you can actually kind of split apart and look at the separate layers of you know they have this interface right you know they have an execution engine and they all have you know different storage engines and i think looking at these three aspects is kind of important because where the relational databases it's really consistent with no sql databases there's a lot of different approaches to each of these three things um so uh you know sql is obviously pretty familiar to us here um but again you know that has a lot of different implementations under the hood right across your different vendors uh as same as your query planner and then how is the the storage actually accomplished uh you know what is the what is the um storage interface right so uh you know these really very very uh even within relational database vendors right but with no sql no sql technology it's it's really quite different uh across the board in a very different way um relational databases of course obviously very very versatile right i mean you can use them for online transaction processing or online analytical processing um alike but you know they do you know they handle lots of transactions lots of use cases you know but there's a limit to these things uh once you get past a certain level and volume of data uh how do you get a quick response time how do you get uh you know how do you get them to perform uh at low latency for your queries uh so you know the the you know historically the relational databases as we all know right they were designed to run a single machine they came from this era where you know we had single servers that we we care and fed and kept alive uh you know uh and and so you but now you know in modern times you have machines generating data it's not just users and with so many people and applications connected to the you know the entire internet you know the data volume is just going crazy you know i don't know about you but uh folks in the audience just say in the chat like how many devices do you have right you know besides your laptop at home you know do you have a phone do you have a tablet you have a watch i mean if you're if you're like sailor rick you probably have a phone a tablet a watch and then you have a backup watch and then you have a secondary tablet and then you also have a pc so that's like we're coming up on three or four devices per person here so you know with with that kind of level of requirements you know of you know higher data volume uh faster data and and different types and new types of data it sort of mandated a new system and that's kind of where uh no sql came in it is important to note however though that that you know relational databases aren't you know stuck in 2010 right um new sql systems have the same sql interface under the hood but they're trying to figure out how to solve solve the distributed architecture problem right like volt db or cockroach you know they try to address this sort of stuff through partitioning and sharding you know and that can that can get hard uh particularly to operate and troubleshoot but you know what what's interesting is that you got to be careful with that right some of the um some of those approaches to new sql clustering they can change actually the nature of database integrity and how consistency is handled with the distributed asset transaction it's not like the simpler more straightforward acid behavior right on on traditional non-clustered scenarios um so you know back 2010 this is a big problem right for all the web giants you know they're starting to run into limits of relational approaches and suddenly you start seeing no sql you know meetups pop up everywhere um and i think over time i think we all came to understand that it's not nosql it's just not only sql right so there's you know there's uh it's not the negation of sql it's just not only um and then you know right around 2008 you know avinash lakshman and prashant took the dynamo paper and combined some of the google bigquery um or bigtable excuse me concepts and then that developed uh cassandra that was at facebook basically to power the inbox search feature and then facebook released it as an open source project in july 2008 so no sql was born to basically address right this sort of how do we scale out horizontally and not vertically right and um over commodity hardware where data is replicated and and how do we handle a wider variety of modern data types now sure um academically speaking there's lots of more types than nosql databases than what you hear see here on the slide but today these are a lot of the sort of popular mainstream ones i mean you could argue that things like graph databases or maybe even object databases or maybe a little niche um but you know these are the mainstream mainstream ones and i think personally i like to think of nosql as just enough database for a specific developer's use case right where you the developer you're matching the technology with the use case okay um so let's talk a little bit about you know that's a little bit about why you know nosql let's talk a little bit about cassandra itself uh we mentioned it originated facebook and then later apple netflix other companies that also have just tons of data and users but could not compromise on performance and availability started getting involved in the project um so with uh with netflix nearly all of its streaming data is stored in cassandra hundreds and hundreds of clusters 30 million ops per second on the most active single cluster but that's just the most active single cluster like the overall count is significantly higher than that clusters are of course distributed all over the world using multiple data centers and i mean that's not even their biggest you know that's not even the biggest deployment globally apple scale is significantly higher now this photo here from like a conference conference room is is several years old you know i think it's probably up closer to like maybe 200 000 dedicated cassandra cassandra you know servers apple remains one of cassandra's biggest users and i'm very active committers um you know netflix contributed a lot of the ecosystem tooling uh spotify as well and you know they've been very uh active along with contributions from spotify apple and i think instagram right cedric or am i getting that wrong was was instagram also uh yeah yeah at some point naturally yeah um yeah famous i thought castle engineer working in instagram yeah for sure cool cool that's what okay i wanted to make sure i got that right excellent all right thanks so you know what is it right enough preamble um you know why are so many you know leading companies and disruptive technologies adopting this this sort of thing so let's start with the simple what it is right i mean we already talked to teed it up this is a no sql distributed database so we'll focus more on the distributed part here in a second uh but each part of cassandra you know each um each instance of cassandra is called a node right and this contains a full cassandra database each node can handle roughly two to four terabytes of data and thousands of operations per second per core uh and what's hard for so many databases is the ability to handle that level of volume but yet keep the latency for read write requests at uh you know millisecond level of performance you know particularly as you scale up the number of nodes you know uh slow is totally fine for cold storage right but for apps or databases that are customer facing slow really isn't an option people will bail and just go to your competitors now you might notice i didn't give an exact number because it sort of depends on the exact amount of resource allocated to a single node but in general we're talking about thousands of operations per second per core now i said it was a distributed database so sure you could technically run it on a single node uh but that would sort of defeat the purpose of what it's meant to do you know it's a leaderless peer-to-peer system meaning you know any node can do what any other node can do they i'll explain what that means in detail don't worry but this is what helps it kind of deploy across regions and data centers and the automated self healing helps ensure it stays available under pressure it runs anywhere that jvm does so it's platform agnostic and since it's not like a single open source uh single vendor open source project uh and owned by apache software foundation it's it's vendor independent okay cool um so um partitions over distributed architecture is what makes it capable of handling data right and i'm talking you know terra petabyte scale you know um you know you just you know need more data just add more nodes and then data on partitions just gets redistributed automatically for you okay so a single cassandra node like i mentioned can handle two to four terabytes thousands of operations per second per core um you know uh yeah basically sure you know other no sqlc databases are also distributed but often reads or writes can only happen on certain node types i don't know if anyone's familiar with things like elasticsearch you know you have uh uh you know you have masternodes uh you have you know coordinator nodes you have um all different types of node roles and that could be great uh it can also potentially create a bottleneck um similarly you know this sort of leader follower architecture the the leader or the masternode uh can be a single point of failure or you know even if there's multi-master or you know leader election type things going on uh that can impact cluster performances as new leaders are elected um so you know when i said that every node can do whatever your other notes every other node can do you know that's any node can deal with any request right read or write so everyone has superpowers um now with uh with volume and velocity there really aren't any limits with cassandra and you'll notice that sneaky little asterisks down there on the on the bottom of the slide you know we're not trying to be uh dilbert weasel weasley here on yet we're just saying that you know you can get linear scalability out of cassandra no bs it just requires you to get the right data model okay now the cassandra community has lots of resources to help you here but i think simply put data modeling revolves around creating a schema and modeling your data that will distribute evenly across the cluster now and in the future so you get that right and you can get that that kind of that kind of graph that you see there from we borrowed that from the netflix tech blog um they did a benchmark where um you know to prove that adding more servers doesn't have a diminishing point of return right cassandra doesn't do that if you do the data model right they scaled up in this church from 45 to 300 nodes and you see this nice smooth line up into the right you know it doesn't curve off at all right um so if you want the some details on that um maybe you could drop the the chat in the chat yeah youtube chat the link to the netflix blog that'd be cool uh this is now some time ago that this was done but uh you know cassandra has not changed in that regard since this blog was published okay so um i don't know about you but uh maybe you're a casual gamer you like to play games on your on your um on your tablet or your phone once in a while you know you ever run into that moment where it says it's offline for maintenance you know uh gosh right so you know why is that right you know cassandra helps address these uh address those sorts of issues you know in part it's based on this dynamo paper uh which you know is is now several years old it's not dynamodb it's the dynamo paper uh the academic concepts that set a baseline for the highly available system right uh that that you know how it was going to deliver that nearly what 15 years ago right so to cassandra high availability doesn't just mean fault tolerant it also means disaster tolerant you know using multiple regions and data centers availability zones over different regions multiple servers per region or per availability zone etc etc cassandra's replication makes downtime nearly impossible uh we've run into uh clients that have come in that are doing self-managed that are you know uh i can't name the client but one of them came into a company all hands meeting and said that they hadn't crashed they hadn't had a crash in in years i'm just gonna let that sink in years like i i don't know a linux server that can stay up for for years with no leader follower architecture and multiple live replicas in place at any time there's no single point of failure right cassandra automatically understands networks so that all of your replicated data inside of clusters nodes you know um you know they're not put in a vulnerable situation like they're stacked up on the same availability zone of the same server rack right now the driver clients are smart and they're aware of this so they make it transparent to the app developer with things like smart retries and connection reconnection mechanisms and you know they can auto connect auto reconnect to another server or data center because remember any node can do any operation makes it really easy for the for the developer in that regard now operations for a huge cluster can be tiring right um you know one of our uh one of our excellent devrels aaron uh plutz you know used to work at target and he can tell you uh you know what what they went through you know come come uh come holiday shopping time um he's got stories um so you know go for it [Laughter] yeah totally aaron jump in on on chat if you want um but yeah he he lived that but you know because the clusters are you know do have some basic smarts they are able to scale they can change data placement they can recover auto magically right um there's more to operating clusters than than this of course but it's good to know what's already handled by the system right so you're you know you know what to focus on okay you know i gotta understand how to do backups okay i gotta understand how to do consistency checks and and uh reaper and compaction and things like that all right now cassandra's trademark it's hallmark what is what is one of the things it's known best for multi-data center deployments you want to go global you want to go regional you want to go national we got your back uh cassandra's got your back it grants you an exceptional capability for disaster tolerance and you can bring your data close to your users right to keep things low latent for your applications um you know historically companies really only have two options here you know you could go active passive uh or you could go active active um you know a cassandra is an active active everywhere setup you know they're not on standby or otherwise passive right so um you know this you know cassandra's sort of mature and proven replication it's a big part of how it's able to deliver the linear scalability the high concurrency and the extreme high availability that it's known for okay uh it's also not bound to any platform or service provider runs anywhere that jvm does right so you know you can run in a vm on azure aws google cloud you know you can run a bare metal you can run in vmware uh you can run an openstack you know you you name it it's jvm does it right that's the great thing about the jvm um and so you know you can learn this once and deploy it anywhere right your database skills will travel with you no matter what job you go to or you know what corporate architecture decision or vendor has been selected you know you don't have to worry about having to to learn cassandra again or learn another database management system you'll never need to re-architect the system as it grows because you know you can depend on linear scalability okay also it doesn't belong to the you know to anybody right you know any of the commercial vendors it's controlled by a not-for-profit open source foundation called the apache software foundation which you're probably already familiar with if you've ever used things like hadoop or spark or apache kafka apache pulsar zookeeper maven et cetera et cetera um some fantastic excellent excellent industry-leading projects at apache sort of the gold standard in many ways for for open source this protects your skills and investments uh as well as you know allay's corporate concerns in the long term you know because with open source you know it's always possible to read the source code yourself right you really need to understand something and go all the way down the rabbit hole right you can you know you don't have to deal with decompiling you know uh or reverse engineering obfuscated classes or something ridiculous like that the source code is available for you to learn from as well as help you troubleshoot um you know in the event that uh you really needed to do so in anger of course there's lots of experts lots of community lots of support options available um so you know hopefully you never get to that kind of a situation all right so slides yes hot off the slide press let's go let's uh let's do a little bit here say that i'm going to turn the share back to you go for it yeah sure thank you very much and we are totally on time so that's all good so yeah um it's now time for you to get your hands dirty and for everyone to get their hands dirty so let's go with some first lab first end zone so obviously you will need cassandra but as you see before cassandra makes sense to be installed on multiple nodes multiple machines and it can take a while to install it yourself so why not using a service that providing uh cassandra for you just with a single click so today we will use something called astra astradibi askhaddastak.com so get cassandra as a managed service free to use no credit card but you know if you use more than 40 million requests per month maybe we will start asking you for something but you know for now free to use all your students type project could run on it an operation global scale and inside the same platform there is also a streaming solution called apache pulsart we won't use today but hey so this is why we pick astra db today nothing to install very easy to use so how to use it lab1 setup databases okay so um so either iran or rugs will share the github link with everything on the youtube chat you can also use nightbot or exclamation mark github to get access to the readme that i do have here on the left part of my screen introduction to cassandra and here you see first the homework that will be the assignment for you to do at home this week when the workshop is complete to get the badge level of content and here create your astra db instance and on the right part of my screen here i do have the astra platform so the url for today is here so we have a short url for everyone so again exclamation mark and here we go so as you can see to authenticate to astra you can leverage on existing account google or github i will pick google this time and let's do it i time out here we go and here i see rack sharing the link for astra and github thank you all right so when you sign in i already have a couple of databases here so you won't have any uh but so the first things we will ask you to do so looking at the screen over here on the left part is to create a new database you the getting started button that will show up and you will create a new database called workshops and a key space called chat song so each time you need to provide an input in the end zone you can copy paste from the instruction pretty cool right but again ask the question in the chat we will be happy to copy paste the value there as well if you want to okay we are not in a hurry and i will you know let you the time to sign it and create that database okay so create database uh we got a question at the same time so is serverless a database right so serverless could be applied to multiple type of system serverless in my opinion technically speaking mean it can scale to zero if you are not using it it's not running you are not paying for it it's really driven by the cost pay as you use so in the development you might find about uh function functions as a service lambda function google function as a function uh k native it's really when you're not using it there is no server running for it so database same if you are not execute database and it's not really running you won't get charged for it and if you need a lot of the database it will scale as google okay so database name workshops key space name chat song yeah could be based on chat somehow and he provided a region so to to to get a free region a free tier go to the google cloud and pick uh one region that is free okay the the region not free get a small locker over here pick one that is free okay and they are part of the google cloud to unlock the others region if you want to to to do that then this is where i will ask you for for for the credit card but you know the free tier uh have everything you need and you don't have to provide anything okay so my workshop database is now pending i already had a database course workshop so as you can see the database name is not unique what is unique is the database identifier but never mind so as we as peter explained this is a three note cluster three machine it will take a few minutes to start startup okay but uh even then when you do have your database pending please give me a send up in the youtube chat just just to tell me that hey you are okay i'm not and then we can move on oh the key space name is chatsuna did did you say chat sandra yeah i don't know okay if if you want me to spell it in french that would yeah okay etc good good one nice okay okay so uh i can take this question during the database institution and we will go back to slide and peter will keep moving explaining what do you store in cassandra so um yeah we've got some store together what you want to retrieve together so based on what you want to insert so on which node to insert the data so the insertion the writes are totally distributed among the nodes and remember there is no leader nodes no master node so the load is totally distributed then when the requests come to a node it will be uh added to a commit log appended to an existing open file so super fast and then pushing to the memory and then you are the the the client is uh akiti i acknowledge i connect you you switch me back in french now okay this delay there's a layer just sweet there's alert all right okay so the client is acknowledged so it's very fast you come with the right request you know on which note to go immediately pick put the data in a already open file put the data in memory and acknowledge and later either when the memory reach a threshold or you reach a vacation time the what everything in memory will be flush and disk and if things go wrong and the nodes go wrong before the data is flush on disk when you restart the node it will read what is in the commit log and will be able to catch up and will not lose any data this is why it is so fast uh yes so keep seeing some sum up i think we can move on uh so now either you listen to peter going to what do you store in cassandra are you totally a hands-on person and keep going at your pace with the two three before i'm going there as you wish and now peter [Music] sounds good all right one second i'd go for the hands-on option over listening to me personally but hey you know what uh you know we're we'll we'll uh we'll we'll do what we can here um all right let's see is that showing up folks are we are we seeing the holy scripture of cassandra page one paragraph excellent okay so in the beginning because the the lords of the lords and ladies said that all servers are created equal uh so uh basically you know let's let's just talk a little bit more about this active active everywhere idea right why is peer-to-peer architecture important um in distributed databases in particular okay so um you know we look at the traditional kind of leader follower architecture right uh you know you select one server amongst the cluster as a leader that leader is responsible for making decisions on behalf of the whole cluster propagating those decisions to all the other servers every server at startup looks for an existing leader no leader found it triggers an election uh the servers will only accept requests after a leader is successfully elected um i'm going to refrain from making trump jokes while we're reading the rest of this but um only a leader handles the client requests you know if the request is sent to the follower server the follower has to forward it to the leader right they can't they can't deal with it so the leader election within a cluster you know it works well especially with smaller clusters but when you get to big clusters maybe even a couple hundred a thousand nodes you know typically a lot of distributed systems will use an external store like maybe zookeeper or ncd uh because those internally use consent consensus have their own robust consensus algorithms and and provide some linearizability guarantees you know those are great options but you know not all databases distributed databases out there you know are are using things like zookeeper or at cd you know they they often roll their own uh you know and there's a lot of different options for distributed consensus um you know uh raft paxos etc etc etc you know an accord as being a kind of a new one on the scene that we'll hopefully learn more about in the future soon um so the peer-to-peer architecture kind of addresses this this issue uh with this with this setup data is replicated across multiple nodes all of which are equal no single node can bring down an entire cluster a typical peer-to-peer topology you know you've got three or more replicas for each data set so a nosql database like sandra that implements a peer-to-peer architecture provides yet another layer of resilience right for this sort of high volume low latency apps so you as a developer you know you do need to do things like denormalizing data and you're maybe a little bit more aware of the logical and physical data models as opposed to maybe something like a document database uh but you know the payback really comes to you when with the scalability and the availability okay let's talk a little bit more about what i mean when i say data is replicated because obviously distributed consensus is one of the hardest things in computing next to off by one errors uh and naming um so um you know replication factor this indicates the number of nodes used to store uh each partition haven't defined a partition yet don't worry we'll get there um so that means each node is responsible for up to x partition ranges where rf equals that x value um and stored on multiple partitions at the same time so data arrives at a node that acts in the role of coordinator because again any node can be a coordinator so where does the coordinator send the data this time right it's replicated to the to x number of nodes depending on the replication factor the default in cassandra is three um three proves a pattern mathematically three is the magic number it's a good number to use for a lot of reasons uh but that's you know in a very small nutshell how the replication works um in terms of where data is placed so what does this look like in code um cql is a query a data description language for cassandra that is a subset of ansi sql um and is meant on purpose to be very familiar uh to you if you're an sql developer uh syntactically so we use it for both setting up the database uh configuring it and then of course querying and interacting with it so here's how you create a c key space uh in cql wait wait a second hold on what's a key space you might write rightly ask uh key space kind of like a relational schema a schema in relational databases so um loose analogy we'll define that more crisply as we get on um so the key space name you're just saying here in the syntax is population right and then when you specify the replication you can specify a strategy for how you want to distribute the replicas there's a there's some there's some complexity here there's some additional configuration options there's there's lots of handles for you to handle your situation but network topology strategy is a good strategy uh that places replicas in a network aware manner so that's a great starting point here we're going to say we want three replicas in our data center if we had more data centers defined we could uh specify separate rf or replication factors um for each data center by listing them here so you can really control it at a per data center layer but that's what it looks like in in code in in cql um so cassandra wouldn't be a very robust database however if it only stored one copy of a partition in one place if that was the case wouldn't take a lot before a single failure could mean missing data or worse a failed database operation so cue your replication factor you'll notice there's one ring here right and we're denoting an rf of one um which you know basically means one copy of that partition on one node don't worry again we will define what partitions are in detail okay so uh you know that let's say your your your rows with your usa data for new york and los angeles you know that's it's a one copy on that one note now if you increase to an rf of two now i have two rings and i have two nodes that contain the usa uh partition data great similarly you guessed it if i define it you know tune it up to three which is the default now you add another ring and you got three copies on three different nodes so like i said that's the standard and cassandra and it gives a solid balance between availability performance and consistency okay so let's uh dive into a little bit of database internal so it's clear to you how things work uh when we say that data is distributed what does that mean well one of the questions we get asked a lot here uh on these um yes only once is complicated yes exactly [Laughter] uh one of the questions yeah it's complicated tm exactly um one of the questions we do get asked a lot is you know if it's a distributed database i have some set of data how does how does it know how does cassandra know where to put the data or how to get it later when i want to read it so it's divided up into what we call partitions take a look at this example table here in the slide we have three columns uh country city and population country that's our partition key right we'll show you what this looks like in cql as well so don't worry it's not complicated to define now in this case what we're saying is that we're dividing up all the rows here based on the country value now they're multiple rows with the country usa france canada germany since they have the same partition key like cedric was saying earlier uh data gets stored together within a node and data gets automatically distributed around the nodes in the cluster according to that partition key now let's look at this example um we've just the same data we've just broken it out taken the data from that table and distributed it around the cluster visually here uh like it actually happens in in cassandra under the covers so notice how you know rows with the same country value they're grouped together right they're literally stored within the same physical partition on disk so later on if i wanted to know the population for every city in the united states i could read a single partition and you get all your results with an extremely low i o cost right that's part of the the the awesomeness of cassandra is that you know you're sort of storing the data like you want to retrieve it uh when it comes time for your application you're thinking about these queries ahead of time and storing the data exactly like you're going to retrieve it so it's wicked fast okay then you choose your partition t your key for your table cassandra just handles all the rest it does all the data distribution for you okay let me pause there for a second see if there's any questions uh related to the slides uh it doesn't look like it say the wreck if i missed something let me know uh but i'm gonna continue on i think you you're good okay cool all right just check it out okay yeah you're good all right yeah so it's like any other workday then [Laughter] um and if you have questions folks yeah please don't hesitate to drop into the chat if you want to ask about something on the slide or get into more detail okay so what does this look like in cql sandra query language again should look pretty familiar to you if you come from the relational world so we start with the key space you see there's the create table command population is your key space and then the table name is population by country city right uh then we're defining a couple fields and their data types countries attacks cities of text population integer and then here's the interesting part uh this is your your uh this is where we get this is where it gets interesting your primary key partition key and clustering columns so for all tables in cassandra you have to include at least one partition key right in this case we're defining it as country so we're partitioning by country just like we did in the visually in the past couple slides um and so you know anything else that comes after that is a clustering column now notice how you've got this like inner parenthesis around um uh you know country and city here you know denoting that it's kind of a potentially a composite partition key the reason why we're using the parenthesis is in case you you do define a composite partition key where you have more than one value um as your partition key or or you know more than a bunch of clustering columns the parenthesis just kind of tells cql which are the ones that belong to your partition key so it's just a good uh code you know readability and cleanliness habit to include this parenthesis even if you only have a single volume all right then it's very clear which one is your partition key uh and you know if you if you decide to go composite again you know what's partition key and what's clustering columns okay cool so that's what it looks like in cql uh pretty straightforward not all together not terribly different so far from standard sql even though the the primary key concept partition key and clustering columns is indeed a bit different okay now every table um has dedicated or you know or more than one partition key country in this case right now each node has a range of partitions assigned to it the numbers here are just arbitrary to keep the example simple but you know you get the concept these are called partition tokens uh every node is assigned a set of tokens that they own so uh if we look at the orange bubbles here uh on the lower part of the slide if we start the left node you know that owns range 1 through 25 and you know the next one 26 through 50 70 51 through 75 and so on so when you add uh and so on around the ring right and when you add a partition key to a table that value is automatically hashed out using a murmur 3 hash into an integer token value so you know usa new york becomes 59 new york right and that's how cassandra knows where to store and retrieve your data you can think of it as the address of your data almost the the partition key so from left to right here um you know toronto uh montreal number 12 numbers 12 here would go in that first note that owns range 1 through 25 right uh and then who in chat can tell me um where los angeles and new york would go which which node would it be if we're counting from the left with these orange circles so which data which which node starting from the left of these four orange ones would own the new york and los angeles data exactly so salmin you got it yup hey month anjali you got it exactly right exactly right yeah pretty straightforward right i mean this is you know this is why cassandra it doesn't take a lot of computational overhead to figure out where stuff is right because it's a pretty simple um address okay um awesome so why partitioning well you know as i was literally just saying because scaling doesn't have to be hard or shard i see what you did there cedric that's funny um i uh one of my one of my friends had a t-shirt from a conference that says i sharted yeah jokes distributed database jokes okay folks we've got jokes um so you know these volumes of data are just not going to fit into a single server so you have to spread them out over dozens or hundreds of thousands of servers and you know there are some uh you know some of these ways of spreading them out uh are are you know there's always trade-offs right nothing is categorically better than something else but you know the the for cassandra you know this this works our our technology works pretty well um now token ranges get recalculated uh if more nodes get added to rebalance data so in plain english if you add nodes you've got more to spread the load across right so each node can own less and less and less tokens in the range since there's more nodes to show the load if you scale down or scale in depending on what you'd like to say um more partition token ranges will then get repacked into fewer nodes right so if you have a four node data center um what happens if you add a node well okay instead of having to own 25 um a range of 125 you can only own what you know the first node only now has to have one to 20. right similarly if you if you shrink it down oops i've got now i've got to own more token ranges because i've got less less nodes to to do it and spread it across but you know there's no downtime here all of these scaling operations are live at runtime zero downtime you know this this is just the auto magic of of cassandra at work and not something you need to handle or deal with but you know good to be aware of and understand the database internals uh yeah okay cool thanks aaron for answering that question from nariana appreciate it um okay so then you know that now there's let's let's add something else here let's talk about replication factor we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a minute but if you if the default is three these partition token ranges are duplicated and then they're sort of offset across the available nodes in the cluster for fault tolerance and load balancing so you know just as you see here in the picture if you have an rf of one okay you have one set of data across four nodes if you have an rf2 you have two sets of the data just distributed differently right because it would be sort of silly to put them on the same node because right you know for you know then it wouldn't be fault tolerant um and nor would it would it load balance as effectively so you can see here it's the same data it's just kind of offset and spread differently across the notes cool so a little bit more about replication factor and how data is stored and retrieved in cassandra um let's start with the default which is the rf or replication factor of three so if we want to write some data you know maybe this um usa uh partition from earlier you know the request comes in a node is is you know chosen to handle that request we call that a coordinator node it's it's any node can be a coordinator right because remember any node in cassandra can accomplish any operation right uh you know it's just it's just the no it's just the name given to the node that's acting in that role at the moment you know at the moment that that request comes in okay so you know this this data you know let's say 15 you know the integer 59 comes in um or maybe that's a partition token um and a set of rows but anyway um all the nodes in the ring can handle that operation so great uh you know let's handle it hand it to 67 83 and 0 because it's been needs to be replicated three times right because we've set the rf of three so that means there's three copies of this particular um partition identified by 59 here in the cluster okay cool pretty simple concept we don't need to you know belayer it um and then that that 59 again that's just the partition token right that was hashed out of the partition key for the data we're writing um yeah so uh the coordinator just basically forwards that database right operation to all three notes each node stores a copy pretty simple okay now each node and the cassandra drivers themselves as well know the token allocation in the cluster uh so it means it's token aware so your app can you know via the driver clients can can contact almost literally any server and still get the right answer right um again part of this power of all nodes you know being able to do all operations so let's talk a little bit more about globally distributed what does that mean uh we meant we kind of hinted at this earlier that the cassandra is well known for this um so with this concept of data centers uh together with replication and all the other things we've talked about it makes it pretty easy to deploy cassandra in any region or multi-region the last one i think is particularly powerful because uh you know most databases you can deploy a single region anywhere globally right that's just the cloud these days but a single database that spans multiple regions or a multi-region database that means you need to to have replication that works and is fast and is available and all those other adjectives right um you know and since cassandra runs anywhere that the jvm does you can run it on any infrastructure provider public private you know hybrid cloud multi-cloud you know all of those things you know bare metal you know all those all of those work um so you can most you can bring the data to your users into your applications in the region that they're at meaning that latency will be low for for your users that when they when they're interacting with asking for data from the database and that's very very very important yet you're not sacrificing consistency uh availability or scalability okay so folks uh in the in the youtube chat what is the biggest and we have not given away this answer previously so this is a real question warning this is an actual question that will cause you to think what is the biggest issue with replication go ahead and respond in the youtube chat what's the biggest problem with replication in general not with like just cassandra you know with any right okay yes uh tp got it first although vino you you you hit it but just sideways you hit it from the from the cassandra per particular perspective i i was kind of getting at what's the general issue with with uh with it and you nailed it and everyone's got it yeah exactly right yep data consistency that that is the issue how do you deal with the fact that things are spread across a network right this is the the existential question of of distributed computing um uh so you know so many things in cassandra are aligned around multiple layers of defense so many things in cassandra are lined around making you know mitigating that that risk right so let's look at a scenario here uh this is a default replication factor three scenario right so that's why you see three arrows going there uh from from the new value of thirteen dollars right new value is written you know let's say uh um uh you know cli writer one writes this you know new variable you know x is equal to 13 right since the rf is three the write request is sent to all three servers now let's say it's successful on server one and two but it fails for server three there in orange now if later your client your app you know via the driver your client reads the value of x from server 1 and server 2. well it gets the latest value of x is 13 because server 1 and server 2 have that latest value now let's say that another client from a separate application triggers a read for x but server 1 and server two you know some disaster happens that you know they're they're aliens fly in from you know out of town uh there's an earthquake tornadoes something happens and server one and server two are down temporarily so that means you know client one needs to read it from server three and that has the old value for x of 12 bucks so c2 client two gets that old value uh even when you know uh see the first client got the latest one so you have two consecutive reads here from two different apps that you know basically say wait a second the latest value is is it's not getting the same answer right now sure once server 3 came back up you know the the the earthquake was healed the tornado abated subsequent reads would give you the latest value sure right now that assumes you know of course some sort of read repair or anti-entropy repair processes running in the background which of course it is with cassandra but we'll get to that later you know the rest of the servers will get that latest value as well eventually right this is the this is the eventually consistent um way um q mandalorian gif someone um but there is no guarantee provided by the storage cluster right that that that demand that once a particular value is visible to those clients all subsequent reads are gonna continue to get that value even if it fails so how do we deal with this potential inconsistency now distributed consensus i'm going to preface this by saying distributed consensus algorithms are some of the most difficult things in all of distributed computing so it requires a multi-layered uh sort of defense you know much like much like security does right you know you have a security posture you have multiple layers of security why because security is hard because and and people are trying to break it um people might not be actively trying to break distributed computing but it is indeed very difficult so what do we mean by that layered self-defense right okay let's look at one strategy to avoid potentially inconsistent state like we we can call this hints now let's imagine we want to write some data let's look at that usa partition from earlier as the request comes in right and you know it's chosen to handle it acts in the coordinator node role uh and then um it is replicated since it's an rff3 it's replicated to node 67 83 and 0 there okay great with me so far excellent all right now then one of those notes catches on fire and it's down right so we've only got two of the three um sources available now we have this mark uh this ability called a hinted handoff uh it's a persistent data consistency mechanism that's built directly into cassandra so when a node goes down the remaining nodes will save any mutations in this case a write for those nodes locally as a hint uh and then the hinted handoff makes sure that that right operation gets to all the nodes that hold that those replicas now hints are stored for about three hours by default so if the node isn't able to come back within three hours you know either you need to trigger a repair process or you know worst case you could destroy the node and bring it back into the cluster as a new one which would sort of refresh and rebalance all of its data from a known good cluster state okay right sorry uh the the the uh i failed you on the animation there um but yeah this is one of the many sort of robustness features right that's built into the core of cassandra there's all kinds of other things you know um you know if you if you catch up with uh aaron plutz he'll tell you all about you know his adventures with no tool uh there's reaper uh you know you can set transaction um consistency levels on a per transaction basis which is pretty mind-blowing when you think about it and a lot more okay uh now let's talk about uh cedric's favorite uh section cap theorem what does that mean well uh eric brewer from google defined this a number of years back uh and it has since ruled many people's worlds uh in in the cloud and in distributed computing so uh it basically it talks about the trade-off between availability consistency and partition tolerance okay what does that mean in plain english well availability is hey you ask for data you get an answer you know is the service up not making any claims here about whether it's the right answer just does an answer come by you know uh does an answer come back to me consistency meaning do you get the same answer from all the servers in the cluster that would be in a position to answer that question and then partition tolerance is your abilities for a distributed system to survive in network failure suddenly one side of the network or one node can't get through the network to the to another part of the to another another part of the cluster okay uh put another way right uptime you know you you uh availability is uptime um if a failure of one or even multiple servers you know is leads to no response uh you know or leads to uh you know leads to a response your system is considered available right consistency is you know what i was saying before no stale data you ask for something you get the most recent value right uh if you're if you get a different answer uh or older information is returned your system is not in a consistent state um and then partition tolerance like i said you know the the ability for uh you know nodes in the network to suddenly you know or the communication link is severed suddenly uh part of the the the network is unavailable and you know a half of the cluster can't talk to the other half of the cluster or something you know horrible like that uh that is one of the more difficult things to deal with and most of a huge part of the focus of what you know cassandra you know does not compromise on um is is really tries to avoid you know the the issues caused by partition tolerance and network unavailability at all costs so it's important to remember that this is talking about a cap theorem this whole conversation is really about what happens in a failure mode when everything's working fine you can be consistent available and partition tolerant and you know all at the same time great you know things are things are working great it's when there's a failure condition that that you have to you know potentially choose two out of these three things unfortunately you can't be in that little sweet spot right there in the center in black right um uh you know you have to make it sure you you have to make a choice there every distributed system not just cassandra right distributed applications distributed databases anything that's distributed has to make this choice um so you you have to choose two out of the three uh and like i said you know cassandra really strives to avoid inconsistency above all else right so in a failure scenario cassandra's design you know design philosophy was that you can configure and choose your compromise you can choose your own adventure here to either be consistent and partition tolerant or available and partition tolerant right um so uh you know different systems different databases they make different compromises uh and they have different design points but that's the way that cassandra works so that's why there's some confusion out there um sometimes as to you know often people when encountering a new database will will ask you know hey is it you know what where is it on the cap theorem you know is it is it ap or is it cp or or something else you know and there is a little confusion out there in the market you know is cassandra an ap or cp database well yes is the answer it's both it's configurably consistent right but it can it cannot be both at the same time right it has to be one of the other in any given query uh now since as i said cassandra you know aver prefers availability slightly over consistency because it's an eventually consistent database but you get the flexibility to continue the consistency depending on your use case and at the per transaction or per query level um okay uh now um the consistency level is one of those tools that we you know the system uses one of those layers of defense along with hints that it uses to um you know ensure uh consistency uh and you can set the consistency level um you know that that you want to have and that basically defines how many confirmations that the client the driver client your application is going to wait for before you know the the response is dispatched back to your client and you know a definitive answer is delivered okay now uh like i said it's configurably consistent right on a per query per transaction level which is awesome uh so you can you can set it here and there's a number of different consistency level settings um there's some more advanced ones like local one or local quorum or each quorum that that i won't cover here i'm just going to cover some of the basics um just to give you the because this is an introduction to cassandra there's there's lots more enabling material here on our youtube channel uh that get you into the details here now we often recommend that write operations um oh excuse me sorry i'm jumping ahead um right uh so mixed consistency levels are are good right it doesn't have to be one way for the entire you know life cycle of your application for everything that your every query that your application could potentially execute right um you can also mix it you know even within a single um you know a single aspect of the application so one best practice is that you know you could right you could do write operations at a quorum uh but for reads you could maybe be more flexible and you could try maybe read it again at a a consistency level of one or or two now what does this mean really let's kind of examine and get into it what is the impact here during the write and the read of data what does this mean okay so let's look at the simple case consistency level one now in this scenario your replication factor is three so you're copying data to three notes right you're copying a single partition to three nodes um and let's you know client comes along writes some data to a node the request is routed to those uh the correct replicas if it needs to be um asynchronously and then you know concurrently so three separate network calls to these three replicas now the first answer that comes back from either of those three notes that indicates success great we're good right uh the response is returned to the client as definitive you know we're we're you got your you got your data back okay now let's look at another way to get strong consistency using quorum which is uh often what we recommend uh a write operation with quorum now only requires a response from the majority of the nodes available now in this case we set rf is three so what's a majority two right two out of three is a majority um and then we can also read consistency level quorum you know we can also read using that quorum consistency level we're guaranteed to get the most recent data as long as we can kind of guarantee the overlap between reads and writes we know we're going to have a strong consistency here great now all is another interesting one uh a write operation with us a consistency level setting of all requires responses from all three of the nep replica nodes because again rf was set to three uh you can also read not just write operations but you can read using a consistency level of all and then you're guaranteed to get the most recent data yeah all right now it might be tempting to think that the consistency level all is just hey this is you know we should live here right why not why do anything other than that well that's great but you know when everything's in sync and everything's working correctly but you know remember cap theorem right it's a it's as as general admiral akbar famously once said it is indeed a trap right captain room is always there in a failure condition so if you choose consistency it is at the expense of availability so you know that mean you know one if one node goes down the request fails right so that's not you know that may not be good okay now uh one trick that uh that has kind of emerged uh you know over over the over time is that you know how to use these two things together right if you need immediate and strong consistency uh what we typically recommend to cl our customers and our users is is uh you know that the simple formula here the consistency level of right plus the consistency level of read should be greater than the replication factor okay wait a minute so what does that mean um so if if reads and writes are set that way you know you're you're gonna be immediately consistent even if you lose one server so rf is three in this example right so uh consistency level is is quorum for write and read uh in this case i guess it's set to quorum so if rf is three that's two for each right so consistency level of right is two consistency level is r is two which is equal to four needs to be greater than replication factor which is set to three which is currently not the right not not set that way right so if you wanted let's say just to play this out immediate consistency with five nodes an rf of five and a quarant setting for read and write you would need to set your rf to what to get immediate consistency anyone if anyone wants to guess and try to beat me to it if you want an immediate consistency with five notes and a quorum setting what would you need to set replication factor to to get immediate consistency that would be okay i guess maybe we do a mentee for this at some point but that would be rf is four right because uh or actually wait did i get that right cedric now wait a minute it would need to be higher than that wouldn't it immediate consistency with five nodes would mean three plus three it would need to be seven okay so it's based on the replication factor not the number of node so let's say the replication factor is three you read yeah perhaps is the majority of the node so two over three so you get two response among those two response you are sure that one of them is the latest and and you get rid yep the other side same when you write you write with cohab chrome majority of the node so two over three okay so consistency level to right two consistency level to read two two plus two is more than the replication attacker three good to go with that anytime you read something you are sure to get the latest version now let's say and you talked about that the replication factor is five for some reason well you read with toronto so coron for five is three you get the majority of the node and you write with coroma as well three over five three plus three is six five you're good to go that's more related to the replication factor rather than the number of node right okay so i just i was looking at the the greater less than sign and i read it backwards so okay got it all right pretty simple cool thanks for that and then let's talk a little bit more about tables and partitions so hopefully that's clear um uh thanks for that cedric and then yeah let's talk a little bit about tables and partitions very briefly we're not going to get into this too deep uh because this should be pretty familiar to everyone that's worked with a relational database or g is even a spreadsheet or a google sheet for for god's sake so uh you know a cell right as we all know intersection of a row and a column right you know you you know what this is this is what's uh holding your data um and then a row being a single structured data item in a table so uh you know we've got what four cells here one john doe wizardry right they're all related however together in a single row now in cassandra partitions are the basic physical unit of access so this is how as cedric was saying earlier you know data is stored together on disk right so to the very right uh that's this way sorry zooms a little bit of a mirror here um all the values are wizardry right except for one um so in this example we've set um department as our partition key right we're partitioning by department so i've three rows here and given that each one of the three rows has the same partition wizardry key they're all stored in the same physical partition right so they're stored together it stores together what it retrieves together so if i was to say select star from this table where department equals wizardry i would get back all these values all right now if we look at the table that has multiple partitions again three rows here that hasn't changed but let's look at department so department is wizardry dark magic and devrel right um and then uh uh and so even though you have three rows and you have a single logical table you know you would say to select star from this table you would get back those three rows with the wizardry dark magic deference but you'd be accessing three separate physical partitions in the cluster and that's what i think is you know it took me a moment to get my head around when i first joined the company was that you know you're sort of aware of this network topology but in the way that you structure your your your the layout of your data uh it does have a relation to this you know it has an implication that what happens underneath the covers with the network right um and so by being aware of that uh you can really get uh and designing appropriately for it you can really get all the promises uh that cassandra delivers um you know with no compromises uh as long as you're you're kind of doing things that are aware of that so uh cedric why don't you show well maybe we can do a hands-on and uh we'll show get people hands on keyboard and show people how easy it is uh to create tables why don't you take the screen share exactly i'm sure now people want to play more with the database so but you know it's really um useful and important to explain how the the architecture works under the hood to explain how the database can recover and can scale easily because then you will realize that the tables the data model is really based on uh how cassandra works okay so lab2 create table could be pretty fast so let's see back to my screen oh i was uh signing out uh okay let's sign in again and let's go to big two create tables so the first things that in this ask is uh navigate to cql console okay so cql stands for cast android query language as peter stated before and so i select my database here in the list and i'm look i'm looking for this tab sql console over here and it will pop up this uh shell cql sh the shell for sql no need to provide any user password sso it's done so we told you inside a single case you can have multiple key spaces key spaces logical grouping of table same as oracle schema and the good pattern when you implement an app would be one app per key space because this is also at the key space level that you will set up the replication factor the rf so let's see here if i describe the key space you see all my key spaces over here okay and summer system uh for internal news that can somehow us the one that we will use is shot summer chat okay um so here um maybe i can show you just describe key space is right in space chat song as of now it's empty so the command that has is returned is just the command to create that key space and here just to show you that in astro the replication factor is three and as of now you are working with a single data center but you can have multiple data center if you wish and have data distributed across the world okay so what i'm doing now is use chat somewhere so just to change the the the space name and not having to provide the prefix chat somehow in any of my requests the shell know that now i will work inside that key space okay so let's create a as you can see very close to sql the type are not exactly the same so here we do have text instead of varsha uuid for unique identifier and the primary key is compo it does have multiple parts one part of the primary key is called the partition key to say how do we distributed the data among the partition among the nodes so all the token slides that peter presented before but here it's the same yeah that's true you can have table with where partition key is the same as primary key that will mean the unicity of a record pulled by the primary key is totally defined with the single field so it will be both partition key and primary key you will have a single recall per partition totally fine so here i'm doing that and see i do also creative not exist so there is this nice uh check before and now if i describe the table or test table i will see my table users okay great maybe one one another one i could explicitly create a describe table and provide the name of the table it will show more info regarding that table so exactly what we have design color name primary key and everything and also a couple of metadata that the system has put for me but that you can customize if you want like the compression the compaction strategy the time to leave and you know you could have access to those steps but you know not in introduction to customers but yeah for you to know that's metadata are set for you okay so now let's uh describe table what i can do now is create table for post so post by user and post by room it seems weird right now but it will be explained on the next slide so here we will have exactly the same table look at that user id post id room id room id post id user id text so two tables to save the same data with the same fields so what is the chance beside the name of the tables that's the way the keys are built here the primary key is user id post id user id is the partition key data is distributed among my nodes the using user id so if i want to avoid to do a full scan cluster when i look for this table i always need to provide the value user id in the where clause this is how cassandra will know where to look so associated with one table you have a set of valid queries and if you need two queries to request against the same data set it's very likely that you will need multiple data a mutual table the data is replicated in multiple tables the philosophy of cassandra's storage is cheap and this is a trade-off to be able to do millions of requests per second even if you have terabyte of data this is what the relational database was not able to do even with the olap strategy now you save the data in tables that are optimized for one particular request and now if i describe the table here you go you will see my three tables over there and uh with that i think we can go back for the last uh part or last uh session part a slide start sounds good before going to the last lab and uh yeah over to you peter thanks all right yeah i i love your point about the the full table scan the dreaded words that uh any any uh any cassandra user uh will ever hear you know if uh if if you haven't sort of gotten the the the idea behind it yet you know that that is something to be avoided right you know that there's a lot of you know by defining those queries up front like say that was just showing you you know you're you're storing data like it's supposed to be retrieved uh it's all contiguous it's super optimized for for reads but it's not you know for analytics right it's not meant to sort of hey i'm going to ask you arbitrary questions you know because then you get at that full table scan you you want to you want to have them you want to have them known up front okay so let me share uh this is that showing up the agenda slide now we cool awesome all right so let's talk briefly about data modeling uh and this just kind of this you know good segue from from the point that we were just talking about here right so that uh you know you're you're much like a relational database you know you need you need to have a schema defined up front before you can do anything right before you you know you can't just it's not like a document database where you can just throw a json document document at it and not have any pre-work or pre-thought gone into it you're creating a structure for your data to be organized into so that it can be uh you know written and retrieved efficiently right so very similar to relational data modeling um you know not quite the same but similar uh we're going to start off with you know your data we're going to analyze your data set we're going to look at your uh you know and you know you're going to look at your relationships your properties your entities in a relational database and then you generate your data bottle and then you know you you normalize it so but then from after you know that from the application standpoint from the developer standpoint if you're using a relational database then what right well then you take a look at you know i don't know whatever er diagram any relationship diagram or you know whatever you designed you know whether that's you know through your dba or your data architect or whether it's you yourself doing it right and then you're using that as your source of truth you know that would determine well okay what queries does my app need right and then okay how do i write how do i write those how do i determine them um how do i design them right what tables you know what i need to join that sort of thing so that's kind of how it works on a relational data modeling right you're you're you're thinking about your data first then you're modeling it then you're thinking about the application right so with cassandra it just whoop flip it around right so you start everything from the application perspective so watch what happens right this is it's actually ridiculously intuitive when you start to think about it like this like what query is that click on the user interface going to trigger or what what query is that api call going to need right so we're going to start with the app workflow we're going to start with the application we're going to use that to generate our data model and our queries and everything and then we apply data so you might be thinking well wait a second does that mean i need to come up with my query ahead of time well yes actually it does that's one of the reasons why it's so efficient and again why you don't you know typically use uh cassandra for analytics or ad-hoc query workloads right because you're defining the stuff upfront that's why it's so fast so we're going to go through this process right now and show you how it works but once you've done it like two or three times it's really quite intuitive um so this is the overall kind of flow uh workflow of what we're gonna do right so we're gonna start with the app workflow uh and and then figure out our entities and our relationships then we figure out our conceptual data model and then we figure out our app you know our app workflow if you if you've done any kind of work with a relational database before in the past you know you're going to re recognize a conceptual data model this is this shouldn't be terribly foreign to you no no pun intended with foreign keys um so the application workflows you know that's really what is your user doing is they're working in your app you could literally draw this in a figma or a whiteboard or you know a cocktail napkin you know this is what happens in the user interface or you know if you're developing an api what api calls are being made now we're going to take uh the app workflow and the conceptual data model and then we're going to use that to start mapping um those to our logical data model then we refine the logical data model a little and then we optimize it a little bit and if we need to we end up with a physical data model okay so that's the high level process right just kind of describing the overall the overall flow before we dive into specifics steps um and then you know as it says right there very helpfully at the bottom of the slide one way you can boil out a lot of what i just said into a very quick minomic um is you know a query per table right is a is a is a good way to think of things okay so this is our conceptual diagram um let's say we're doing like a youtubey kind of application or a video you know website of some sort right um so you know in this case we've got users we've got videos uh so we look at the videos what are some of the attributes of videos well we've got comments uh users can also make comments so there's a relationship there so if you look at users and videos you have a relation between users commenting on videos and videos being commented on by users so um but uh it's interesting to notice that both you know users and videos have this set of attributes users have email they have an id videos have a title description so on and so forth now by using your erd or entity relationship diagram you can start to map out what those relationships are going to look like right okay so relatively straightforward let's move on to the app workflow so this is kind of your uh you know again we're sort of thinking like a youtube or a video watching application just as an example um in the first use case you know you're opening up a user profile okay you know every app ever invented has some concept of a user profile right so nothing nothing too crazy their user logs in maybe opens up their profile and now they want to see all their activity right in this case for a video website that's comments right across all of their videos right so uh like uh you know like when you logged into linkedin or facebook or whatever and you kind of just you know see your activity feed and all your recent activity of all the stuff you've done lately so you want to find the comments related to the target user using its identifier again probably like a user id or something so and usually you want to show the most recent ones first so you want to see things sorted you know in time order now the second use case video opens uh uh excuse me a user opens video page so they're gonna go to some specific video page right to view it and they probably want to see all the comments that everyone has ever made about that video so the first workflow if we boil it out the kind of attempted pseudo code here you're doing what you're finding comments related to target video using its identifier most recent first uh and then um yeah um so for the second one um for some video that you click on you want to see all of its comments from all of the users identifying excuse me uh using the video identifier some key and then again showing all those comments most recent first yeah you know peter just two two different screen from the youtube so the first screen is your home page as a user when you sign in you want to see all your comments and the second is uh just a video page where you want to see all the comments for video and of course you want to see the latest at the top of the screen perfect exactly yeah um thanks for giving a visual to a better visual for it no doubt and then yeah it's like if you okay so the next thing you can do is some pseudo code right we almost did that you heard me doing it verbally just a second ago right so you're finding all the comments posted for a user with a known id on that um on that profile page that cedric just mentioned and then on the video watch page you're finding all the comments for a video with a known id showing the most recent first right okay so now let's bring it to a logical data model all right uh if we start you know we're gonna do our two we're doing a query per table right so we have two tables uh if we start on the left here with comments by user so we've got user id which has a k annotation after it that means it's a partition key right and then as you remember from before what are the components of your primary key it's a partition key and or clustering columns zero or more clustering columns uh the k as i said indicates your partition key and then the c means a clustering column and then the arrow indicates the sort order so what this says right is that um with user id i want to again you know uh partition by user uh by user id and then i'm ordering on creation date and command id pretty simple right uh and so uh again for comments by video um let's let's this would be the table for the video view page that say that rick was talking about um now i'm going to partition a little bit differently um i'm going to partition by video id which has the k after it and then i'm going to sort by creation date and comment id so again we do all this you know you might notice that some data is going to get repeated here right because things are denormalized right and as we mentioned a couple times cassandra uses a denormalized data model um and and again you know that is strictly for optimizing read performance okay so we can now map this out to a logical data model great excuse me physical data model pardon me that was the logical data model um so uh if we kind of go back here what changed between these two slides i'm going to do a visual diff besides the the the different data types here being filled in what what's different so we lost a column here now because this might be an optimization as we start to map out our types as part of the physical data model so you know we had this comment id but it got collapsed down to a time uuid see before here we had creation date and comment id now suddenly it's just time uuid why is that well uh we because uh we have this optimized field type in cassandra a time uuid it's a combination of a timestamp and a unique user identifier that you can put in a single field right so it's just a nice little optimization that's available in cassandra so why don't you use it right now do you have to you know if you implemented your data model like you like i showed here on the previous slide would there be a problem no right this is just an optimization we're just trying to give you the feeling for things that you might that are available to you in the cassandra's uh you know data types that that you might be able to optimize a little bit more when you're moving from the logical to the physical data model okay so just summarizing again you've got a user id that's cast as a uuid type field comment id is a time uuid and then we combine you know we combine that created out and comment id into that one field um video id again uuid comment is text all right so we're we're pretty much there now it's time to write code you know uh optimize is is an optional step um and so you know if you map this out to your tables it's pretty quick right um you know you're saying basically you know uh create table here um you know you've got your user id and then your comment id that's your your column here if you look down in the primary key here for your first table up at the top um and yeah and then you're saying you know you want the you want it ordered by comment descending right so that when you read that data out you don't need to do a sort in your application logic or your or your uh user interface tier or something like that you don't need to pay the cost of ordering it read time again you know once again always storing data the way you're going to use it you know we're saving it that way on disk um so it's already in time ordered format so whether it's three nodes or 3000 nodes that is part of what helps you get all of the promises that that cassandra makes right and and get all that value okay so that's just the overall process that's it you start with your app workflow you work those out you use those to generate your pseudo queries your pseudo tables and then you start to kind of refine and notice that because it's a denormalized data model you don't have joins and everything like that that the queries are actually really simple and then you can just take that to generate your query code again good rule of thumb is a query per table so if you do one query for one table you're going to be off to an absolutely fantastic start with your cassandra application all right so let's uh let's go back to another lab see either you want to grab the screen share back for me and let's do show people how easy it is to create read update and delete yeah you know let's let's do it um but you know um you might ask the question if there is no join how do you do the data modeling for one too many or many too many you know if you are familiar with rational model well yeah yeah with what peter just shown uh a comment could be uh you know user can have multiple commands video can have multiple commands it's many too many you create x table where x is the number of queries you need okay so let's go to these lab number three create read update delete operation so then you can do clear here uh the table are created we can go and start inserting some data so insert into first command so i'm here step 3 3a create or insert data so here i will insert providing the values so uh very very similar to sql here you know just provide inserting two table name column name values all the values i will mention that uuid is a type there is no quote around the uuid and i will do it three times so you might ask why a uuid and not an integer for instance well let's go back to how do you want to store an integer that is unique in the table you know with relational database you are using something called auto increment in oracle you are using something like sequences you just ask the sequence give you the next value what do you do when you do that you need to stop the word and ask every node what is your latest version get that and work with it so there is a lock and with cassandra we hate that so instead of that we are using the uuid approach where where you need an identifier you don't need to sync with anybody just create a uuid out of the blue because we know that uuid are super unique they are so long they are probably more uuid than atom in the universe this is where it's come from not to have to block multiple nodes to get that ideas okay so i do have a couple of uh can i select from users a no clauseware not very good query because i'm doing a full scan of my cluster i did not provide any partition key so here i got it so now if i insert into post by user one two three one two three let's do it so inserting to those three table so post by user only post by user for now and post by room it's coming so same data but inserted in the circle here i go so sit to copy paste i'm using this uh icon over here it will copy the the the cell in the clipboard and i'm able to copy paste from one screen to another okay so to insert provide the values you need to provide every field from the primary key but all the others field could be let blank okay adding a column letting a column null in cassandra has just no cost on the country are relational you know i don't know if you have uh add a new column in a relational database even if all the existing values should be set to null it take a while because each field needs to be updated it's row its record needs to be updated cassandra is not the case if you do not talk about one column it will not be used or save on disk okay so now let's read okay read all the rows again that's cool for development never do that uh in production okay you always want to do work clothes and always provide the partition key i will keep saying that for the next 20 minutes and then you you can go back and do something all right so speaking of where clause remember it was posed by user and the schema post by user who posed by user the user id is the partition key so it needs to be in the workloads let's do it okay and you can see that partition id does not ensure unicity inside one partition there are multiple records you save together what you want to retreat together it's kind of doing the group by when you save and not when you select okay so same for post by room i select from the room and then for a second query i provide a room id because for the second query now roommate is my partition key if i try to select not on the room id but let's say on the user id in table two what will happen user id i mean why not it does have the same data the same record right so let me try that error that expected you try to select on something that is not part of the partition key so let's imagine that your cluster have a thousand nodes which is not stupid look at the numbers on netflix and and apple so it will ask every single of the 1000 nodes do you have this do we have it to wait eventually it will be slow and this is why you always need to provide a partition key in the workloads okay all right uh here with all the data convert post id to timestamp so you can use some function to convert what you retrieve a few function on dates and you can use some label so here instead of having the post id here i will move that as a date and here so the post date is there so whoa whoa whoa so we bring a an identifier and we were able to get out a date from it and the reason is if you look at the table schema where is my table schema it's a time you you id it's an identifier that's also hold a time step and this is one of the optimization that you can do okay so we got our few valid queries i propose a queries that is not valid there is a way to make it work or at least something with non-predictable response time but it's not recommended so i will try not to use it in front of you okay so now when it comes to updates very close to sql so update set okay command to execute update set what you want to update where and for the work close now you need to provide the full primary key right you will update one record so here we go updating one record getting the updates of this record so one one one one one one and post id ah so it was this guy so second row on my screen that we updated okay and okay inserting two let's do it and now we got a new one over here oh is it a new one look at that i still have four and before i had four what's the problem you did an update did i did you yes i did in cassandra this is one way to write super fast it will just it will just override what's in the database and it does not care of what if something was there before or not that's a default behavior you can make sure that the record was not existing before using something called lightweight transaction or lwt but you know two hours are not enough to to cover that but this is also one way in cassandra to go fast every insert isn't upset it's written on it's written on cassandra's tombstone jokes and removing data you know speaking of tone stone wow exactly uh good good timing so now if i want to delete something from the database i will delete from uh and i will uh okay let me copy that when you delete obviously now uh you only get three items cool but what you need to realize them is a append only system what is what what cassandra actually does was to create a new row in the table stating that a this one should not be visible anymore and this row technical row is called a tombstone as peter stated so let's say you're running out of space in your cluster and you say sure i will delete a couple of rows it will be even worse because you will keep adding in your table new row stating that a it should be deleted it should be deleted it should be deleted so there are ways to delete the records like truncates or deleting by part and then making sure that you remove the tombstone immediately all right so see create read update delete delete but you know you need ready to know your queries in advance to shape the table okay last 10 minutes let's see if you guys were very focused and listened to everything that mostly peter said you know i was just uh doing some exercises here so i propose everyone so what i'm to do a quiz what up what i'm taking away from all this is that inserting null values is a great best practice right is that what you're saying never do that and you know all right oh that wasn't the quiz that wasn't the quiz okay um we will finish on time so uh going back to mentee.com and uh here i'm showing again the code it does not change or the qr code if you join the session in the middle and you are not already in mentee open a new tab go to mentee.com enter the code on the screen uh the code will be uh the the code is also in the in the youtube chat for you to copy paste and the game so a little bit of housekeeping youtube can have a delay that's how the streaming works and the fastest you answer the more point you get as long as the the response is the good one so when the newcomer questions show up look at your phone first this is where the question will show up first again youtube has a delay so let's wait for you so how many survivor do we have for foreign sessions let's see youtube tell me we are about where are you youtube youtube youtube 70 okay so let's wait to have what 50 50 in the game and let's start okay okay it's moving 44 yeah i don't want to make people who stay there to the end not wait too too long so let's get running uh i i'm not even sure how many questions i do for you okay let's let's let's do it ready okay eight quick yeah we will be on time i didn't expect eight questions okay okay let's get ready uh one or fifty we do have the name so ten more seconds it will be too late nine seven six five three three two let's go okay question number one is how many master nodes does cassandra cluster need at least three block cluster 3 per dc enough to make contain consistency not a single one cassandra is decentralized hey hey so indeed most of you i did correctly so cassandra is a masterless system no master decentralized so no need for any master so looking at the leather board who was the fastest among you i want to see your names oh all right look mark mark r is looking like he's taking the lead is coming in on a hot second but look at that so three points that just nothing like like yeah wow 30 minutes ago come on nothing okay seven more questions to go question two and fast to get the most points how data is being distributed all data is replicated to each server by partition range of partition per node with address locators using post mail man what's the point to replicate your data everywhere all right indeed you shard partition your data and save a range of partitions per node excellent okay at the level yeah it's like people were paying attention this is great vote goat is i'm pulling for vote go personally oh yeah oh there we go vote go to the top oh yeah all right excellent username you are to be commanded sir or madam okay okay i will vote for the people who asked the most question in the youtube chat okay question number three are you ready let's go which replication factor is recommended oh this one is a speed question 1.5 3 15 42 and you know i don't know how you can be half replicated you know just one arm or i don't know all right it's three inches oh everybody was cool right too easy consistency level was all on that one okay so mark was the fastest for the second time but you know enough to be on the podium but uh vote goat lead the way question four what is the strategy that's a good question what is the strategy it's a gateway to the star it's a local in memory version of cassandra it's cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a development tool in france it's a butter brand really interesting yeah it is also a movie you know no other star is the movie yeah oh yeah it's cassandra as a service in the cloud so look at literally the worst brad pitt movie ever made yes that one that's right okay vodka joy iggy pranoti all right all right but france was the fastest this time okay question five everybody's ready let's go what is a primary key same as partition key it's the main house key does not apply to no sql databases uniquely identify a row it's a column in the partition key oh yes you had a couple like false positives yeah this is a little this is a little harder all right this is good yeah indeed primary key is really there to identify the unicity of a row a record and it's composed with both partition key and clustering column but we did not really cover today the clustering column so yeah it was not that hard okay the man's cool oh wow yeah seems like it was tricky not everyone got it correct oh seems like vodka is definitely your champion maybe it's you who knows [Laughter] all right question six six three more questions to go what is the partition key now oh a consecutive number applied to each new record a disconnected field in your table to partition your data an optional table filled with optional partitioning the key to partition the reality from the next okay indeed it was not that hard a bit a bit of text to read but you know you can easily remove a couple of options to keep the later just all right i'm just okay i'm just going to go on record and say that vote go is not me and ion or ellen or uh um ion already called already called it out so i don't know maybe maybe he gave himself away there it could be him okay joey with a respectable performance and hemoth as well i'm right guys ladies indeed this is good okay two questions let's try to finish almost on time executing select without the partition key is bad now the recommended way to retrieve data the right way uh if the data was inserted without a participant a way to illegal and finishable by law i vote for number four even if it's seriously i know yeah you cannot really be correct all right and the answer is avoid avoid the full cluster scan at all costs so does that mean that iran olau was vote goat who knows it's just uh stating that he failed on purpose all right hey yes maybe not okay last question people okay and then wrap up and yep we can all have a trick in the data modeling framework we start modeling with the conceptual data model and application workflow with the physical data model with the logical data model with copy paste from stack overflow clearly the right answer is clearly copy paste from stack overflow especially for the design right indeed both are needed conceptual data model and the application workflow application of flow means your queries okay final leaderboard who was the fastest among you drum roll please we need some jet we need some jeopardy music by the way for for uh during during these i think uh stefano is playing music for us right now oh cool okay um so three winners uh so take a screenshot of your screen right now right now and you will send an email
