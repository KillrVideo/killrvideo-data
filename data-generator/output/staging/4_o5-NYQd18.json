    "text": "so once again with Alex volume distributed data show at accelerated life and today I have a very special guest than a cello this gentleman works as a cloud database architect at Netflix from data stacks this is the distributed data show that's very promising I believe you're also Apache Cassandra contributor for many years already yes so first of all introduce yourself please we have some guests lab ok thank you thank you Alex for the introduction I'm Vinay cella Apache Cassandra commuter and cloud database architect working as part of cloud database engineering team at Netflix it's almost five years with Netflix but before that I started my journey back in 2012 with Cassandra very early on with oh seven version you know with the old drift based client vector broke the long time with Nate on that as well you know it's a great story the way I started with Cassandra back in 20 2012 when I'm coming from a totally different background of you know micro services and relational databases so then when we started looking into this no sequel databases we looked around several others databases including and all the performance tests but really proven that the Cassandra was a right way to go back then even in Dion like oh so inversion as well then that is when I you know started working with Cassandra and Cassandra community and then joined Netflix which is mostly lunch on Cassandra mmm-hmm lot of lot of applications use Cassandra at Netflix right great so you have a toolkit accelerate yes one or two I believe yeah yeah so what was your talk yesterday yeah yesterday I was talking about full query logging and capturing the live traffic and replaying it in you know in Cassandra moment that's a cool thing that's a really cool thing I've implemented something like that many go for MySQL oh yeah because sometimes you really like I have to replay production lot on staging yeah and that's very essential think that's really good what we have it now it goes live version four I believe yes in the perfect project yesterday with Jake with Johnny we also discussed Wed he's also pretty excited about red yeah it might imagine the days where you know you captured the live traffic coming to your Cassandra clusters in a production environment and you know clone it and put it in your real-time environment especially when you are looking for some box some weird box have been there just what's incredible to just incredible yeah okay and today you talk about I'm talking about photo features specifically in terms of performance reliability and complaints what is coming in for oh and how that makes Cassandra forum much more easy to operate and you know get your complaints check boxes ready you know with four oh yeah great so what are working on right now so right now I'm focusing on Apache Cassandra management process which is also called a sidecar in the community along with that spending a lot of time benchmarking and testing and getting the photo out to be used introductions so there's a lot of operational complexities involved in running Cassandra introduction or in cloud environment so I would like to see a Cassandra in a stage where it's easy to getting get started with Cassandra yeah as any other modern cloud services are you know getting started is is a matter of minutes yep and also taking it from development to production also should not involve lot of complications in terms of operations and deployment with I'm really hoping with Apache Cassandra management process sidecar we're gonna make it much more easier to run and you know starting with the development and all the way to the deployments yeah so we are trying to address a lot of operational challenges in bootstrapping configurations token management you know monitoring in terms of health and metrics also you know backing up restoring Cassandra and and also you know doing the rolling upgrades and rolling restarts you know much more easy yeah that's great you see someone cares of operation guys yeah and that's great because well some of my life I was working and development but also I did some remotes observations and like okay someone wants to make our job easier yeah yeah thank ya yeah so we I mean as a developer community in Apache Cassandra we are also not only looking for making you know developer life easy in terms of using Cassandra but also making operate I mean you know operating Cassandra is much more easier to you know there's one of the goal that we're and that I'm focusing on along with that there are many other interesting things in the cassandra space to walk on yep cool so website Kara I understand what about the performance monitoring testing you say it you are doing oh yeah so with the for oh we are spending a lot of energy and working with the community in terms of benchmarking fluoro and getting it out with a rock-solid stability and performance so we use Netflix data benchmarking tool which is nd bench which we developed at Netflix to benchmark any of our data stores and to certified data stores in our production environment so when we use nd bench and tested in the in our environment we try to simulate our production usage pattern in production query patterns and you know spinning hundreds of notes clusters yeah and test it at a real scale with real work I mean close to real workloads you know to test any of these new features so we will be releasing blog posts on that as well in coming months once all the benchmarking is done by the way guys Netflix has extremely just incredible useful technical book if you aren't following them you shoot definitely oh yeah I mean I'm doing it all the time thank you so much right so many use of this image is a great content out there not just movies but also technically yeah what so version four comes up this year I believe yeah finally yeah it was a long time what's the most important interesting things are coming in oh yeah so for Row is coming up with a you know great set of features and amazing performance so if you come at in my talk which I'm giving this afternoon I'm going to talk in specifics of performance improvements and features in terms of compliant you know complaints to domain has an audit clogging that is one of the feature that I worked on in forw which ensures that your Cassandra database is enterprise ready with all these complaints check boxes and also in terms of reliability there is an internal new messaging is completely rewritten with a sync networking yeah that makes it much more reliable but not just reliability but also highly performance yeah yeah and it's a lot of thread context switches are being abused we we saw how many thread context witches have come feel and we compared it with for this pink is a really a great thing because oh I am very intimate at scaling that's one of my favorite topics well that's just it looks like magic you need more power you get it but it always was hard with the databases like you easily can run an application new instance on a new server and that's it if traditional relational databases it doesn't go so easy yeah but Cassandra that's very much easier but still if I have like one two terabytes per note spawning can you know bringing over data to it bootstrapping that will take so you're really getting into the topic of zero copy I love that so yeah we have done benchmarks on zero copy streaming the main idea there is to avoid copying the data to the user space mmm send it across a wire and you know avoid all the serialization and deserialization cause with the zero copy streaming we have seen five times improved streaming performance I mean you can really see it not only helps in operations but we are actually talking about Cassandra availability here so imagine the scenario bit in a cloud environment you have a number of nodes down maybe a node terminated by your cloud provider and if it takes you know ask to you know steam the data there's a high probability there would be other than another instance which could be terminated or so during that time yeah and then you're talking about Cassandra availability but with the introduction of zero copy streaming when we are talking about copying the data in a matter of minutes we are not CPU bound here we haven't totally network bound here we go at the food throttle with a network speed and we also we are also talking about increased availability here yeah that's really cool thing coming in behind a photo I see one question about Simeon areum yeah her chaos monkey guess when I first learned this approach I was so damn excited Emily that's just amazing cuz I was winking to his direction and then I just go read a couple of articles of oh man that's amazing so simian army chaos gorilla chaos monkey people are asking actually how do you run that do you do it against the Cassandra and so on very interesting question so Simeon the Cosmin gamesman army exercises are automatically by default on all of our service tab sometimes we disable it another but we are working really hard I think we're close to enabling back it again in secondo and we used to done chaos monkey on Cassandra 4 until I think a couple of years back okay I mean do do some other operational issues we had to stop it but we are enabling back it again alright so but she awesome I mean I have a sticker on my laptop I don't have it with me but you know chaos monkey can't do anything to Cassandra yeah yeah yeah I don't know maybe we have some guests who doesn't know what's where simian army and chaos monkey and soon so where's guys are crazy we're just going to your production and shut down some servers automatically over time yeah that's very an imagine doing your persistence just like Cassandra and their wives everything I really like this concept because I see a lot of developers are optimists and that's a bad problem actually they write verification like it will run over time you have to bring your team to an understanding things will be broken network locks any network delays power outage and if you are not thinking of reliability when you're going to be dead with simian army go read about where that's important and be king okay so you work with Cassandra community and Apache foundation and Apache community for bridge a long time yes how was it it's great I mean the community is great party Cassandra community-specific is much more welcoming so what I've learned over years working with the Apache Cassandra community is to getting a time of other committees to review to treat review your design to review your code is very important as part of the process what we have learned is to communicate effectively in mailing lists mm-hmm and in IRC channel and also in through the Gira's once we have that figured out and it's much more easy to work with the community and also there is a new process that Cassandra Apache Cassandra is introduced recently called Cassandra Cassandra improvement process so if you have a design out there and you want to float it through the Cassandra community it's not a hard task not a you know go to Apache Cassandra Vicki everyone has access create I mean write up a bunch of sentences about your design and what your ideas are put it out there it will be pinched up big eventually get it bring it to life no in the very end that's always about the community again yeah that's what matters yeah and for the community it's also our responsibility to make it much more easy to reach you know a possibilities important things I think with the Cassandra introduction of Cassandra improvement process that would be much more easy to reach Cassandra community to get your ideas out there and to get discussed yep actually I'm getting bit more into the community forum what do you find the most important qualities for open source contributor how I mean of course what's a developer usually but what kind of a developer yeah so there are no restrictions as as in you you know you need to have Java expertise or no there's nothing like that I think Apache Cassandra you know good good way to start working with Apache Cassandra community to be a contributor just to start you know talking about it you know start contributing to the documentation maybe you know start opening bugs and JIRA pours through the Apache Cassandra JIRA and just drains from ideas I mean there's a easy way to get started with Apache Cassandra community take a look what would you say to a well beginner to intermediate developer if some job experience but not so strong not so like real ninja using Cassandra and wanting to contribute to that so what's my first steps I think I start with the Apache Cassandra Jacob github and so go through the open jiriz and there is a label low hanging who start moving them it can be it can start with the testing there's a lot of area to improve on in terms of Cassandra testing so that's a good way to start that's a good way to guess your get your hands yeah so guys go contribute to Cassandra that makes it sound better and it makes you better amazing yeah ok my favorite question your favorite book we all of us encounter at a lot of different box and some of them were pretty catastrophic and some of them were actually really funny yes your favorite one well there are a lot of fun interesting bugs in past four or five years but one thing I can you know which we recently hit you know a few months back mmm-hmm when the repair over steamed a bunch of data and under Cassandra clusters NASA I mean there's a it's fixed now but we ended up hosting lot of data and also build heavy mud cookies in memory and you care what the fun I believe yeah yeah that's one of the reasons but Cassandra is a great area you know I said it's a very wide community so it's a very bigger project so there are a lot of areas that we can get community health yeah so I'm really looking forward for Apache Cassandra community to grow further yeah and okay guys I know you were waiting for it for almost 20 minutes already I know what you want me to ask him man we need numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers how big is B what how many notes you guys run at Netflix how many data you have burn out how many data in general sure you have a lot of number of questions there you go so we have tens of thousands of Apache Cassandra nodes here running in our environment hundreds of Cassandra clusters and we're talking about petabytes of data there and we're talking about tens of millions of operations per second you know we are very nimble team we managed Cassandra as a service for then ten Netflix mm-hmm yeah I mean we are talking about petabytes of storage even so tens of hundreds of thousands of nodes yeah that's a lot I believe a last report from Apple was something like 115 thousands and that's like that's really a huge yeah so guy I ran a lot of Cassandra Evans in Europe and one question people ask me over time is how much data to put per node so it totally depends on our use case so we work with customers closely and based on the usage pattern and latency requirements we we have heavy dense nodes which runs all the way up to terabytes multiple terabytes and we done pretty thin notes as well a couple hundred gigabytes so it totally varies and we are an AW so we use different instance types all the way from small to extra large so yeah I over to inter a big note feature a big note feature yeah no I'm not okay well good so I really like how it sounds tens of thousands of nodes and thousands of clusters of those gave out guys have sisters hundreds of others yeah okay thank you so much for being there actually I believe for the time your talk coming up pretty soon so I know thank you so much thank you so much",
