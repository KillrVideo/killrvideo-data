  "description": "It’s now possible to develop fully reactive Java applications with frameworks like Spring WebFlux and Reactor. In this interactive workshop we'll explore the power of these frameworks and get hands on with a reactive implementation of the popular Spring Pet Clinic reference application.\n\nWe'll do all of our work in the cloud with Gitpod’s open source, zero-install and collaborative development environment . We'll use Apache Cassandra™ as the database to fit the highly concurrent, non-blocking nature of our reactive application and get familiar with the fully-managed database as-a-service called DataStax AstraDB.\n\nDataStax AstraDB - http://dtsx.io/workshop\n\nMenti - 23 82 17 8 or https://www.menti.com/eebcmze543\n\n💬 CHAT = DISCORD, ask questions live: \nhttps://bit.ly/cassandra-workshop\n\nCODE\nGitHub - https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/workshop-spring-reactive\nGitlab - https://gitlab.com/DataStax-Academy/workshop-spring-reactive\nGithub Official : https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-reactive\n\n\n❓FORUM = QUESTIONS during the week community.datastax.com : \nhttps://community.datastax.com\n\n🧑‍🤝‍🧑 THE WORKSHOP TEAM\n- Cedrick LUNVEN (@clunven, https://www.linkedin.com/in/clunven/)\n- David GILARDI (@SonicDMG, https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gil...)\n- Aleksandr VOLOCHNEV (@HadesArchitect)\n- Eric ZIETLOW (@EricZietlow)\n- Erick RAMIREZ (@ErickRamirezAU)\n- Jack FRYER (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-frye...)\n- Bettina SWYNNERTON (https://www.linkedin.com/in/bettina-s...)\n\nand Special Guest\nMoritz Eysholdt\n\n🚀 🚀 ENJOY !! 🚀 🚀",

    "text": "so welcome everybody for yet another Cassandra developer Workshop today I have I am lucky I have a very special guest moris eold um co-founder of tpox so morit thank you for being with with there with us can you please introduce yourself yeah thank you very much um Cedric for for having me yeah I'm co-founder of typ fox and we start several projects in in recent years one of them is Cia as an open source alternative to to vs um to vs code which is um governed by an open source Foundation the eclipse foundation and also um a few years ago we started the project gitpod that will play a very big role in today's um in today's workshop and gitpod is um is a great way of efficiently do coding um in your web browser with um with all your with your workspace on the on the server end on the server side yeah and today you will use gpod and you will see how good it is for any kind of development we are using gboard every weeks but if it's the first time you attend you will see how cool it is so let's get started it's not only me and morit on screen as usual there is a full crew behind the scene answering your question in the chat I already seen David and Alex answering a couple of questions you can also ask longer question on Discord and let's get swirling oh by the way if you like the content we are doing don't hesitate to subscribe yeah just saying moving on so today as usual we are liveed on YouTube and twitch I think we try LinkedIn today so maybe we are LinkedIn maybe the folks on the chat will tell me if you need to ask question we are on the YouTube chat and also on the Discord and today we will do some little games and Survey live as usual using M nothing to install simply open a new tab on your brothers m.com and I will give you the link speaking of which okay so today we will show you how to build a reactive application using spring framework and to do so we will use as a database data Stacks Astra Cloud database in the cloud and as IDE development environment gitpod there will be a backend and the front end moving on it's simply just getting started I know you you want to get your ends dirty all right um and first you know don't wait let's explain you what is Astra what is the database we will use today so Astra is a manage service it's Cassandra as a service in the cloud okay it's provided by data STX but there there is a free tier and it's a free forever tier so no credit card nothing you simply register even with your GitHub account start a database it will be there forever 5 gab for for free for you and on top of this database we do have tools and way to scale and API rest graphql API on top of the database okay to ease as much as possible the use of Kasra and this is the reason why we will use that today because it's free easy to use and you don't have to install anything so Astra is software as a service um yes so you know what let's get running so everybody out there Endzone part one see today's Endzone no slide there will be slide cery but we really want you to to get the most of this workshop and to start the app you won't code today so if you beginner totally fine I won't ask you to create a unit test to to debug no everything is code I will show you the code Bros how it works uh but you should be able to start it and first well you need a database so go to DTS 6.i Workshop or use the QR code you have on screen and it will lead you to hear how to start the database okay so and by the way so today we are using uh a GitHub repo data stxs Academy SL Workshop spring reactive the link of the GitHub repo is below me below the video uh and it's for from the the spring pet clinic I will explain uh that later on uh so in this repo not only you have the all the step to run the app so start the database okay how to fill every single field on Astra Okay click add database select the free tier okay when the free tier has been selected pick I mean the cloud provider has been selected for you because I know we are running this free tier on Google Cloud but hey if you can see that Astra can run on any cloud and Astra is now multi region and Astra can do VPC appearing with existing Cloud so if you already have some um application in the cloud is one of this cloud provider you can make Astra part of your ecosystem with the VPC ping but by default the database are set up on our own VPC select a region pick the region that is the closest to you so I I am in Paris so I pick Europe West I did the screenshot as you can tell and when you're done click configure then it will ask you to provide database name keyspace name username I give you here some sample values but you know you can pick the one you like simply please remember your password because even if you can reset your password it's still it's always a bit annoying to have to reset your password um yeah you will have to provide the password in the enone please okay ping the URL here so the URL is just below um the video but yes let me let me copy the URL for you in the chat by the way in the chat I am data STX developer guy one of the people behind the that developer so I I put the GitHub repo and D put the the link to create the Astra database okay we we do have time two hours is a long time let's take the time needed so when you do have the database ready to go I mean with the active State please do a S up so for the keyspace name you pick what you like uh as a proposal we we we put pet Clinic uh pet clinic either for database name or uh keyspace name but you know what the application will uh Be Clever enough to use the key space you provided so database name I put pet clinic DB and um keyspace name I I put spring un pet clinic um the only constraint I do have for those is really for the password now I think you need to use at least one um number one I mean one digit one uh Alpha num character one cap upper case letter and eight the password would be at least eight characters yeah spring ped Clinic yeah as Alex stated in the chat it's not very important but spring pet clinic yeah that's what we will do today okay and when you are okay please give me some thumb up I really want you to have the database ready um because then I will go to a few slides but you know if you if you're okay that's better okay so and when you filled all the step now you can click on create database can I make my screen bigger maybe there is no reason to keep this blank space on the left and right and so it will take a few minutes to spin up so we are just providing a new container running C for you on the platform so it may take a minute to start okay Babu tell me he's okay cool so it's working so Matt okay and yeah simply do uh part number one it's nzone one and it's okay and you should have so Astra database see I'm signing with GitHub everything it's G star today and see I do have my database pet clinic in active State woohoo cool um so I will wait let's say three more minute for you to be okay and let's move on oh started very fast cool cool cool cool and when the status is active see that you can now click on the DB and see that it's free you do have 5 gab of capacity uh you add a cluster ID and a you know database username pet clinic and your password so for MTA uh when you need to choose your plan you simply click free plan over here on the first part okay just say I don't want to pay anything and it will ask you to pick one of the region so pick the one closest to you and just click configure and just f f the the the parameter as stated or as you wish so name of the database I put pet clinic DB so let me copy that uh but you can put what you like and so on what we save for keyspace spring pet clean CL and for username pet clinque and you will I yeah you may see my password uh during the endzone but it's not a big deal because there is a client ID client secret that you won't have time to catch or I will change it after the the the workshop because it's recorded right you can just pause and get my IDs so Maurice I I know you did that before how do you find the database creation process was it complicated or simple straightforward I think it was rather straightforward I mean didn't took take us so much time and when I look at the chat looks seems like people can follow yeah that's that's cool and that's that's yeah that's really the mean of this kind of live stream is to make people do stuff with you easy cool um and so okay I will wait just a bit more for everybody to have their database um so you can see now that the database um you can access to elf which will you which will spawn a graph container and showing all the requests you are doing against your cluster you do have access to cql console which is uh which is the shell to interact with Cassandra very famous in the Cassandra world we will use that later you do have the studio which is a kind of Jupiter notebook but for candra okay um so let me enter my password Here here just the shell okay and describe key spaces you don't have to do that I just try to fill the blank during the time it's asking for credit card details so if it does that you did not pick the free tier uh so we need to really say free free free and if you already have a free database running you can reuse it for today but you can only have one free database in your asper account okay what else can I show you in the meantime uh I can show you connect okay you do have a running Cassandra now and you can either use Cassandra drivers this is what we will do today I really want you to show how to use the candra drivers but on top of it you do have the race API and graphql API if you know your front end developer really like to use graphql then it's provided so it's not only candra as a service there are some tools around that and so not today but on the sample app gallery you can see that we do have a lot so spring data Jam stacky for your frontend um next okay Gatsby spark and the spring pet clinic will be soon after this Workshop we'll be there soon okay are we good should we move forward let's stay let's wait until 25 and we will move on okay documentation buing database yeah I do a single DB this is my dashboard it's an activity B I use the key space train pet clinic I am on DCP for for free Europe and capacity unit one which is the fre tier okay one more minute and I will give you a little theory about reactive stuff okay I think we do have people ready yeah cool so people follow that's cool I do have 25 let's move on so today is all about reactive and so to introduce you to the reactive stack so just to remember the database we just created is Astra we do have a back end using spring framework it's a spring race it's a race API using the spring framework technical stack this is the part using the reactive and we do have a UI okay a client it's spring pet clinic angular which is one of the UI implemented on top of you know the for the default reference application in the spring community which is the pet clinic okay so first synchronous and this is for I mean for Java developer this is what we use all the time okay when you want to use synchronous communication with candra you will um connect okay initiate a session and you will start executing query against candra and you will get your response okay so you will send the parameter to the apepi the driver will create a query what we name a statement I don't go into the details today you will bind the parameter that's simply mapping parameter to um to the query you execute the query against against Cassandra get back the the the the result in an object called a result set and finally you get the result so what the issue here the issue here you can see on the slide is you need to wait during all that time okay so if you are running not performance queries and in Cas you can do that I for instance select star from a table without providing a work close it can take a lot of time if you um if you query for a lot of data or a big cluster Okay so so SWAT analysis so strength weakness opportunity threat for for something we are doing every day synchronous is very simple but pretty soon you can eat the issue which is which the weakness which is a blocking communication so um candra is well known for ey frut I volume type of workload so meaning I fput if you need to wait for everything get insert to be completed yeah your I throughput is a bit compromised right um so let's see if you can do better opportunity easy to test and maintain you need test or yeah that's very the Vania type of code we are doing day today okay easy to test easy to maintain issue scalability okay on a client you have limited amount of thread and so if most of your queries are blocked waiting for result maybe at some points you won't be able to invoke candra anymore not because candra cannot scale because C scale out a lot but be because of your client with limited number of thread so how to cope with this imitation so let's go asynchronous okay that's the promise so now with asynchronous you will do the small step in the beginning put the parameter uh prepare your queries bind the parameters to your queries and boom execute the query but instead of waiting for the result the Kasra and the driver will give you immediately an object called a completion stage which is uh in the family of completable feature in the OR Futures the future IP in in the Java A+ which is simply okay when the data will be ready you will get a call back coming from that and only then you can process the result you know on result boom you will process the result so you will get asnc result set and not only a result set on Cassandra every single query is paged and you will get the call back when the first page is loaded okay by default the size of a page is 5,000 this is the page size you can make it bigger or smaller for instance if you are working with a web UI there is no point to get 5,000 records yeah maybe you get the first page uh but yeah the call back is per uh page and you know when you start processing uh the page one when you eat the last element of page one under the hood the driver will fetch patch two for you and you can still process but hey What's happen if you get an error you know processing the result of the complex stage is not that easy you do have two um two path to under so first is Success okay you get the result set I mean I think result said you're happy everything's fine and the second is a completion error which is you got an exception and so on the exception yeah you need to see okay do I throw an ception do I do I do some um work around okay you got the point so that's a bit tricky but okay that's still okay normal uh error it's kind of like a try catch right uh but the issue is in asynchronous you tends to chain one call after the other just to have nothing blocking I mean as soon as I do have the call back for the first I invoke the second as a call back and the third as a call back and then you change the treatment and what happened is you nested every single code and so each time you nested the a new service you have to manage two is it okay is it not okay and now you get the ID you get a tree of all the possible case uh even the first level is failing okay no problem the second level is failing so should I throw the exception up to the first level and the first level or process the second level or do a rank around there this is what we called the Callback l so what is cool with asynchronous is now you are not blocking anymore you get immediately your futures um so you can scale okay um you can scale much more now your web thread are not blocked but you you get the idea now you can eat this Co back L if the coal are nested and you do have a main MBT error okay and moving on to the promise what about reactive okay I put it in green because reactive is cool right okay so this is the reactive Manifesto uh WR by some clever guy telling that okay this asynchronous hell is not what we like so let's try to put something better and so they created the reactive Manifesto you do have the link on on top uh right and corner and basically this is uh see maintainable extensible this is exactly what we were missing with the asynchronous only stack so what is a reactive service so the what we try to achieve is first the service to be responsive that mean the system always responds in a timely manner okay if it's success or not success you can expect the system to always and S the same in the same time frame second is resilient okay the system stay responsive in the face of any failure third is elasticity the system stay responsive and V viring workload and adapt itself uh to variable ingestion rates so that's a bit more not really in the code but more scaleout Dynamic scalability uh things you can achieve with elastic load balancer on AWS for instance or in uh you know kubernetes when you when you see that one of the Pod is not responding get the else check not running yeah you may want to scale out this component that's part of the reactive what we want and message driven okay asynchronous is still at the art of the system so the system relies on asynchronous messaging to achieve loose C loose coupling and isolation Okay that's the theory what about implementation well the leading implementation uh is the reactive stream API again I put you the link so re active stream is really a specification okay and here you can see multiple implementation of these API so here you do have reactor vertex AA and this is a logo of spring web flux leveraging reactor okay so what object do you find in this specification well um you you do have the subscriber and a publisher okay and so the subscriber will send a request to subscribe the publisher will get you an object named a subscription and you as a subscriber you will query your subscription so now you do have an object as a subscriber and you won't query the publisher you would query the the object you have the subscription you execute everything asynchronous and then there is a call back on next okay to get the result un next and you know what now you don't have the notification I mean the callback for every single page but for every single record and this is why when you speak about reactive word you you think about nice UI that refresh autom you know automatically because um the item the item are sent back to the U and the idea is anything happening on the DB you get the call back you get the notification per record and so this notification can be bring back up to the API layer and framework like react angular any JavaScript now is able to read that notification coming through the UI you are probably as aware about websocket and boom the UI can be refreshed automatically so it's it's now call back at the fine grain level and so you can do uh fast and small things with this uh new callback but also it can do more so if you good if you look at the candra code but you know it's quite reusing the same publisher subscriber mechanism and now when I execute uh when I bound my ston I get a flux so flux is one of the object used by reactor reactor is the leading implementation of the reactive streams okay reactive stream specification reactor main implementation in Java and so tools like web flux will leverage on this reactor object so in the code you will see either flux which is kind of a list in the reactive world and mono the single result in the itive world you execute the query and now coming from candra you do have a call back for every single row okay and which is neat is if you can keep up you know um there is tons of things happening at the candra level and you as a client you are a subscriber and you cannot keep up with that well there is a back pressure mechanism to tell KAS okay please please driver slow down I cannot keep up and that's the sweet that's you know that's really what's cool candra is famous ice root Bo if you cannot keep up yeah now you can tell Cassandra to slow down it's for read but not for write because there is no way candra could tell you stop writing uh I cannot keep up um but it's not the the the topic for today but on a single node of Cassandra you can expect about 3,000 transaction per second and per core so on a machine with eight CPU it's about 20K request per second per node and C is a distributed system with basic production three nodes so basically very basic cast can absorb easily 60k request per second so as a client you need to be pretty strong to to eat that value but anyway just telling you the back pressure is only available for read okay that was a lot of theory right okay and this reactive we will apply that to the reference application which which is in the spring Community which is spring pet clinic so if you go to the spring.io you will find the reference implementation of the pet clinic but the pet clinic is so famous and so widely used and widely use as a reference app that now there are some people forking and changing the implementation in new way so I hide a little bit it's it's so you can see you can go on Spring dpet clinic. kb. and you would see multiple implementation for this sample see you can see here the angular the micros service you know using all the spring Cloud stack and I'm happy now the spring reactive is part is part of this organization so again this organization is community oriented okay maintained by people like Anan R uh very active on saring you know ticket very fast so thank you to the community pretty happy to be part of it and if you start creating some ticket with the sample we are using today I will probably Jump On It All right we do have the database we know uh that we will use reactive so let's move now to the development platform and on that I will let the expert speak I will let Moritz take over and I see I will get back to my screen uh later on so let's see okay now marit you share your screen yes I do do you see my screen yes we can see perfect um yeah thank you Cedric so let's let's go a little bit deeper into a development environment that runs that runs inside the your browser that runs inside the cloud um so let's take a closer look at at gitpod here on the left we see it running we see a screenshot um of it running this is basically the website so if you go to gitpod doio um it's super easy to just click on this button um try now and all you need is a is an account on GitHub or gitlab or um bitbucket.org and with gitpod you get an IDE that has quite a bunch of features that Focus around um being ready to code immediately and that Focus around um collaborating with with colleagues and also that Focus around um being powerful enough for professional developers and that Focus around um reproducibility so that um everybody who's working on the project um gets a reproducible workspace or multiple reproducible workspaces and in more detail so for for teams we we support code reviews and sharing of uh workspaces and exchanging workspaces snapshots and to be more to offer really really fast um workspaces um when you think of what you you traditionally need to do when you start developing traditionally you would clone a project and check out a branch and study the rme and install the tools and run build and run test and um then after a [Music] few um a few half an hours hours or even days you finally ready to code and gitpod automates most of this so that from choosing a project to starting to code you can do this within um within seconds and that's what we're going to do um and you can you can follow this along with me um I will provide you a link links in a in a minute um it's free for up to 50 hours a month and for people that want to use it more professionally or more extensively we we also have have paid plans because um running a full-fledged workspace in the cloud is actually quite a heavy thing that also creates cost on our side so to to follow along you might open up um gitpod either on gitlab or on GitHub by by following these um these QR codes and um as you do it I will I will do it as well so I will I will switch to to interactive d mode um so for example if you go via gitlab um here in yeah so the project is available on GitHub gitlab so you can pick what you like yes exactly um for some reason I um here I'm still I'm not signed in for some reason so just a second right so when I'm on this project and when you're signed into gitlab you have probably seen this um this button web IDE before and since a few weeks there's also a second button or another option in the drop down named G pod so if you click on that one then a gitpod workspace will open and we have this native support for gitpod in gitlab since a few weeks because we we gitpod we we um started a partnership with with gitlab so we will be working together to make this work really really easily um the same works on on GitHub so if [Music] you go to the GitHub project um um you could either install a vs code extension that installs the gitpod button here or if you do not have this vs code extension installed you can go to gitpod doio uh or you can prefix the URL with gp. pound and press enter and and then um a workspace will start on this project you may need to to log in to gitpod um that's something I did already you can do that with your your GitHub GitHub or your gitlab account and what's happening now is that gitpod starts a workspace um for me for you um in the cloud and now we have a running workspace and when we take a look at the workspace here in the middle there's already a readme file the readme file from the repository that is open in an editor but I will close this for now here on the left hand side I have all the files from the repository and here on the bottom I have I have terminals um and there's stuff happening already and if I open up a new terminal I can also see it's a bash uh we are under Linux uh we can run any any Linux commands and and we see that we have quite a powerful machine where we can just do stuff on the server side and um here we see that our pet clinic project has already been compiled and we see that we see this message or we we see that it has been compiled because here we see the message the last message from from Maven that tells us the build was successful it took um 1 minutes 40 thank you and and we know um we didn't wait 1 minute 40 um when we opened up the workspace this was already done and that's a feature of gitpod we call it prebuilds so what gitpod can do is gitpod can can run such tasks ahead of time like before I start a workspace G does this like a like a cicd server so basically when you do a git push to your repository then gitpod gets notified builds a workspace for your new commit um and stores it in the cloud and later when you need that workspace it's just there and ready to code and you see this nice message of oh you just saved 2 minutes of watching your code build because that ran ahead of time cool um and same for same for angular um and this application or this the application automatically ran so we can now open this up in a browser for example or I can um I can also open this see in a preview and I see it in in gitpod and now we see the spring the spring pet clinic app running live inside my workspace um so the full the full app so basically from I choose the repository click on a link have the running app in my have a running workspace with the app running in it takes less than a minute so that is I think record breing breaking time for for going from zero to to being ready to code um but let's let's look a bit more into the details on how how we actually made this work so the entry point for this what gitpod uses is the the gitpod yam file um so that's a configuration file that you can place in in your repository and it's it's very useful to to place it in the repository because this way it's version controlled and shared with your team we call the St environment as code and the big advantage of this is that the the setup of your def environment is always consistent with your code so you can be sure you get the right version of um vs code extensions and tools and so on and um the first thing the GitHub gitpod Doyama file does is it says um it instructs gitpod to take this Docker file as a basis for the workspace and when we take a look at the doer file we see oh it takes a workspace full image installs angular stuff and installs even more angular stuff and when we started workspace what get put does is it takes this Docker file the docker container from it and launch this as my workspace uh yes absolutely let's make that a bit bigger is this is this better yeah I think just waiting for feedback but all right yeah zoom in the screen here like uh command plus just to make that I can do that too yeah perfect and make your yeah perfect you can put back your brother full full screen now too much overlap um so what get does is it it takes this doer file and like when you start a workspace it checks is there such a Docker file in the repository and if that's the case it builds a Docker container from this Docker file and that will be launched as your workspace so basically everything that you install here inside the docker file will be inside your workspace so you have it for example accessible here in the in the shell and um you don't need to base it on workspace full you can also base it on Alpine or yanku or Debian or other um Linux distributions and so that is a very very very powerful way of creating a def environment which is exactly tailored to your project and at the same time giving you a very convenient control over um how you manage it because it gets version controlled with your with your code and inside the gitpod Yama um what we can do is we can we can specify tasks that should run as a pre-build um so for example here or let's let's look at at react here this is the command for for the prebuild so for the pet clinic example uh we run the command Maven clean package install as a pre-build um so just like a cicd server if for example Cedric um keeps on developing on the app and pushes to the git repository then gitpod will run this command to create a fresh workspace from it store it in the cloud and later when Cedric or I want to start a workspace on that commit then we get everything pre-compiled and can be happy about this this message um the command then later the command actually gets executed when you start the workspace so um this command made sure that when when I just started the workspace that we could already see a running app yeah and this is why a question we asked to enter your credential we will do that in a minute this is setup.sh that will use the credential coming from Astra initialize the app and start the app yes exactly I will um pass over to Cedric in a while and then I assume you are going more into details about that one um there's more conflict here about um ports so for example the react app is um or the pet clinic app is opening up um Port 4,200 uh we need to expose those ports to show them in a preview um config to enable the previews and also um pre-install vs code extensions that I will talk about more U more in a second um but first I want to show to you that this is actually um this is a real IDE this is not a this is not a toy thing so um gitpod supports um vs code extensions and here we have Java support installed via V vs code extension so the Java support that you see here in gitpod is exactly the same that you see in vs code because it's the same vs code extension as what vs code uses and the vs code extension actually packages the eclipse um Java tooling um language server so when I for example hover over a command and I see the Java doc that is exactly the same that you would see in um in eclipse or if I open um some class let's um go to some utils and press content assist and I get the real content assist so this is like exactly those functions that I can actually open up on this class this is not a not a wild guess based on text scanning or if I do a control click and click on this then I can also navigate to The implementation and we see that this Java code this is not from my repository but this is from um um associated with the local date. class so this this this Java code is somewhere deep in a jav file in my in my workspace but nonetheless for convenience it's super easy to access it because um it makes coding so much easier when you can actually read the codes that you're calling um and what else um other features that we have uh we can also find references and see um where is this is being called from there's something that's not working um and one more thing that we can do is um we can also debug so for example I can go here to my Sprint application I can set a breakpoint and then I can click here on on debug and then the left hand side in the debug view um I can see how how the application starts oh that's a lot of information now I'm really running out of pixels with my resolution yeah and you did provide running in the Java virtual machine and here I can see the call stack and now for example I could um click here to step into the method and now I'm starting to step into the um Java spring um framework yeah that's cool I do have a couple of question coming from the chat now so first is does the workspace you are using uh keep the States you know is State full you can go back and yes absolutely um so the workspace as as long as you run the workspace it's your Docker container so you keep all the files all the processes and so on and um when you close your browser window or when you click on stop workspace um then the files from the workspace will be will be saved in your user profile and then in your user profile um you get a list of the workspaces that you launched recently so you can always go back to them and and start them start them again you like our app um and second question is about uh shortcuts so is there any um shortcuts close to what we are we get used to eclipse or yes AB absolutely um so if you if you press command shift p um or if you um or go to view find command it's just like in vs code so you get a list of all commands that you can run and you you also see the shortcuts that are already associated with those commands so you can use all those those shortcuts and you can Additionally you can install vs code extensions that change shortcuts so for example you could install a vs code extension for um for uh VI shortcuts and thereby make um make it behave like yeah like vi vi whoa no that's yes only do it when you know how to exit but oh jeez oh yeah tell me about that that's cool so it leverages on kind of vs code and you can install multiple extension by the way in this app you already have two extension running that is that is very very true um so let's take a look at this so here we have um um we have an extensions View and um in this extensions view um I can for example search for I have the lombok um extension installed and I have the spring boot extension installed and there's also a bunch of buil-in extensions that are pre-installed and here I can for example simply search for um other extensions so I can search for Java and then I find a bunch of other extensions where I can simply click on install um and then when I click on something to install um I don't know let's install the maven the MAV stuff then I can choose whether I want to install it for for this project where install it for the project then goes and goes into my um I get a marker in my gyama then will be shared with my team and when I install it for uh is so that's myself that goes into my user profile um that is where I should put my VI shortcuts or um a theme that uses coloring that not everybody might like um yeah then goes into my user profile and will be there on my projects but it won't bother my my teammates and to show what these extensions can do um I already showed that we have the visual uh the spring boot extension installed and if I go to resources and to application. Yama so this config file from um from Spring and then press content assist here oh it's not so super fast then then we see we we get content assist for this yam so that is this this content so this the IDE knows exactly which values are are acceptable here and that is provided by the vcode extension for um um for spring tools and I also just noticed that the find references that I wanted to show earlier it actually popped up here on the left hand side I it elsewhere that's why I was a bit confused um so we the find reference feature actually works nicely and um to to Really benefit from this um when you work in a team there's a few ways that um that make it super or that are super powerful when you want to work with skod um one is um reviewing um pull request so for example now when I go to some other repository here is the repository of our um of our IDE and open this then I will get a new workspace that starts and and it doesn't matter that I already have a workspace running so this is what I want to show is it's super convenient that here I don't need to interrupt my work just because I want to review a pull request elsewhere I can have several workspaces that just without problems run in parallel okay um question in the chat can you use uh like private git like AWS Azure code base or you know a git URL you would provide um you can use private repositories from github.com gitlab.com and bitbucket so there we all have support for private repositories okay um we also have support for private no for self-hosted gitlab installations so if you self-host gitlab somewhere uh we can also hook this up and on top of that we we offer um you can self-host gitpod and and when you sell for giod then you can hook it up to mostly anything that supports oos um and that can also be a GitHub Enterprise server um or your self hosted gitlab and when you self host gitpod then of course you also choose each Cloud infrastructure so then you can for example run it on Google Cloud platform or um or [Music] AWS and we're working on Azure support okay nice um and so now here the the workspace for my code review is is almost there and here for example I see the the files that have been changed um or here's only a file that has been added and when I click on details I can also see the pr and then for example I can um I can click on review or I see the all the conversation from the pr and I can can review contuct my review and inside the file I can also comment on individual lines and that that all gets uploaded to um to get cool and even more when you work in a [Music] team um let say now I'm do some coding and I'm stuck with some something on ASA but I know that cetric can help me what I could do is um I could click here on my on my avatar icon and um now I know that Cedric is with me so what I could do is um click on share uh share running workspace so I could invite Cedric to to enter my my running workspace and then we could together work on the same same code um that also works nicely for for educational settings or for mentoring and unblocking obviously but even if Cedric would not be there with me right now but I know that he's super busy in another meeting at the very moment but hopefully later today you might have an hour um to look into um or to have me out what I could do then is then I take a I take a snapshot from my workspace um so a snapshot is like an um the current state of my workspace State persisted um in the cloud and when I take a snapshot I get a um I get a link so now GP is taking the snapshot and once the once we have the link I can share I could Shar the link via email or via chat and if Cedric would click on it then Cedric would here's the link um would get an exact copy of my workspace so the copy is like fully detached from my workspace but it contains the files exactly as I left them um so that could including environment variables and all the modification you did cool yes yes yes that is super useful for as work or for handing out exercises yeah or you know multiple report multiple state of your exercise you know you do have you know basic then step one step two step three if you stuck go to link step three and everything is is done for you you can move on for your exercise so really for any University uh or you know any school so not only student don't have to install anything on the laptop but you know you could have your uh courses ready to go with multiple com and these Workshop snapshot stated to each committe um yeah that's that's a big part of my or that's my My Demo part um which is cool which is cool thank you um if there are more questions please post them now in the chat yeah not yet not yet but I will watch and if there are uh let's let's take the question so so should I should I take over finish up there's two more things I want to stress first um as I already mentioned you can use gitpod on gitpod doio or you can self-host it we have terraform scripts to install it on AWS and gcp um and we have a home chart to install it on on kubernetes and um we recently went open source so you can actually look look at the source code um of G and compile it yourself try it run it um and of course um improve it and and contribute yeah this this like to hand the lead over or all right all right so let me go there and there and let's do some little slides um yeah let's let's go with slides uh okay um yeah just two question maybe we should take now uh before running because it's question relating to snapshots and first is uh so the snapshot is just a copy uh it's not link together with the or original and so then is how do you merge a snapshot with the original you know back together if you need to ah was was good so so so if you um if you create a snapshot and de you basically Branch Branch off your workspace what you would do is um you would commit the files that you want to keep to get and and push them to your repository and then use the mechanisms of git to to to align them so you would rebase or git merge um however it is necessary and and if that is not an for some reason of course you can also just download files from your from your workspace to your hard drive and upload them to another workspace but G way that's just the last resort I think G the way okay that's cool that's cool pretty neat okay uh let's go into a little bit of spring and using everything we saw just to build the application will you uh we still have time so let's let's go into it so a couple of we we ago we introduce you spring uh so it was two hours only on Spring and spring boot uh so I won't go into the details today I will go fast but you know at the heart of spring the the the mechanism that make spring a superstar in the Java Community is really the inversion of control so now you define a single interface multiple implementations for your interface and when you need to use this service you only uh specify the interface and not the implementation doing that you introduce loose coupling between the user of your service and the service so it's very easy to do moing to do multiple version of your service uh and you know even if you have a single version of the service most people doing that all the time now it's so cool to introduce the decoupling between layers of your applications so last time we introduce you the spring boot which is the run time with everything in included uh in Spring and if you need more function you add some spring boot starters so spring boot starter data spring boot starter security spring boot starter uh ff4j why not I mean uh so today we will move to uh the reactive part okay so it's still running inside spring boot but now we are using something called Spring web flux so this is spring boot with three layers presentation layer business layer uh persistent layer using inversion of control in between layers okay and spring boot will help you package your app as a standalone jar which is pretty convenient and easy to deploy as Container for instance you don't have to deploy your app in application server and I told you adding some starters you add some Metric L check configur by the way in the sample today in git pod we are simply using the spring the rest API but if you go to application. yaml you see that you canable Spring Security distributed stressing with Zipkin and also promus grafana stack it's all there you simply have to enable the flag when you start the app so it's all due to Spring Boot and the spring Cloud World providing all the dependencies youit simply attach what you need so speaking of now reactive spring so this is the key slide so what you used to do with spring MVC which is the web layers for servlets in the spring World both for rest API and controller in a MVC uh pattern you know model view controller where the view tends to be with free marker or time lift in the spring world and the rest API of course uh using the rest part of of spring um and you can only use rest controllers and have your UI using any JavaScript stack of course so endpoint it's moving from MVC to web flux but that change something if you introduce web flux in your class pass now all your application might be reactive that mean spring will scan all your classes and if one method is not reactive it's synchronous for instance the application won't even start okay it will tell you there you do have a blocking call I'm not starting and so now because you introduce some reactive at the end point because all the nice features I show you before find GR notification now you need to be reactive to the full stack so full stack mean at the database level when you interact with the database so add the connectivity meaning the driver levels then in each layer of your application repository service and controllers so for the connectivity uh because we are using candra we of course using the candra drivers and the candra drivers provide now ways to execute in reactive way so then two way to work with this reactive connectivity stuff you can either use spring data reactive candra spring data reactive candra which is a wrapper around the the the reactive uh driver from Cassandra um this is not what we are doing today today we are simply leveraging all the features from the driver not spring data because my point is spring data is very strong but it's like really building a boat inside a Buttle so with spring data you do have nice repository okay where you simply have to Define interface and um entities and um method with convention creating the proper method name Will execute the proper query but what happened under the hood now what about bch statement but about pag what about consistency level all these features from the driver are hidden for you and it tends to forgot them and always use the default mechanism it's not the spring data F it's because spring data is so easy to start with that you are doing the default method and it's not what you should do because there be way way better things to do to be much much faster so what I did today is I simply use the driver to see everything is Can it can do for you and later you can use spring data spring data reactive to to to get that um yeah to make that happen and you know with spring data when you get stuck with the repository you switch to C in class called candra operation Cassandra template and guess what you are using the class from the drivers okay so um I do have this the implementation of the spring pet clinic app using spring data reactive as well that could be another Workshop so today let's dig into um let's dig into the the the real thing everything you can do with Cassandra driver without being constrained by the over the over overlay spring data okay okay so backend code review all right so first at the database level okay so my the I implement this app and so I took a model which is relational okay if you look at all the existing implementation of the pet clinic it just it's only relational SQL and so there are some joints all over the place so the business domain is Pet Clinic you do have pet own you know you do have owner owning pets and the pets can go to visit and for the visit you will you will uh contact V which is quite as easy so you totally understood foreign key between owners and pets foreign key between pets and visit and you know Integrity constraint visit pet vet in Cassandra no joints no Integrity constraint no assd transaction and so I simply use the you know the the method that is explained in ds220 on this channel is thinking take your entities take all the query you need to build your app and try to First doing one table per request even if it's mean duplicate the data it's not a big deal in the Cassandra world I know it's surprising for people coming from relational this is how it work don't be afraid to duplicate the data and so after that I try to to to find ways to maybe reduce the number of tables and it end up during this data model okay so moving on okay then is connectivity to candra so connectivity to candra is done by uh the drivers maybe I will show you how it works more in the code and the repository service controller so I put here the the the schema the the the architecture you do have the same in the GitHub repo uh so what you simply need to realize is um you would you will have mostly a Dao for single for each entity and then for services you can have one Services per Dao or you can uh use the business service layer to Aggregate and compose data coming from multiple Dao and what is cool with the reactive is um now if you need to get all the pet from owner um you can you may still need to do n+ one select so get details for every single pet but with the reactive stack you can do that all together and get the values for every single pet as synchronously and get the result when you get all the request all right okay so now let's go to the code okay all right so um we add a database it's running we are happy and we do have an empty key space what I will do is I will copy my credentials just to have values to to be used in in the gitp so what I do so I follow the step written there it's pretty quick okay it's simply create a service account and copy the credential so if I go go to my database I will go on the top click on my name okay this is what has been asked scroll down to the bottom just to so just to see the security settings I do have here my security settings so if not I will add a service account and boom I do have a service account from there I will go here and say copy credentials okay I can maybe maybe open can I here can I [Music] open yes uh this is not what I want yeah so this is what is in my clipboard it's a gone with my client ID and client secret the thing you need to make pose and steal all my data in my database but yeah it's a demo database that would I will eventually terminate the database now after this Workshop all right so with this credential in my clipboard let's get started I'm going to GitHub okay and I will use the opening GitHub opening git pod button I put there but because I use the extension shown by uh Moritz I can also simply click on gitpod button over here and see look at the URL it will open git pod and use my my git pod so it's starting let me WR this guy is it security credential per DB per account true per service account per DB I guess but now you are asking I should I should try if I cannot access another database with the same account because it's at the organization level so I can probably use contact multiple uh database with the same service account this is a question to ask to to to people at data Stacks because you know what I always use the free tier so I always have a single um I always have a single um database okay so um two tabs one is the UI okay everything has been done for me and the UI is already running on PO 42 so I can open the BR and the UI is there but the UI uh cannot contact the back end because the back end is not started so if you look at the uh backend tab okay I was asked to provide my credentials so guess what I will past my credential which is jizel so this is a small setup.sh script I have created for you and what it's done it's simply creating some environment variables oh it did not ask me for my password whoa that's so strange not that much because uh in the gitpod world even if you delete your um even even if you delete your workspace you you can keep your environment variables and so Astra DB password was already there saved and so I I I I had no there is no point for me to uh provide it again okay so see so now the database has been started I can open the database okay first I show the full demo then I go into the code so now the back end is started and so one call you can make it's going to the pet type because it's referential data so it has been populated for you so what the application does a startup is creating the expected tables and putting data where needed you know that's pretty cool so I can see what are the pet types in the DB okay so I will go try it out and execute and see those are all the uh pet types available in my in my um in my database uh and so during the type uh during the time you are starting your back end I can go to my database maybe here show you the cql console you don't have to do it simply uh I will wait for you to start the front the back end copy your credential copy in the terminal provide the password you're good to go and so remember gitpod has uh downloaded all the dependency did all the um Maven command for us um and also execute the pre-build okay so describe key spaces is it big enough should I make it bigger okay describe key spaces uh and see I use spring ped Clinic okay describe tables okay um yeah if you just created the database you don't have to provide user password this is because I'm using a older database and the no password to provide to open the cql console has been released a couple of days ago okay so these are all my tables and um if I want to see all the pet types and other the one I show you in the Swagger UI I will go here and I will do simply s from okay so now the pet types are those Guy Bird cat dog I'm still lizard snake all right um I can create a new one from the Swagger um but you know that's not the point what is uh pretty neat is look at that gitpod just uh open a public API so the P the API was expected to run on 99 66 so what it does is simply map into 9966 on 80 and now everybody can access that you could access my my my this URL if you wish and so what we did in the beginning in in the launch of the of the angular we simply evaluate with GP URL 9966 what should be the back an URL and like that cross finger if I click on pet type now the UI is communicated to the back end and I can add a new so let's see lizard. cut what's next uh so what's what's what kind of pet do you have morit a lion okay have turt oh turtles yeah why not okay so now let's go to the turtle so I'm editing the reference table if I go to the database and ask for the data of course it has been updated okay it's not a mock we are communicated from this UI to the database so and you know before going to code let's make a p that's cool right we do have full working app with UI and backend and database and you don't have to install anything and it's free all right um okay moving on so let's go back now to um the heart the code and to show the code guess what I will use uh my ID no just kidding I will use git fod okay so remember first uh let's go each step first the connectivity so if I go to main Java everything is there com okay com and maybe application. yl which is the spring boot uh configuration file okay so this is the one whereit open before let's make it bigger this is a configuration file I have enabled some actuator spring see you can enable zip kin by simply enable true uh you can enable using the SEC Spring Security by enable true and you can either use Astra which is a default Behavior I do have or you can use local candra if if you want to lose if you want to use Zipkin local candra prometes grafana you need to start all these component using Docker and the docker compost is there for you everything is there okay prus grafana Zipkin Cassandra y everything is there so if you want to run everything locally do it the compose is there for you but today every everything is in the cloud so let's see I do have application uh application- astra.com so to set up the data Stacks driver you simply need a single com file application- asa.com okay and this file can have hundreds and hundreds of fine grain configuration key so first if you use spring data now you need to use the small keys I mean The Limited number of keys available in in application yl in Spring data and you have not access to all these stuff by default this is there is a way to do it but it's not well written in the documentation yeah you simply go Basics and do Basics so first look at that you can so this is the Astra okay so I'm using environment variables I have created when I've imported the Jon I do have the same file for local configuration and now I'm using uh Docker candra 9042 okay so level zero configuration files okay level one config so what I do candra config okay I will Define a bin SQL session okay implementing synchronous asynchronous and reactive calls okay simple as that and depending of the flag us asra I will load one file on or the other okay very easy very basic you've got the ID uh maybe one things to say about configuration before going further is um I use Spring Security and I uh if you enable Spring Security in the application.yml you will use one class security enable config okay implementing a filter with spring uh and if you disable you don't have the spring uh security filter and same for the security Swagger you know the small framework we are using to generate this UI uh if you if you disable the security this is what it look like if you unable the security there is a new button over here to provide user as password as HTTP authentication basic all right config okay now what about Dao one step O Okay one step above Dao so let's pick one of the entity you know they're all working the same uh pick one entity and see what's going on okay so let's back uh one vets okay so vet at the DB layer first create a entity okay so we are using lombok not to create any getter Setter it's been it has been done for for us at compile time uh it's an entity okay nothing much to say about that but we are using uh annotation or those annotation come from the default drivers not spring data I told you but you can do quite the same with uh spring data so here the partition key clustering column provide name for the columns and with that you do have a mapping from object to the tables so let's use that in a Dao so like spring data in the default candra drivers there is a Dao mechanism uh so-called mapper where you simply Define the interface and code will be available for you as is okay and you create a mapper referencing the Dao okay but now you do have access to the SQL session so that mean you can here easily create the tabl so see in the mapper I create the different table using my SQL session it's available for me right here and then and at the Dao level I can Define some uh you know Advanced uh queries in the select over here uh okay that's entity level now let's move to service level oh by the way so at the driver level um all the method will return map reactive result set and the reason is the driver won't force you to use either reactor or another uh reactive implementation like vertex so it provide you the publisher which is the interface the specification uh and so because spring web flux is is using um reactor at the service layer when I invoke my Dao so this is my service okay injecting multiple Dio over here and so look at that I will say flux remember flux is really the class you want to use when you return a list of something so the do got me find all which is a you know map as result ah maid reactive result set and I map that as a flux and now I can uh um move from any entities to the vet entity which is the entity used by the service layer remember when that's basic spring stuff at each layer you want to have dedicated entity at the layer I have V entity using annotation related to my implementation my database then at the service layer I don't want any dependency to my database so I create a new classes even if it's exactly the same uh but most of the time there are some mappings because this class we get some info coming from multiple um there um so what about using urm so in Cassandra there is no R okay there is no relation so we are using object mapping because there is no relation joints does not exist in C so this mapper or spring data are really the object mapping so it's kind of ibatis IET if you wish uh look at that if you look at the do interface I will you know uh select select delete update see I update and I provide my object which is really like connection. save in the iberet world so but you know we do have an entity I save my entity um I update my DB but no it's om not omm that's kind of the same but it's not hooked it's not magically oh I will update my object and boom it will magically uh update my database um so I have used IET back in the day and you know the developer manipulating manipula the this data this object layer and having some updates in the database I can guarantee that DBA ate that because you're not aware of which kind of query you are firing against the database and this is one of the reason that now people tend to put API on top of the database because they don't want you to execute any query because you you have fun with the orm true story okay so that's your Dao let's move to the service layer so I I translate the result set from mono or flux depending of what I like and I'm use a mapping to map The Entity from the level to service level so if I go to the mapping let's see I do have some utils mapping that's okay stupid mapping field to field okay put that field in that field put that field in that field there are some framework existing to help you with that mapping but you know my point of view is is faster to do that like that instead of expecting some yet another layer of annotation to do the mapping not just me you can you can do whatever you like so uh I do have my services over here let's see what I have it's simply you know uh it's really code like you would code now if uh Java eight it's all about it's really close to using streams you know reactive streams once you get either a mono or a flux from the result now you can do map okay mapping from one object to another asynchrony for every single record you can flap map so you can do the same uh but in a dedicated uh Asing call for every single item uh and so at the controller level spring web flux we expect to return either mono or flux so make sure that at the service layer everything has been done for you just the last word on these classes is look at that at initialization of the class because I do have after set properties I have implemented initialize being just just spring stuff this is why the database is filled when you start and and by the way the everything in reactive is lazy if you simply uh create the mono if you don't have anybody to subscribe to this mono nothing will happen you need a terminal code and this is why I put a little subscribe in the end you do not want to do that block because do block will get you everything what you need but I I can guarantee if you put some dot Block in the code then spring web Flix will go after you and say I don't start I saw some blocking code okay so and now the controller layer and it's all working the same so now I keep reusing the same annotation uh from you know spring MVC spring rest so it's still get uh Swagger API are still the same now instead of returning a list of vet I return a flux of vet like that so really um at that point controller is all about boiler plate and login and error management because all the all the code to compose has been done at you know the service level and service level is all about aggregating data coming from multiple de using the nice features coming from reactive you know the flat map and enrich the object populate the object from Source coming from multiple data asynchronously and then see it's pretty close to what you have in default spring boot app simply now we need to move everything from list to flux anything from uh object to Mono make sure and anything is blocking in your app and you know sometimes playing with all the Stag map. list. flat map. default empty uh in the end is pretty elegant code you know in two lines you you you you do a lot of stuff but at the same time you know coming to this uh code sometimes it's a bit tricky so now which is NE with this application you do have a full working app during Cod create R of they delete uh both for single entities and on uh groups of entities and really it's not really about all the decision I made to build the app is where you have a running app with Spring Security enable with distributed Str a distributed trting enable if you wish so use it as a template when you need to build a app and this is what you know the spring uh pet clinic community is there for uh and you can see that um a lot of java developer and spring developer really use these uh really use these those repo to uh what I would like you to dc.com slash this guy so this is a reactive sample okay pretty neat but here you do have the react GS for the UI angular for the UI micros service cutl and it's not the same you know Cloud rest I use rest I my you know base code to work and I switch from this guy to the reactive one moving from MVC to web flux and changing the data model because I I'm using a noqu database but here you do have graphql you do have Cloud config data gdbc microservice config so if tomorrow you wish to start the app on Spring get a look at this community website um and contribute if you can um I think they are doing a great job by providing ready to go samples okay I was in Speed mode uh do we have a questions uh why not we modify the u d layer [Music] first um yeah yeah because you yeah yeah so I got your point so at the initialization in after set properties because I I spe specifically invoke subscribe yeah the the the overall um starting process we wait for these to be to be to be done yes mono object flux list yeah true and uh flux or or mono are really working like streams in the Java eight8 yeah you you get the map your reduce your uh you know um and the you know sometimes you are at you are very tempted to go back to streams and start doing um because you can stream as well flx uh but no you should avoid stream and stay in can because um yeah you don't want to block at any point okay all right so um we we went to the through the code the code review you do have the sample running on your uh on your Cloud instance not your laptop I hope it has been uh helpful to you and nevertheless you do have a working app now for you to use as a template and so this is The Logical architecture of the app okay um this is the one I've used and this is the one completely buil and started by GP for you and I uh what we did what morit did is find this guy as the sub module of this guy and so when you open uh your workspace with that this guy is already there it has been pulled as a g sub module I was not aware it was possible I find that pretty useful okay that's the database and that's stuff I did not enable on git pod it's working with Docker um but you can do that if you start the app locally oh for in so question about integration test so for integration test um of course you don't want them to block and so web flux provide a pretty nice web client so it's not the default HTTP client or iy sync HTTP client it's called Web clients and you do have the sample uh in the app in the SRC test Java thank you all for the session today and thank you toit especially to first to provide the nice giboard platform we're all using every Wednesday to to demonstrate what can be done on top of Kasra and also to be there today and to show and you know explain what is GB and what you can do with it yeah thank you that I that I could be here it was that was fun I really liked it yeah oh that's great and you know what we both of you are doing the same in a couple of hour so until then thank you very much all and see you next time by right all right see you and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops I have more room no more formats to change me on the
