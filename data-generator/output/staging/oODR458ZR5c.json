    "text": "yeah so today I'm going to talk about webassembly pretty pretty short overview so it should be you know my like five minutes maybe right so typically webassembly your think kind of thinking front end stuff which is odo is made for I'm gonna talk a little bit more about how webassembly could be used on the back end right it's kind of a different take on it I thought it was kind of interesting so I just kind of pitched an idea and he's like I'm good for it so I'm gonna give a good overview of webassembly kind of dive into some of the features of it and then focus mostly on the safety aspects of webassembly you can go pretty deep I don't want to keep you here for three hours so just keep a high level so just to start it off when we're talking about running web assembly in the backend it actually is a thing you can do today because Google Chrome has v8 JavaScript engine so does nodejs and actually there's projects going on to get open JDK which is the leading Java distribution plan on using v8 for the scripting API as well so you could actually view it well if you're on node you could do it today if you're on Java probably I don't like Java 12 or something like that might have that so even the Fuhrer ought not on any of those backends there's plenty of there's at least one Java sorry webassembly implementation written in C you could easily pull that into any as a librarian to just about any other language environment you had so with that we're going to talk a little bit about web assembly as for backends and is it a good idea is it a bad idea I kind of leave that up for you to decide I'm just gonna kind of lay out the the idea and see what you think and it's kind of a discussion starting point so web assembly it's obviously it's really fast there's actually some really compelling benchmarks out there so it'll take an algorithm write it in JavaScript write it again and C file down to web assembly and yeah you 20 X 30 X or performance improvement it's pretty compelling benchmarks out there so it's it's it's made its it's made this case for the web browser one of the ways that it gets those benchmarks is it focuses on being really really low-level language it's basically an abstraction over the CPU it's it's not high-level at all it's really as low as I can get without being totally tied to the CPU and so web browsers of course target mobile phones tablets laptops etc and so as such web assembly is focused on the CPUs that run on those platforms so there's two main CPUs what architectures IFAs there's armed which is kind of the RISC architecture kind of simplified and then Intel x86 x86 84 which is a lot bigger and more complex their web assembly is aimed at targeting both of them and these are pretty divergent ideas for microprocessors web assembly is kind of this abstraction over both of them and it's so much of an abstraction that people who are talking about running web symbol even on GPUs which is entirely different architecture all together so it's just it really is intended on being a an abstraction over CPUs when you do load a web assembly module well you don't load it web browser does one of the first things that the code will do is compile it so it goes through an explicit compilation step initially the initial implementations of web assembly several of them would actually ahead of time compile it right down to machine code I think I'm kind of getting the feeling that Firefox and Chrome have kind of left that idea and they're going to more of a just in time compiler model but either way it's the implementation is free too ahead of time compile it right to machine code which is kind of a compelling aspect of it actually so if someone comes to you and says oh I'm writing web assembly it's probably not true they're usually compiling down to web assembly you're usually going to write a sort of higher level language like rust or C or C++ or Fortran or cobol whatever whatever your flavor is but in terms of languages you can choose from you typically don't choose from ones that have got a garbage collector so JVM Python Ruby all those things are typically not options it comes down to basically do you do is language if a garbage collector and you don't want to ship the carbage collector with it there's no reason why you can't ship a garbage collector with these or there's no reason why you can't implement a garbage collector I mean so webassembly views memory just like the SEM the CPU views memory CPU views it's just one linear block of memory and you can run C or C++ you actually have to implement an allocator same thing you do with C and C++ or regular CPUs on the on the operating system and you can do the same thing but you can implement a garbage collector like JVM and you can absolutely implement the entire JVM for web assembly it's just a recompilation step in fact people do this it's just about every language the trouble is you actually have to download the entire environment every time you go to a page so it's like kind of dealing like a Java update every time Google comm yeah not a great user experience web assembly views so in terms of memory most CPUs divide memory into two parts there's the program memory in the data memory web assembly is it's pretty sharp divided so in the data memory you can you absolutely use raw pointers there's not a whole lot of data types with assembly and you use integers for pointers and they just be reference memory like you do in C C++ etc however in terms of program memory we're in like x86 you can jump to an arbitrary memory location like for instance and see have function pointers those are basically jumping to an arbitrary memory location you actually can't do that in webassembly you have to use like what's called a table so they have concept to deal with these things but this is kind of where the safety aspects of web assembly start appearing they disallow things caused corruption in security problems another another platforms these are these kind of safety features are built pretty deeply into webassembly it from the core from the start of the app the design is built from the beginning to be able to be formally verified right so again webassembly is meant to be an abstraction over CPUs very low level abstraction over CPUs and doesn't have the features of a language so you compare that with say the JVM bytecode there's opcodes in the JVM for allocating an object accessing a field different opcode for accessing a static property it's is very oriented around Java and you can of course build lots of other languages on it they have but they're all kind of they have to have some commonalities it's kind of a little bit constraining in terms of languages on the other hand webassembly they they did add concepts and tada on top of what a CPU uses but all the concepts they add are purely for the safety reasons so like the add yeah functions modules memories things like that and so for instance a web assembly memory like every module has a single block of linear memory they can access and we talked before you can grow that if you run out of memory or if you're you know really frugal you can actually you know release memory so you grow and shrink this memory but if you access for a he dereference a pointer outside of that memory it'll cause a crash and webassembly execution will just totally crash and the host environment can handle that so in this sense the sense we've talked about so far web assembly is pretty contained like if an error happens in module it's totally contained that module I can't corrupt memory of module next to it I can't corrupt the hosting host a hosting environment either it's totally sandboxed a single module is going to contain just your kind of your basic ideas right so functions are basically your your exports right so it's where the code resides you can you know call these functions kind of like you do in JavaScript or C and then of course you can import functions as well you can also important variables but so we're gonna go over a quick example of calling webassembly function so savor it and see from JavaScript in the host environment right so if you want to do this it's pretty straightforward you just call it like it any old JavaScript function super easy as long as you can kind of fit into the numeric types so you can really only pass or return integers or floating points which is a pretty big constraint usually you want to do you like strings array it's object something so you're pretty much always always stuck into passing or writing a whole bunch of wrapper code right so if you want to that doesn't like you know allocating memory inside the module you know let's go to the next flood we have a example right here so this this example is for the c standard library function sterlin which of course calculates the length of a string because in c we don't store the length we just calculate it every time so this is all JavaScript so if you're gonna read you'd write it in JavaScript actually it's typescript I like types so the red box there is that highlighting what the goal is where you can call our right there but the rest of it is just wrapper code so the first line would be we allocate some memory here okay so that is the literal C standard library function Malik Wright and webassembly doesn't provide these alligators again the C standard library includes an alligator you can like je malloc or whatever but since it takes and returns just numeric data types it's totally fine we can caught no no no wrapper code needed but we need to but we ended you to call malloc so we can allocate memory in the webassembly environment this is getting kind of clunky if you think about it right then you have to go copy the data from the JavaScript heap space into the web assembly environment so it's it's pretty clunky and of course you gotta you know free.they memory at the end which is had all that in it something quick example the other direction let's call the host environment call it a JavaScript function from C so if you look on the right there's a C header function header for calling the environment if you look at the seaside its char start our pointer and on the left is JavaScript and that's integer because that's how we represent pointers it's just point integer right and technically we could just reach into the memory location and just print it out except for it come out it's a whole bunch of numbers we want to print it up so it looks like a string so I actually have to do some utf-8 decoding right so if you look at this this is kind of terrible you don't actually want to do this so luckily enough there's plenty of rapper generators if you've been following webassembly from its origins and into its infancy and where it where does today you'll know plenty about in scripting they people have been using them scripting as a framework for compiling whatever C++ down into JavaScript in the early days and now it's to web assembly as well but the rust language has been really wonderful actually I'm keeping up with web assembly so they're there tooling is actually developing at a pretty good rate but one of the big takeaways I want you to take from this these couple of slides is is that web assembly is really really good at being fast and not really good at doing anything else you can run code really really fast but you can't really can't access the network you can't access file system you can't can't even access a timer which is great for security people or you know timing attacks but if you want it's not so great for for application developers right but it's nice so cuz it's purely a sandbox API like if so what looks based API is like you don't have anything in a web but simply module that I didn't explicitly give to you back I had to like write the wrapper code and literally import it into your module before you could actually use it so it's from a security posture it's actually kind of a neat way to think about it this is where I started thinking like oh what if we use this on the backend right so I kind of poked around and one of the big things you run into you I'm sure there's mostly back-end developers here so I don't explain the backend too much but the front-end you just you only really working with one user at a time right back in you got a deal with multi-tenancy right I thought well you can save your system up so you don't have to you but a lot of lot of us have to have to do this right so when the front-end were you worried about you know cross-site scripting and such the backend you also have to worry that every request is isolated from every other request and this is X goes pretty deep and it affects just about anything and so one of the big reactions when you tell back-end developer that you want to run third-party code inside of their trusted servers you're like no we're not doing that right and there's been things like web hooks that come up I would say more recently Amazon lambda well the whole server listing so all the functions google pad functions one of the big use cases for those actually callbacks and an integration like that I know I've used in the past for implementing API is that want to execute customer code inside of a trusted environment it actually works fairly well I generally just uses the network and operating system file permissions to kind of guard the system and keep it isolated so it's it's not as limited as web assembly but it functions mostly the same way I would say where it breaks down is if you have really high fan-out model where so you've got like one function r1 that's right one web request that ends up in like 20 30 100 200 lambda calls that gets gets not only expensive from the money side but also latency each of those lambda calls take a while right especially if you get a cold cold start right so I think we're webassembly comes in is like and what if we could do like the lambda thing that the in process callback but we'll do it in process instead of on a different machine right that's where it starts getting kind of interesting right and like I think we've all kind of become used to seeing something like this right I don't this probably doesn't even matter what language you work in you you've seen something like this I don't even see sharp people have seen this he just call it different things right but almost every language they work in these days has pretty rich API is based on the idea of passing functions and there's a whole bunch of applications this is really cracked open like it's actually a really compelling reasons a really compelling thing whoo it's already done for us in terms of api's like collection api's atomic data structures it's actually pretty crucial for that reactive streams I don't know if you've heard a quick check but it's actually a really cool thing she could tell the Google it getting heard of it I probably wouldn't even be possible without first-class functions so it's really revolutionized the way we've done programming today I think it really is worth looking into can we do this for webby api's it is rather compelling but one of the big reasons why we haven't of course is so far our web api has have been based on the idea of passing values from you know over the network right you had a network boundary you have to serialize whatever message you're going to send so that's kind of where it breaks down is you don't really want to send code while webassembly that's code we can serialize it right but then it gets a little good gets a little that's kind of where to talk cousin right so I know I've written api's that looked like this basically you know you want it you want to do some filters and some maps and so you end up implementing this like a whole bunch of different options on your URL query parameters and they can get that's pretty tiresome you do this once to do it twice and you're like I'm not doing it again is how much work there so so error-prone so of course graph QL came in and it's that's kind of where they they're more on the map step of that but they're also like the filter stuff I think is more punted towards the back end still but I think I think there's a lot of room for like what if we added first-class functions to graph you up something like that but I think that's a pretty compelling use case right but so just like it's kind of what if what if we could send a post request like well I would guess you'd want to send and get requests in this case I'm not really rest but what if you could do this right it'll be kind of interesting right so what if we used what could we create what could the api's of the future look like right it's kind of interesting interesting thing to think about until you realize we've actually been doing this for decades so like the spark spark Python API they've been sending function oh of course this one is a string since age is greater than 21 but that's really as a function mean it's a DSL right and you have to compile it to have to do the work of creating this language and compiling it down then the next next distributed system over does the same thing they do a little bit differently right same thing with Cassandra cql I don't know why I chose Cassandra this SQL is probably well more well known that's the same thing right I mean and the best part is the cql versus SQL there they do it a little bit differently you have to look you have to look at the documentation every time so we've been generating all these dsls they do it slightly differently be nice to standardize on you know passing actual color maybe I don't know it could help something outside of DSL so spark again but looking at the Scala api's this is kind of interesting to think about but they actually do pass code if you notice they're using actual lambda functions right and it's because they have they get well they get the jar sitting on both sides you're running around a JVM in both sides so in one sense they actually are passing code which is kind of interesting to think about and this is this is all getting pretty difficult right and I think one of the things I want to get to is none of this has probably doesn't lean itself doesn't lend itself well to open api is especially forcing like a JVM both sides or javascript in both sides which is another point I was going to bring up you could do the same thing with JavaScript as well like you can easily paste JavaScript into a Jason message and but you have to run JavaScript on the back end which I don't know if you want to do that so comes down to it web assembly could actually be a great way of serializing color so I think it's worth looking into so I'm gonna go through a couple examples of here's like a really naive way like how might you send code we're gonna start off the C code the the basic way to do it is just start off with writing C code into a file and then ya can set it so you'd be doing this on the client side right and you just compile it with GCC clang or whatever your favorite C compiler is and link it up into a web assembly binary and pokes it across the other side and they can execute over there of course I mean that's super awkward cuz you're running GCC in a browser it's kind of like running David JVM in a browser so maybe we should be sending the C source code plaintext source code it's probably a little more scalable model don't out so what I'm thinking is maybe I don't know why I came back to graph q out here but whatever it's on my mind I guess let's say there's a graphical function or actually be like an operation would like a RPC or something like that right it takes a string instead of a first-class function and then you just literally paste in C code right that could that could work I don't know we're just kind of tossing out ideas at this point so if just to run with us for a little bit and then back end you might have little templates it every now you just kind of paste that code in there voila compile run x-cubed boom done this could actually work in my work of course I just kind of threw in that compile step on the back end we already established that you know running running web assembly is safe we didn't talk about compilation but I this it's no horrible problem it's not insurmountable because we we can we can just compile the compiler down to live a sampling for all that safety all right I I think there's some of the transitive property continues there and so at this point I've been totally assuming that web assembly is completely safe I think there there are some holes in that argument I think when it comes down to like one of the big holes is you can extend the multi-tenant system right you can execute code for too long unbounded execution so they're current that currently is definitely a hole with this whole thing but it wouldn't I looked into the the v8 source code it doesn't seem too difficult to add like a time bound execution of course you gotta confuse people it's worth adding I don't leave this talk is for but you can start this conversation anyway this is kind of a total aside but we have to talk about what language you might want to send this code in right we've been using C as an example so far I could work I I don't know if people really want to be writing C if we're talking about a lot of web developers and memory management so yeah C is kind of seen as being hard webassembly obviously we just mentioned in several slides ago it's for robots right so probably don't want to use any of those directly however I did run into this thing called assembly script if you're familiar with typescript if you can compile an assembly script program it will also run through the typescript compiler which means you can target literally both JavaScript and web assembly that's starting to get a really interesting flag so yeah something we need to consider like is this is this actually a useful technology I think it probably would be right we could start sending Jason and then I think first-class functions in there right that's kind of an interesting idea so something to think about so just to kind of recap what we've gone over today I think that we've established that webassembly is mostly a safe place to run on drastic code I think so functional api's I think they're definitely established that they're they provide a lot of value with for us today and I think web EPA is probably you know might seem valued there are two and then kind of the the to do note here is we got to figure out a good serialization code format assembly script might be it looking into you but anyway I want to leave you all with this message just let's go talk to each other maybe see if this can become a real thing I think it's interesting to think about see what we can do so if you're looking for more information we've got webassembly org they've got I actually found out this idea that I hate this whole slide you know it's talk it's not even new they thought of it like years ago so I thought it was like a brand new idea it's not there's tons of information up on webassembly org also the Russ programming language if you do anything with webassembly rust always comes up because they've got a really great tool chain for it and it's improving at a really rapid pace - they put it putting a lot of effort into them finally you've been a great crowd thanks for listening oh right you can contact me and there's my Twitter and email address right I started working at Kensei yesterday as a new startup in town it's kind of fun machine learning you can contact me and talk me about whatever you want to talk about Thanks you [Applause]",
