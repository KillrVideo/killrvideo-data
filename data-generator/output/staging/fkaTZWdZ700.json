    "text": "on this episode of the distributed data show we're gonna talk about a matter of grave national even international importance I mean not talking about global warming okay I'm talking about application development how are we gonna be able to do that in one Episode oh no no it's a series from date step this is the distributed data show a bunch of episodes about use cases and that makes sense because people need to use a database and to actually do real things with it and I love to hear those use cases we had a bunch of great conversations at developer days with people this fall right right but we heard a lot from them about the kinds of you know lots of questions they didn't say hey make a distributed data show about topic X but they come up to us with the questions right so like what kinds of things that we've been hearing so I think that's kind of the whole basis around what our job is really all about which is devil developer advocates we're we're out there in the community working with our customers our users or developers basically anyone who's trying to be successful you know with our product and with Apache Cassandra so being out there talking to them and some of the things I think that we heard the most about was about application development and actually you know using the database to actually get something done that's right yeah that's right so why would why would I learn about a distributed database anyway right I'm like okay some people might find it intellectually stimulating but most of us are just trying to build something right so that I mean obviously so I thought maybe let's do like I don't know three months worth of episodes about application development I mean we got that asked that many questions that's true about about different topics from different people so maybe a good way to think about this is the application development lifecycle and no I'm not gonna start with like old-school classic waterfall where we talk about requirements for three months okay okay so we're gonna go a jille yeah okay so we're trying to dive right into it but even so um I do think data model probably a good place to start yeah what do you think I think so your interface design no they don't if you're gonna start with square one what is it that you need to know you need to know how to model your data right I definitely think we should start there for sure okay so what are we gonna talk about in this series because we have tons of content on data sacks Academy about and like whole course is about data modeling but what in particular we hear about from developers the number one question that we seem so we get quite a like you said we have quite a lot of resources around data modelling and we get a quite a variety of questions but the number one question that we always seem to get it's always around data modelling for time series data right so especially with all yes so with all like the IOT applications that are out there right now I mean time series is huge so I think we're definitely gonna have some blog posts yeah and maybe a follow-on episode with possibly myself and our coworker ceedric yeah that may be something coming here very shortly yeah we're working on that I certainly hope that I'm looking forward to your blog series because really good at time series that's it's a one of the most frequently kind of categories of or patterns of use cases so we hear about it all the time there's definitely some best practices for that right okay so we're ready to start coding once we have a data model but we have to pick a programming language right that we're gonna implement things in so what do we have to choose from if we're using Cassandra did a sacs Enterprise right well that's one question but the other question is also if I'm gonna be building an application from scratch yeah I probably want to be working with one of the like the newest and hottest trendiest languages right and so that really brings to my mind the language go okay that a super new super trendy now we don't actually have a driver for data stacks or Cassandra for go but Adrian has been investigating the community investigating this language and he's going to give us a lot more information about it getting started would go cql is wildly easy all you have to do is throw in the standard go get github / goes CQ l go CQ l and then upon adding that library reference we can set up the new cluster with various public IPs here however that's setup we just issue a key space create command create the tables as we need and we can go to writing all of the CQ l querying that we want so stay tuned and we're gonna talk about more of what you can do with go CQ l apache cassandra and data stacks enterprise so let's talk about a driver that we do have for both data stacks enterprise in apache cassandra and that's also one of my favorite languages to code in Python that's right so we've been doing some work around that so do you want to tell us a little bit about what we've been working on yes okay so python super popular I had never done any app dev in Python before and it's now what is it number two you now unlike the most popular languages you know I've seen I think it's kind of it's all over the place and I think I've read one article inside in 2018 it was the number one language first language of the way so not only app development but also data science and that's really I think what's pushing it to the top spot so as a way of working it into working myself into this I I thought maybe you and I you know Python I don't know Python let's work together on a killer video implementation yep in Python yeah so that's what we're doing I don't know how how much do we scoop right now of our episode on that ooh well maybe we'll just talk about few of the high point yeah give me some high point okay we're gonna talk about how easy it was okay fun is so easy to use that's true I found a bunch of libraries that like help me do things yes like I don't know validating an email address it was like yeah there's a library for that exactly but then there's some parts that aren't so easy right like setting up your environment with all those dependencies that do all those cool things that you also have to have your system all set up for that I may have messed up Amanda a couple of times with my dependency additions so so we'll talk about that for sure the easy and the not so easy some really cool integrations that we did yes yes the for the first time we've introduced Kafka into the killer video stack so there's some cool possibilities with that because inventing is a key part of what what the killer video application does and we've done in memory messaging frameworks up until now this is the first time that we've actually used something that goes outside across applications so anyway I feel like I'm doing that the Python episode now so let's stop we'll put well tie a bow on that and we'll come back to it later though up-and-coming Python something that we're really digging into super popular yeah there's the old standby of Java yes right and we acknowledge that most application development done using Cassandra is Java great big surprise right right so I think we're gonna have a follow-on episode that's gonna focus just on the best practices with using Java driver excellent yeah and Erik's gonna tee us up for that he's really been digging into things like when do you use lightweight transactions how to set consistency levels when to use retries there's a bunch of tips and tricks that he's gonna share with us we're gonna talk about lightly transactions how to use them some of the caveats around of the pain points they solve and just generally trying to be successful in your implementation okay so we've picked an implementation language maybe it's Java and especially if you're in the Java world you're probably looking at using an application development framework why because it's gonna make your job so much easier if you can kind of use this boilerplate code especially if you're doing something like microcircuits you can start to use a spring boot that's really popular we see a lot of that usage but I said spring and there's another aspect of that that we get asked about a lot do you know what I'm talking about Spring data Cassandra so we get asked about this a lot as a framework David Gilardi is gonna dig into this for us a little bit and really get to the bottom of what's going on there what are the best practices for using that should you use it at all so spring boot is a really easy way to enjoy spring into your java application with minimal setup we're gonna have on a special guest who's really gonna dig into the why and how of spring boot then we're going to discuss spring data Cassandra and okay so generally in the past I have recommended to not use spring data Cassandra for various reasons and but over time I've used of kind of changed on this involved a little bit there are actually a set of good reasons why many development teams may choose to use something like spring data Cassandra so we're gonna discuss those reasons and then we're gonna look at some things though that you really need to watch out for in some later videos so the next framework that we're gonna focus on is one that's very new to me I know just very high-level all about it which is J hipster yeah super trendy super trendy could be like a really cool store or it could be a framework but basically it's gonna get you started from very quickly you have your front end all the way to your back end yes in your application but that's that's really honestly all I know about it so I'm really excited for ceedric to come and just teach us more about how to actually how to actually dive in and use it yeah I'm looking forward to that one this season to help you building application on top of Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise I will introduce you the deep stuff framework it's a scaffolding tool that will generate for you a full working application based on your entities you can ping among multiple technologies both for front-end and persistence and it's a very good way to bootstrap your project we also have a very special guest on the show so stay tuned yes so we love all these frameworks that help us rapidly develop and prototype applications and you know get take away some of the grunt work of building out that infrastructure and all the plumbing that hooks everything together we also get asked a lot about Cassandra plus-x fill-in-the-blank right what if I want to use Cassandra with spark or what else Cassandra with solar Apache Solr we hear that quite frequently a lot of people talk about using a separate search cluster things like that yeah we also hear a lot about using a graph engine yes that's right integrating with Apache tinker pop okay so I think we're gonna have a really great episode with Denise talking about all these integrations especially focused on Apache tinker pop and graph okay so we've talked a lot about integrations right but let's let's just get down to it let's get our application out into production let's actually get somebody using this thing so what okay wait a minute wait a minute okay what about testing are we gonna test the application yes before we go to production yes are we gonna test in production I mean maybe that's your thing I don't know but a little bit about so alex is gonna give us a little bit of the state of the art in testing he's gonna cover the gamut from unit testing integration testing user interface testing he's gonna cover it all we will speak about testing continuous integration and continuous delivery if you want to build your application reliable and have no box or downtime and protection that's exactly the thing you need and if you are afraid to deploy on Friday you do need it see you soon okay so we spent this whole episode and we haven't talked about the most trendy thing in all of tech and that's oh you did not yeah I had to bring it up I had we had you can't have a whole episode without talking about kubernetes oh yeah we can't have an old application development series I guess about without talking about deployment using kubernetes exactly I might be persuaded that we should cover that you talked me into it so let's do it okay okay don't get in somewhere okay good we the cycle the application life cycle developing and deploying our application I buy it yeah okay I think it's gonna be good I think I think that kind of wraps up this episode but we really want to thank all our special guests that have appeared on this episode with us and of course all the guests that we're going to see in the future episodes of this series that's right and we're going to try to get our social media game going get some questions out to you some opportunities for you to feed some questions to our guests so that we can surprise our guests with those questions on the fly and see how they react awesome till next time [Music] [Music]",
