    "text": "hi this is Jeff Carpenter and I'm here with David gilardi we're on the technical evangelist team here at datastacks and we'd like to talk to you about the killer video reference application now in a prior video we chatted with Luke Tillman about the history of killer video and then we talked about where you and I David are taking it moving forward I want to talk a little bit with you about what you've been doing with the Java implementation of killer video now there was a prior Java implementation of the service apis the service layer for killer video that our colleague DUI Hai Juan did so that was in a pre-existing job implementation and that was based on his Achilles object mapper which is kind of grown into its own framework yeah and then you did some work to transition that to using the data Stacks driver uh the the DSE driver data sax Enterprise driver specifically so you can talk about your goals for that particular implementation of that Java layer of killer video yeah so um so as you just mentioned like one of the goals that you know the Achilles version uh used the Cassandra driver right it was using the Cassandra specific driver right and one of the goals we have for the killer video project in general uh not just the driver project is to get everything up on the DSE versions of the drivers um and because well yeah so part of that is because we we are moving the killer video app forward to start exercising a lot of the newer DSE features uh like in DC 5.1 and everything that are specific to the DSE driver um so part of the goal there with moving the you know creating our own version or forking off and then kind of porting our version into the DSE version is to have a DSE core driver version of the Java implementation right okay so that was the project yeah port to DSE driver uh what what parts of that were the most interesting to you to work on well let's see there there was actually all sorts of it um I mean putting putting aside the Java version just for a moment um and we did talk about this a little bit in some of the other videos right um the the microservice architecture you know some of that piece uh that we like I said we mentioned with Luke um getting into that and getting into how all that worked with Docker and stuff that was actually quite interesting that was one of the neatest Parts but in the core Java code right one of the most interesting Parts by far uh uh was the asynchronous pieces because in all in all frankness and that kind of deal I did not come into this with a ton of a synchronous programming knowledge that just wasn't something that uh you know I had worked on before so coming into the project and then having to look at that between not only the Java version but the c-sharp version the node.js version and kind of like you know figure out how all that worked how do I put this together um that was definitely one of the most interesting pieces as a matter of fact too um I was specifically you know trying to follow as closely as I could to the data Stacks documentation that we provide on actually how to do all this so it was just a big learning experience um so even though there were a ton of a ton of really interesting aspects I think the asynchronous piece was so you've gone a couple places there that I want to dig in and explore a little deeper one of them is that polyglot language perspective where you're actually working on multiple language implementations of the same services at the same time so did that kind of inform like you were learning one thing from one language with which you were able then to bring into the other language implementation or how did that work yeah absolutely matter of fact uh that you know Luke Luke Tillman had you know work he he's the one who punched the uh the node.js version out and the c-sharp version actually and so it was kind of nice because I was able to go to those and and this is for anybody who's looking at any of the versions that we have out there I highly recommend go take a look at some of the other versions because I was able to use what he had done in both C sharp and node.js to help me kind of inform and guide in certain directions that I went especially the asynchronous programming piece right right because one of the goals we had was to make sure that you know all the transactions everything it was all fully asynchronous and that was working properly and such so I was able to use what he had there um as a guide because the the Java implementation like when you start getting into um at least as far as I'm concerned like when you compare say a completable future and the way that you do certain you know synchronous programming in Java compared to the implementations I saw in node node.js and c-sharp it's a little more complex in the Java when it's a lot more straightforward than the other ones right that syntax is a little bit more tricky yeah yeah so that was something that I had to really go through and figure out so yes I was able to use the other versions in that case again as a nice reference point but then the other part of it too from like an Insight standpoint is now being able to look you know look at the driver across the board look at it for all these different languages and and see kind of like maybe subtle nuances and differences and and something you mentioned about the the polygon polyglot piece of it is you know in the organization that I came from before I came to data Stacks right it was absolutely normal through Acquisitions or Earth or anything for us to have multiple applications not just all in Java or not just on T sharp they were all in you know an amalgam of all these right um and so it was kind of normal for anyone who uh was on our engineering team to have to be full stack and have to know multiple languages and how to do this across the board so that kind of like that ended up kind of being one of the directions is we wanted to get everything to parity right so we have the versions that had similarities between them so someone could look at any one of them see how we're doing in the DSC driver across the board right and in that way it would help those developers who might be in that situation where they do have multiple languages they have to worry about now they can reference multiple multiple reference apps as well that are going to be similar and build yeah that's and that's excellent I I and one of the things that calls out to me is that our driver team has done an excellent job of having parity across the different drivers the different language drivers there doesn't tend to be one that's way ahead of another I feel by and large they are across the board offering the same capabilities with the same kind of paradigms for interaction which makes it possible for you to do what you're doing and having the applications work the same yeah because you're right it's not as if we always have that luxury on a project of being able to say all the services are going to be in this language on top of this platform I mean even if you have uniformity in the infrastructure that you're using it's inevitable that one team is gonna do a version upgrade of this of this or that library before the other I mean we we live in a world in which you're gonna have to adapt to languages infrastructures Etc from Project to project or even service to service yeah so that's a great skill set to have okay so I think we've covered that point pretty well yeah uh what I thought is that maybe you want to show us a little bit of what you've been doing with the code itself can we do that can we look at the source code is that can you oh look at oh oh I think they just did it I think we're allowed to do they totally did it now we're in okay we're in the source all right we're looking at some Source that's great okay okay give us a shot well okay so I mean we're not gonna the whole plan of this is not to like dig into the actual source code that you see here but one of the things I do want to point out is notice this nice these nice wall Comet walls of text if you will that I have um throughout the code just to just to kind of point out a lot of the times I was purposefully putting these walls of text in when there was something interesting going on a lot of times I would be referencing links that maybe reference you to the driver documentation or something along the lines because there were there were a lot of scenarios right that I came across and one one example I gave I thought this one was pretty neat so you've got uh say prepared statements right and you've got the query Builder you've got one way to to put queries together but you also have the mapper right right and one of the things I didn't find out till later and I just found this to be so interesting is that when you use the mapper it actually creates a prepared statement for you in underneath the hood right so as long as you are reusing that essentially kind of reconstituting that same query with the mapper it'll automatically create that prepared statement for you right that's really neat now that's a little bit different approach than say creating prepared team it's like this is what I'm actually doing right here I'm actually creating a prepared statement that I'm going to bind later right right right you know um and again I'm not going to go and show all the detail that um but it's just a different approach that you can do and there are cases where I actually had um one where I was doing uh batch inserts right where I actually combined uh one query Builder a prepared statement with you know a bind later in my um in my batch along with a query that I built with the mapper and the way that it works it actually worked flawlessly was really neat so it was just like little tiny things that I was kind of finding out as I was going through the code so anyway the main point of that little die tribe there is look for chat you know if you're if you're checking this out look for those walls or comments and everything usually when I put those in there I was putting them for very specific reasons reasons so I can kind of point out something that was done something that might be interesting and and trying to kind of facilitate a set of examples of different things that might happen in the real world yeah and I love what you've done with those because it's really uh it's not like most source code that you find um you know so in that sense maybe it isn't realistic my source code always has comments it's no I mean it's particularly well commented in the you know the quality of you are doing a little bit of teaching or instruction there about yeah what it is that you're doing it's not just uh I got this cookie cutter cut and paste stuff that I grabbed from the driver manual it's like there's actual thought behind it and then you're explaining what you're doing with references back to the documentation you know right and to add to that to that point I mentioned kind of earlier that a lot of the times I was purposely while I was doing this project I was purposely using the the data Stacks driver documentation while I was going through for my examples and everything there are definite parts of code in here you'll be like man he lifted that right off the documentation page yes I did that's exactly what I did because I wanted to kind of eat your own dog food thing I was I was trying to go out go about it exactly how right our you know our documentation team the driver team and everything was spelling it up for us in the dots so a lot of times when you see the links I've referenced that's what I'm doing I'm referencing the actual stuff that I was using as a reference to to build everything so we went pretty far down into the source code here why don't you kind of pull us back up to the surface a little bit and give us some context where we find this oh yeah so let's pop over um to the uh to the killer video GitHub page so if you go to github.com killer video you can see it up here in my bar then that will bring you to the to the whole killer video project in GitHub now notice too it's not just Java right we have all the service implementation all the microservices the web UI all the stuff that we're using to put all this stuff together is right there and then if you go to killer video Java right this is the GitHub repo for the Java version um feel free to you know to uh to to clone it use it comment you know suggest changes whatever give us your feedback yeah we are accepting contributions absolutely excellent well I appreciate you uh giving us this little bit of a guided tour of the source code and the GitHub page David look forward to adding more and more features to that killer video implementation coming soon graph and some other great things yeah absolutely we're not done at all this is an ongoing project we have a matter of fact you just mentioned at the very next project I'll be working on is some graph content so we're going to start pulling graphing and really pushing into some of the DSE 5.1 features all right well until next time thank you for watching thank you",
