    "text": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you hello and welcome to our workshop on application development using Astra Astra's data sacks Cassandra is a service offering which is great because it gives you all the features of Cassandra like speed scalability and availability with none of the hassles I'm your host today WOB your hosts with Adrian hall I'm in developer relations and he's a cloud architect with the Astra team we also have a couple of developer advocates helping us in the background they'll be answering questions for you on discord are our advocates like a good challenge so make sure you give them some real tough stumpers they're in discord let's take a second go over our agenda for our workshop today first of all we're going to cover some housekeeping stuff to help you get up to speed and working with workshop then we'll show you how to create an Astor database we'll actually you'll get your own instance of Astra so that you will have a version of Cassandra that you can play with then we'll dig into the api's for accessing Astra this will include the REST API and the graph QL API and then we'll wrap up by giving you some additional resources that you can use to further your your learning journey there are a few different things that we're going to use today first you'll have the live video stream that you're seeing here and then you'll also be using Astro which we talked about which is the Cassandra is a service offering you'll use that your browser will be using as part of the tools caddy coda to do the exercises this is a browser-based sandbox that Oh Riley has that allows us to interact with the the terminal and and with Astron so forth to do the exercises through your browser so you don't have to install anything on your computer we also have Kord we're we're answering questions for people that's where David and Eric Z lo are feel free to ping them and ask them with any questions you have and then we also have materials here that you can download from github the get github URL is listed here but I think the dev advocates have also posted that in the discord channel as well so that'll include the slides and some JavaScript that Adrian's put together let's help get set up here what we'd suggest to do is create a few different tabs in your browser the first to an up here that we're showing in the top left of the screen is for the video stream that you're watching right now and then in another tab what you can do is you can open discord so you can answer ask an answer question have questions answered in there will create a third tab then we'll put cata kohta in there you can see the URL here and I think it's also posted in the discord channel caddy coda comm slash data stacks and then from there you can go into the getting started with Astra course and we'll be using those exercises also if you want to open a terminal you can download you can clone the github repo and get the slides and so forth there as well okay I think we'd like to start today with a survey this will give us a chance to get to know you a little bit so we can tailor our our content towards you as an audience to do that you can either download the men Demeter app on your phone or you can go to mentee com now the code that'll ask you to type in is eight three four four seven six so if you'll go there now and enter that code and then we'll go ahead and start the survey let me start sharing my screen now maybe I can figure out how to do that here let's see Hadrian you may need to stop sharing and stop sharing yeah I think so give me a chance there you go all you okay we you guys can see that okay yeah okay I'm starting to see people are getting on go ahead and give us a thumbs up and we'll kind of watch the count here as we let people get connected it's like we're about 50 now this is where I would probably normally tell my dad jokes but I think my boss is texting me and telling me to stick to the script so maybe I better not do that it was just a second to get people in connected here okay let's go over to the next slide here go ahead one more time hit me with a thumbs up one more time really quickly and let's see how many people yeah it sounds like we've got a truck coming through okay this is looking good so it's like we've got about 50 people here let's go ahead and we'll start with the first question here let me unlock it okay go ahead and tell us how much experience you've got here it says bohtan is closed I don't understand that I'm looking at on men Demeter huh I don't understand [Music] there we go I get it okay looks like I finally got there sorry about that ceedric makes this look a lot easier than it is ok looks like we've got a lot of people that have very little experience and that's great that's exactly who we're we're looking to talk to you today let's head on to the next question here is your employer currently using Cassandra looks like a lot of people are actually using kisana and their employers are using it Cassandra at work that's great okay that gives us a general idea there let's move to the next question what development languages do you use you can I think you can select multiple of these here so if you use more than one looks like a lot of Java we've got a COBOL guy here that's amazing we got two COBOL guys oh boy now everybody's jumping on the COBOL man bandwagon okay cool that looks pretty good let's go to the next question if there were any of our workshops before looks like we've got some returners pretty-pretty balance though so welcome to those of you that are here for the first time let's try the next one are you here for personal reasons or is this part of your business that is an interesting pie chart representation yeah it's like we're getting about 1/3 business and 2/3 personal very good okay let's try that that's it that's the end of our mentee survey we appreciate it let me see if I can figure out how to get back to you Adrian you take over from here cool all right so that was that was fun with minty first thing we're gonna do today is get a database created on Astra the first thing if you haven't already done this go out to asteroid data stacks comm slash register and it will let you register to create a database with your github or you can sign up with email pretty standard signup experience in that regard or you can use your Google account then after that you'll be brought to a screen if it's your first sign up and it will be the screen that you create a database with you brought there automatically to create your first database there's just a few pieces of information that you'll need to enter here one is make sure you have pre tier selected so that you're using your free database then pick your location which will be preferably it'll be the location that is closest to wherever you are geographically so if you're in Europe pick the European one if you're in the US pick the US location and then the database details now for the examples that we're going to be working through talking about and using in cata koda I have named the database better BOTS the user is better bot and my location is US East so if you name your database that it's a little easier to follow along in cata Kota and just in the general examples because I reference and speak to better BOTS whenever I'm referring to the key space or the database and better bot as the username so in the situation where you may have used your free tier database already the easiest thing to do is to delete that database however if you have a database like let's say killer video or something there already you can still use that database and the tables were adding and other things that we work with in this workshop you'll be able to use that database for that too you'll just have some extra extraneous tables and a little bit of data in those tables that's all so no no big deal if you just want to use an existing database but if you just signed up you can create the better BOTS one instead and when you sign up and create launch database you'll see this screen pop up little green bar that states that the database is initializing and you'll see as the database starts to become an active live database the little one database number will uptick just once and eventually as this finishes the screen will populate and you'll get connection details and cluster details the connection details have very important information that we will use throughout this workshop namely the API access section there is a REST API and a graph QL API these are bits of text that you can copy using the little copy icon there on the little double rectangle there and it basically copies the URL that you will need that has the cluster ID the region wherever you've created the database like US East one or the European location if you're there and then slash API restor slash API graph QL up above names the key space just in case you ever forget what your key space name is you've created it's right there the user name is there and also an option to reset the password if you ever need to reset your password then on the cluster details it shows some very basic information about the cluster itself how much storage is used which region again a US East one total storage loud and capacity units replication factor that's some information that we'll talk about in subsequent workshops and if you have selected the free tier you will see at the bottom the very important bits of information that you're paying zero dollars an hour for this database so now I'm gonna give everybody about two minutes or so if anybody's having any issue with the database creation or any questions please ask now and we'll just we'll give everybody a minute or two to get their database started up if you're in discord also note that we'll be posting other things such as the links to the material that we're working on also some other extras different resources and things like that so as Steve mentioned earlier open that up in a tad you know break it out however you can on your screen makes it easier to follow along or ask questions Steve you know those specific details of what's on the Academy ring I think it's it's pretty minimal at this point right I think they're putting together something even as we speak if I'm not mistaken so you know stay tuned the key materials we have so far especially being that we literally just released Astra days ago it's hard to keep track these days of the day but it's it's been only just some odd days since we went full GA and Astra has been made generally available by proxy that we are still working on a lot of great materials that we'll be publishing over the coming weeks and months to data stacks Academy we have a blog series called better BOTS which will give you the links to that in discord and be posting them in the github repo and some other places so those would be pretty easy to get to and we published to various mediums for that series too on dev to medium or the data stacks blog itself so you can kind of pick which medium you want to read to consume that information a go you may just want to it looks like there was a question discord you may want to just briefly summarize the steps in creating database one more time all right let's actually will briefly go backwards and do that so when you log in if it's your first login you'll be sent directly to the screen where you basically get this it's it's an empty form for the database where you'll add your location and the database details what I did for the particular database that we'll be using in this example named it better but username is better bot and I picked us East one however at the question has popped up you have a killer video database already as your primary database you can keep that one there you'll just need to make sure that you change the database name and key space name in any of the examples as you work through them because the examples are set up to work against better BOTS with the username a better buy but it's pretty easy I'll point them out as we go through and mention that here's where you would put killer video instead of better BOTS if you have that database instead but no problem adding tables to the killer video example if you just want to keep that database in place and again just to go over it once you hit launch database you'll see this screen and it'll sit there for a minute or two as the database is created then you'll be presented with the actual specific connection details where you won't want to keep this page available so that you can check out your REST API and graph QL API links there you'll be able to copy them by just double-clicking on the little rectangles there or you can highlight it and hit ctrl C or right-click and most browsers will let you choose to copy the URI address so there's multiple options there to copy that into memory whenever you need that and then of course cluster details just States a few bits of information about the database itself looks like we're doing pretty good no other questions I see popping up its the police fun keeping track of a five different chat channels at the same time all right we're gonna where to keep moving along here all right so we covered housekeeping material Steve good job on that thanks for keeping us abreast of everything we have created our first database so now we have a we have a full Pachi Cassandra database in Astra ready to work for us pretty awesome feeling honestly if you've ever interacted with Apache Cassandra before this this is just like a breath of fresh air as you see how easy and quick you can get a full Apache Cassandra database up and running so the first thing we're going to take a look at in this course is the API s and that's the main focus of this course we other material where we were talking about Apache Cassandra specifically we'll be talking about cql we'll be talking about distributed systems and all sorts of advanced topics the 401 301 201 level topics in this course this workshop we're going to specifically be talking about the api's that are now available on Astra specific to Astra available for the online database the first one we're covering is rest so a little bit of just a quick and big emphasis on quick overview of what rest is it stands for representational state transfer the origins of it if you ever want to dive in real deep you can definitely do this there's a lot of academic papers Roy fielding originally wrote this and one of his dissertations or in his dissertation I mean the basic idea is that the URL at least in context of how we're using rest is the URL provides access to resource identifiers based on app object / object name etc and you interact with things using HTTP using the put post get etc using the verbs that are available at HTTP the other notion is in our case we're using a JSON payload these are also stateless services so these things within your application when you're using rest services you would manage your state in various states on the client-side but overall the app the API itself is stateless you send information you get information and you are done in that interaction the way our rest interface is built is designed to reference the database from a key spaces tables and rows perspective so when we are interacting with a key space it will be the base URI the one that we showed in the connection details where you can copy it there and then we'll reference the key spaces if we're working with key spaces tables if we're working with tables and rows if we're working with tables and yes we will get into that more and I have to memorize that at this very moment just speaking conceptually about how this API works the first thing we're going to do is to simply use the REST API one of the easiest ways to do that is to use Curl Curl is available on linux mac OS you can get it on Windows it's generally available via whatever CLI out-of-the-box with whatever system you have it's also very easy to install and we're just going to use that for our first examples so the way we do that as stated in the connection details you can just copy this but let's talk about the base URI what that is so we start off with the database ID - region and then we have apps aster dev data stacks comm and then slash API for the rest interface it's slash API slash rest for the graph QL interface it's slash API slash graph QL one of the actual links what it would look like is that example there the database ID is basically kind of a UUID identifier then you see the region and the rest of the URI after that here you see I've just cut the variable there for base URI down to a minimum a little bit there with rest we then designate the version of rest right now we are at v1 so it's /v 1 slash key spaces then we would designate the key space we're working with which in the case of killer video that would be killer video in the case of better BOTS you'd put better BOTS right there were key spaces and then if we're interacting with tables we would extend that and continue on into tables /table /dataarray and again I have a little example right below that just showing what a real-life uri endpoint would look like for interacting so and then in the curl request the next thing we were going to need to do is we'd add the header details and auth token so when we start working through the when you start working through the catechol you'll see the specific header details and auth token a lot of that will be provided for you so it's it's pretty straightforward but there's two elements that are needed for the REST API and both of the API is really whether you're using rest or graph QL you designate the content type and then you have your Cassandra token which I'll show you how to get in just a moment and it's just set in there as a header detail within the HTTP content and then finally we need to build the body of what we're trying to do whether it's create a table or add a row of data or something like that this would look like this for example it's a JSON blurb of stuff where you state key value pairs within the JSON as JSON is formatted and you basically have criteria outlined of what action and what data you want to interact with or give to the database or request from the database or something like that so with rest it's a combination of the URI as we just talked about wikispaces of tables rows and then the blob of data depending on if you're trying to give it data to save or something like that and then you send in that request you get a response back with whatever pertinent data is available so with that let's get into katakana the first example which I'm going to actually pull up so you can see go up to cata Kota dot-com slash data stacks and it's the getting started with Astra course navigate into there and you will see the two cata coded scenarios that we're going to be working through this first one we'll work with is the REST API scenario so I'm going to give everybody a chance to start working through that themselves and as you go please ask any questions in discord twitch or YouTube and we'll answer those as we work through together hey it's probably worth pointing out that the first scenario there and the course is basically how to set up your Astra account we've already covered that that is starting with actually the second one yep so the Astra REST API service is the one you want to click on so at the beginning to use the catacomb a scenario the way we've set this up to make it a little bit easier is we set up some initial environment variables so there's the base URI which you can copy the content just like I did where you click on this and you'll see the little double paperclip there highlight and then you can just paste it in then within that base URL you want to navigate out to your Astra database I guess I need to Oh Chrome I'll just click on my database grab the rest API endpoint and then in here and paste that in and then actually remove the API rest so that we just have the base URI where the cluster ID and the region are available in the URI hit enter and that sets the base URI environment variable within our environment within catta coda hadrian ya know some some people will need to create Kathy Kota accounts so that's taken an extra minute or so just so you know oh yes I'll actually give everybody another couple minutes to knock that out cata Kota is another location where we will be providing a lot more additional material around not just the api's but also Apache Cassandra itself database query with Apache Cassandra and all sorts of other course material around getting familiar with and getting deeper into the technical parts of Apache Cassandra and using the database yes Prescott you will need to create an account Steve and I are just hanging out giving everybody a chance to get that cat ACOTA account up and running looks like looks like we're swapping data Kota a little bit so we'll have to be patient about trying to get everybody in yeah just with everybody jumping into it it spins up a lot of containers and stuff one thing I love about these workshops is seeing everybody's avatar and nicknames and discord and twitch creative bunch as humans that sounds good if get an error that says sorry it looks like something has gone wrong inside of cata Koda refresh it and try again and it should should work out the issues as everybody steadily gets logged in with their examples there was a question about the rest user rest underscore user and I will talk about that in just a second actually I'll go ahead and talk about it why not so in this example here where you see rest user and rest pass that is where you will need to put your username and password that you created when you set up your database so in Astra you can see your user name here in this case I made my better bot and your password is here so I'm gonna go ahead and go over this once just while everybody's setting up their cata Kota example etc as you get in this is your first step where you need to set up the environment variables and I just set up the base URI right here then the next step is to get the token this is where we're talking about getting an authorization token to be able to access the API for graph QL or rest what we'll do is we'll copy this it's just a curl command with the JQ make it a little easier and you'll need to go back and put in your username and password and yes I'm gonna I love working with everybody so I'm just gonna give everybody my password here like that and then put in my username just like this you execute that the curl command execute against the API with that username and password and gets an authorization token that authorization token is limited by a TTL okay time to live which means that after a certain amount of time when it's unused it will be deleted it will be removed so whenever you go into work through another session of chrome request or you're writing code against it or whatever you need to take into account that these are time-based so a new request to initiate new session work will need to be done during that time in this case this is my authorization token right here and what I'll do is I'll just copy this export token I'll paste it in here like this and within those single quotes I will take this ID this authorization token I mean and put it in there like that then just to make sure that I have my token and my base URI saved appropriately I can click on this section within katha coda the cool thing in cata coda is it will execute it over in the terminal for me so just as I click on this boom it executes sit in the terminal and it just prints out the base URI which I just saved as an environment variable and the token over here so those are set now and click on continue and be sure to click on continue not the little arrows up here at this point buddy have any questions did any any issues pop up while you executed that that's really kind of that the toughest part of this exercise making sure you get the base URI right right right yeah it is it is key to the whole rest of the flow apologize if my keyboard is loud I am one of those mechanical keyboard people so let's hear we have a few questions now what was it you know so the error that says JQ : error at standard input cannot index number with the auth token that is an error that most likely is because the base URL was incorrect so when you export the base URL make sure that it is exactly like what we entered here at the very top of this example which if I bounce back through it's very specific that anything after comm needs to be removed so there needs to be no trailing slash or anything like that and the reason for that is in the example here where it does the curl request the curl requests concatenates the API rest v1 off on to the end of the base URI all the interactions we have to do are concatenated on to the tail end of that URI in this particular example too let's let's talk about what we just did so we sent this request via curl via a post HTTP action to the base URI / api /r s / v 1 / oo so whenever you want an auth token to use rest or in the next example graph QL you would send a post request to this end point this end point then returns the authorization token the only thing that this end point requires in the request is just the username and password key value pair in a little JSON block all right so open brace username : your user comma password : your password in double quotes of course and in our example I just have JQ - our auth token that just takes the response that we receive which is also JSON and it comes back as auth token : the actual token that just pulls out just the token so it's a lot easier to copy and paste into the next variable oh yeah and in cata code it's a little tricky sometimes like when you copy and then you're trying to get it into the terminal here you have to make sure you sometimes you have to like click twice in the terminal to make sure you actually back in the terminal to paste or to execute or anything like that I think that covers the questions well everybody's working on that just for a second I'm going to actually go back if you take off the JQ and you execute this you get it back it just looks like that right - note when you create an auth token you can actually create and have multiple off poke ins live at any particular time so like in this case I just created a new auth token which I could then also just change to that one instead of using the previous one I just created but that's how it comes back comes back in JSON format so whenever you're writing an application you have a nice JSON object to work with within JavaScript or whatever language you're working with so you can break that out into an object and then take whatever action you need to with it when you click any of the dark code segments in cata code it will automatically bounce to the terminal and execute that immediately awesome looks like we're doing good here good job sure yeah we're jog yeah it looks like looks like you'll probably need to get your URI affixed so check it out and see what it actually is make sure that trailing slash or anything after the.com is removed good you have an end all right so almost time to create our first table this next section may be a little tricky if you're still using the killer video keyspace I'll try to make a point where you need to change things and make sure to have killer video in the example versus better BOTS but again in cata Khoda the examples that are provided are based on the notion that you've named a key space better BOTS so just take that into account as we work through this we summation I will actually talk about that a little bit more you do not need to always create tables with rest there are more traditional Apache Cassandra routes that you can go which we'll talk about a little bit and you can also do it in graph QL so there's multiple ways that you can go about actually creating a table alright let's let's talk about this a little bit creating a table with the rest API so as most are probably familiar with a table in the database is just what we're gonna do what we're gonna set up to delineate some columns and then have this so that we can add data to that table based on the columns of information that it's there to hold and once you have a table you can insert and replace update delete data from that table and interact with it however you need to from that point forward to create a table with the rest endpoint what we need to do is get that base URI which I'm already done here in the examples it by setting up that environment variable so we have that base URI as an environment variable so we don't like retype it or try to copy it again and we're gonna set up curl request by once again rebuilding header token etc the cool thing of course with cata Kota I have all that in an executable blur right here at the bottom so just to cover the content of what we're putting together for this table if you scroll down or if you've read through the information there in that window what we've done is set up another curl command where I set the request to post type okay and then the base URI API rest v1 key spaces better BOTS tables that part would need to be changed if you have killer video so it would need to be API recipe one key space is killer video without the e just an R on n slash tables in the header adding the token then set content type and then the data which I need to I think it's a little bit bigger so we can see more of it there we go data raw format and then we start off with if not exists true so if the table doesn't exist it will create the table if the table does exist it won't attempt to recreate the table which means we'll be able to item potently execute this query to create a table and it won't ever air out and it will ensure that we always have this table that's that's there so it won't cause a problem or anything if you execute it multiple times oh and I just clicked on it so I went ahead and executed for me which you see I have now successfully created a table but let's talk a little bit more about what table I just created there is a column definitions and we will point you at the documentation that has all the information about this so you can look into the specific details about the JSON that you need to use to create a table with whatever types of columns you want whether it's time time stamps uu IDs decimals floats whatever in this particular example you can see the columns in the column definitions as a JSON array the first element is static false which we'll talk about that at some other time but then the name of the column which in this case for the first one is ID and the type that that ID is is UUID then second one I just named the name of the column name and that's a type text' then I have a description column which is also text created which is a timestamp priced which is a decimal so like ninety nine ninety five and then I write what the partition key is which is I'm going to use the ID just for this example table options which is default time-to-live I just set that to zero and the name of the table there at the tail end which is just products that's it so that will create or has in this case since I accidentally already executed it it has created a table for me so of course you have a table but if that's all you have you need to do something with it so let's add some data to that table a few other questions come up can you do multi node and that's a topic for another day let's here I looks like someone is it so in the next example I think I'm going to answer some of the questions that are starting to come up for this already in the next example again doing a post building it again also base URI then rest v1 key spaces in my case it's better BOTS in your case maybe killer video or better BOTS and then this time though I'm adding the slash tables slash name of the table I want to work with in this case I just created products and I want to add a row of data to the products table and then slash Rose rose is just designating that whatever is in the body of this request of this post request is what it's going to take action on and again it'll be a JSON object defining what data it is that we want to get inserted to get added to this particular table the header information same thing as before you got your token and just stating the content type pretty standard stuff in the body the JSON is basically columns and then it goes name and then value so it's kind of like designating the key and the value of which column which piece of data goes to in the example I have a value for ID which I set to a specific UUID you can use the same one so in katakana if you click on the example it'll execute it and add that row to your database the primary key is just designated in the JSON right here it's autonomous of the column declarations where just state specific it's like a specific section within that to designate what is the partition key because you'll see like here's the beginning of the JSON array and here's the close of the JSON array that's the columns and then specific autonomous pieces are the primary key which needs to be designated you need to have at least one key and then you have table options when you execute that you'll also be returned this JSON right here that I got back that will state that it was true that it was a success or not successful and it'll state how many rows were modified so you can you can submit JSON and similarly with graph QL when we get to that you can submit multiple rows to be added at one time almost kind of like a batch from the context or from the point of view of the graph QL statement or the rest query itself it's it's a grouping of items that you can add I'm going to go ahead and go to the next example here the last one and of course once we add data to a table we'd want to be able to query to get it back in this particular example you'll know that the base URI is what is the base URI has the additional pathway along with the unique identifier that we added the road with so the row had the UUID of c 0 0 F 4 7 b 6 etc etc and we build we put that into the URI of the current request we add the header info for content type and then the token and then we just executed Oh which I did not get a result because Oh weird so I just found out if you back if you uptick in cata Kota sometimes it does not rebuild the URI correctly you'll see the thing is a bit concatenated together which might have been why it did not execute correctly there we go so in this last one actually needs to be a git not a post action HTTP called live coding it's hard it live coding is sometimes difficult David indeed it is inserting wrong report number ended with I believe the port number ended with maybe maybe the URI isn't complete or got concatenated like we just saw and when I did uptick with cata Kota here just a minute ago it actually it sent me back to the previous command but it it did something to the text and didn't give me my full command back so maybe just verify the URI actually has the slash API slash / b1 / key space is better bots tables products etc or whatever it is because that's that's what that error looks like a Shetty one if I mispronounce any of your nicknames I mostly apologize they're very hard to pronounce when they have numbers and other things in them so I'm going to give everybody a quick minute to finish that up and then we will continue with the next part so everybody just keep working on that if you have any more questions I will try to answer them as quickly as possible the katakana scenarios just so people know they will timeout after I don't know I think it's an hour or something like that but you can't they'll be around forever so you can go back and rework these exercises later if you're interested we are not going to be talking about cql shells specifically from an example point of view in this area it's just we're just talking about the API endpoints we will have additional material and workshops around using CQ l CQ l shell within the interface and interacting via the drivers all sorts of other ways that you can interact with the database and Astra besides just the API endpoints yes the catacomb examples will be available after the workshop so you can go and check out the catacomb examples and other catacomb examples as we make them available anytime you want to there they're out there they're going to be theirs there's going to be new ones available soon so always worth checking out and just working through those a lot of good material there we'll have to tackle that topic in a subsequent course Prashant that's a getting it getting a little deeper into the innards but give us the size of the rest and graph QL endpoints when you create a database they are spooled up and available as soon as pretty much as soon as the database itself is available usually I believe that most there will be a 5 to 10 second lag from the database being available to the time when the api's are available and that's really the only time you'll get any delay and that's just on the initial start that's all that is when you're done with this scenario too you may want to bookmark some of these pieces of information that are in the category example such as the astro readme Docs lots of good material here especially around as you saw doing the building out things with the rest interface building that JSON object can be somewhat difficult right so if you go to the documentation go to the API reference you'll find an awesome feature here readme Daioh is based off of the swagger standard Docs implementation so you can go in here and let's say you want to add a row to a table you can add that database ID just like we've talked about here in the course you can add the region so they're like us yeast 1 and you'll note as I do this key space name better box note that the URL the curl request etc is being built out as I move through this so there's products and let's say this is the ID and then you can add columns for what you want to add so like this would be a name I'll say some name and it's all built out and the JSON will be built out here for you so you don't have to hand code that comes in really really handy to be able to just bounce here into the docs and put together your Co requests in addition to that there's node which of course it builds it out as you type also as you build the requests Ruby JavaScript and Python and this these Doc's are specific to the rest interface and the JSON that you need to create for the rest interface yeah it's it's super cool sure yeah as I have built examples and things like that I even use the docs just because it's so easy in such a nice interface and to note if you look up on the top right of the example there's a try it button that actually will execute it against your day which is also important to note because if you go through all these and then you add your token ID it will add this or do these actions to your database so sometimes you may or may not want to actually execute it from the docs here oh stay tuned there there will be Java don't worry there will be Java and also just to add the better bots blog is where we are blogging about this material and other will be using the rest interface the graph QL interface will also be writing sequel ul and doing a lot of other things actually building out a full-fledged reference application using the better bots theme and the material like you're learning here in the course working against the Astra databases and if you would please fill out the survey at the end of this scenario all right I asked think of ad astra is Latin for to space off to space launching into space so that's yeah now you know and knowing is half the battle I feel like I just dated myself so Oh bounced to the wrong part of the slide deck we are over here about to get into graph QL all right there we go interesting I have lag between my slides and my video okay I think it's all in sync so when I speak it should be what's on the screen all right for the next section we're gonna take a dive into how to use the graph QL API within Astra we're gonna be using cata Kota for it too but just like previous I'm gonna give you a kind of a review of how this is done how we have it set up for you to use again just like with the rest interface we will build you or I there's one key difference with the graph QL uri endpoint which is there is one there is only one uri that you will deal with once you have built this which is a key difference between rest and graph QL this is that uri so database ID region just like before and it ends with slash API slash graph QL an example of what that URI would look like with your live database is right below that then we put together header token again same thing as with the rest interface so as you as you might guess it's very easy with that same token to go back and forth between rest calls or graph QL whatever you want to your choice and then the key with graph QL even more emphasis is what is in the body of what you're posting that's where you build your query that's where you will do introspection that's where you will do your mutation against data etc I will I will interchangeably use some of the graph QL terminology during this part with the Cassandra and database terminology because it is different graph QL is designed to be kind of a layer above whatever data sources it's not pertinently tied in any tight way to a data source so you graph QL could theoretically be over files it could be over the top of a database it could be over the top of multiple databases there's a lot of options but in our particular graph QL context our graph QL server is running against the database that you have created the graph QL server updates dynamically effectively in real time as you create tables and change the structure of your tables so that whenever you are doing anything in graph QL you'll see your tables updated as you work through this so it's it's something that's just maintained automatically against the database the schema that you would structure etc you have nothing to do all you ever have to do is get your token and make graph QL calls against the server so the HTT body where you put that query is also again JSON you'll know running you'll notice a running theme with all this JSON here JSON there all this JavaScript object notation right the focus of these api's is really to enable the web developer that's working in node.js or JavaScript and really any language it doesn't matter but the emphasis is around that JavaScript and JavaScript object notation to be able to enable the movement of data back and forth so with that let's get into the next category example which is see here it's probably important to point out Adrienne that token does timeout so you'll need to refresh that you can't continue to use the one used before it'll probably be that is correct it does timeout and just in case like you started a session in cata coda and then you're doing this next session like two hours later clean really your token would have timed out and that is why at the beginning of each of these sessions where you execute any type of actions against the graph QL endpoint or the rest endpoint I have put a little starter so that you make sure you have your environment variables whichever one you're starting with and you initiate an up-to-date token so if you go in here now to the Astro graph QL scenario gives you a little intro with our awesome better BOTS logo and then you'll notice especially since we just did it this is basically the same environment variables set up again okay now it's important to note you do need to do this again also in cata Kota because this is a new terminal session right so it's it doesn't have your previous environment variables set up we'll set up new environment variables and we'll get a new token just for the specific session the other thing that you'll notice is that right up there is an editor kind of now I guess it is an editor not kind of an editor it's an editor so in the editor will actually create some code some JavaScript specifically to execute graph QL against the graph QL endpoint there are currently two files that are open in our little editors tab interface graph QL mutation and graph QL query those are the two main things that we're going to be working with so let's go ahead and set this up again so there's our base URI gonna paste that in there go back over to my asset or database I'm gonna actually copy the graph QL API link this time the difference between these two by the way is literally at the tail end one says slash API slash rest the other one says slash API slash graph QL copy that paste it in and then again I'm gonna remove the graph QL and the API part from the tail-end okay just for this cat ACOTA example and I'm going to make sure that there's no trailing slash or anything so just make sure it is just calm at the tail end so there's that one and I'm going to copy curl request again and get my super secret passwords in there and if anybody is curious why I feel so confident and showing you my username and password I will be immediately after this workshop deleting my database so these won't even exist anymore but they're great for the example Oh what happened here live coding it's always always so fun oh I I didn't type my username correctly so let's fix that see I was also giving you false username and password information there we go now we've got a new token yes not as a question pop-up currently with a stir the way it is set up which this will change one day but right now when you create a database you get a singular key space that key space if if the database is terminated you delete the key space but otherwise that's the singular one that you have to work with you can create as many tables as you want in that and you can update the tables you can delete the tables etc but the key space itself you can't add or remove key spaces without creating and terminating entire databases at this point all right looks like I have my base URI and my tokens set up correctly so now when you click continue here pay attention to what occurs and you'll notice that node and NPM go to work also in your editor you'll notice that you have a package.json a package lock JSON which is the standard material for whenever you create a node project and you type NPM in it it creates a package JSON often it prompts you and says what do you want to name your project what do you want to do what's the description of it what are the keywords all this other information in this particular situation though I just made it do a headless or not a headless but a propolis build of the package JSON so if we look at that just for some quick context it's just your default JSON so that we can use NPM and we can use node to execute code that we'll be running and add dependencies if we need dependencies so with that done in this example if you look through this we have some JSON code I mean some JavaScript code over here and we do have our JSON object our first query way down here which kind of goes off the screen as you see again here is where the JavaScript is actually building from our environment variables the base URI attaching API - API / graph QL - that setting up our headers are accepting content type headers and then also setting our token and retrieving that again from our environment variable that we set up for the token so looks somewhat similar to what you might have in actual production code that you write then below that we set up an HTTP request because we are using HTTP and then there's response data and etc some code around handling that as it comes back so that we get the response out put out into the console via the console dot log and if there's an error does the console about error and then the post data is building the data part of our HTTP request which is again the bulk of any type of interaction that you do with graph QL is always going to have some type of body as that's where the actual executable request is being made so in this particular situation what I have put together is a basic graph QL query this graph QL query in this case the ID happens to be the same ID as the data we added via the rest interface now the reason I did that is twofold one I just wanted to show you all how you can do a query and get back a specific record from the table based on its ID in this case I've entered it there so it should just execute fine and if you scroll down one more thing we need to do so after you've reviewed the code there's you know code reviews are important write copy to editor click that and you'll see it populates all that code so you don't have to type anything directly over to your graph QL - query JS file so we now have the graph QL query jeaious all ready to execute okay you'll see it also is now here in the tree structure so it's actually created to physically be able to execute we go down here and click on this it'll actually execute that file for you which course the other option is you could just type node graph QL query J is because the terminal is a fully featured terminal now the response as you see has come back it's returned to JSON object and the response says data products if there were multiple like if we were trying to get all the products you know we would see all of them here and we'll talk about that in just a second but then the various respective key value pairs of the JSON object itself with ID name created price and description so we got super robot arms for a measly little nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety five cents or whatever that enumeration is of value so click continue we're going to get into step three what we just did is a query one of the awesome things about graph QL and especially if you're familiar with graph QL and have have worked with a little bit before there's a lot of tools that enable you to work through the query like graphic UL and other things like that which we have links for and we'll be adding more links for in the content we use it a lot ourselves as we're working with graph QL because graph QL enables introspection via the query you can actually use a lot of these tools and it will provide you autocomplete which is an absolutely beautiful thing to be able to have to work against a repository like this so literally someone could build a database for you and then you could just have graph QL access and work against that database and find out whatever information you need through the introspection so then the next thing that you would want to do in any scenario of course is mute data in graph QL the term mutate is kind of a general term to literally just mean the changing of data in some way or even the addition of data in some way in Apache Cassandra terms that would mean doing an insert an update delete something like that but from this perspective you're just writing the graph QL so you're doing a mutation whether you're doing any of those actions and the server determines which action dictates which Cassandra action on the database side so if we scroll down again let's go ahead and copy the code editor and it copies that code into the graph QL mutation J's file again the header is being built tokens being inserted from the environment variable etc etc and the important part of this code is right here in the post data you see that it starts with query but the type of query is that it's a mutation query so that's an important thing to note pretty much everything in graph QL is a query of some sort but this one is a mutation type which means it will be changing data in the database the syntax is the object ok now the object is pertinent only to the JavaScript side now you have to have this object and you can think of this as let's say you have a form and the user goes through and names it something and gives it the values that you're going to insert into the database well on me the side where in the code that you're putting this together in your JavaScript this object would basically be something that you in your code would use to manage this specific object that's being inserted or updated or whatever I just named it super arms it could be something like the insert object or the update object something like that so then it's colon and then you have an actual function okay or a call it's whatever the action is going to be and this is where you get a little bit of the database notion that bleeds through into the graph QL concepts a little bit here we've defined specific functions that are that are generated and available for every table within the database you have an insert and update in a delete in this case it's going to be insert whatever the table name is in our case products and then we pass it the object itself that it's going to insert or the object that it's going to update or delete so in this case we have insert objects and I have a ID that I'm passing it a name description price and in this example I actually have a timestamp that I've added now with graph QL right after you give it the data with the key value of the column and then the data that you're going to put in you designate at the trailing part of it value and then you list out the elements of the JSON that correlate to the columns in the database in this case just like that table we created we have an ID name a description price and created so if we execute that go we see it executed we've added another piece of data to the table let's kick continue talk about this a little bit now when you write out graph QL one of the nice things is a lot of the tooling that helps you write graph QL and such it'll give you the ability to write it out and a nice format a JSON way like this so this is if you had it formatted out this is what a simple query would be to return all of the products based on just getting the name description and price of each one of those products it would leave off the timestamp for the created field and it would leave off the ID wouldn't have the ID so in the user interface like in your webpage you would run this query execute and what you get back is just the information that you need to actually display to the user so that's one of the underlying premise with graph QL is that you just work with the pieces of data you need when you need it to keep things minimal moving back and forth on the pipe to your applications but to query and then here's a little bit slightly easier to read mutation where I've put two items in this mutation instead of just one so this is an example of what you would want to do like let's say you have a form or something and you have multiple items that you actually want to get mutated or inserted into the database this is how you would put two items in there so new mech so and a new CPU for your mech added that in there insert products function then the values and then the value column names right below that it's a name and description in this example the attempt would be to insert values just into name and description so if those other columns are easily knowable this would just add the name and description and the other columns would be null alright so again clear my little screen there I'm gonna run the graph QL query and you'll see it returns again that same value but what we want to do in this last example is actually to get back all our stuff that we've put in the database so like if there are multiple rows of data this would be the way to do it and what you do just take that same example that is in the graph QL query file so make sure you change back to that and then here what we do is we take off this filter which is just the value based on the ID right so then we just have the we're saying give me a query of the query of products the products table and I want these columns back from that for everything I want everything to come back now I will add at this point though to make sure that you don't just query and everything blows up tries to return the whole lot of data like all your petabytes and petabytes of data this default query actually is limited to 100 rows so it'll give you a hundred rows back right now what you can do though if you want all of the data in some way form manner there is paging there is filters that you can add a lot of other options um and we'll be writing a more information about that specifically in documentation but also you can use standard graph QL filters so you do introspection and the filters are they're presented whenever you do any type of introspection autocomplete against the graph QL endpoint so right here we have our one item back but now that I've removed that filter if I run the query again you'll note let's here here's the description name is here super robot arms and the power for robot arm spec a3 so now that's both of our records that we've added have returned from that query once I take out that filter so it gives you an example of how to change that piece now just on the tail end of that I saw a few questions and I'm gonna go ahead and delve into it just a little bit in this interface when you created your database you probably noticed some other pieces here that we haven't touched on one is the cql console so if you did want to write cql commands directly against your database you can go into here and log in like this and you can this is a cql shell standard thing is if you installed Apache Cassandra locally or you had a cluster of your own and you're just issuing commands using the cql shell against your database so like if I typed select asterisk from what did I do better coups better BOTS dot product boom there we go there are those two rows that we just added the rest and graph QL look queried and pulled back via a standard select statement using star don't use star but this is just an example so you get an idea of what we've added they're using those two things and how you can still interact with it using the cql shell one of the other options that we have is the standard developer studio which in the interface if you just click on launch now it launches that interface for you now generally if you haven't launched this before it don't ask you for your username and password and it's that same username and password and then you can go in create as many notebooks as you want and oh I just I called the other one that testing stuff here we go and again you can write out cql queries here and there's even some autocomplete in here if you hit control space and there we go so the initial execution what did I type wrong oh I did not write my CQ oh right there we go the initial query execution when you go into this always takes a few seconds because the studio kind of launches a thing and then get some stuff going on on the back end to make sure that the queries return appropriately once you get past that first execution whether to describe a select and insert whatever it is all of the queries are going to be quick as you would expect against Cassandra at that point so there's another way that you can connect to your database interact with your data and work with all those things all right so now unless there's questions that's your connect where you feel ah the key space um the key space but L should be in here I'm gonna go back here in yeah how do you do it squeezed face in there yeah so if you already have killer video you would have to make you have to make sure you're getting the correct see because when you click into the database here right if you have killer video this should be designating your t space your base URI so if there's a key space error oh you talking about in AH in in cql shell you have to designate the key space and developer studio it does default to whatever is selected here in this drop-down I'd wrote out the key space in my select statement but in studio you don't actually have to do that you can just designate the table name but I always like two cents per spec in cql you're supposed to designate the key space I always put it in there no matter what alright so let's hear any other questions um if you do not go get a token the access is basically not enabled sceetos let's hear I would also we have a reference in here but just give it an initial shout-out definitely go get the Cassandra definitive guide book from O'Reilly we have that free link for that it's a it's a good one I actually have a copy sitting here right beside me so definitely definitely get yourself a copy of that that is superb superb material big shout out to Jett good job on getting the latest copy or late the latest iteration of that book published all right so last part of this is a minty so Steve okay thanks Adrian that was great let me see let me figure out how to share my screen again okay there we go so you're back at menti again I should have told you you didn't want to close that when we were done last time but if you did you can go back to minty calm and the code is eight three four four seven six so we'll give you a couple more questions to help us out here everybody go ahead and give me the thumbs up let me see if I people are keeping up with us here okay it's like people are getting then okay let me go the first question here then I think I gotta unlock this again there I think we're good to go there so you got the you currently use rest to graph QL for data access now it's kind of interesting the breast stuff is probably more traditional but the graph QL stuff is starting to pick up it's so funny how something so new as rest can be considered a traditional technology at this point ok very good let's go the next question here see you think well there data access technologies are using besides rest and graft you all this is this is a an open-ended question so you can just type in if you're using something else and then it will we'll start to see the answers here nobody's using anything there we go looks like you're talking a dream but you're muted then that's it that's a common problem these days mute looks like some style that answers there good okay great let's move on one more here what tooling or frameworks use in your day-to-day engineering projects good luck this enough I know we have some COBOL programmers out there so I hope to see what libraries are using I'm very curious about this instead an object mapper for the COBOL I I'd be curious to know the things I have used in the past in relation to COBOL kind of kind of verged into that realm or different though these questions are actually for our astra team they're going to take a look at your responses and see if that gives them any good product ideas so yeah we'll be we'll be pushing forward to make sure also and a lot of things such as our twitch streams that we do the individual ones that I do myself I'll be putting a lot of emphasis on the things that people use most and I will be sure to also be giving a little love to some of the lesser used things such as maybe even COBOL things like that there's even been discussion about testing out some of the new web assembly options that are out there and working up some reference material around that so what you put into here is definitely things that we will be looking at and we we'll be focusing material on okay let's move to the next one here oh I guess that's that's the end of this batch here so we'll go back to you Adrienne and then we'll come back for one final mentee so don't close your mentee yet cool thanks Steve alright so what we've done so far we've created a database we talked about the api's had a pretty high level um well interesting I'm all over the screen but yeah we've we've worked through the API is that we've taken a direct look at rest and graph QL specifically and how we structure our your eyes how we structure the pathing within that how we structure the JSON pretty high-level but easy for you to go this the resources that we're going to talk about right now and dive super deep into any of those technologies that you may want to use all this might be my fault let me to try to start sharing oh I'm such a big fan of Skype um so and we're getting into these other resources that I was just talking about sorry about that little glitch so as we went through and I actually gave you a little bit of an example there's data stack studio which is another super easy way to get into the database and work with the database from the interface itself there's also the cql shell here's some of my links to a lot of the things that I work with every day because I literally stream a lot of the material that we just went over I stream material around building graph QL statements for astra setting up CQ l doing all sorts of things like that I blog about it etc and I have a lot of examples out there the there is the book that I referenced just a minute ago the cassandra' the definitive guide Jeff Carpenter and Evan u''t wrote this book and the third edition which Jeff just got pushed out is available now so if you go to that link you can pick up your copy electronic version and of course you know if you want a solid physical copy you can always go pick up one from O'Reilly there's a lot of developer resources and we talked a little bit about it previously in the course today there is material in Academy data stacks com there will also be loads and loads of additional material about the API endpoints how to use them the ways you can use graph QL and as we extend and build onto these new features etc all that will be updated and Academy days Dexcom as we work through that if you have any questions as you work with your API endpoints go check out community data stacks comm and we have a whole basically everybody watches that so there's any questions come up we will dive in there and get your question answered also follow us on twitter and twitch at data stacks devs if you're on twitch right now you're already there and then these slides will be available at that location and I believe they will be posted in discord if they're not already posted at this very moment we also had this how do we schedule these ah you send an email to the address and we can get an office hours schedule where people can join us and we will discuss whatever it is really that you want to discuss about Apache Cassandra health checks etc building out things basically sre office hours so join us or email us and we'll get one scheduled and we'll dive into whatever topics you want to dive into about Apache Cassandra and finally Steve has one last minty for it's all one last minty let me share my screen again I'm starting to learn how to do this see I can be taught okay okay here's the first question let me see I can lock it here for you how likely are you to recommend this been to a friend or colleague so if give us give us your feedback on that okay cool appreciate that let's go this next one how'd you hear about this event okay good we appreciate the feedback on the unlikely are you this two questions here how likely are you to recommend Astra to a friend or colleague and your organization okay great appreciate that assumed you see yourself using a stir in a project okay that looks like we got our answers there thank you very much this is kind of an open-ended question for the Aster team I really wish Astra had and feel free to type type in any ideas you have there [Music] [Music] this could be anything such as SSO single sign-on specific drivers or helpers for the api's anything like that whatever you think of please let us know they'll definitely it'll go into our brainstorming as we get additional capabilities and features built fewer trucks driving through it hopefully only you heard that because it was one of the lovely gravel trucks badly Steve so yeah go on going to get some roads built it wasn't so loud as it was your video was shaking I think was the dead giveaway there Oh a PDF book in addition to the cassandra book you want a book on the API specifically I'll have to get to work on that one and I like the idea of a cookbook - alright great I think we've got one more thing this is are you interested in the personalized Astra on boarding session this is not meant to be a marketing deal this is meant to be lever engineers working with you to help you do some stuff so if you're interested enter your email address and we'll get in touch with you on that and I think that's about it isn't it I do believe okay I don't know how we wrap these things up this is my first posting of a workshop but we appreciate your time and and your attention in this and please you know feel free to send us any feedback that you have or anything else yep well we'll definitely look at that and as I was saying we'll have lots more material coming your way and additional workshops in the near future so subscribe on Twitch follow or wait follow on twitter subscribe on youtube follow us on twitter and all those things and we will see you next time you",
