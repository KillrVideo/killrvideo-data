    "text": "hey this is jeff carpenter data stacks developer learning team and i am going to walk you through our new implementation of the spring pet clinic application it's a reactive implementation using spring web flux data stacks astra and a few other goodies going to need a free database running in astra you can click on this link here which will take us to astra where we can create an account or if you already have a account you can log in from there so this walks you through the instructions for your getting your account created and then i'm going to go in and yeah i don't have any databases now but i'm going to add one database google google cloud us east one and i think i'll name this spring reactive app and i'll just use a key space name of spring and i'm going to say my database username is is jeff and i'll create a simple password oh longer than seven yep and uh all right and i'll create my database so this will take just a couple minutes to get rolling now all i'm going to need to do is watch for my database to change to active and then i'll once it goes active i'll copy my credentials so i'm going to do that i'll scroll down here in this window all right and i'll copy the credentials okay so i've got those it's time to launch in git pod now if it's your first time using git pod you'll need to log in and it's something that you can use you can use your github login if you want and that would be just fine so this will take a minute to pull some docker images to build up the environment which would include some of the dependents the dependencies that we have as well as uh running the front end application that that we're gonna need uh for this app so this is almost done downloading and then it's gonna build for us all right now the build has finished and it was successful i see here that it's prompting me to paste those uh credentials that i copied a minute ago so we'll do that and then we should be good to go now you can see it's starting the pet clinic application the next thing that happens is uh we see that there says there a new tab should be opened and i noticed that there is a service available so open that up and this gives us the swagger ui for our sp spring pet clinic application reactive and so i can actually use this to invoke the service over its api i can operate my rest api for this reactive application right from this swagger ui right here flipping back to my instructions i see that i can successfully celebrate now that i have the swagger ui up but we actually have an angular application that is part of the spring pet clinic ecosystem so yeah i want to run that existing front end so it says that there is another terminal named spring pet clinic angular and i can see that down in here and it says oh i need to say yes to the question about analytics it's going to send some usage data that sounds fine to me and this will run all right now we see that it compiled it successfully and another services available so i'm going to go ahead and open that up and it's loading all right all right and i have my uh spring pet clinic app running so i can go through and test this i can add owners i can add new veterinarians i can get and put all the different types and the relationships between them assigning specialties to owners and searching by specialties and all these great functionality within the application that i'm going to get out of the way and give you a chance to explore all right well that is pretty much the guided tour of this application um switching back to the read me again you see that there are instructions available here to where you are freely available to run this demo on your desktop if you want instead of using this uh gitpod route that we took and there's some great descriptions in here of the different elements within the architecture how this application is put together uh in terms of a microservice that uh implements all of this with some of these different daos that are available inside it and how everything is wired up so i encourage you to read through this and browse through the source code and this could be a great jumping off point for you to build your own application and the goodies that i mentioned include being able to see metrics on the application using prometheus and to do some distributed tracing with zipkin so as promised there's a little bonus for you here at the end that i'll encourage you to take a chance to explore",
