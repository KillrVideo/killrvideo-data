    "text": "and hello everyone that's alex wolishnev developer advocate developer advocate at data stacks and cedric london director of developer advocacy at data stacks and we are very happy to greet you at datastax monday learning let your week start in the great way hi cedric hello everyone very happy to be here for week two so we will go on with the docker basics let's dig into it yes and uh while we are starting just i see many registrations of new people who join the task after the beginning of the first week so there is no big problem there is no big deal don't worry you are still fine are just two words about the program we run to make every week the great we have data stacks funded learning which makes new and new classes regarding the most important topics for the developers from all over the world and this week we work on docker containers fundamentals that's the second step of our docker containers from basics to best practices course we are doing first week is done but you still can do a homework and watch the video recordings but quiz is over of course this one is just started and we have very interesting assignment this week then for the next week we work with application development with docker because that's not like it was done before i would say and finally in the week four in the middle of october we work with the best practices and final assignments and that's very great to see you all i see more and more people are joining and that's really cool then final thing to notice before we start when we started first course we didn't expect so much people interested because well docker went live in year 2013 and since year 2015 it became more and more popular and that's the time when i was told to started using that but we got more more than 1 000 of registrations over 3.5 000 views on youtube that's great people from 25 countries and more than 1 000 hours overall watch time it's like you know what money it's all kind of secondary thing as long as you have them of course but what really matters is time and i can't say how excited i am what we what over when 1 000 of watch time so people trust us and watch our workshop and that's incredible feeling you see yeah that's definitely a validation of this format so you know last week is was really the first time we tried that so it really seemed that you like it so you know if we keep having you beginners with us on mondays we will have new topics uh coming after this four week we have ids but you know for now it's just secret sauce no no no no no no cedric you can't say something about that the point is as far as i know at least next as soon as docker path the docker learning path will be done cedric will start next one and can you maybe share a little bit of what you are going to say so yeah so i do have multiple ids um in the pipeline so i do at least two so first would be everything you need to know about spring so that's for the java community you know spring is obviously the main framework you would need to use if you're a java developer everything is based on that mostly newcomers are there but you know definitely having you know spring expertise on your resume mcq very appealing for for people to to apply for so very big target second target you know is what about no sequel you know back to basics what is now seek well what it's called you know yeah and also to highlight what world of nosql is much more rich than you can imagine in the beginning because you know what i've seen so many times people are like oh no israel yeah that's uh well no well yes i would say yes but not exactly because it's more complex than that and you have different solutions with different approaches that definitely sounds very good to me okay and then uh let's move on but before we start we have to ah and thank you thank you for all for joining us this picture on the right side that's like 1 000 of people watching something together we are spread it all over the world but we are still doing something together that's the reality of 21st century thank you so much for joining us and that's week 2 of docker learning path docker containers from basics to best practices docker fundamentals so we did a lot of great things last week but something we didn't what is very important and it's called data especially it's called persistent data very important concept to learn and understand as container happen to be it may disappear exactly the same way treat your containers preferably as they are ephemeral and they should be expendable that's very important oh pets vs scatters you explained that last week about that yeah yeah so uh that's a very uh well-known devops joke about what what's the difference between pets and cattle pets have names and cattle has ids if your pet is sick you bring your pet to a veterinarian if your cattle is sick you mostly probably going to dispose it and containers are burnt to be expendable contender containers are cattle but still not all of our applications are stateless in most of the cases you are going to handle some data and you are going to keep some data available all the time and if somehow your container was destroyed you still want your database to be available when you just start the next one so we have to treat persistent data specially and how do they do that in general there are two main ways technically there are three ways but third way is a temporary fs in a random access memory so we don't cover it it's not persistent and we speak about persistent data first way is a bind mount bind mounts is a very simple idea you just it's just a way to mount a local folder into the container file system simple as that you have a folder you have some files on that you allow it to launch you specify this folder to be mounted into the container boom you have this folder available in both of your local machine and uh in container important to know what bind bounds um the host mount precedes container it means what if you have some data in the container on this folder and if you have some data on your local machine and you bind the mount boom your data from host replaces the data in the container and that's very convenient and that's a very good way to work especially for developers use cases when you type your code you write a program it store it in your local folder and it immediately appears in your docker container it's very convenient most important things to mention about that so it allows direct access to the files from both host and container by default it will be read write but you can set it up to be read only if you need that it's managed by user so it's basically just a simple folder or file mount and not a special docker entity you treat with docker commands uh usually and that's important to understand you prefer bind bounds when data comes from your host machine and you are the developer typing commands and file system and main things when we make a bind mount for example if you launch a container with a docking docker run command you should remember from previous week we can specify minus v so for volume local path double point container path and if you want to change uh mode of access set it to red only read only is going to be local path double point a container path uh double point row for read only notice what by the local path i mean absolute path the not relative one if you are trying to use a relative path when docker will um think of your local path as of a volume name and we are covering volumes on the next slide so it will not work and if you don't want to specify the full path like home username project name blah blah blah then you can use a linux abbreviation of dollar pvd in parentheses which stays for the current directory simply give me the current directory as you see on the screen on the example frame and there is a little complication which never happened before now docker provides two tools or two mechanisms two ways to attach volumes and bind mounts in first case you can use minus minus volume or minus v and in the second way you can use minus minus mount and um they recommend now to use um dash dash mount way and specify type bind oh okay yeah that's uh that was something new for me as well because volume uh command argument option is much more well known and was available from the very beginning but now it's not recommended way anymore not like it's deprecated it's not deprecated but it looks it feels like it's going to be deprecated in some next years so maybe if you are just starting you better start to use dash dash mount instead of dashboard dashbeam because just you make use it for that from the very beginning and when you have to specify i have my pointer first you have to specify type and type will be bind then you have to specify source and source will be local folder so in this case just local folder i am located in otherwise you may add slash and whatever path from current folder if you want to mount a subfolder and finally target is just a path on the container so it's exactly like it is with minus v but you have to specify type bound there are two ways if you're already using the hv it's fine it's not yet deprecated maybe it will not be duplicated i don't know but we've dash dash mount is the new recommended way to mount things and when we go from the container this folder is mounted to a file system you are working thief when we speak about volumes and volumes is a more new although still not for last year improvement let's say another way to handle the data notice there is no principal difference it still will be folder to folder mounting but docker volumes are the entities managed by docker so you may say docker volume list ls docker volume create docker volume delete and it's managed via docker commands and the folder you are working with the volume you are working with will still be will be a folder on your laptop but it will be located here in the docker zone you don't usually work directly although it's still possible um it's a very often use case for where for the situations when data is created by a container what does that mean created by a container for example imagine your database running in container and you are storing an insert statement and your data in the database will be stored finally on disk because well database wants to persist its data and in this case alpha um it's initiated still by you but anyway data is managed and created by the database so usually when you work with database you prefer to use volumes and there is exactly the opposite way when you mount a bind when you do a bind mount then it means what you have some data in your folder it will overwrite the data what exists in the container on the target path for the volumes it works a bit opposite way when you create a new volume and then you create a new volume that's important and the target path in container is already filled with some data with some files those files will be copied to this newly created volume it may be not so easy to catch like from the very beginning but you start to practice that you will get into the idea what do i mean very good and um we prefer uh volumes for the cases when data comes from a container like databases but not only databases good typical commands to work with volumes first of all it's a first class docker entity so you have all the typical list of comments you may need docker volume create docker volume list docker volume inspect docker volume remove very typical that's mostly the same list for networks and so on and so forth when you create or when you work with volume uh using docker run command so vera again still to the same ways minus minus v or minus or via dash dash mount or using dash v using dash v or volumes first thing you specify volume name like this or like this and then you specify container path so it will be slash up in my case so volume name it project data will be mounted to target path slash up on the container and notice it's a pro it looks exactly like on from the bind mounts but that's the name and that's exactly the mistake happens when you are trying to mount the relative path you have a path using relative way so dot slash project data it will be interpreted as a volume name and it will not work because you cannot use slash and dot in the volume name you always have to use full path if you want to work with bind mounts and another approach which is now recommended is to use dash dash mount as on the third example so we can go with docker run dash dash mount source that will be the name of the volume and target it will be the target path so exactly a way to attach this volume on the container very good and we just reached first demo so let's do some very interesting things like how exactly the persistent data lost we want to cover three scenarios very simple one we will work with mysql so you all must be more or less experienced with this kind of relational databases at least and first way we work with mysql we don't do any mounts we don't do any volumes data is lost inevitably and for the second case we will use mysql but we mount we do a bind mount and data will be kept and we will have it everything on the local folder and finally we use mysql volume and data kept and we have docker volume but we kinda don't have local folder i want you to know it still exists but it's hidden inside the deeps of the docker zone you usually don't go and we can start and i need my terminal good yeah maybe you need to make a smaller yeah bigger i will make a smaller definitely give me a moment boom now we are small oh what happened good now i'm going to clear and make it bigger so everyone will see what i'm typing a little bit bigger even i think like that yes so very well and now very simple example so first of all i'm going to switch to volumes good so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going just to run docker mysql and let's take a look on what exactly i'm doing here well docker run this one must be familiar to you because well we did that before now minus d i run mysql in the detached mode so it will be run in background and will not block my terminal then minus e either i am setting an environment enviro environment variable which is called mysql a low empty password equals true what happens here the point is containerized mysql will not simply run if you're not give it to root password because it's kinda okay you cannot login to mysql if you don't know the password and if you don't give a password you don't know your password and to avoid these i simply say okay empty password is fine then it means root has uh empty password and that's obviously not the thing you want to have in your production environment but for the container i'm going to destroy in a minute that's perfectly fine and finally i have to specify what particular image i'm using and that's going to be mysql official mysql image latest and now yeah now if you can make yet another time bigger okay because you know some folks may have the screen blur it's not due to the stream it's due to your bandwidth at home but if you can make a little bit bigger or i don't know can you quickly switch from a black background to white background terminal i don't know if you can do it anywhere else oh i can try to be honest i did it last time like ages ago uh yeah let's just no let's move on i think it's big enough now yeah i think it's big enough so okay and i have id of a docker container running so let's take a look what i have right now i have my mysql container running with ports with a name and so on and what i want to do now is i want to attach to this container to see what's going on and how it'll how it is inside and i want to go for docker exec exec allows you to run a command on a running container within it exactly inside and now i go for docker exec as i'm going to attach to it i have to specify as i told you last week a minus iit for interactive terminal to allow me to be attached to it not just execute comment and quit immediately and as i did it i have to specify which particular container i'm accessing i'm giving beginning of its id so it's just container id c615 and others i don't type it fully because there is no need as long as this id is unique enough so docker may identify one of my running containers and that's the only one so it's going to be easy job it will be enough to identify the container and give it to me and finally i specify what i want to call a command mysql so once again docker to call for the docker exact is to execute a comment within running container execute a command interactively because i'm going to jump in inside the container container id and what comment i'm going to use instead of mysql it can be bashed for example so i will be attached to a container and hooray i'm inside the container and i can see what's running inside okay we don't have ps installed which is a bit weird but okay but i can say mysql and boom we are in mysql oh okay will not help and what i'm going to do now first i want to show my databases and i have only four information mysql performance shaman sys all the typical mysql databases it needs to run and what i'm going to do is i'm going to create database create a database i will you call it test1 boom and i show databases again and we see i have all those same databases as before but also test one and i'm going to quit and i'm going to quit containers still running now i have to recreate this running thing and i'm going to be polite with docker stop and process stopped and now i want to run it again so i go for docker run blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah the same things and i have a new id because i'm not restarting the previous container moreover i can even remove previous container and who knows what will happen when i will exact attach to this new one with the name two eem five five i'll again again bash i forgot to use mysql and show databases data bases and of course there is no test very simple because it's a new container and all the data is removed with a previous container if you want to have your data storage somehow you don't use this approach i don't need this there yeah yeah put your mask on and come closer to me you're again in front of the command line oh yeah you're right yeah let me switch to you so i will not hide data or on top as well yeah that was fine that will be fine good perfect so again no persistent data by default you have to care of your persistent data specially now just to check if i have any volumes docker volume ls okay i have some volumes oh that's uh those are leftovers from my uh previous experiments i will wipe them out for them uh clean up purposes to have it everything clean docker volume ram oh docker volume print i think you can do that oh yes you see bloon happened to be after i started to use docker and old dog is not so easy to learn new tricks so yes yes you are right you're right dr prune is much better way never mind never mind um let's go on you see how great to have it next to me yeah no so close yeah regarding uh cleanup and docker prune we will speak at the best practices part so week four good when what comes next we have uh first a second second i think we will do we will do um bind mount so i'm going to copy my command and show it to you and this one is a little bit longer but idea is the same and most of them you've seen already docker run detached set environment variable mysql allo empty password equals true so mysql will be running and then here the major comes dash so we specify the bind volume from the local folder folder mysql data to var leap mysql oops sorry and finally i'm calling an image mysql so it will create container based on this image okay so we have docker ps container running when we have list of folders this folder was just created so i didn't have this folder before and this folder is also mounted to the running container so if i do docker inspect 941 i have this long list of things related to my container and we also have him mounts explain it mounts type bind source so that's my folder destination read write room that's important and so as you see i have this folder and moreover it's not an empty alpha we didn't exist why before mysql has started not a certain empty var um notice it empty mysql folder and initialized it as a new database so all the files now exist here and there both but if i say docker volume at least we so let me check docker volume inspect cf546 oops where is the mistake volume name cf546 okay i will use a full name okay so that's yeah that's another volume from another container i'm running so as you see that's an old one that's not what created because volume was not created that's a bind mount which doesn't create a volume entity and docker doesn't care about that it's just a direct bind mount and as you guess now i can docker ps and i can jump to my container like before docker exec but i have to specify then first of all i want to jump directly to mysql and i want to specify the new id and so 941 boom and we are in mysql so show databases nothing new create database let's say test tomb and show databases again and we have this to here and now you know what what i'm going to do right now i'm going to terminate this mysql completely alright so i will docker stop it to give it one second to say goodbye to this cruel world and when i'm going to completely remove it 941 and boom there is no this container it doesn't exist it's not running it's not even stopped this like 2ee container downwards is the one which was stopped before six minutes ago exited five minutes ago but my new one is completely terminated but let's take a look what happens then then i run the same command again docker create docker run minus d minus e mysql empty password minus v mounting the same and using the same image that's a new container it never existed before and i'm going to jump in and some of you may know already what will happen five four six okay it will work for me good and i say show databases and my database test2 is here so i have my local folder and i have my data and final thing i can instead of creating a database with my bind bound because i don't need this folder for example i may want to have my folder under git and i don't want my local mysql data to be stored under git and deliver it to i don't know production or github or anything of course that's my local data so in this case i prefer another way so one last comment docker run minus d the same password thing minus v now name it volume mysql data mount to var leapmysql mysql and now when i say docker volume less volume unless i have this new one which has name mysql data which has driver local and that's my volume available for me let's inspect that docker volume inspect and mysql data boom and we see when it was created driver local no labels mount points and some other things like name and possible options in scope now interesting point this folder it's a real folder on a real machine but as i am using macbook macbook doesn't support natively docker so it's still a virtual machine inside to run linux commands using x-hive virtualization and if i try to go to this folder i will find nothing because first i have to attach to this virtual machine which was easier uh back in the days uh docker for mac was using virtualbox but well it's not here anymore and that's for good for real i'll tell ya docker for mac improved so significantly over years that's just great so but if you're a user of a linux when you can go to this path and see this folder with your mysql data within your host machine so that's important to know volumes are no principle difference to bind mounts it's still a folder with files like you know there is no cloud that's just or someone else computer the idea is exactly the same but now yes when we say docker volume inspect docker volume delete uh docker volume ram sorry then docker can manage those entities and that's great and i don't want to waste your time for use for running these commands for this container i hope you trust me what if we will create a database i do trust you yeah thank you but maybe there are some not so oops show databases [Music] okay but if there is a something create database test free we have this database created and we are going to kill this container docker kill um what was its name doc docker ps doker kill i'm going actually to kill both five four six boom it's not running okay never mind ah okay so it was stopped already very well and i will wipe them all out oh so i have no containers anymore and finally i'm going to run a new one using the same volume so docker run minus d minus e i hope you can see the comment behind us okay i will raise it a little bit higher so i'm using the same volume mysql data and it means what i can attach to my previous one it will be eight d one zero yes and show databases and test three database is of course there because volume was not deleted despite container was deleted so volumes and containers are two different entities and you have to think of both of them so i think we did enough regarding those simple things anyway you have to do those exercises on your own to get it all in your blood and in your memory and to persist this skill and i want to move to the next part uh cedric maybe we have some questions to answer um simply one question just pop up uh how are you calling docker by d by id i think ah that's a good questions um that's a good question so answer is very simple uh the point is you do have an alias exactly i'm a very lazy developer so i have an alias that's very easy to explain then we go for example to nano bash profile you will see a long list of different setups i'm coming right now yes yes and docker composes here and it's defined just like uh docker compose as dc and docker sd because well i am very lazy good yeah aliases you see when you work actively with terminal you do need a lot of aliases if you want to be efficient um and i have one more question how to set up git with docker do i have initiate the git first then run the container uh mohammad mohammed we cover it in the week free but in general docker and git the doesn't communicate directly to each other in any way so you can have both and just run git commands and docker commands they do not interact anyhow oh the question what the difference between buying and volume maybe you should re review the the just review the the streaming because this is exactly what we explain 15 minutes ago yeah exactly so uh i will not explain it again because we have more topics to cover some exciting topics but what's uh important to remember here we have two main mechanisms bind volumes and volume bind mounts sorry and data volumes they're very close except of some differences and i suggest you to walk through the video again or slides to get the difference better and first and first of all do it on your own using the homework uh assignments good and we can move on now multiple containers all what we did before we did some containers running one by one we had running nginx we had running mysql we had running some i don't know ubuntu but it never was like something really operational or bringing some value like justin nginx serving a static index html well it may have some uh purpose but in general usually when we speak about the software systems we speak about multiple components and the art of bringing them together and that's i don't know if i should say it's easy with docker or not and there is a little trick you will understand it in few slides so let's move on multiple containers collaborate directly as long as they are in the same network and they work natively very easily so using a default network type breach containers may communicate with each other and containers may communicate with host machine and internet there are some network basics to learn but i will be very brief on that there are three main types of network on uh in docker there are more of them first of all that's important those are main if i will tell you everything about every one of them we will all we will finish this day like 10 hours later networking and docker is a complicated thing and there are a lot of powerful plugins for example uh the motto of docker from the very beginning batteries are included but swappable it means what you can easily set up your own you can write your own network uh management system and you can write your own network plugin and some people did that because overlay network which um allows uh two docker containers from many multiple servers and multiple different hosts to contact each other was introduced well relatively later and it was a big problem if you want to contact multiple containers from multiple machines you are in big troubles and there were some network plugins to do that now they aren't and so high need because overlay network allow you to run to connect contact multiple containers from different running machines so easiest thing to explain is the host host network is basically not a network at all but containers started in your host machine will be directly attached to the port of your host machine and there are no networks whatever comes to your port of your host machine or your server or your laptop will be immediately received by the container host mode allows you to exclude all the network expenses so when you use any kind of a software-defined networks like docker networks it works usually very quickly [Music] more or less but there are still some possible delays and if you want your uh docker um infrastructure to be as efficient as possible you maybe want to exclude any kind of a networking and attach directly using host type network which is not exactly a network person downsides it's only supported by linux and as long as one of your containers took port 5000 for example it will not be available for other containers running on the same machine because it's a host container by 5 000 so one port to be used only by one container obviously that's kind of some extreme situation and well mostly probably it's not for developers so now i'm sorry i added this network type at all to this slide but now you know more which is great so now the main type of network which is used by default which allows only connection within single host and provides very nice dns features is a breach type so every container attached to a default bridge which is created when you start docker first time can communicate with other containers only using their ip addresses which is not going to be convenient because obviously containers are expendable so you're going to have new ip addresses over time very quickly bridge user defined breach will have a real dns service within so your containers may communicate using their names so when you call a container when you create a container and give it a name mysql then all the other containers will be able to reach one using the name mysql simple as that and that's great so bridge is the default one uh covering all the communication between uh container to container container to host container to the internet via network address translation and all the things like that uh one downside it's only supports single host so all your container on your laptop will be able to communicate but we will be not directly able to reach containers only on another morning machine well only except of a situation you run a dedicated bridge there again and then you set it up like very remote computers so a lot of work and finally overlay is a network to communicate over multiple hosts usually it's not used so much at least by developers and usually it's not used uh with plain docker but it's more speaking about docker swarm which we will briefly discuss um in some next weeks when working with networks is very similar to working with volumes you can list them you can create network specifying type you may inspect a network you can delete network and you can connect a running container to existing network docker network connect network container and i told in the beginning what i can't really say what running multiple containers is easy and now you will see why because we are getting very close to live demo 2 and we are going to create network driver using driver breach so it will be user defined at breach network to enable a dns settings on that and then i have to run first container and then i have to run second container and i'm not sure about your definition of a word easy but that doesn't exactly fit into my definition of word easy you you made me you know you may be faster just to install that stuff yeah maybe it will be easier to install mysql requirements install php and then run to run wordpress so what we are going to do now is we are going to run wordpress and wordpress requires php and many of our different dependencies like some php extensions and of course we have to store data somewhere exactly speaking mysql and now setup for this demo is a little bit more complicated by state unit i told you docker is awesome so just trust me and don't quit for next few minutes and you will see what i mean but now let's work a little let's walk through things what's going to happen right now first i'm doing docker uh okay first i'm doing docker network create i'm giving the name to my network and i'm specifying driver bridge to be honest driver breach is default driver type default network type so i may skip completely this part and just type docker network rate wp um just the name of a network network and it will still give me the same result but i use driver breach just to be more clear then second uh i'm going to run mysql and now notice very important what i run it as a second step because on the startup of wordpress it will try to connect to a database and if i start docker wordpress first it will fail because well we don't have mysql available so we go docker run detach background mount volume name it volume mysql datum so because we are going to have this data persistent to be mapped to var leap mysql in mysql container it will use network wp that's important if you don't specify a network it will be connected to a default network and therefore have no connection to a second container because this one well is connected to my custom network name of the container will be database and this is important that's not just a name to easier find your container in the lists of a container you get with docker ps but it's also important because it will be a dns name for this container so wordpress will be able to find that i show you in a moment then next view minus e minus e minus e and minus c are to define required environment variables what for i have to specify mysql root password to be secret password i have to specify i'm going to use mysql database wordpress i will say what mysql user is wordpress and my mysql password is wordpress i have to specify all of that otherwise mysql will not start well at least i definitely have to specify secret password and i have to specify this free database user and password for wordpress which starts in a second and finally i run publishing port 8080 uh left for the container oh sorry left for the host right for the container publishing port 80. my mounting volume mounting volume data intervar www.html for a simple purpose via a wordpress plugin administration panel i can install plugins i can install and change thems so also wordpress has some files to store not only mysql but wordpress as well as i am not going to directly communicate with them only via wordpress administration panel i'm using not bind mount but volume when i specify a network to attach which is wordpress i am specifying it to be detached again to not grab my console then long list of environment variables because wordpress needs some configuration as well wordpress db host it will be database free free zero six so free free zero six is the port we all know but what's the database as said name database in the network wp will be registered as the dns name for this container so everyone can access it simply as a database if i would call that mysql wordpress database when i have to specify here again mysql wordpress database it will be available then i'm giving wordpress db user wordpress as here wordpress db password was wordpress is here and database name wordpress is here so we are matching configuration and well yes i know it's a little bit too much but let's see if it works in general i will need my this helps i am this one i will need this one and we go to my terminal i hope it's still big enough for me it is great and so first i'm creating oh okay of course um i create hello so few basics about networking docker network ls and okay i have some networks as you see and here is the network i created to keep it fair to you i'm going to remove this one so it's removed and i'm going to create it so it's created and now i now i can say docker network inspect wp boom and i will move myself again to the side so you will not so i will not hide a configuration hello cedric good so here what yeah i'm back yep so we need some kind of a virtual masks but good uh and we see what docker network inspect gives us name id created scope and so on and so forth other settings and we we have some uh settings for this network as well uh is its internal no it's not internal so it's available from host and well it's just a plain simple breach network very simple now what i need i need to run my docker commands and well yeah that's going to take a moment first i want to clear that oops that's funny people complain that commands become longer and longer wait a second wait a second i told you trust me i'm an engineer stay with me for so many minutes i will show you something you will like yeah if it was that difficult lazy as you are yeah yeah yeah yeah if it would be difficult i would not recommend it to you and what i'm doing i'm not just recommending i'm running a full course it means what well it deserves some of your attention and final thing for me to copy paste are my square five so it's going to be mysql five i hope i did no mistakes when you start to work with comments like that it may take some time and now i want to check locks to assure my docker is running because my mysql container is running because if it's not running wordpress may fail to start and i'm saying docker locks i ask to follow container minus dash f and i'm saying c 94 and my container is running and mysqld is ready for connections perfect now i can start uh my dear wordpress and boom so let me clear that i preparing to start to that and finally wordpress latest word press boom latest i hope i did no mistake hmm at least it started now who may tell me what's the comment to watch for locks not you cedric not looking not you docker locksmiths from last week yeah good and as you see it's just started and it mounted to port 80 and there is no mistakes otherwise it would write me something about that so what i can do i can go to my local host and open that and take a look what happens next yeah my wordpress is running great and i can go on and i can set some site title 100 500 username alex now you need to use wordpress and you are in trouble [Laughter] well well wordpress is not so bad although yes personally i wouldn't use that and i need some emails it's a very very great solution but it's huge yeah and i don't want to index that anyway no one can see it and alex 100 500 and we are done so we can jump into mysql and see what database is initialized but we see it anyway because we can simply go here visit site and that's my wordpress hello world wordpress is running and all i did is just run three tiny commands looks good i'm very fine but well not really because with all of that i have one question our statement i'm too lazy to type all those comments seriously that makes no sense that's not transparent and very error prone is there anything to simplify our life answer is yes an answer called docker compose docker campus is the very powerful tool uh based on a very simple idea infrastructure as a code when we speak of infrastructure as a code we usually speak of things like terraform or cloud formation or i don't know cloud manager from google compute platform but uh the general idea is the same you describe the things you need in the configuration file and you receive the results instead of typing commands on my own all day or copy pasting them from the documentation i simply take a very another approach i describe everything in the docker configuration file docker compose configuration file and let docker compose take care of all the required actions technically speaking docker compose is a simple python script well not so simple as it was before five years ago already but it's just a python-based wrapper which reads your configuration file and executes proper docker console commands and it looks like that that's a simple file i will again move myself back to not hide the file from you goodbye cedric oops goodbye see you soon yeah good and very simple as that that's for file um you describe what you want to have and we will do it in a moment and you receive what you want and as it's a simple plain file you can put it uh to get your colleagues may work with it put some changes and so on and so forth everything what i did right now is technically being executed with a simple comment like that docker compose up that's it all the comments i run just all these characters i don't know how long it was it was too long now it's just docker compose up and i really like this thing so let's take a look at the docker compose file or i would better switch to my code and we will go to wordpress docker compose and i will make it a little bit bigger oops hey hey one more time yeah that's something already good so that's a very typical docker compose file for the simple two services to containers setup first line it's very recommended to have is to define docker compose config version docker compose evolved very quickly over years and as a result there are some strong collisions in different versions of configurations and version 2 will behave very differently to version 3 config so you do want to specify the version the latest one is as far as i remember is free eight and if you are only starting to use docker compose i do recommend you to stick to the most up-to-date version then i define volumes i may need for these kind of uh service we are going to use them later before you may admit them completely and docker compose would simply create them but we um they're getting uh stronger and more demanding over time so we have now to specify explicitly volumes we are going to use but you know what that's for good uh that allows you to avoid any kind of mistakes or typos you may have uh in your configuration file so that's very recommended to have volumes and versions requiring them when we specify services this one is wordpress and this one is database what does that matter that's exactly the dash dash name we used before so this one will give the name database to running running container and this one will give wordpress name to a running wordpress container therefore and as docker compose take takes care of network as well the special user defined breach network will be created for you so you don't have to care of the networks after all and let docker compose take care of it so those containers will be able to communicate with each other when as before i'm specifying image so which image i'm going to use in this case i'm going to use wordpress version 551 having php version 7.3 that's official wordpress image based on php image then i'm specifying volumes one is wordpress data i just created here in the configuration and where it's going to be mount notice that's the name at volume not a bind mount then directive depends on do you remember i told you i have to first start mysql when wait when let my wordpress events start wordpress exactly to avoid this kind of collisions i specify here what depends on database so it means this container will not be started as long as this container is not started yet that sounds great there is one very serious downside basically um maybe now it's a bit better but a couple of years before there were no health checks and at all and only think of a running container is what is running from the docker point of view although mysql takes some time to start by itself like initialized empty databases and so on and so forth for this kind of health checks you may have you may need more specialized text tests and scripts we cover at the application development fifth docker week free so next week then we are publishing ports so my uh wordpress will be available on hostport 8000 when i saying restart on failure so i want my container to be restarted if it exited with exit code not zero so it's failed somehow and when i'm specifying some environment variables as i did in docker run commands and some of you may say i don't like to have passwords in play text in the files which may be under git and that's very very very makes sense and that's again a teaser for week three i want you to see next week because i don't like it as well but shouldn't be like that and finally exactly the same directives for the database we will have a service called a database with the image mysql57 with the volumes mysql data restart on failure and with environment variable variables to see to set to be set like that and that's all my file and how it works in the end first of all i let me let me remove my old containers because i don't want my laptop to be over busy it will be dope or ps um oh i have a bunch of them how come one was restarted i guess doesn't matter so docker kill adb9 c94 8d1 i can as you may as you see you can mention multiple containers at one and a little bit of cleanup and we are good to go so i am going to switch to my wordpress folder and um first thing i'm going to do docker compose ps and docker compose tells me oh okay as always i guess uh sergei i will stay with you for the rest of the workshop otherwise i'm jumping here and back all the time oh okay yep uh good so and docker compose says me i have nothing now i can simply say docker compose up enter and docker compose does a lot of interesting things first it create network not so fast it create network wordpress default with the default driver which is bridge then it creates required volumes with for default driver which is local when it creates wordpress database and wordpress wordpress uh for us and now a little explanation here this part database is the name of a container we define it in the configuration file both the database and wordpress when number one we need it when we start to scale up and i will show you again in a moment and finally this wordpress where does it come from very simple you may have multiple docker compose projects in different folders and you may run them at once to avoid the collisions if you don't explicitly specify name for the docker project it will use the name of the folder you allocated so this wordpress database 1 and wordpress wordpress 1 are coming all from here because last folder i am located in is wordpress if you don't specify docker compose project name it will use folder as a project name by default and now we see some locks i started docker compose without minus d without detached mode so i'm receiving all the logs to my console and we see some good things happen first of all mysql is ready to accept connections and second of all my wordpress is running and now one more thing to notice i've used port uh 8000 for wordpress i didn't know why i did that but okay let it be 8 000. so now i can go to my browser just localhost 480 will not be available anymore as we stopped previous wordpress but if i go now to 8000 i have my wordpress install here available isn't that great and you can run it completely on your own having you have this given you have this docker learning path repository github.com data stacks devs docker learning path and we have here victor and we have here wordpress and just compare this gorgeousness all the things you have to do to run containers on your own and that's only two containers but for some applications for example my uh past experience i had like around 40 containers running it's not convenient to manage them without docker compose and view docker compose it's docker compose up minus d and have these configuration file explaining your setup i love that good so this one is running and i want to stop it and i want to start it again but with minus d command now we have to cover some things important things docker compose has multiple commands for you to realize and walking from the comments you must learn following comments there are more of them but i want we are speaking about the essentials and fundamentals so docker compose up will launch your application and docker compose down will take it down and clean up so if i say docker compose down it will not only stop the containers but also wipe up the volumes and it will also wipe up networks things like that good but i want to have it running it will take some time to run it again but we can discuss commands meanwhile docker compose build we will do it in a moment but in general you have to know in my docker compose yaml file i've used only images so if we take a look here i'm using image and i'm using image just to run some application and see how it goes it's perfectly fine but when you are developing it will be not convenient to pull an image or build it locally with docker build and then use it here and so on and so forth so to avoid things like that instead of following the image directive you can use build directive and specify the address like imagine i'm working with application located in the app folder and therefore instead of pulling image of wordpress for me like let's say i'm developing wordpress god bless me i don't but um yeah i would not do that um but let's imagine i was punished for something and we have um this build directive and i'm developing wordpress in this folder and when i can say docker compose build to have uh the image to be used by docker compose but in this case i want to stick to image anyway i don't have an app folder at all following commands i have to cover docker compose locks and possible options minus f and container how it works very simple way i have my application running i can say docker compose locks and ask for all locks docker compose prints all the existing clocks and quits but in some cases you want to trace what's going inside the system and then you say docker compose locks minus f which stands for follow dash f follow and it will not quit as soon as i start to use this wordpress i will have logs right here and finally if i specify the container name like if you have 40 containers but you want to debug one you have to specify this one to avoid all the logs from all over containers and then you can simply say wordpress and boom i have logs only from wordpress what's next docker compose exec you already know docker compose exec a docker exec but just as a docker exec with docker exec you have to type docker container id exec minus t command to execute and so on docker compose makes it a little bit easier so i simply say docker compose or if you are lazy like me you can set up some aliases and use the dc but well that's a workshop so i have to stay strong and use full names docker compose i can say exec i can give a container name wordpress and i can say what exactly i'm going to do i will need bash and in this case i don't have to specify minus i t because thanks to docker compose interactive terminal will be allocated automatically and boom i inside the docker container so i may say psalms and i have all the processes running here so you may take a look uh and we have what's going on inside we have apache web server running we have uh so apache processes www data and we have bash because i'm logged in into the container and we have psalms because that's the comment i'm executing to see what's going on within the container i may ask who am i i'm going to be rude and i can take a look at what's the folder and if you have experience with wordpress you maybe will recognize all those files because basically that's my wordpress is and i may i don't know change something in index html okay i have no nano maybe v no maybe vim okay i will not change this file never mind never tried to do it before good so that's my wordpress and that's it runs what's next i have to specify for you to know docker compose stop and docker compose start those will stop containers and start containers pretty obviously and it will not delete them so if you store something within the containers even without using persistent data it will be stored but in general that's dangerous approach so i recommend not to do that but the point is work day is over you want to go home you don't you you don't want your laptop to be busy with things and you can say docker compose stop and containers will be stopped and it will be a little bit faster to start and stop than the full recreation cycle you maybe need in some cases so stop and start the same way i can specify which container to start so i can simply specify docker start mysql if i don't need wordpress again in this case that's not so big deal but when you have a dozen of containers running you may want to manage resources no such service mysql why ow because it's a database oops database exactly okay though docker compose stop and do i have anything else here to mention restart i will not show you you got to this youtube stream it means what you can't handle things like docker compose restart on your own and docker compose kill is exactly the same like stop but without graceful termination time it just sends secure immediately so it just works quicker but be careful because if you work with persistent data on your production you don't want to use kill and docker compose down uh that's i've shown you before that's to clean up and white wipe out things what were used before so you say docker compose down it will delete network it will delete containers etc now one big thing about the docker compose you have to remember docker compose is the thing which is not perfectly designed to be to run on production so if you have small amount of containers running on production you may want to avoid docker compose at all and manage it with i don't know manually or with ansible or something if you have many of them you may need kubernetes which is not the part of this course and if in general it's recommended to avoid using docker compose in production so it evolves over time and maybe uh it's already reached a point i promise you to make an investigation about about uh using docker compose in production but we will see if it works or not and we are very close to the time we are done and we have to do a quiz but before that i want to show you one last thing using our docker playground so we have labs play with docker thing some of you've used that already it's a cloud console to use docker and we have here this labs play with docker and i'm going to add a new instance and i'm having this new instance available and now you may say okay we use it with wordpress and database and it was great but can we have maybe some real real cool example of application you may run the things like that and yes i prepared something for you and i will not run it locally because this way you will be not able to reach that but i'm going to run it in a darker playground so you will be able to touch it and use it and i'm doing git clone and i'm cloning our data stacks devs docker learning path and i'm going to switch to this folder week to a speak tomb and here i have a voting up perfectly and that's a very simple thing no it's not simple thing it's a real application it's a demo application so it's small but that's seriously big uh and great demo application let me show you we will have you heard about microservices i guess you heard so application we are going to run now looks exactly like that that's the application to vote and we have voting front end where you decide to vote for point a or food b it despite to be highly scalable and very performant it dispatches every vote down to radius q and when we have a bunch of java workers processing with radical radius q handling all the votes and putting the prepared results processed results into the postgres and then finally we have node javascript backend to show you the results and it consists of five kinds of different services and java workers are launched in the multi in a big group so let's take a look i have it right here and i'm saying exactly the thing i did before docker compose up minus dim it creates voting up default with a default driver network voting up because i told you that's the default name project name it pulls all the required things and while it provides pools let's take a look on what exactly it's going to pull that's the docker compose for our system and we have here five services voting front end on the port 5000 and it will use my image dlp voting dlp for data for docker learning path we have java worker as a dlp worker it doesn't need any ports but it needs connection to both radius q and postgres e result back a result front end to show you the results from postgres and it uses postgres as a database and ready to handle cues and let's take a look how it goes with our docker playground we are almost done so last image to be pulled it works pretty quickly system is pretty busy right now because it's a tiny note but well uh thanks to play with docker platform for giving us for free hey okay result is not downloaded yet voting is radius is postgres is by the way uh dlp result needs some love and needs some optimization because docker file is not nice and we are going to improve it at our next workshop uh sorry next next workshop for best practices so this one is ugly but that's for intention so we will have something to improve great and finally worker yes perfect so we have uh radius we have postgres we have voting frontend result and worker and they are running i can check how it goes if docker locks minus f i will follow ah sorry i have to i'm with docker compose it's much easier docker compose minus f i don't have to specify the container docker compose will follow all of them docker compose locks correct good and we see what voting connected to radius we see what worker connected to postgres and radius and we see what result is connected to postgres and postgres and starting and radius started great so we have two ports open five thousand and five thousand one and we go to four port five thousand and we have applications starting up yes slowly slowly but surely and we have to decide cats versus dogs and you know i'm completely cats person so i definitely going to vote for cats and vote is processed by four six one for whatever it's a container id and vote is dispatched to radius pulled by worker processed by worker push it to postgres and shown by the result of 100 of votes for cats but you know what i'm going to copy paste this to you on youtube and maybe even discord and you can go where and vote i actually ask you okay we see it's changing right now so we have cats and dogs and there are some changes and okay dogs are winning but that's fine i love you whatever you prefer cats or dogs that doesn't matter to me very well application is running we have a lot of votes by the way you can change your vote if you want so i'm revolting to docs and i guess it changes a little bit but well you know i will stay honest okay i will stay with cats and is changing back and now please stop voting i know you like that but let's get back to me just by final few things things you will really like so take a look we see the logs right here application is running people from different countries are voting for cats or for dogs whatever they prefer but now i want you to show something extra special so how many our services we have running like we developed free voting worker and result we have two more databases and i told you it's microservices scalable thing so take a look on what i'm doing right now i'm giving you here docker compose scale i take worker i set worker count equals free and now it start to look really like this picture where was it here because now we have three java workers processing your requests and if we see it here we see up worker one worker two worker free are created and available and now we say docker compose locks minus f worker to simplify it i will follow only the worker locks and we see what worker 2 connected to a db and connector for vector worker 3 is connected to adb and now you can go and change your vote a couple of times and you will see how multiple containers multiple workers multiple processors process your votes automatically and we can tell docker compose ps and we will see many processes running and available because we have postgres readys result voting and free workers are available for us and that's damn amazing so this week assignment let's do a more complex setup using docker compose it should include at least one predefined image like mysql and custom image you build you should persist data so docker compose down will not wipe it out please use our week 2 samples for the inspiration to to make it simpler last workshop's assignment was to decorate something and i really don't want to give you any particular suggestions because that should be docker should be suitable for what you doing not i doing and this way is the same i want you to have a running simple application like we had with wordpress and mysql but a full stack application with a database an application as it is and with our uh voting up we had pretty complicated already system we've scaled out workers front end for voting fronting front and for results and so on so that was a pretty big one and i want you to use docker compose with one at least predefined image usually it's database and one image of your own so like a supplication or something when then we go to the most interesting part of this thing i want you work not only with us but you work with each other if possible if you don't containerize some of your like proprietary project please publish it on github on your own repository then create a new issue at datastaxdev docker learning path issues there is a special template for you to fill very simple very short one and i do hope you will do that and i will try to help and review some of the projects where as well then finally choose an issue from the list of other issues because you will be hopefully not the only one who publishes something write a comment on the issue what you would like to review this one review the project think how you would review it how you would improve that maybe there is something you would suggest and write it as a comment to this issue if you have time and if you have interest feel free to review multiple projects so you will have overview of what people are doing with docker and docker compose and it will help you be better be better but also you will see all how it works try to clone repositories of other people and make docker compose up and see how it works very important feedback must be always done in a positive manner and i take it very seriously next thing if you want us to review your assignment publicly send us the link using discord or email or github or whatever you prefer and some of the best submissions we will cover next workshop because next shop workshop is exactly going to be regarding the application development and we really would like to have some asylum some assignments done like that and finally we spent together over four hours already so at us on linkedin and twitter and youtube and thank you for your questions we are overtime so i will answer your questions in discord thank you so much for being with us and see you next week yeah thank you very much and see you next week [Music] on the same page
