  "description": "Full tutorial + resources: http://bit.ly/tutorials-recipes | A brief guide on how to Setup Your First Search Query on DataStax Enterprise. We have lots of helpful videos on DataStax Academy. Some cover big topics, like Apache Cassandra data modeling and some answer single questions like how do I install DataStax Enterprise. If our big course-long topics are \"full course meals,\" these single question, DataStax Enterprise Recipes are \"quick snacks.\"\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 5\nDataStax Enterprise 5.0, the database platform for cloud applications, includes Apache Cassandra 3.x with materialized views, tiered storage and advanced replication.
