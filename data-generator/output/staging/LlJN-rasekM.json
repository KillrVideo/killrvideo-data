  "description": "GraphFrames is a powerful feature in Spark that allows you to harness Spark's distributed computing framework to operate on your Graph. Tasks like data ingestion, schema migrations, and analytical jobs can all be run against your Graph. In DSE Graph, there are several methods to leverage GraphFrames including Gremlin, Spark SQL, and Motif. In this talk, Jim will walk through the basics of using GraphFrames with DSE Graph; he will then l show how these different methods can be used and how you can evaluate which one is the best for your use case.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "so my name is Jim Hatcher I'm a solution architect at data stacks which means I get to go out and work with clients and help them set up data sex products so it's a fun job barely enjoy it I'm gonna talk about graph frames today and I'm gonna talk some about open source graph rhymes but I'm also gonna talk some about data stacks specific graph range because that's you know what I work with day in and day out so but I hope this will be an informative talk whether you're using the DC graph or whether you're using graph frames in some other context so quick agenda I'm just gonna talk about the building blocks some of the concepts that go into graph frames and kind of kind of my mental model for how I approach approach this and then I'll talk about some things that are in open source graph reims and then do some DSC specific stuff and then I'm going to tempt fate and try to do a live demo of some things and we'll see how that goes and then give you some some resources and I'll post these slides so slide share and you can if you something really your branch then you can track me down and find the slides use them so building blocks so I'm talking my graph frames I can't move well when I'm talking about graph frames so graph frames is a patchy SPARC project that's a way to to do it to it analytical work against the graph model and so the the roots of graph frames to me are pretty deep and I think it's kind of interesting so I tried to think of the best way to represent that and I thought a picture would be good so I came up with this kind of model and so a DC graph is a component within the data sex Enterprise stack and the the the the data layer how the data is stored is an Apache Cassandra so that's a distributed database and so that's kind of the foundational piece piece and then the next piece to kind of understand is okay now what happens when we bring graph theory into the mix you know graph theory is a you know mathematical some concepts denis talked about sign up for a graph theory class in her keynote keynote talk and so really it says leo how can we think about things as graphs and what are vertices and water edges and then you can pull that into the concept of a graph database okay now that i'm modeling my data in that way how can i persist my data in that way and then there's the apache ticker pop library in the gremlin traversal language and you put all those things together and those those give you DSC graph so you know so far you have to understand a little bit about distributed databases and you have to understand a little bit about graph theory and a little bit about graph databases and then we have this the stack down here at the bottom that involves apache spark so if you don't know about you spark it's a it's a distributed execution framework it's used a lot in the Hadoop ecosystem it's used in the Cassandra ecosystem it's used in others but the idea is you you you want some way to distribute code execution across many servers and so it's a pretty powerful framework we use it in graph for analytics meaning work you know we want to do some analysis since the data whether that's some basically bi stuff you know group counts or whether it's some type of machine learning that kind of thing but you can also just think of it as a tool to do data ingest you want to run some utilities against your data that kind of thing it's it's a handy handy thing for that so and then if you've kind of followed the progression of SPARC you'll know that the the SPARC world kind of started out with this thing called an RDD the resilient distributed data set and everything you know we are learning about rdd's and what they do for us and if they give us your you know resiliency in our data and there are immutable all these things and then in the spark world things really moved from rdd's to data frames which kind of Nabal the advent of spark sequel and things like the catalyst query optimization engine came into play and tungsten which gives us some memory thing so so in the spark world things have moved from rdd's to data frames for for a lot of things and then we bring in the idea of machine learning and graph algorithms there's a lot of really neat machine learning algorithms so you can do against the graph data model things like PageRank and connectedness and sensuality and so there's a library in SPARC called spark graphics which gives us a way to do PageRank and these types of things against the distributed graphs and then as spark started moving from rdd's towards data frames the graphics library jumped on that bandwagon and I said okay we're gonna come up with thing called graph frames so to me that conceptually the lineage of a graph frame is it's kind of complex and it involves a lot of things so I think you can either look at that as sort of a daunting thing like oh man if I wanted to get in the graph room just look at all this stuff I've got to learn and that's true but you can also look at it as wow that's a lot of powerful concepts coming together and if I can get my my head around that mARMS around that there's some really really really powerful things I can do with it so anyway so and it kind of the advent of all this stuff on the on the Friday far out of the screen we have a thing called the DC graph frame which is a specialized graph frame that takes the things available in the open source graph frame and adds a few if you keep it buildings onto that make it interesting so I'll say if you want is this as a space you're interested in and there's a book by Manning publications called spark graphics in action and the author of that book the first third of the book he really says here's a chapter on graph theory and here's a chapter on graph algorithms there's a chapter on functional programming and he does a really nice job of just explaining what SPARC is and explaining what graph is and then kind of bringing them all together and so it's written that a bad book for just learning spark so anyway a good starting point if your this is sort of you know graph frames 101 for you so a lot of neat concepts kind of coming together and after I created this picture I realized that I had unwittingly created a graph and this is my life now I think it's actually a directed acyclic graph which I also didn't do on purpose but um there yeah there you are so okay and then just just one more picture just to kind of set the the scope of what we're talking about in the DC graph world or from the DC world we typically have this is a common set up where we'll have two data centers and one is meant to serve up OLTP traffic and another one is meant to serve up you know batch analytic so OLAP kind of traffic and Cassandra is kind of the under underpinning that knows how to move data back and forth anytime you write to one it automatically writes to the other but you know we typically try to isolate you know our real-time low latency traffic to one data center and we'll isolate you know our low concurrency you know batch jobs to another data center so most of the stuff I'm talking about would be things that would happen over here on the right side in the green the green world so I just want to make that point so okay so let's let's talk about graph frames a bit okay so you know because of their lineage they're you know just out of the box capabilities that they pick up there they're innately parallelizable so if you have some process you're gonna run you know you don't have to worry about writing multi-threaded code you don't have to worry about you know kind of managing that plumbing because SPARC does that for you you know it's part of the plumbing built in and it picks up the resilience and distributed execution ability of spark and then because it leverages data frames from spark it you know you pick up catalysts and tungsten and ability to spark sequel so just kind of get that out of the way now the next next kind of specific thing it does is a feature called motif finding and motif is if you're familiar with a site for a query language that it's popular I can neo4j so motif is a subset of that language and it kind of looks like ASCII art give you an example of it in a minute but it's a way to say I'm looking for a pattern a motif and my data I'm gonna describe it as this little picture of vertices and edges and then I'm out of run it against the data so that's one thing you can do in graph frames another thing that's built in the graph frames are implementations of common graph algorithms so there's there's some there's some really powerful algorithms in here I just I'm less down some but you know some of the ones that are really interesting to me or PageRank which you may know as you know the kind of the main publicized way that that Google does or at least did in the early days how they do search you know how they rank their search results that's named after Larry Page the founder of Google shortest paths is a very interesting algorithm you can do against your graph connected components so so these are all built in and most of these come from graphics and they're done as RDD operations and and that that makes a lot of sense I I used to think in fact in graph frames the implementation of these things early just wrappers are on the already D versions and in some cases that I don't think it really even makes sense to try to to make it like a tabular type of thing because they're very you know the nature of the algorithms is that they want to parse through the graph and walk the graph so anyway so some there's some great great I'll go the rooms there and then if there's some other algorithms that you wanted to write on your own there there are several methods that are made available to you in graphics and graph frames which are aggregate messages and and Prague also if you wanted to do some other kind of algorithm that's not supported you can do it on your own and so and then I just wanted to come make the point that if you create a graph frame what you do is you know in spark you say okay Mike rate this graph frame and then I've got a I've got to tell you what my vertices are and tell you what my edges are so you do typically load that from you know on a text file or some type of binary format graph son or something like that and so you need to create the structure and they have to pull it in and it's just it's just kind of a powerful idea in itself you can say hey look I want to I'm gonna store my data in a relational database but then I want to go run some graph algorithm against it so I can export that data and then bring it into a spark process and say okay this is you know the this these tables in the rational database I'm gonna represent those vertices and these tables I'm gonna represent his edges and even though I don't store it as my system of record as a graph database I can still take advantage of graphic or algorithms that I can run against it so so that's what I wanted to say about OSS graph frames so DSC graph frames sit on top of that and one nice feature of DSC graph frames if you're using DSC graph to create to create DC graph frame I have to do this they sparked that DC graph and then point to the name of your graph and it'll know oh well you're you've already got a graph database I know what the vertices are I know what the edges are academically just start running an algorithm so that's kind of a nice a nice just kind of a shortcut but you can also do the same kind of thing you do in OSS graph frames and say hey I want to load you know data from this text file and Union it with this data from this relational database you know anything you bring into spark you can you can pull in as your vertices and edges so one thing that data stacks brought into the se graph frames that are not an open source is tinker prop support so you know there is the motif finding built-in but you can also do take a wraps for so if you're if you're in the DC graph world any kind of oh-oh-oh-oh TP interaction you're doing with your with your date with your graph you're doing through tinker pops so it's very nice to be able to say hey I've got this library of query patterns that I'm already running I can just take those and I can pull those into I pull those in the graph frames and run them in a scan operation however there's a there's a catch there that most most of the tinkerer pop API the gremlin API is supported but there are some things that are not so you know you have to be a little careful there so some notable exclusions that things that are not supported are the the repeat step the Union step as in select step or three that that are come to mind so and and really they're well I want I was gonna give my opinion as to why I thought they weren't supported but over time I think we'll continue to see more and more of those steps supported in graph rings so you know graph frames are very good for operations that you think about is a big scan across your graph you know typically an OLTP mode you're not gonna be scanning through your graph say give me every you know customer vertex label and do something with it you're gonna be very discreet and and make very small small operations on the graph but if you want to do something like get me a count of vertices that you think that'd be a very simple thing to do but in OLTP mode we don't let you do that so just doing something like that it's really handy to have graph frames in the mix so here's some common things you can do in your graph Jonathan lacy will just give it a talk about how can you understand the cardinality and summary statistics of your data to avoid super super nodes so this could be an option that you'd want to do just do some simple group counting of your graph and you know if you have this work a little actually zoom set up where you have OTP traffic over here and that's traffic over here you can do that without affecting your you know your production whatever kind of traffic so so it's good for that another thing that ref frames is really good at is anything you want to do against your your graph that's going to cause you mutations so you know we tend to think about graph frames is like an analytical thing you're trying to get you know insight into your data but it can also be used to just very like you utility kind of thing so you know doing an initial load of data into your graph graph frames is very good very good tool for that kind of thing because you know it's it's parallelized already you know if you have data like in text files that you're going to pull out and load into your graph you can put those on a distributed file system like DSC FS or HDFS use graph to read that data and it can you know if you get a you know 30 node spark cluster you can have 30 nodes just cranking data into your graph so it's one of the fastest way to push data into the graph and batch and then you know another another place I see customers using it is like in a dev environment maybe you've got a model that you're starting to code against and you know schema and you decide oh we've got a super node problem or we've got some kind of problem and our schema that's not working well we want to alter our schema you know split this vertex label in the two or something and but meanwhile you've loaded a hundred million vertices into your dev environment you don't want to just wipe it out and redo it so you can you know write a graph frame job that says take the data push it you know you know transform it push it into the new schema Dini for that and then things like hey I want to go drop all instances of vertex label X you know I don't you know we messed that up we're gonna reload it so I just want to zap it teenee for that kind of stuff let's see and so that there's there's two methods I'll demo one in a minute once called update vertices and what's called update edges so those are two things that I'm 99% certain are not in no SS graph frames that that are in DSF the SC graph frames that are they're really handy okay demo I'm gonna give this a shot here [Music] okay so I'm going to bring up a tool data stacks to do try to make that bigger yeah yeah see that okay [Music] Oh so for this demo yeah there is this demo I'm using like the killer video reference application this is something that they sex uses as an hour training videos is that kind of thing it's kind of our reference architecture so you can see the schema over here on the right what we had was database says movies and then we have actors that act in a movie and directors and that kind of thing and we have users that rated movies and so you can see the schema here I'm looking this at this in data stack studio which is just a notebook solution we have it's really meant to be like a developer tool just to help us interact with graphs oh okay so just kinda as a starting point this is a typical gremlin query might we might run in OLTP mode we're saying go to the graph give me all the vertices that are of type movie and then find me the specific one that has a title of I am Legend and like we we get that back here and I just want to point out that by my default if I if I take off this has claws and try to run that query studio tell me you can't do that because that requires a scan of that vertex label and we don't allow you to do that in fact that message actually says graph scan is not suitable for anything other than toy graphs which is always thought was kind of a passive-aggressive message but but so you you you can tell it you know I specifically want to allow scans but the whole idea is that that's not a scalable thing that's not something you want to be doing against a graph that has a billion vertices and it's gonna take you know minutes to to do that so but but I can in in kind of normal mode here whoops you know just if I give it a specific entry point into the graph I can do that so so this is kind of the typical way that we interact with graph if this is something we're doing that's a ltp operation this is the kind of thing we're doing so in studio i can i can say okay i'm and i click on that movie on my expand its neighborhood and include anybody on the actor edge so if I do that studio will kind of bounce around and show me all the actors who are in I am Legend and then if you wanted to you can keep kind of expanding out and doing that so just so just want to give you a sense of that now if I wanted to do a query like this what I'm saying is give me movies that that are I am Legend and go out find me all the actors and then group group you know give me a count of actors that are in that movie so that's doubly and I am Legend we have eight actors so if I wanted to I could comment out this the specific clause and again I get this message telling me that this scan is not suitable for anything of those Mattila graphs so I can't cheat and say that I want to allow scan to happen and so I'll do that and then if I then if I run this query it will actually show me the results so we can see that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part-2 has 44 actors in it and you know other other Harry Potter movies have a lot of actors in them so so this is an example of you know I'm gonna go this is something that basically scans through the graph does some aggregation and give me the results back so I don't it's not something I typically doing ltp mode so it's my first example of something that would be good to do in a graph frame so let me switch over to a spark shell so there's a spark shell it's just a interactive command line that I can use to interact so let's see so just just to kind of get a sense to this if I took well first first let me let me create an instance of a graph frame so I'll save algae it's not big enough Val G equals spark that DSC graph killer video which is the name of my graph and when I do that spark should tell me I have a graph a DSC graph frame so it says I have a variable here called G which is a type DSC graph frame so now if I run this I'm saying give me a count of all the verse vertices in my graph which it'll do and the result of that is as a data frame so or a traversal so I need I need to do a show to tell SPARC to actually go execute that give it to me so it says I've got ten thousand seven hundred eighty-seven vert vert vertices so I can break that down further and I could say give me a count of vertices by their label so I can run that I forgot my show and so then it breaks it down by by labels for me so it's a handy little tool like if you if you're just loading data in your graph for dev and you think that well I just loaded a text file ten thousand records today I'll make it into the graph you know handy little thing like that so but this example that I was that I did and the other side if I try to do it it actually runs into some problems and in this case it's because I'm not referencing the right library but I can tell you I don't think the group count by is supported in graph frame so here's an example where we have kind of limited tinker prop support so but however in graph frames we kind of have several ways to think and think about how to do things so because we're because we're operating graph frames which sits on top of data frames we have access to do things in spark sequel so if I come over here I'll run these two statements and what I'm saying is go out to my graph called killer video and all the vertex instances I want to register as vertices and edging says I want to register as vert vert edges and now these are available in my metadata store so if I want to do a sequel statement against those things I can do that so if I paste that in over here and then do movies and actor counts that show that would kick off a spark job at run that so this is a very comfortable space for me I've spent a lot of time in this sequel world so you know thinking thinking about this as a tabular type of thing that I want to scan through into a group by statement or a having statement there's a very comfortable space for me and I I would think a lot of people out there have you know come to graph database from the racial Davis world and this is a this is a good thing to do and you see we got the same Harry Potter movies as our as our as our top top answers here so and I'll tell you in general you know I this is an example of something we saw we could do in studio an OLTP mode or we could do in graph frames and in in in batch mode generally speaking this stuff runs much faster in graph frames than it does on the OTP side and I think the you know the the probably the bigger takeaway is even though I can in this instance get this to run I only have 10,000 vertices in this graph if I had a you know 500 million vertices graph this is not going to scale well this this might this is a probably timeout or might you know might run for I don't know hours or something but on the spark side you know it's it's built built to do that so a pretty powerful thing okay next example how am i doing on time - I might skip this one for now and come back but there's another spark sequel example where I'm looking for actors who it would appeared in movies that are across multiple genres ok so let me let me come back to that one maybe so I may give an example of motif finding and if you see here what we have is we say gee that finds the G where G is our graph frame and then we pass it the string which I like to describe as ASCII art this is the motif language so what I'm saying here is I have a vertex that I'm going to call movie and it's adjacent to a vertex called person and that's connected by an incident edge called a 1 now now what I call those doesn't matter I could call it x y&z doesn't matter you know the only context that matters in is if you if you put another statement over here and you call it the same thing motifs gonna link those together and say oh that's the same instance of that vertex so here I'm saying ok I'm looking for movies that are connected to two persons and then I'm looking for movies that are connected to John Rah's and so that's kind of the first step you say here's the pattern I'm looking for here's the motif I'm looking for and then you can apply this filter statement and this looks very much like a sequel where clause and I could say that thing that a reference is person above I'm looking for specifically the label or that's the person so that's aweso that's the person vertex label in my graph etc so the these lines here I'm just kind of giving it some plumbing and and then here I'm saying and where that genre is in comedy so so I'll just run this so that gives me a dataframe back and if I show that we'll see the spark job kicks off and should give me a list of movies that were in people who acted in movies that were in the comedy genre so I'll say one thing I found about using this motif finding a lot of the stuff you could do in motif you could also think of how to do in a spark sequel kind of way so it's given me the first 20 rows so here's Sally Phillips acted in Bridget Jones diary and that's comedy so one of the things I found is that if you take that data frame that it built and you do an explained on it spark will tell you basically the the plan that it's put together to build this and sometimes I do get into actually reading the details of this you know there's things in spark you want to avoid like shuffles where I have to move data across note something like that and you can get into get get into this but sometimes if I'm looking to do something I think I could do that as a motif or I could do that as spark sequel sometimes alright at both ways and then I'll look at the explain tenant plan and you can get into looking at the details but generally speaking if the explaining plans this long you know 20 lines long or and this one's 100 lines long the 20 lines gonna be a lot faster so I found in general if it's something I could do in both that the spark sequel really ends up being faster and most of my experience so you know like that this is this is the explaining plan for this motif guy if I look at the explained plan we did for the movie and actor counts let's just get a sense of how long that was much shorter I mean we're doing the same thing but there's just gonna be a sense of it if you've seen a short plan that's that's usually good okay all right so the next thing I want a demo is doing shortest path but let's take a look at something real quick so what I want to show here is I'm just doing a traversal where I say find me a guy named John Wayne and then go into this repeat step limit it to ten seconds so I don't create some thing that goes on forever and what I want to do is look at our schema start at the person I want to go in on the actor edge which gets me to a movie then I'm gonna come back out on the actor edge just give me back to a person so that's what we're doing here and then we're saying give me the simple path so don't know creating any cycles don't go from John Wayne to what they don't know Green Berets back to John Wayne back to Green Berets you know only go a simple past not non-ace non a cyclic path eight whatever you know I'm saying and so if I run this it's just gonna start at John Wayne just kind of Traverse for a while and and what you see here is that John Wayne I was in the sons of Katie elder and also and that was a guy named John littell so so the the shorts path algorithm in graphics I learned is part of the business presentation together only follows edges in their direction so if you say I want to find the shortest path from John Wayne to Jimmy Stewart it'll start at John Wayne and it'll go out out out it'll never go in and so in this graph if I start at John Wayne and try to go out there is no out so like so the short path example I want to do is for you know what's the shortest path from John Wayne to Jimmy Stewart you know and so this won't work so in order to do a shortest path algorithm on this what I'm going to do is create short cut edges from every actor to every other actor who's worked in the same movie so because I can do mutations in graph frames I'm gonna do that here so I won't get too much into this but what I do is I start a person and I go to an actor and go to a movie and then go to another actor and I join that all together and then I I build a data frame here that that's an edge that says I'm gonna create actor an edge between actor 1 and actor - and I'm gonna call that thing work together so the first thing I want to do go back to data stacks to do what I want to do is alter my schema to create a new edge label called worked together between people so after I run this will see that the schema change over here on the right so you'll notice this recursive edge that Jonathan warned us that might cause some super node issues in the last talk but that there it is and then I'm gonna run this fellow and pieces [Music] so we create some datasets that basically pointing and the structures in our graph and then when you say I'm gonna do this first step which joins whoops sorry [Music] actors two people I'm gonna do this next step which joins that result two movies the next step which joins that two actors again and then I create this data frame called the shortcut edges and the shortcut edges when I'm done I have a data set that has a column called source and I have a column that has a name that's d'Este and then I have a thing called tilde label so those are the three columns that are required in graph frames for edge structures they basically say you know connecting this source that this does the nation with this label so then what I do is I call a method on my graph frame called update edges and I'm gonna passing that shortcut edge and this has worked for me a couple times and it went weird on me one time so hopefully the demo gods are smiling down upon me this is gonna work so and on I had this problem earlier I think it has something to do with the way I'm pasting it in the well and pasting this in denise could you like dance or soft-shoe yeah let's hear it let's hear it that's bad I know uh it's like the DBA walks into a bar and he goes up to two tables and he says do you mind if I join you okay all right so Brooke on me all right but the the what was supposed to happen was we'd see work together edge between John Wayne and John littell and then an edge go in the other direction between John littell and John Wayne and by the magic of television I have actually run this and stored the results so it's an example how you run shortest paths one thing about running running these graph algorithms is that use a spark checkpointing so you have to set up a checkpoint directory on a distributed file system of some kind so I'll just run that those little plumbing and then what you do is we're gonna say I want to you know run from my graph frame owner in shortest paths and you pass it a set of landmarks and the landmark is your you know what you're saying is I want to go through my whole graph and say what's the shortest path from every vertex in my graph to whatever these landmarks are you can just give it one thing or you could give it a thousand things whatever so in this case I'm just gonna pick John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart so I need to pass in a sequence of the IDS of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart and in graph frames the IDS look a little weird so I'm just gonna run this statement so you can see John Wayne's ID is the person which is the vertex label and like a base64 encoding of the of the keys so and we have of John Wayne's ID and Jimmy Stewart's ID and then what you would do is you know pass those in here passing the landmarks and then you'd run it so I did this earlier and I stored the results in Cassandra and you know this is this is something we clients doing a lot where you want to go run some algorithm I mean it's a personalization algorithm or edge waiting algorithm or something you want to do that you want to store the results and then you want to like serve them up and your OLTP system I kind of think so there's a little shortcut method that we have in DSC that says given a data frame go create me a Cassandra table with a schema that matches that so it's a little shortcut thing so this created a table called the shortest paths in the key space called test and then I kind of tell what my keys are and then what I did was I took the results of that and I wrote it out to that table so I'm spring up this other terminal window and so I have a table here called the shortest path where I stored this output and so here's one of the results of our shortest path algorithm this says for the vertex labeled person with that key this is a person called Sara Valiente she is six you know that from her to John Wayne is six six places away and from her to Jimmy Stewart is five places away so I'll store that Cassandra and you can see if you if you actually go look at Jimmy Stewart's record it says Jimmy Stewart is zero you know hops away from himself and he is one hop away from John Wayne so apparently Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne acted in a movie together so anyway that's an example of some shortest path and so that this algorithm went about 10,000 nodes took maybe five minutes to run you know it scans to the whole graph and creates all the shortest paths so it's pretty pretty powerful pretty powerful stuff and it's just canned you know like you'd you don't have to tell it how to traverse the graph you just tell it go out there and just scan through this thing it's pretty cool so that's my example I got some resources here I'll just talk to him real quick this first thing I guess I can present again the first thing is the the graph frames page and it's got a little description and documentation about how you can use two different algorithms sample on how to do you know connected components etc this next link is the the graphics code and you know it's a surprisingly small code base you can go out there and see how they do shortest paths and all I'll tell you most of it's based on message passing algorithm and my colleague mr. Pires Mehra is gonna do a talk this afternoon where he kind of gets down into the details items that works so that that's interesting to you make sure to attend that this third link is the graph frames code this fourth link is a presentation that Russell Spitzer and our tomalley have did these are two the two of the engineers at DSC who wrote DHT graph frames so it's pretty pretty pretty neat talk and and some blog explains some things about it and then this last link is that the meaning book I was talking about earlier graphics in action it it's a book about graphics but it has several chapters on graph frames and if you want to get started in it I'd highly recommend that is a really good place to just kind of jump in okay well thank you for Jason [Applause]",
