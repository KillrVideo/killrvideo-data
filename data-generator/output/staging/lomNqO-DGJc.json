now and siri's already trying to talk to me all right good it looks like we are live i see all the folks so let's say we have cedric hi cedric hi how are you guys happy to be there we've got bettina hi guys and jack fryer who nobody has ever seen his face before it's amazing and alex we cannot forget about alex yeah that's right where is it there's alex here's alex and then oops right wait i'll get it eventually this is hard to do eric there's eric the other eric i can't this is right all right well hello everybody hello hello i see a bunch of highs that are coming in the youtube chat and the uh the discord chat welcome to our last bonus episode of the cassandra workshop series it's time to have some fun so before we get started anyone anyone have anything they wanna they wanna say [Music] patrick i know you always have words well i mean what am i going to say other than congratulations you made it eight weeks um and what do you get out of it another eight weeks no no no wait do it wait the next eight weeks starts now welcome to the preview we're now going to start our 32-week series no no no no oh my god i'm here i could deal with 32 weeks of this no alex alex again he's a trooper yeah 64 weeks what are you talking about and christian is asking did i forget patrick maybe i did forget patrick i was trying to do the point thing over to patrick it's really hard when everything's like reverse and upside down so uh christian let me just tell you yes he did and a matter of fact he didn't even invite this column to the last second until he realized i don't believe he didn't match up yeah don't believe the kind of respect i get here that's okay that's all right don't don't believe what he says so so at this point all right we see all the team i think everybody here is probably familiar uh with everybody and who we all are so we've gathered everyone here today to have some fun now we'd be totally miss if we didn't start with a mentee right now one thing i do want to point out notice there's a qr code on there you can just scan that instead of having to do the mentee.com but we'll still do that as well so let's go ahead and get to menti because you know our game there hey that's an improvement yeah like you know it wouldn't be this series without a mentee so let's go ahead and get in there what's a qr code um a qr code is that funny square barcode looking thing that you can uh i don't know if this is the same on android take your cell phone yeah you could just take your camera and scan it and it will matter of fact i'm going to do that myself right now it's built into every cell phone except in australia eric so yeah let's go to the mentee all right i'm going to open the menu myself make sure that that's doing what we expected to do and if you would give us a nice thumbs up on that there we go i see all the thumbs up coming in wonderful i'm giving up i want to do it as well you know okay are we ready exactly i'm ready i'm ready are you ready oh yes i am so i don't know how many of you are actually know what kind of questions and stuff i put in here so we'll just figure that out i think everyone should join because that's the last main tea it is the last one all the course we need okay not for last maintain general but for last of this course okay who would be in the top ten uh-huh yeah this is this is like you know if you've been one of those folks have been really working on the mental quizzes and everything and you've been like man i just haven't got on the top three you've got this chance you have this chance all right so the first two questions they're really just going to be more some of our survey things and uh now i swear we don't ask this to just try to get a bunch of feel goods um but yes how likely would you be to recommend the cassandra workshop series oh let's just stop right there i'm just going to stop the survey right there don't take it right yeah perfect just not gonna do it huh who's not gonna do it what are you doing what are you doing what's stopping you said you're gonna stop it well i wanted to stop because the score was really nice so i was like don't jinx it all right get that one person who gives us like a zero now like no yeah that's usually the case there's always somebody's gotta be contrarian you know what you need is less so j12 uh which we know j12 from the series uh over in discord says ten on ten thank you thank you for that we really do appreciate that i'll take it myself awesome already well thank you i'm gonna go ahead and move on at that point thank you for the responses and this one is free form this is for you to fill out what were the highlights in the low lights of the series and um you know highlights are always wonderful we want to know about those low lights too you know what things could have been better what things did you really like more importantly i i want to know how i can not pay anybody because they messed us up cedric second yeah it's i mean it's important for us like if you're going to recommend it to a friend tell us what we can do to make it better for your friend yes yes yes no we're really your friend what i want to know is killer video a highlight or a low light [Laughter] i like the eric guy was odd that's so true we have to work with him every day yeah totally wasn't me submitting that one totally not let's see oh that's interesting a lot of a lot of different connected technologies we covered chat was a bit distracting that's interesting okay um oh you know i like the fact that people say kubernetes part was good because at the first place we expect to focus only on cassandra but after a few weeks we made that bigger talking about cloud kubernetes totally now there's one on here that if you could see my face you'd see me i'm kind of face palm to myself low lights examples were not tested on windows you know that's fair we i think so many of us it's yeah so many of us work on max and linux platforms and such and we do have windows machines um there i would say there's a lot of truth and we did not at first test as thoroughly on windows and i think some of you uh have beared the brunt of that and then i think a lesson learned we definitely had from this series i think what half the folks that we're on were all windows users so lesson learned for us in the future um so patrick we all need very powerful gaming pcs that's right yeah please alienware r16 for everyone oh yeah alienware is great for windows totally yeah no i have one of those i have a gaming laptop it's it's kind of funny you call it a laptop i mean the thing weighs enormous it weighs more than a desktop and it the power supply is bigger than the laptop yeah 185 watt power supply oh that's weak dude i got a 230 watt power supply yeah it's a portable gaming rig that's what it is but i think it'd be perfect for this oh yeah i think we should with that you can do week six exercise [Laughter] i'd see to travel with one of those i like the i like the uh i like the low lights or the highlights the whole series interactivity low lights why only swag for the top three not top ten that was good one or missing good material and prep work missing a chapter in cassandra stats um what's that cassandra stack is that like with the metrics yeah is that we're talking like um maybe in the chat um whoever typed that one if you can give us a little clarification on are you referring to like uh what eric just mentioned like the actual metrics coming off of them or more ops admin kind of stuff let's see oh yeah the the cast operator was magic i do agree there's some magic going in there is that a good magic or bad magic that's not a good coach yeah i'm gonna go for yeah dark magic or something i'm definitely seeing a lot of good for the mentees of people everyone seems to like the mentees except for actually okay that actually would be a really interesting uh session to do at some point is get someone like um jim dickinson or someone on here and talk about okay what actually went into the center operator yeah dig in uh chandran answered yes it is on cassandra metrics and statistics okay so that's with that one thank you for following up there oh just stand by chandran so we we've got we've got some stuff coming your way that will blow your mind and make your life easier don't know if it's selling now we have to make it really good oh geez yeah maybe it's awesome maybe not oh looking forward for kafka and training and dockers kubernetes eager to learn these technologies um i see one in the middle here this highlight understanding the power of cloud native low point realizing how limited my hardware ubuntu box is now to that low point that's also another lesson learned i would say for us um we found that there were i would say i would say a majority of folks that were with us on the series that resource wise and their their machines like definitely the kubernetes one trying to spin up three cassandra nodes on a single machine i have a really good machine in it that's hard to do so definitely we may have uh kind of went a little too far in the resource needs uh in certain cases so that's definitely something for us to to kind of fix in the future ooh another good lowlights lesson cassandra real world problem patterns and troubleshooting oh yeah i'm seeing a bunch of windows ones not just not just that david hands-on lab environment is a highlight a little bit of both that's really sweet and they put a lot of effort on having their environment for their kubernetes related trainings for example yes so training instances yeah yeah totally did you take a screenshot of what oh going into a database somewhere yeah right right um i only pull out the low lights though sorry yeah well i saw this one i will miss you all we're not going anywhere we're just not just ending the series it's not like we're all gonna be like okay we're all moving we're all changing careers uh yeah yeah no we we are definitely gonna have more coming and we we really do again we appreciate the feedback and we take all the stuff that all of you say seriously and we use that to kind of evolve uh what we're doing next so thank you everybody for that um so at this point right we're in our secret bonus episode this is really the last one of this particular series and for today i mean we've already kind of started talking you know touching on some of this stuff but uh you know we're gonna we're gonna go over the astrakathon winners and we'll we'll talk about uh those those projects and those folks go over a little bit of a recap of what we did for the series we're going to have a fun mentee a ridiculous mentee you can still win swag in this and then we're going to end with an access anything except for bettina we're just gonna mute her and we're not gonna let betina talk at all yeah [Laughter] and look at the slides too late what's the what's that doing there you know this is the reason why we idew the slide to be honest yeah yeah all right so with that let's go into the strike-a-thon winners should we just sit here for a moment with suspense or should we do it be nice to the people come on should we do that the music turned it in oh yeah you know where did my music go actually i should we should need good music for this sorry yeah yeah yeah we need some suspense music epic music well you guys can a lot of submissions by the way thank you very much for everyone that did yeah yes and they were all over the map yeah yeah there are all sorts of really interesting submissions and different technologies all sorts of things okay are we ready let's do this all right so here are our winners in third place uh you know by the way maybe uh alex alex can you say anne's aim's name i definitely can pronounce uh first one so the first place goes to marat marat goodbye dulin second place that's a little bit harder for me but still something i can't handle that's obviously kevin garcia and the last one is the hardest for me so sorry if i'm wrong it's i am chakra um i think you did better than i was gonna do oh there's zion yeah i see iron in the youtube chat um now what we're what we're gonna do is um we're just gonna go through all three of these real quick and just give a kind of quick summary um so who had ion who can give i in summary uh i can i can so um you know what i will copy paste the ion repo on the chat you know just to see so i ended up maven you know a maven project uh well structures using like it test i mean the long-term super gdk gdk11 so we went through all the documentation as you can see there is a lot of documentation for us to deep dive good package structure good naming overall good data model using bucketing where needed um some you know some curl command to to test um you didn't have the maximum note because there are some glitches in the documentation we had to fix here and there are missing s in the url or everything but that's really a good job and that's really a good sample for anyone wanting to do a project on astra slash cassandra so here you got everything you need so congratulations and cedric i see that you dropped the link on youtube could you also drop that in discord to the repo i can thank you there it goes boom so for those of you who are interested add something here too david yeah go ahead this is not the last time so that i know a lot of people were like can you give us an extension uh hang on to that code if you didn't submit it um this is not the last time we're gonna do this we had a lot of fun but this was a last minute thing we uh we're now working with hacker earth um which is a company that does professional hackathons um but we'll also do some of our own as well um if you're a student we're working with major league hacking um for you know for the 18 to 24 if you're a university student uh we just partnered with major league hacking so plenty of places for you to win prizes get some cash show your show your chops and when you do something like this put it on linkedin yeah that's where you get noticed and we will amplify it um we want to we want to really make sure that you are well known to be a total rock star all righty all right so for number two who's got kevin uh that's on my side and i can say that's a very good submission for the astra caton um that's a java project regarding radioscopy researches like in the medical field and it looks very good code is very clean and easy to understand not so much documentation but you basically don't need so much documentation with a well-organized and very readable project uh very well doctorized containerized and in general very good overall view and it works how it should work and it looks nice and yes i really enjoyed reviewing these uh piece of code yep you know to that point i gotta say by the way um you know when we first started doing the hackathon and you know as patrick mentioned you know we we kind of did this right at the end here in the last minute um you know i was kind of curious to see what we were going to get i actually had a ton of fun going through all the projects that everybody submitted and checking out what was there and downloading like you know downloading their apps or going to the github repo and working on them and seeing them and i found it to be actually really quite fun i'd like to get time to go through all of them if patrick or cedric will let me do that we'll see we'll see what happens i don't think we have a github link for kevin do we yeah i was going to ask you we have materials that we can drop for kevin's submission i thought that was a zip i am typing an answer meanwhile yes it was a zip file uh so not a git repository but by the way for the next workshop for sorry for the next astra caton i believe we need to make a requirement to have it published as github because it's much easier to review obviously a git repository so i can make some notes and so on so what's easier yeah yeah on that and it's easier to get out to the community right than other folks are able to take a look at what you've done and use them for their own needs and wants as well okay so then the last one but the first one marat who's got marat well i did do an intro with kevin sorry cedric did a much more detailed look at the code um so first i post this into here into the chats and i was absolutely blown away by the quality of that guitar repo that myra put together it has a lot of diagrams how the app is composed it has very clear instructions it worked everything every step worked and i and then it was dockerized it um you create the app with stopper compose and then everything was downloaded it took a while it downloaded the internet but then in the end i had a really really interesting app yes and there's actually a lot of complex components in there so it creates a cassandra container it creates an initialization container that creates this e-mail and then there are additional components in there so it uses um so many things uh etc is in a better position to comment on that but it uses kafka and it uses a lot of components for processing and aggregating the data in the end it's really time series and that's aggregated with a into a forecasting application so it's um it's really nice with a nice ui with a nice layout easy to follow i thought it was a fantastic submission awesome so congratulations to our three winners say a few things about the code oh i'm so sorry i'm so sorry let me let me yeah let me add a couple more so again congratulations same i was just impressed by the quality of the code i mean impressed is the world um you might tell with the readme if you go to the to the to the repo and see all the architecture diagrams and screenshots you might tell but all those components are fully quarkus you know the latest fast java microservice technologies there are some very nice trick to make the indeed the cassandra schema ready to go you don't have to do anything just docker compose build docker compose run and then a dedicated container that will connect to cassandra once cassandra is ready the schema and everything then of course you do have the aggregation using you know using kafka and spark and then spark machine learning to do some prediction on time series you know best use case forecast on the whole time i think i need to go check that out that's awesome yes yes yeah yeah yeah infinity infinity app so check it out on the github repo and just run it it's really easy to run just follow the steps i want to notice for everyone who uh make a proposal or send something to astra caton or any other competition please be absolutely sure you've included into the documentation of a project and yes you should have documentation some words about how to build the project because there were some submissions about any explanations how you should build that and well that's like a very that's how to be polite that you send some projects explain how to run it yeah yeah great now for our three winners um again oops i switch screens over here um again for i and kevin and marat ensure to reach out to jack fryer same thing for those of you familiar in the past with doing things um with our vouchers and stuff reach out to jack to get your gift cards right the ones that you earn and patrick i want to totally put you on the spot right um so when when the whole idea of the astrakathon came up right it wasn't just about having folks create stuff to submit it to us and then it just stops there right so what is the long-term goal for projects like these in the community uh we're gonna create a whole new startup on some of these they're that good i'm kidding we're building a to-do list so you're all invited to join my new startup that's great um what we want to do is uh we want to help promote these more we want to put these on our website we want to keep talking about them and more importantly highlight you the person who's designed it built it the engineer as someone who's worth talking about and we want to highlight our community members and give them all the mad props we can um lots of reasons i mean we want to we want to always highlight people in our community and show like here's people doing interesting things but we also want to give you an opportunity to show yourself off i mean this is a great way to get a new a leg up in your career and show people that you are not just an ordinary engineer you're a hacking engineer and it it helps and this is probably the most important thing it really helps our community members new people especially when they can see examples that are generated by other users because you know this team everyone you see on the screen here can generate examples all day long but you know there's an impact whenever you create an example that you build and you're a practitioner you do this every day it really helps our community um think of the first time you were working with cassandra or with astra and you were like wow i wish there was more examples to help yeah you could really help that that community build and it's just a great thing to do in community so um stay tuned we'll be promoting more of these yeah so it sounds like we have more of that coming yeah there was one question how many we got how many submissions approximately anybody has uh we had about 12 so around 12 submissions could be given a team yeah given the amount of time that's pretty that's pretty good yeah if we gave you more time uh i'm sure we would have had thousands you know honestly though just that 12 alone just so all of you know watching you know we this team that you see here we all went and evaluated just those 12. it took us the week from the time the last one until like yesterday later to get through them all um so yeah there you go you know you know so it did take a it did take a bit of time to properly evaluate them and and go through them all and everything so some it's okay that we had 12 but maybe in the future we can't have something i've done a six-month hackathon we did a well it was a six-month project for university students and we had well over it was like 150 submissions and we had to have individual conversations with everybody wow that was a long six months wow yeah alrighty great so it sounds like we have before you move on baby yeah go ahead so just quickly so if you guys like like patrick mentioned um before you know you need you can still do the do the work still publish your code on um linkedin or wherever and if you just tag us we'll we'll go and promote it as well oh that's a really good point yeah thank you eric we need to keep continue doing it does patrick say all right i see uh gaurav uh asked what countries were from but i'm gonna hold that off we'll wait to the ama we we told gore to go ahead just guess see if you can guess what countries we're all from right and then we can you can mine is very difficult that's mine yeah i've never i've never been able to figure yours out cedric it's just yeah well when he shows up with wine and chocolates to a team meeting it's really hard to figure out where they keep laying laying on his side just you know eating his grapes you know [Laughter] [Music] yeah so we will really easy to tell yeah so we'll save this for the ama yeah well when he starts wearing his kangaroo shirt then i know exactly where he's from [Laughter] oh that's funny all right so moving on moving on into the workshop recap um now for those of you who've been with us or were with us right for the whole eight weeks wow um you know it was it was a journey it was a journey for all of us as well um for those who joined us in the middle uh don't forget that you know you can always go back all of the episodes all the workshops were recorded all the materials still out there in github none of that has changed um but let's see cedric cedric you want to go through the recap i feel like you're good um yeah so you know we started with um the first two weeks focus 100 on cassandra data modeling uh architectures and data modeling uh because the best way to fade a customer project is the data modeling so first that really need that that was really the the the subject that you need to master first and then week three and four was very for me the meat of the series was how to build application using python java node and c-sharp but we we yeah i think c-sharp lasts for one or two weeks and after that we don't that was kind of hard that was trying to maintain like trying to do the code for all those languages every week and the c-sharp one just kind of fell off yeah um but you know now thinking twice as an application developer uh we we gave you a lot of info about the what happened under the hood in cassandra and with what could be the futures running in kubernetes having sas services and managed services for cassandra the the more the things you need to focus more is really how to develop how to provide the features and less how to you know install or deploy or scale your okay that that one of the things that we change in the future i guess and you know this is why next weeks five and six it was all about kubernetes uh joy joy and pains [Laughter] hardware issues where is my where is my box how can i do the exercise you know um i'm waiting for 50 minutes for my cluster to be up all those kind of things i think we eat like maybe 30 times the same question about resources on those exercises yeah but listen learn you know next time we will do some less demanding exercise yeah that may be a little much sweet you know speaking of reduces the hardware week seven even if it was all about performance test we are pretty you know pretty pretty calm pretty small about the the settings we needed to do the exercise yeah you know i'll tell you for week seven uh hopefully all of you felt this we felt a little guilty for what we did to you in weeks five and six so for week seven we kind of backed off on the homework because we were definitely getting the the feedback through uh the mentees and just asking you questions that you know a lot of folks were still catching up right and all the homework and everything so we hoped that by week seven it backed off a little bit gave you a chance to kind of catch up um and and i'm my hope from week seven is that again given if you all remember the survey question there of how many of you are honestly performance benchmarking your data models the vast majority were like we're not so i hope at least one of you has decided to start performance benchmarking your data models after that particular episode and if you don't uh we would love to hear your story about how you failed yeah and have you in a workshop uh it's it's just come on this is engineering you know you don't just build a bridge and say all right everyone go ahead no you test it by the way in youtube uh lebron punit says we accept your guilty apology that's awesome oh that's so good to hear yeah i feel so much better now what about the vms downloads [Laughter] i am so glad we moved away from the vms oh yeah oh my goodness all right and then week eight yeah it's a week eight about the cloud uh it's a road to the cloud very good feedback on this one i didn't expect that much i mean at least 10 to 15 people reached out to me and told me oh that thing's about introducing stuff to the cloud is very very interesting then we move the app to gke um i did the slide between i did the demo the day after uh it was a fun one with a lot of technical issues but in the end you do have the project to do it i'm very sorry to interrupt but there is a question in the chat or no statement in the chat oh no like uh which speaker belongs to each uh country and i only have one question i have only one question but very very big question alexander wales if russia or singapore well there was another one that said bettina lives in alaska but i'm like yeah bettina how is alaska it's a little cold or nice oh we have a heatwave at the moment that's great i i kind of like the cedric uh french canadian one well but i guess in germany you got it wrong eric it looks like i'm in australia no you're in the us should we spill the beans or are we going to try to yeah go ahead let's go sweat maybe you should have a magic quiz about it just create one real quick in the background while we're doing this [Laughter] i'd say we have about every time zone covered though i think so big hit yeah yeah i think we are definitely kind of uh run the gamut there all righty all right anyone anyone uh have anything else for the recap anything else you want to say there i think that about covers it really i mean it's a good long eight weeks yeah i think a big big thank you is an order for all those people there with us every week i thought that's impressive yes yes yes yeah it was so wonderful to come to the workshop you know ten minutes early and see oh my god there's already 18 people waiting right and it's you know they have to wait for still 10 minutes right yeah we had around uh jack correct me if i'm right we had a little over 2 000 people that were there every week yeah you're right yeah 2 000 people showed up every week i mean okay that's not like you know binge watching on netflix but uh we're just really happy to have that many community members join us all the time yeah speaking of binge watching does anyone out there in the community actually go and binge watch these you know if you do tell us in the chat there i'd be i'm kind of curious to know well i do know i do know of at least some folks i'm curious to see we're going to see in in the chats there eric i've had some folks that reached out oh val there we go the owl that i did and the owl it creeked me from wrong but we've we've been chatting in discord and comes from an oracle background and i think i think you said you were getting into this uh you know first time in the beginning and everything but no i've definitely talked to some folks who have did not start with us they you know they found out about it like halfway or more than halfway through and then went back and watched all the stuff and did the exercises and everything i thought it was wonderful all right all righty all right so and there's there's by the way i see some gold in those chats but i'm gonna wait for the ama um but this now is your dun dun dun last chance for this series to win some swag these are very very serious questions in here very serious questions all right so we have mentee and again you could just use that qr code just go ahead and scan it i will go ahead and pop these down as well i'll drop them here there we go and we'll let everybody get into the mentee game gamecode5579128 and i've put them into the chats operators are standing by yeah right it did sound like that it totally did all righty and i'll let everybody get in here let some numbers get up there by the way these animations if you did not know all of the wonderful animations you've been seeing throughout the series they are all the work of jack and so you know if you want animations for your own project jack is totally willing to do all these in his free time voucher administration right just all goes to the jack of the swag fighters anybody who's gotten swag the vouchers if there's anyone you want to brought it's me yeah it's very difficult there's all this stuff to make us look good let's be honest and fumbling around up here for jack so let's just get down to it jack's the one really doing any work here yeah someone else just kind of talked to him questions on community because he posted the homework there oh how many how many how many views did it get i think obviously it's it's huge uh eric yeah eric's the man i think eric do you know what the the top number of views on one of the community uh the homework questions was oh um i think that was uh something like uh 8 000 or nice i think it was over 10k i have a quick look i'll look it up quickly does jack have a better salary for this no we've actually lowered his salary um he became so efficient we realized that uh i'm paid in t-shirts and matches yeah we get all the t-shirts we gave him a smaller closet to sit in to do his work too there's you know there's another question in the in the youtube chat are everyone star wars fans really and it's it's kind of funny of that because when what when the team was coming up with a theme and trying to figure out what to do you know obviously you have to be really careful of uh copyright and all sorts of things and so we did kind of come to something we could use i guess there's i don't know do we have any trekkies i'm both honestly i'm both star wars and track so yeah totally star wars oh no gotta get involved i finished star trek like back in the day and then i haven't gone back so have you seen the lower decks no see i haven't seen any of the new stuff and i kind of i maybe i should binge watch that yeah all right watch like the mandalorian that's all you need oh they're gonna have a new season i can't wait yeah let's see out of late afternoon like once you get through that you gotta get something in there see i'm a tricky all throughout and um i i never got into star wars and it's always a you know point of contention with my um kids because um like my kids like particularly my oldest son would recite you know all the lines in the star wars movies that i'm like not i don't get it i've never seen them so i i got to point out one joke that someone just made very punny rajiv uh in discord that jack is a jack of all trades i like that all right so i think we've maxed out on our quiz numbers let's get into this very super serious quiz again top three we'll have a chance phones will have a chance i think everybody should play this one by the way uh including the team because i don't think they know what the nobody knows what the answers are i'm not all right are we all ready let's do this i'm just kind of freaking out about this don't forget to look at your phone look at your phone where did the name cassandra come from greek mythology nowhere it's just made up cedric the great or norse mythology oh write those questions i didn't read them you ask these questions every week who wrote the last question yes it's greek mythology and centrifugal yeah yes it is greek mythology patrick patrick you want to give some of the history here because there's some fun history in the naming isn't there are you suggesting that patrick was around during the great mythology days it was it was just me and plato back then and uh we hung out a lot no no no the the fun the fun part is that so avinash who's one of the originators of cassandra he's if you know him you know he's got kind of a funny streak to him and he picked the name cassandra because it was the uh in the greek mythology cassandra was one that foretold the doom of the oracle and he just thought that was awesome um and so they didn't really say that on the recording did you i did i said it on stage eric what do you mean i got it on a t-shirt somewhere i have no shame at all i've been doing this for 10 years um but yeah that was where that all the other stories don't count that's the one that counts and it's awesome all right all right cool thank you for that patrick moving on moving on sorry i was typing something in the chat there all right let's see is that jack is that you jack where's that difference what happens when if jack wins that's really weird somebody said i was the son of zeus does that make me kratos all right let's see that was okay silly's got a war here okay never mind sorry i skipped over that for some reason the leaderboard i i did that so anyway who stayed up the latest to deliver the workshops eric definitely eric you should really pick eric or other and by the way after everyone answers this i'm gonna let you know something else what time is it right now yeah what time is it eric it's nearly three a.m that's not what's up that's the answer to their questions case in point yep eric is here now now notice that melbourne australia victoria the home of lockdown if if you picked any one of the eric answers you were correct so all of those folks uh get that so let's see what this does to our leaderboard no uh working in the global company brings some very funny uh meeting times sometimes we had cassandra day china recently about a month ago and i was host on this event and it was like from 3 a.m to 9 00 a.m my local time so eric i share your pain on a friday night or a saturday morning right yeah yeah it was saturday morning exactly yeah there's no doubt that i think the folks uh that were more in the uh mia aipac regions uh bore a lot of the brunt of the late nights and double episodes right because we do them on wednesdays and thursdays to try to accommodate multiple you know as many people in different time zones as we could um yeah no doubt that we change and maybe we can share that feedback we have some feedback from people living in india that doing the second workshop on the thursday was not a good solution because it was like noon in india and folks there don't really you know do some pose to do the workshop at noon and for that reason we would like to shift the second slot a bit later during the day for for those folks so if you think it's a good idea yeah you should tell us we could have put a question on that yeah that's a good point yeah no we definitely got a lot of feedback as far as uh folks in the in the time of these so just look for in the future we will try to adjust um to to accommodate uh accommodate uh some some of the time zones a little better than what we had in the past um all right so in the top we have uh uh chen jessica which that's manufactured john jessica sorry if i'm totally butchering that but he's been one of our he was actually one of our submissions as well one of our code submissions uh for the astrakathon uh mihir and last chance and alex is that you alex the fourth one was that different plus meme all righty all right let's go to the next one again very serious questions who constantly seem to have an echo oh no everybody if i am the one austin was it alex david cedric or patina there's 2 000 people that could answer that yeah yeah yeah yeah no cedric was definitely it i mean i think i think i had one little uh mishap uh one of the times with uh when we brought patrick in it wasn't so much of an oh no it was an echo thing or i shut off cedric by accident that we had so patrick if you remember the episode patrick was a guest speaker on he wasn't actually supposed to be there the whole thing that wasn't planned yeah and oops so i shut off yeah i shut off patrick and it shut off cedric so i'm like patrick you just have to stay for the two hours that's weird fun though what were we doing something important video yes now i need to to explain why i do have a eco and it came for i think week number two when during the mentimeter we would like to add some music fun music using the mario soundtrack and at the moment i put that music and this loop with audio on my mac boom everything was screwed and it took me up to something like last week to figure this out yeah and you know that's something but alex we have to agree we have to accept what it happened between nearly everyone who was a host like 100 percent it happened with me as well yeah now is there i wonder if we should do an episode of like the behind the scenes of filming what actually happens before we do these in like some of the uh no one would ever attend yeah [Laughter] flaming dumpster fire that we all oh yeah no i know we've lots of lessons learned lots of lessons learned all right so let's see what our leaderboard looks like and oh alex what's gonna happen here oh alex takes the lead alex takes the lead and we have csi gyros okay i also want to have some swag alex wants him to eat we don't get swag we're not allowed to swag you know they don't give you know my rules about this no just take him out don't look back and then last gen now we've seen last chance before so last chance i don't know if you as jack his last chance ever won and no all right last chance this is your time to shine this is your time i didn't even see that oh my god oh that's great all right next very serious question where did our special guest patrick mcfadden appear in space on the sun on the moon over the rainbow oh man i know these are really hard i know where they should be like where did i get stuck a little five minute fun thing and then i'm like oh i'm totally stuck here totally looked at the right question so wrong it was on the moon if you remember he was on the moon we had him everyone thought i was in space though yeah well maybe it's because you're kind of spacey it's kind of like it's a venn diagram in space but on the moon yeah i mean i guess that was a little tricky because you're like well isn't the moon in space yeah very tricky very tricky serious question all right so let's see how our leaderboard looks now oh wow cy popped up there but let's see what happens when the timings come in always wrong oh well dave now that's not me david's top we have kevin castillo and psy we know psy and always wrong you're so close you're not you you've not always been wrong because you're really getting up there in the leaderboard so last chance just disappeared yeah last chance i'm so sorry well we have more we have more let's do it all right let's see next always the next one how many different hairstyles did alex have just one he never changed it exactly six he loves that number one forever workshop in the series it never changes it never stays the same it's always in transition i think i know the answer to this one all right let's see what happens yeah one for every workshop in the series if you go back and take a look between alex's hair and his facial hair he just kept changing it every single time oh everyone's gonna go back and watch now yeah they're gonna be like what someone's being like no in episode 3 he had the same hair as episode two that was a bad question that was the other episode there's gonna be a fan wiki out there where people are gonna start tracking this like did you see alex's last video what is it like did you did he change something yes he did you got his eyebrow pierced i see it oh no yes hair is the same only different styles that's true yeah that's right all right let's see so where did our leaderboard go to this time in a way i think this is probably one of the hardest ones because the questions are all over the place oh my god all the hard leaders just got shot out oh look at that out of nowhere y and v oh wow so we have wine v aha and prasad so ensure to reach out to jack to get your swag hit me up and we will get you fun fun stuff ridiculous questions ever so if you didn't win don't feel bad at all no you shouldn't feel bad you shouldn't feel bad all right you should really be paying attention to alex moore's what you should yeah that's that's that's really what it means that's really what it means there are congratulations to our quiz winners and now we get to move into the the favorite part right is they ask me anything and i've seen all sorts of stuff already coming through let's talk about how we're going to facilitate this because this is going to be difficult i'll just be quiet and then there i don't know i mean how do people ask questions on the chat right we got discord we got youtube both actually actually can i can i kick it off i'm gonna answer it professional question guys jack when am i gonna get my my um voucher okay can we ban aaron question can we just uh can we can we just get that out of the way because that is that's gotta be my low life the amount of times that i have to feel that question it's ridiculous so to put eric at this misery you should have all uh on monday you'd have received an email from eventbrite and it will give you a link to claim your voucher you need to submit that and buy today so we're going to close the form in a couple of hours and then we've got tons we've got thousands of requests so please bear with us it's going to take a couple of days to send all out so you can expect to have your actual voucher with you by friday as long as you submit the form and if you need the form please message me in the chat and i will send it all righty all right there's that now i'm already seeing some good questions coming in in these chats and specialty yeah you want to do the discord one cedric uh i'm reading all the questions never mind but the the chandra secret question is pretty neat yeah let's do it let's do it let's see okay so oh you want to yeah you want to read it oh oh no you know with my ugly accent all right so he says he says a fun question everyone from datastax team who are live can answer it on screen in greek mythology cassandra was not at all believed by the people because the god apollo had a curse on her that she won't be believed by the people ever now cassandra is believed by the people to be one of the most widely used peer-to-peer distributed databases all around the globe even netflix instagram and many use this did the cursing cassandra was it ever reversed back after facebook invented cassandra in 2008 what is your point on this transformation growth any ideas oh i've got an answer here so there's a parallel people used to not trust the eventual consistency that we talk about because oh no what's gonna happen but it actually ends up being one of the best things ever and it's just like that's that's a good response believe the truth in cassandra boom parallels yeah and and you know patrick i'm gonna i'm gonna put you on the spot too going back because so patrick and i have some history and um and i knew patrick at the time that this cassandra thing was becoming a thing and and i remember him talking about this and this is if you remember at that time in the database world sharding had just became become a thing and there were you know various tech stacks out there that started like this sharding of relational databases and you could you could have some fun with that um but i remember it was a different time back then it was a totally different time and i think there's a lot of skepticism of whether or not something like this would actually truly scale and work and everything and now look where we've come so i'm curious patrick on your take from uh the question here about cassandra now being believed what are your thoughts uh yeah okay so yeah it's funny because we did that was my first conversation with you about cassandra is like this is a real database and you're like no it's not um and so yeah i think i was one of the first 10 people on the planet to ever put it in production that was back a long time ago 2011 something like that yeah um it was a while ago but um i think it's yeah this is a curse broken um a little bit there's now a group of true believers but um i am still shocked and amazed by how many people think that it's not reliable database when it is probably the most reliable database you'll ever use so a lot of work to do um and it's like the things like eventual consistency that freak people out um it's the fact that it's a distributed database and you're not really sure where your data is and those are all fine we're actually doing a lot of work to try to eliminate that with astra where we give you an sla that you can believe in and trust and the technology is implemented so you don't have to think about the underlying thing but you could just use the awesome and to quote a book that i am reading right now trust the awesomeness no oh you're reading that too it's skippy oh my god i'm in i'm in the last ten i'm in the last one i've been waiting for it to come out for oh that's great by the way the book that we're talking about is oh god expeditionary expeditionary force i'll tell you when i when i first this is a sci-fi book sorry we're geeking out just for a moment um but when i first came across the expeditionary force um that actually i got that because of another series called boba verse which is wonderful and patrick actually recommended told you about that yes you did but then i found the expeditionary force and the title of it and stuff i was like whatever it seemed kind of more military and everything it is so good it's a lot of fun and the author finally released the last part of the series and skippy by the way skippy is the um is a an ancient ai uh and hence the name i don't want to give any more away go take a look at the expeditionary force go read it you will move on you will appreciate that ai from the 1980s oh no this is like millions of years old yeah it's much older very serious old ai you know oh they actually you kids you stay off my universe so so to develop about youtube here what's that i said we got a few on youtube here it's scrolling pretty quick oh wait before we move on before we move on to follow on to what patrick was answering with there were some followings to that um a bunch of folks asked about how does the financial industry cope with it with uh cassandra and we see it all over the place actually and i know patrick you every bank uses cassandra yeah yeah it's actually there are some really prominent use cases of banks for example um ing a very big bank in europe they were very early adopters of cassandra and they did a lot of content they came to the cassandra what do you call them cassandra themes that we had and great talks you can find videos of them so it's recommended uh i would also spoke about monzo okay huge bank in the uk uh one so mobile banking almost 100 percent on cassandra they'll do some talk on on the meetups and they do have technical blog explaining everything about that but you know technically speaking they are using event sourcing that are not there and not acid one and they use lwt whenever it needed and now you know what is the lwt man almost all the major credit cards they're all also users so this kind of answered your question chandraskar is that yeah we're still working on it look at all the questions after yours where people are like no yeah so we got work to do yeah um here's the funny secret is all every bank has always been eventually consistent and they never use acid transactions for financial transactions they're not reliable enough think about that one all right so eric eric you had one provena asked um where can you find sample questions for certification so all the questions all the quizzes in the um in the academy courses are patron um on the exams so you need to do the quizzes multiple times too to get confident and get a feel for it oh eric z what was yours you had one oh is it there's a number of them here um i'm just trying to scroll back up with what i was looking at there give me one second yeah there's a ton coming in youtube yeah it's much faster than we can probably keep up but do our best um okay so when we need the same table data for 10 different queries with different predicate requirements you recommend 10 different tables of the same data that depends there are these nice indexes in cassandra that in the right in the right cases um can be used to to great effect so not to give the the answer that everyone hates but it's used kid specific but it really is when it comes down to it there's a lot of cardinality stuff you have to keep in mind um but i will throw this out there just as kind of an easy gold nugget of knowledge um there's no problem with keeping ten tables with the same data functionally speaking there's not really an issue with it so um that would be my two cents i i know uh eric ramirez you probably have a an opinion on this one as well yeah no so um if you stick to the one query one table rule i think um you're off to a good start yeah yeah yeah absolutely there are um there's improvements coming in cassandra 4.6 or possibly cassandra 5.x that will change it um but for now stick to that rule that's that's a good answer that's a very good answer so another follow-up to the financial conversation we're having i see this so is the tunable consistency set to all with respect to financial domain and you know i'm actually gonna be curious for for i see yep i see some head shaking and i i wonder right you know because i don't know too many folks who in practice would use all because if you go to all you now lose your ability to have availability tolerance right because in a case of all if i lose one node it's not available i cannot perform that operation until that node is available so that's kind of like one of the cool things that cassandra does right it's that robustness that availability that always-on piece you get um i want to ask i saw bettina i saw your head go i saw eric's head go like what are you usually seeing from that standpoint quorum lightweight transactions maybe local chrome actually yeah yeah i wouldn't make it too though i'm sorry right i mean it it depends as alex said you know it depends but yeah it always depends it depends on the requirement i've not seen i've not really seen all at all there's actually i believe there's a ticket where um there's discussion i think it was started by jonathan and the idea was to drop all the different uh consistency levels that really don't make any sense just so it's not so confusing to people yeah because the one the one thing to to think about with that is if we're talking about consistency there's the concept of strong consistency and you can achieve that with a quorum read quorum right consistency level it's actually um i don't think we've been into it here today but there's actually a really simple equation yeah that's basically i believe we talked about that in week one actually was quorum yeah yeah i think there's a slide on that um basically the short version is you can actually guarantee strong consistency in cassandra the distributed system of cassandra with uh quorum core so okay let's see what else do we have now uh there was a question around um how do you write the operator yamls i'm trying to remember the name of the application there you do it that's one of the questions [Music] um i can't i can't remember the name of the application that you do it in off the top of my head but um there's a framework for it oh for what for writing operators together oh buddy yeah corbin need this if you're writing a kubernetes operator and i feel like that's an alex one uh sarim i was answering questions in chat um i did that i did that on purpose alex created ah but i've answered this question already uh this uh yaml file is a manifest for kubernetes as a resource definition which explains for kubernetes how to run a cassandra operator so i think the question was how do you write kubernetes operator um and a valid answer isn't you open up them uh yes i've sent the answer already exactly the link to this file it was written by jim dickinson and i don't know what more do you expect from me [Laughter] we need to get dickinson on a session here and have him talk through that because i think people would really really appreciate kind of getting getting the four one one on the inner workings there there's a bettina question is this swagger for python oh right actually cedric research they found a swagger for patterns so there is oh really yeah i didn't use cedric you found a swagger for python i said i would definitely try this out after the actual series yeah swagger anyone yeah so actually if you want to put that on community i'll i'll i'll take the question and i'll see if i can look into that okay and yeah now it's called open api because it has been uh it now is a foundation and it's actively maintained and it evolved pretty quick oh cool i didn't know that nice i see one here going back to the kubernetes one uh is cassandra on kind and kubernetes using production now i would say kind no right that's not really meant for production use that was that was something we used because in a lot of certain things is really easy to spin up locally it's definitely more for development and testing um now is cassandra deployed in kubernetes in production well astra is backed by kubernetes the cast operator from that standpoint and i know there are at least some actual users and bettina looks like you've got one and we've got tons of customers who use the you know those kubernetes we've got tons of users and who've used kubernetes for years as well with cassandra so i mean even before the cast operator they're what uh sky is one there absolutely yeah before they pass over right now so the cass operator is fairly new that was introduced in november 2019 right so um but the use of cassandra and kubernetes because they back so in fact um macquarie bank in australia uses um has been using uh kubernetes for about three three and a half years something like that um we we are actively collaborating with them because they've been running it for far longer than we have in production too yeah so the answer is yes another another question that ties right into that um what are the main clients which are using cassandra names some of them i i if i understand the question right it's kind of the who's using cassandra out there in the world right now um two two ways to look that open up your smartphone look at the apps pretty much all of them all the stuff you're doing um but if you want a couple specific names we got apple uses uh cassandra netflix uses cassandra they've both been contributors in the community um you've got instagram you've got um retailers out there sony playstation um target's been a big one home depot lowe's disney yep disney's another big one yeah right um if you see a company name and they're they're at all global they're at all i mean any of the things that cassandra solves a problem for it's a pretty good chance they're running cassandra i wasn't really joking about opening up your cell phone just look at the apples hey patrick you're muted yes i saw your mouth going i thought you were just whispering to yourself i'm not gonna personally asmr i was saying uh tick tock which is oh they're yeah uh most of your scale apps that are coming out of china are probably running on kazan right now you know alibaba huawei has over 30 000 nodes yeah huawei is 150 000 nodes yes oh 150 yeah yeah they actually think that they have more nodes than apple does which is kind of funny we'll let it we'll let the two big cell phone companies duke it out as i said i thought apple just claimed 6 000 their last year well samsung is another one too samsung so samsung huawei and apple so you probably the phone in your hand is probably backed by cassandra so it was uh regarding the cassandra usage in different countries which was very interesting experienced when we started this recently mentioned cassandra day china and i was very curious where will the speakers for this day come from which companies i mean and in a couple of days it was alibaba huawei tencent some other companies with a very very very big name so wechat and many things like that all together chinese clusters for cassandra are mostly probably the biggest in the world ntt docomo so in japan if you have a phone there you go yeah yeah yeah cell phones and banks they all seem to love cassandra yeah definitely all right let's see who else has got a good question the strategy to update the partition key you don't you can never change your partition key yeah yeah that's a really good question though i think almost every presentation i've ever done that's covered partition that question comes out that's been asked so the solution there is you make a new table and that new table has a partition key that you want um you know there's there's no alter statement though just like eric was saying you don't you don't use an alter statement on a partition key that you think about functionally what that would do that would be a very bad thing all right i'm just reading through questions anyone got any have a good favorite question they see someone asked about all right so rajiv was asking about um why does cassandra use paxus instead of raft and like kafka is moving to raft instead of zookeeper yeah i'm gonna just take a moment to say i told you so which was get get kafka off the zookeeper and uh they finally haven't decided i'm not using zookeeper yeah i'm just jay and i argued about it and i lost so anyway um but yeah the reason we use paxos is just a more it's a more established algorithm whenever you use any kind of consensus algorithm you want to use the oldest most proven model for your database um raft is pretty good um i think it needs a few more years of getting beat up it's like a file system i would never use a file system that has not been in production for more than five years because you just haven't tested it enough um consensus algorithms like paxos have been around long enough um it's been in production uh on the way we implemented it in cassandra for well over five years so it's pretty steady and solid we're not going to go and change the consensus algorithm because it's new and cool we're going to use the one that works so that you have data and to be clear just so no one gets the wrong impression there paxos is is only a very specific subset of queries in in cassandra that would be the yeah the likely transactions right yeah and so that's whenever you want to do any kind of an exclusive operation which is pretty rare in cassandra which is like multiple partition updates um but you generally just don't use them that much because they do they do have a cost associated with them it packs those in the middle it slows down sure it has to use and a quorum is gonna any time you have to ping multiple nodes there are been some proposals in the cassandra project to add things like epaxos which speeds it up a little bit but um any kind of consensus algorithm change we'll have in cassandra will be in addition not replace because we do not want to violate the stability of the database yeah so i see a set of questions all related to where do we see cassandra going in the next five to 10 years and and one in particular talking about cassandra iv and i want to get to those in just a moment i see one though right above it that is near and dear to my heart so i got to get it real quick is anyone run into tombstone issues in high volume update and delete operations so the first thing i want to say to that is if you have high volume delete operations in particular you should not have high volume delete operations because when you delete you are in fact creating a tombstone and especially if you're deleting at a very granular level like at the cell level you're going to create a ton more tombstones than if you say delete at the partition level so i would really say that if you if you have a a pattern and a model where you're doing a ton of deletes a lot and consistently you really need to take it why take a look at why you're doing those deletes and probably stop doing that right from an update standpoint depends on what you're updating um are you using knowles where you don't need them right that's a big one i know that we see a lot where folks will um because coming from the you know the relational world what would you do well you just make a column a null but in cassandra that's an anti-pattern you do not need to do that and by doing that you'll actually cause a delete marker where you don't need it most updates shouldn't really cause tombstones it depends on what you're doing um so i don't know if anyone else i saw bettina i saw you definitely had some looks there um some knowing looks on that one but yeah definitely if if you're finding you have lots of tombstones especially since you pointed out a high volume deletes i would really take a look at why you're deleting what you're doing and and i would i would try to rework that so you don't have all those deletes in your in your process so i've actually come across quite a few use cases um where the entire database is deleted every day and repopulated instead of truncated you know this is sorry it's not truncated this is actually deleted yeah delete it right it was and and i think often these lack of use cases where um data is exported in order to be analyzed and uh you know into a different class you know i don't entirely know why the decision was taken to delete everything before it's repopulated again but in this case that every call was deleted line by line and then it was populated with spark with inserting mouse and uh so yeah don't do it right there is there is also something that we're not we didn't get into i think at all this particular session but if if this is a common thing you're trying to do with lots of deletes and like time series high velocity time series workloads for example yeah um where you've got tons of stuff going in but then you're also expiring a ton of stuff there are some compaction strategies to help there time window compaction strategy would be one to go read on again not not getting into it here but um google it there's a lot of blogs on it um it can alleviate a ton of the issues from these really really high velocity workloads yeah and it's another stupid human trick you can do um with special time series is you can because cassandra doesn't get too too attached to a data files you can delete the data files in the file system while the database is running so that that was actually a trick i've done with um with time series where when when the because ss table is immutable when it's written to disk you just look at the time stamp and you every day you delete all the old timestamps so you never actually issue a delete in the database and the database is fine i like that one it's good that's cool all right so i saw there's a whole set of stuff regarding cassandra iv actually it looks like a couple folks are asking for a small session on cassandra 4 at some point um but maybe we're working on that yeah maybe we could talk a little bit about cassandra 4 and then what's coming yeah we are working with the committee with the one oh wonderful okay so that actually ties great into the question um is cassandra open sort an open source database and doesn't have a strong community um yes it is open source cassandra is there it is it is available go and go and get involved the strong community um it actually has a really cool community when it comes down to it the the amount of committers the amount of talent in this community is fantastic all of always we want more we always want more but um the people that are are putting their heart and soul into this are just some fantastic people and there are uh more and more of them so um this keeps getting asked it's just in different variations so comparison with couchbase with cockroachdb with i don't know mongodb cause andrews is better and i feel they i feel this question almost on a daily basis and my response is always i don't waste time talking about it because they're not competition so you know like you'll never hear me talk about other databases because cassandra is is that for me cassandra is the only solution so i know you guys keep asking different variations of the same question but i just don't waste time on it all right so what is what about um can anyone kind of just give a quick summarization of some of the coolness for cassandra 40 what's coming i mean it's how when's it when's it going game this is a really good point this is a very good point this is an open source project we do not have a marketing deadline yeah we do not have something you know our ceo is not pushing us to ship it on a certain date we want to get it out there as soon as we can but it has to pass every single time right and every jira that is a blocker needs to be cleared before we ship it that's right um we're in beta right now we're in beta 1. um and that's pretty hopeful so far we haven't found anything horrible but we want as many people look at it as possible so soon maybe unless you find something horrible and then we won't ship it yeah i'm pretty sure we're down to the last so many tickets right it's like a hand it's not a huge amount like they've gotten through the vast majority of things a lot of it's testing yeah um if you so the we did a code for use a long time ago like almost a year ago two years ago and um if there's any changes it will introduce a breaking any break and change to a test run we have to rerun all the we do these things called survivor tests and fuzz testing um which is in this i i posted a blog in discord but the survivors and the fuzz testing are about doing the most horrible things possible to a database um apple's been a great partner in this they've been re replaying all their major workloads through cassandra iv and if one byte is missing then they go back and figure out why alrighty how about um i think cedric do you have something you know i thought you had something on where cassandra might be in the next five to ten years um i thought i saw you have a response for that um yeah we do have ids and big things coming in let's say three months now but yeah i cannot unreveal everything it's not public yet but you know cassandra 5.0 would be very you know it will be amazing and i'm french so i don't say that lightly well most of the changes in 4.0 around operator their operator base not a lot of developer stuff so oh performance it's a lot also about performance yeah performance is really good uh zero copy streaming makes adding new nodes into the cluster amazing um there's an incremental repair fix that's actually gonna make repairs way easier um exposing the matrix of virtual as visual tables right all righty let's see is this session reported to the question yeah go ahead eric i was just gonna say there was a question about what's the best practice for compaction and how long you should keep it i thought that was a really strange question because compaction is just part of the normal operation of a cassandra cluster so it's something that you don't manually manage you don't touch it you don't do anything with it yeah i wonder if there was a different question in that question i saw that one as well and um could that be around time i'm wondering if they're yeah or something yeah yeah sure if you can clarify and chat there that might be uh yeah and and there was another question to the people on the screen have you committed any cassandra code and the answer is yes [Laughter] huge um so we don't just talk about it we work on it too yeah data stacks in general is one of the biggest contributors to even open source i mean that's right yeah so i see one here this is this is fun this isn't discord in a hypothetical scenario if i need to get some data from a table in production not always just once and i need to do a full table scan i know it's bad but i'm going to do it only once what is the best way to approach it without impacting the live production users um well i would say you know part of this my part of my answer is going to be cheating slightly um which is if you if you have a pattern that we see a lot and now i realize you're saying only once so my answer may not apply completely but a pattern we see a lot especially for those who may need to do things whether it's from an analytics standpoint from an olap standpoint um is to spin up another dc another data center next to your otp one right use the wonderful inherent nature of replication to replicate that data and then perform whatever those types of copy or whatever the scanning operations on the 1dc that is not your live old tp1 that way right there you're not going to really affect the performance of the one that is facilitating those requests but that also then you know suggests that you have another dc you've got the hardware you're doing that right so that doesn't really answer the question directly but if someone was asking me which way i would recommend um i'd say don't do the scan you know like like you know it's easy to say well just do it off hours and if you have a business model that actually has that maybe that works but so many of the folks that we see using cassandra they have a global user base there's not really off hours anymore right um i don't know what what do you guys think there's there's there's another angle to this one as well um if you're gonna do i i realize you said once um yeah but if you know you're gonna have to do this say every couple months or something it might be worth looking into some sort of a uh analytics um tool like spark for example yeah um because you can do well in production kind of separate dc you know isolate the workload but you can do these tremendously powerful analytics jobs on your cassandra data and it doesn't matter if you're doing stuff in spark that would be kind of a full table scan in cassandra because spark is actually handling a lot of that logic for you and it's doing it in safe ways with good protections and it won't time out you in two seconds right right i'm talking specifically with the cassandra connectors that are you know that are there um you know you i highly highly recommend uh checking it out there's a lot out there on it but it can solve a lot of problems oops anyone else i felt like we had to increase the time out of your read oh look at patrick's face he's like yeah you know this hurts when i do this turn it up do more we don't have a lot of guardrails built into open source cassandra we will by the way there's a change that coming but just you know keep in mind if you find a guardrail pay attention yeah you can put a lot in there but the ones we put in are really bad yeah so you jump over that one you will fall it's just getting to know how a distributed system works i think this is one of the big changes for developers and even admins is that a distributed system you know you don't know where the problems are going to happen sometimes like when you're dealing with a single system like an oracle or mysql you can look at all the statistics on one machine and get a pretty good idea what's happening there in a distributed system if one or two machines is having trouble you don't even know it until something bad happens so there there are ways to monitor that but it's just something to pay attention to yeah and a follow-up to this uh anna and discord and cedric already answered part of it here is what if you want to have analytics on a regular basis right and that's that's a follow on kind of what i was talking about have a dedicated data center for olap because that is honestly that pattern is so freaking cool because to me that really kind of exemplifies one of the really cool features of cassandra is again that that inherent automatic replication where i can stand up two data centers right next to each other have replication automatically in real time bring my data from my old tp data center over to this other one and then i can perform whatever olap analytics queries i want on that other data center and i'll have near real-time analytics and i will not affect the performance of my oltb production data center that i love that feature because it's so easy and it's so simple and then as eric was talking about you can use spark on that thing right you let spark do its thing and uh you know and you could do that with open source by the way um if you want to get a little bit further you can push in some of the data x enterprise stuff if you start doing things with like graph and spark and analytics and you can combine them and do all you know but putting that aside you could do that with open source um so definitely another dc if if you could do that and as cedric already said big cpu slow drives right yeah you can you can change the compute you can and the cool way to do this now and i just actually did an interview with a company called stream sql which does this and um is using well there's going to be some changes coming pretty soon with our cdc but using um pulsar flink in combination pulsar and flink are becoming the cool way to do stream processing and real-time updates in data um the you know the the requirements for data at rest are pretty solid with cassandra but when you have changed data capture meaning when the data gets committed into the database then it emits that data into a pulsar topic and then it's immediately processed by flinked and re-rolled back into cassandra super powerful yeah and a follow-up on that as well um from sudakar in youtube any implementation having data centers across multiple cloud providers totally cassandra yes yes cassandra is completely deployment agnostic you can have a single cassandra database that exists across on-prem major cloud providers all in the same databases again one of my other favorite things about it it doesn't care so yes the answer is yes you could totally do that um so companies like hotels.com deploy anywhere and everywhere because they want to be close to their customers to their users i so question i don't know the answer so this is a question for everyone if cassandra is running on java why don't you run why can't you run cassandra on windows because it's all java based and you know it's not a stupid question java you should be able to run that on on windows the limitations are the file system the the file system implementation in windows is is not easy to handle um um it's not the language that's at fault right it has nothing to do with java itself it's the os there is a funny painful story on this one but at one point there did exist a uh horrible experiment that was basically cassandra on windows um i'm glad we don't talk about that much anymore well the the main problem with with the main problem we ran into with cassandra on windows was in the file system um we we rely on memory map files and cassandra to map to the data files that are on disk the ntfs file system does not allow for a lot of that to happen it's just not built the way that like a linux file system works so um whenever you do something like a delete or you move or pointers or anything like that ntfs lies to you and you wind up with corruption so and you just it was the fsyncs also lie to you so you wind up with corrupt data so just yeah it just turned out to be let's never ever try to make this work i've got one here on a little bit of a different note um for single table on a node why does cassandra have multiple ss table.dv file or sstable.db files is it for performance or some other reason that's an excellent question um if you remember i think it was patrick said ss tables are immutable that means you cannot change them so if you put more data into that database but you can't change where that data is currently stored in the database you have to make a new uh ss table when you have that data so everything basically gets built up in ram until it flushes down to an a brand new access table for you there that's why there are multiples and that's where compaction comes in the compact is actually taking many ss tables taking everything current and putting it into a new ss table and getting rid of the old ones so all right i see here one is there a technical limit to the number of data centers in a single cluster i don't i don't think so dude have we ever run into what's the practical yeah patrick has got one here i feel like i get i get to answer the stupid questions you know like not stupid listen that's a dumb question it's like how did you do this it's almost like limits like how far can you take this thing uh i've done over a thousand data centers but what happens is it starts allocating memory and for gossip transmission so it has to slab allocate so eventually it starts becoming diminishing returns because you have so many different data centers to keep track of and that has to be done in memory that it starts degrading if we were building we were optimizing the system to be better at more data centers like thousands of data centers uh which may be something we're talking about with edge computing then it would just be a different type of data model that we store that information it's problematic for the driver too because yeah it tracks the metadata that's so it's memory loading it's a massive overhead yeah yeah so what do you find is the practical do you have any thoughts on practical limits to control that exact thing for the amount of data centers tens of data centers yeah i mean i've i've seen there's uh i think there's a few retailers that have a data center per large store so you know that think of how many stores a big retailer would have okay all right and um it's just a couple more from the multi-cloud standpoint um you know of any cassandra implementations in oracle cloud i mean i'm sure they exist i just i don't know any yet okay i see patrick yeah yeah we're a osa partner the answer is um and then the other one here now this one's totally an opinion piece uh from jose in youtube question about multi-cloud data stacks or cassandra which cloud do you consider the best in terms of performance regarding the big three gcp aws and azure we know the question i know which one falls off the bottom yeah i don't know if i'm gonna touch it though so this is gonna be one of those every cloud has it's it's good points yes yeah yeah yeah and um you you would be best to try your workload in those clouds it's easy it'll cost you a few hundred bucks and it's well worth the test but i will tell you there is a significant difference between clouds and guess what you can write a blog when you uh get your results oh yeah that sounds like a good blog actually you let us know about that blogger linkedin that blog yeah yeah yeah i don't know the community members said it in all seriousness um if you're a company that is um serious about being cloud native and you know you gotta do hybrid mostly because you have leverage with this with the cloud providers so for example if cloud provider x knows that you're heavily invested in them there's no incentive for them to drive down your costs um that's that's really what it looks like um because there are ways to get around the performance the performance issues to some extent but that's not really what you want to focus on you're really focused on making sure that you're you're anywhere and everything okay all right so i'm i think we're just going to take the last couple and start wrapping up the ama here looks like we have a good last set of questions um does the accidental deletion of ss tables and data files need recovery or can the node be left as it is since the other nodes have the data and the subsequent flushes write the next set of ss tables that's an excellent question mattina i feel like you have one for that or is that maybe just one of those knowing looks where you're like yeah we've we've seen that we've seen that well i think exactly eric and i we worked on something so we've seen we've seen plenty of accidental deletions of sms tables um it's not always entirely possible to recover everything right so well the first thing you do when that happens is you update your linkedin profile that's the first thing and then start sending your resume out oh boy but if it's isolated to a single node you you're given replication then there are things you can do right yeah yeah things start running repairs start doing various anti-entropy stuff to handle that situation absolutely yes okay um one from the owl uh is there a memory architecture diagram you can share i tried looking but i'm able to find a good hit it's a hash map it's all just a hash map yeah mem tables inside of cassandra are a hash map you can go look at it and it's the actual java hash map it's nothing special yeah linkedin to be sorted yeah slinky nashville all right and i see okay so cedric answered one there but i see one last one here so patrick patrick what's your oh did you answer it already the alibaba one uh yeah i just said go test it yourself because i have no idea it's like this is what i'm gonna say to anyone and um frank i'm not trying to be mean to you you can i i'm very violently opposed to benchmarking and throwing those on a website because [Music] first of all we could do the best job possible and be completely unbiased and it'll still be wrong um because everyone's workload's gonna be different you're going to have different requirements it's easy enough to set up a quick test go test you know put together some parameters for your testing like i want to do high volume rights i want to do high volume reads whatever you're going to do i need to store a lot of data everybody has different strengths and weaknesses but then just go test it you know it's well worth the few hundred bucks you're going to spend on renting that infrastructure yeah and it's also you have such a wide a variety of infrastructure that you can choose from right with different different specs you know you can go for cpu you can go for high io rates you can go from different types of disks so i think it's too it's too vague to just say we compare cloud provider this cloud provider it's much much more into the detail about what kind of instances you use for your information from a database to database standpoint i know i've seen a lot of those questions you know can you compare this database that database um don't trust anyone who's handing you those numbers that would be that would be my piece there because yeah a lot of it's use case specific and patrick said even if we do it all right with the most you know the most integrity we could possibly do um it's not necessarily gonna apply to use case and you know we we as a company um can only test so many scenarios so alrighty all right so let's go ahead and wrap up the ami and just to just cap things off you know um thank you everybody thank you for for being with us on this whole journey and learning and giving your feedback that doesn't stop by the way right we're not we're not done um matter of fact notice the link right here we should probably drop that link what do you guys think we should yeah let's do it do we have that link handy uh i'm gonna have to come out the screen oh you get you got it all right thank you thank you for dropping that let me go back to the full screen i ruined the show that came out of full screen there we go there we go yes yes so thank you uh jack is going to drop the link here all right i think i've got it as well there we go so take a look yeah so everyone please keep an eye out for the next workshop um we are you know what we're doing in discord what we're doing online you know i've so many of you have reached out to us on linkedin and twitter and stuff keep doing that we're here we're not going anywhere right um we have more stuff that is eventually coming and uh and so we we hope to see you then uh and please keep your feedback coming and this is part like all of you are now part of this community right this this somebody asked a question about the cassandra community earlier and here it's you it's all of you uh along with uh us and the other folks so um keep it up keep your apps coming right there's more coming with hackathons and everything anybody have anything they want to say in part as we now finally end well seriously yeah next theory yeah what's next what is next that's a great question yeah let's do it okay so remember when we said um would you recommend it to a friend here's your opportunity [Laughter] um next week we are going to go back to basics and we're going to do an intro to cassandra which is going to have some data modeling we're going to do this on astra so keep it simple um we want to so if you have participated in this eight week series you should be just fine with this this is not one for you but i really do want you to go recommend this to a friend literally um jack can you put the uh can you put the eventbrite link in to chat please um we really we could use your help promote it to your people tag us on linkedin whatever um we want to have more people learn about just the basics and how to do this so that's what this is going to be about the week after that is going to be a more simplified version of building cassandra applications with spring and then we're going to repeat the intro to cassandra again we're going to spend the month of september trying to get the basics out there so check out the link uh send it to your friends put it on social media we really could use the amplification um but we really want to get a lot of folks in here and we want to um we want everyone to be successful at cassandra at the most basic level um and keep up the communication with us we really want to know what you're thinking when we go from september and october like things that you're going to be really interested in absolutely yeah now we take all the we take all the feedback very seriously and for some of you who've reached out to us directly you may have noticed some of the things that you've mentioned have shown up in like the next episode or or what's coming in the future so definitely keep it coming alrighty don't forget to like any videos that you watch with us it actually does help us get discovered yes please like us please please like us hit the bell subscribe the youtuber thing now are we youtubers now is that what we are i don't know literally you know do we need to make a little subscribe graphic we're like well subscribe subscribe do it hit the subscribe button above yeah yeah we've tried not to do that so you're right right now it just says voucher vouchers oh that's great alrighty sorry jack i think on that bombshell i think that's a wrap and again thank you thank you everybody for for coming with us on this journey and we will see you at the next one take care thank you yeah imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she could multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
