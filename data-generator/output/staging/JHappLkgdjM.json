today's workshop building an application with you and typescript i'm ryan wilford and i'm joined by david jones gelardi hello david well hello ryan hello everybody how you doing i'm doing very well uh if you guys can uh hear us and see us just fine let us know give us a thumbs up in the chat i want to make sure that everything is coming through clear i saw a question mark martin asks i might be on the wrong channel is this a tutorial or dance music video channel a little bit of both i guess yeah maybe a little bit of both i'd say more on the tutorial end definitely more yeah if you want to dance uh to the music video be it by all means feel free uh to finally say you're not audible i guess but i see some other folks giving a thumbs up yeah okay and i see stefano just say sound is perfect cool cool all right you might be muted your tab might be muted check that um all right so without further ado like i said i'm ryan welford uh this is david we are both developer advocates uh here at data stacks um but we are not the only ones who are uh with you today in the chat we have a whole team of people team members that are ready to answer any questions that you have so feel free to ask questions in the youtube chat we also have a discord that you're invited to you can ask questions there and there will be someone available to answer those questions as we go through the content so make sure you say hi to hi to all those great people um all right so we are streaming on both youtube and twitch uh but we really only monitor the chat on youtube so if you have questions make sure you use the youtube chat twitch is kind of used as a backup in case uh youtube craps out on us and we need to switch streams but youtube is where you can ask questions you can also ask questions on discord and uh actually you can type in exclamation point discord and get the link and you know we were invited to do exclamation point discord in discord ryan uh you know you probably get the link to discord because it it's the same um but yeah you are invited to join our discord we have uh several thousand uh members already um and we're all uh there to to learn more about um development in general but um in a lot of ways specifically cassandra apache cassandra related topics and there's always someone there that can help and we will be answering questions during uh the stream there as well and outside of the stream as well so if you have questions and the stream is over the workshop is over feel free to continue asking questions in discord and ryan just something to point out i'm noticing is nightbot it should be going it might take a little bit it's just taking a moment okay because a bunch of us did discord nothing's happening yet so okay i did i did uh neglect to add nightbot until just a little bit ago so it might take a little bit it'll catch up though okay all right um apologies uh gerardo asks what is the bang before discord for so that is a command that we're giving to a special chat bot that we have that when you do bang the exclamation point and then the words of bang discord then nightbot will automatically return the link that you can use instead of us having to type those every single time and it's kind of self-service if you will let's just let you be able to get stuff for yourself yeah it might take a little bit for uh nightbot to completely show up but it is live right now um all right so some housekeeping um we are going to be using github for our um uh for our workshop here all of the content that we're gonna go through is actually uh on github uh and on the repo and if uh if nightbot's working you can do exclamation point github um if not we can get a link uh copied for you in the chat if you would if you wouldn't mind doing that david um yeah so yeah all the content that we're gonna go through is uh on github uh we're also going to be using a cloud-based ide called gitpod now this is basically just vs code in the cloud and it integrates really well with github so we'll be able to load up that that repo that we're working in uh straight up into a cloud-based ide and and work on it directly uh really convenient really easy make sure that we uh can specify the environment that you're working in just so that we don't have any weird issues with different environments if you want to work locally if you prefer that you absolutely can uh you're welcome to uh we have a few notes at the in the repo on on some of the uh the things that you'll need um as far as like versions of node and npm uh we can't troubleshoot as well on the local version so if you have any issues and you're working locally our ability to troubleshoot things will be a little bit limited we'll still try and help you obviously but um oh there's nightbot cool ipod finally woke up yeah so if you want to work locally feel free to do so gitpod is a very easy to use ide though and if you're used to vs code you'll be very familiar with it for our database we are going to be using astrodb astrodb is a a nosql database as a service in the cloud based on apache cassandra and it's a very versatile database and we'll get into a few more details on that in a little bit all right uh so we offer badges for our workshops um this is the badge that you can receive if you complete the homework uh that we will do or that we will specify uh for the workshop honestly the homework is basically just making going through the workshop doing all the steps and getting a screenshot of of your successful app at the end so if you would like to get a badge that you can use on social media put on your linkedin profile and whatnot feel free to uh to look into that that homework we'll we'll talk about it a little bit at the end as well um and complete it submit it and we'll grade it and issue a badge to you and it's a really cool way to show off your continued learning and we have a whole slew of badges that we offer for all of our workshops um so you can collect them all just like pokemon you know and we're almost at 2300 badges now are we so if you want to push us over we're so close if you want to push us over go do your homework get your badge right um now sudeep by the way is also asking is getpod a necessary tool and as ryan explained so we provide it here um as a nice kind of like you know homogeneous way for everybody to experience the workshop in the same way without having to worry about troubleshooting people's local environments and such like that is it absolutely necessary no you could do this locally but as he was saying you're kind of more on your own if you're gonna take the local route because we can't really you know validate whether or not you have certain libraries installed things like that so you could totally if you if you're more advanced and you feel comfortable doing that you're familiar with viewing stuff uh then by all means go for it but the recommended way is to use github matthias asks how long will this workshop take uh we are scheduled for two hours um yep so we honestly you know however long it'll take um obviously two hours is kind of our cutoff but it might not take that long um we might be able to give you some time back but feel free to ask questions and we'll answer them all the way to the end uh all right so this is what we're going to be doing today uh we're going to set up a few uh uh services right away we're gonna do our database setup and get our credentials for authenticating our database connection uh then we're going to introduce vue.js and talk about how how vjs works set up our own component we'll connect to our database uh we'll be creating serverless functions we'll talk a little bit about how those work um and then we'll talk about how to call those super list functions from the front end and then we'll have some resources at the end so to get us started i have a little demo for you for the app that we're going to build today so if you go to this url that you see hootcards.io and i'll go ahead and bring that up this is what you should see let me pull this out and this is going to be a little interactive portion uh so we're going to play this play this game all together it's a really simple app um basically what you're gonna do you're entering your name you're gonna open a pack of cards and you're gonna reveal those cards and see what cards you get and then we can see what uh what packs everyone has open so i'm gonna go ahead enter my name open pack so we have our our pack of cards we can flip them over see if we get lucky all right so i got a bunch i've got a common i've got a few uncommon cards i didn't get any rares or ultra rares but let's see what you guys have gotten have opened so far okay so lots of comments lots of uncommon see if anyone got lucky with a rare there it is we got a few rares congratulations dave and zai oh banyan got an ultra rare look at that i missed your link i missed your link to play the demo i guess it's in the repo isn't it it is in the repo the link if you if you need the link it is in the github repo you can also uh type it in here i guess yeah i'm going to put it in there so it looks like venue got a an ultra rare congratulations ah got two rares we got a couple more rares i'm going to refresh the page oh filippo uh got all comments that's pretty unlucky i'm sorry philippo you can always open a new pack if you if you refresh the page bertold's got an ultra rare congratulations ultra rare kd another another uh unfortunate all commons so as you can see it's a pretty simple game uh we've got some some rarities uh rarities and cards and we are randomly selecting these cards to create a pack and sending them to the front end renzo looks like got a an ultra rare as well all right awesome well thank you everyone for for giving that test you can feel free to keep opening packs and try and get the ultra rare if you want but i'm going to move on and this is the the app that we're going to build today too funny i was the unfortunate one yeah it is uh it's not very common to get all commons but uh david earlier got two ultra rares which is unbelievably i feel particularly lucky right now if anybody wants to gamble with me just go ahead and wire me your money uh yeah uh i'll keep asked if this is being recorded yes all of our workshops are recorded they'll be available at the same youtube link after the workshop is over so let's let's go ahead and start we're going to uh start by creating our uh our astra database now i just wanted to go over a little bit uh on on how astra works so astra is a built on apache cassandra which is a nosql database it is known for its scalability and availability it's very resilient to to failures and and maintaining access to your data in those events but uh astrodb is a a service based uh cloud service based database uh that we actually have created a data gateway uh to live on top of it that we call stargate and what this allows is for us to interact with our data through a multiple different apis including rest apis graphql apis and document apis which is what we're going to be using today and we have a few other apis that are coming down the the pipe as well but it's a really good way really easy way to interact with your data so you don't have to get into the nitty-gritty of using cql commands or anything like that you can just interact with it with apis which makes it super nice to use um so with that let's go ahead and create our astra instance so if you go to the link you can type in exclamation point astra in the chat you'll get a link to uh to esri yes uh devendra yes thank you for putting that astra is free um it is a uh you get we it's like a credit system you get 25 credit every single month and that's uh used for um useful for what 50 million reads 5 million rights um it's it's basically enough to run a small or medium-sized business off of completely for free so it's it's free to start no credit cards need to sign up you won't be charged a thing once you reach that limit of that 25 credit once you're getting close to that it will prompt you uh to say hey you're using a lot of data do you want to continue uh and to pay for it beyond this um but yeah absolutely free to sign up um for you to start no credit card so it should be pretty clear too when you first if you're creating your first account um it should be pretty clear in in astr it'll say you know you're you're on the free tier and such and nowadays you know funny enough we could update the workshop repo it's up to 80 gigabytes of storage for free and many many tens of millions of reads and writes i mean it's it's pretty substantial from that standpoint yeah by the way hey ryan knight yes i don't see nightbot on for discord it's not on for discord yeah huh i mean i'm responding like i'm am nightbot so i'm handling it but yeah for some reason it's not responding there just wanted to let you know okay uh it's something i'll have to look into later yeah stories but yeah interesting so when you uh when you create your astro account you'll come to a page that kind of looks like this you will probably have no databases uh which is expected but if you go to the top left you'll see create database i'm going to go ahead and click that and we're going to create a database here and you'll see how easy it is we're going to use um a few pre-populated names so we're going to use view workshop db as the database name and view key space as the key space name now what is a key space a key space is a collection of tables it's kind of like a schema if you're coming from a relational database world um it's just a collection of of of tables um you can select whatever provider you want via google cloud amazon azure and you can select the region that is closest to you uh apparently there is a new region central i'm going to use that one because that is closest to me uh but yeah you can you can select whatever pro provider whatever region you want um and it'll be all be fine click create database and that's all you need to do so as far as like the naming of of the database we part of the part of the code is pre-populated and it expects a certain um some of the some of the commands will have you run expects a certain name for for your database and key space you're absolutely free to change the name of your database and key space if you want um just note that some of the commands that we'll be running expect a certain certain names and you'll have to change those as well um jerome asks okay to use existing workshops db with view key space um again you technically can um just make sure that the commands that we are pre-populated with the database name view workshopdb you'll have to change that to whatever database you're using so for ease of use we recommend using the the names that we've specified but if you feel confident that you'll catch the the times you'll have to change it you can go ahead and just real quick ryan yeah sudo sudeep in youtube says do we need to create a login for the cloud as well no you can pick any one of the major cloud providers gcp aws or azure astra handles all of that for you you do not need an account with the cloud providers or anything um so that the point of that is to give you the ultimate flexibility uh and such so no you do not need to log in you don't need an account you don't need to worry about being charged on one of the cloud providers all the stuff here is free yep thank you so when you create your database you'll see on the right hand side status will be pending for a little bit it should only take a couple minutes before um it'll turn to active as you can see mine just turned to active um the credits remaining for your is yours is different doesn't make any difference no mine is bumped up for a different reason yours should be around 25 if you just created the account um i think i was given some extra for something yeah that happened a couple months ago yeah yeah all right so that is basically it for uh creating your astra account something else that we need to do though is we need to create a security token so we need to create a token in order to authenticate our communication with the database so to do that it's really easy once your database is active on the right hand side you can click this menu button the ellipses menu and click generate a token and then you can select your role so we're going to use a database administrator role now this is mainly used uh for this workshop just that we have all the permissions that we need to set everything up when creating a production application you'll probably want to choose a more specific role that doesn't have so much power but we're going to generate a token and you'll see that it generates a few things now we recommend downloading the token details this will download a csv file that has all this content uh because if you navigate away from this page you cannot get back to this like you will not be able to see your token anymore um so we recommend downloading your token details if you do happen to lose your token you can always generate a new one there's no limit so uh no worries about that i'm going to leave this page up just for ease in copying it but i did download the the csv as well so you do recommend doing that your status is daniel and uh the regalo if it's still pending that's totally cool if you see pending or initializing that's fine you can still create your security token and as ryan said it'll take just a couple of minutes to spin these up you're actually spinning up a fully fledged cassandra cluster when you uh create the database so it could take like five minutes or something that's fine yeah now a point a good point is that you can't access that ellipses menu when it's pending so the other way to do it to generate a token is in the top left where you see current organization drop that down and go to uh organization settings and then you'll see token management here and that's where you can generate a token if you're still pending but yeah you can generate a token while it's still pending because the tokens are not database specific it's account account level or organization level i should say all right should i set up astrodb during the session yes if you'd like to follow along with everything that we're doing uh yes set up the astrodb it should only take a couple minutes [Music] all right if you have yeah feel free to ask any questions if you're running into any issues i'm going to go ahead and um launch the get pod ide which is our next step because this can take a little bit of time so i want to get it done early so in the github repo we have this link open in gitpod if you right click it and open it and open it in a new tab [Music] it's ideal so i'm going to open it in new tab drag it over to my bigger window and this will take some time it will probably ask you to log in with your github account there's a couple other options as well but log in with your github account on gitpod and then it'll load up the repo informative asks vue.js versus react js benefits um they both are do basically the same thing they're both frameworks uh for generating uis um they work in very similar ways but they have different structures personally i prefer react but vue is pretty popular as well it's growing in popularity benefits i don't know i think it's a really personal preference so and you'll yeah if you haven't seen use uh different styles right yes very different you'll see this as we go through and and maybe we can do ryan as you're actually going through the code um kind of i know for those react folks that are familiar with that kind of point out some of the differences there i think if you're already used to using react and you've not used you before the second you see this you'll almost immediately see the differences in the layout and such yeah at the end of the day they're doing very similar things um the big differences come from like the libraries that are uh available for each one right react has been around for a long time it's very popular it has a lot of libraries available view is newer um and but it is growing um and then the structure is really the thing and if the structure for view is more like clicks with you better than react great react is my preferred one because it clicks with me better will this get pod instant save to somewhere a fork of your uh repo for example no it is um it is a instance of the repo um it's pulling it's pulling the repo into an instance and then it'll live for a little bit and then it'll go it'll get deleted at a certain point this is just kind of a temporary thing if you want to use git pod with your own repo uh you can certainly work out of a specific repo and like push the code through git so it's kind of a really convenient ide in general so my git pod is ticking a little bit so yours might take a little while as well we have a lot of people probably starting up kit pods all at the same time so we maybe should have warned them oh jesse made a good point you can pin the git pod instance if you don't want it to be deleted uh so should i ask i'm in gitpod what do i do next create a new workspace if you use the link that we provided in the github repo that should automatically create a workspace based on this repo so make sure you use that link all right so mine is up is going to be installing a few things um some some initialization so that'll take a little bit we'll wait for that ion asks any preference view versus react in terms of in terms of building native apps that's a really good question uh react is my preference um it has a really so if you've heard of react native uh it is a really good way of making uh react apps or sorry native apps using react and the the structure is um is very similar you'll use a few different um tags basically uh that are that are more specific to uh native apps rather than um web apps so you're not going to be using html text for your rendering output but the rest of the structure will be very similar we actually have a workshop that we did recently about converting a react web app to a react native app that's really cool and uh and you can see how easy it is to go from one to the other um and you can also just run the web app off of the react native code as well so i would say react is probably uh further along in in creating um kind of dual purpose apps both native and web simon says you can make mobile apps with native script and view i actually didn't know that so it's a good good thing to look into dude ryan i can't believe you're in the regular light mode in that dark mode i mean come on here's mine here's the thing light mode shows up better on stream okay all right yeah it's the truth fine fine remy s how do i get the get pod ide actually so we actually have a a link that can go straight there i just remembered um but if you go to the github repo and click on on step three there's a button here you can click on that uh you can also click on the link that is showing up here a nightbot git pod cloud id that should get you straight there as well [Music] all right so mine is done um if if everyone else or if every everyone who is basically to the point i am getpod is up and running it has installed everything you have the terminal uh ready to go give us a thumbs up in the chat just so we know we can move on um i know this stuff can take a little bit uh a little bit of time but i'm glad that we can answer some questions as we're waiting yeah and there's been a couple of folks that have asked what are the commands that you lo you run once getpod launches we haven't quite gotten there yet right it is in the repo though so as ryan is going to bring you through the repo instructions you'll see as you go down um that will start giving you commands but before we do any commands right we actually have to start working with some of the code so again all the stuff every command and everything you need is actually going to be in that repo so if you do need that and i'll put it in the chat don't forget to do your bang github and then you can follow along yeah and uh i haven't typed anything in the terminal yet so if you are um if you're just in get pod and you're you don't have this workspace open make sure that you go to the github repo and use this link so that it because it will automatically pull that that workspace so i haven't actually done anything in the terminal it did it did a bunch of things automatically um and if you're working locally those things are like npm install which installs a bunch of dependency packages um and i think that's kind of it's making sure that the right version of node is is installed as well uh looks like we have a lot of thumbs up um so i'll go ahead and move on and get started all right so let's start by taking a look at uh our app now this app was built using nuxt which is a framework for view um that really helps you get a jump start on creating a new app kind of gives you a bunch of boilerplate code for for one it also um is a framework that does a lot of things in the back uh in the like behind the scenes that makes it really easy to just focus on the app experience rather than focusing on getting all these you know all the nitty-gritty detail is done so like page routing it handles completely on its own like you have to you don't have to worry about uh any of the page routing um styles the the whole setup um process for a next app it'll let it'll have you select different libraries that you want to use for styles or fetching protocols or anything and all those things are kind of baked in to the app so that anytime that you want to use a say a custom style template you just have to reference it and it will automatically um when it builds it will automatically pull those references as you need so next is a really good way to kind of get a jump start and be able to focus on the app experience itself rather than some of the the nitty gritty stuff um so so this that's why we have like a folder called.next it has a bunch of extra stuff we're not really going to get into all of the details of next i just wanted to preface that this was built using that but we'll take a look at our pages so right now we just have a single page this will be a single page application this is our index.view this is our entry point into our app this will be our homepage if you will and so here we can take a look at what a view component looks like because a page is basically just a component right so view components and view pages are broken down into three main sections we have our template section and this is where all of our html and our formatting happens you can see we have several rows these are pulled from the event style package that we installed with nuxt we don't have to reference this because nux will figure it out for us but this is how we how we use it so we have several rows that we have things displayed on so this is our template this is where all of our html goes then we have our script section this is where all our javascript will go are our logic if you will if i need to zoom in as well let me know i tried to make it i i'd say pop a zoom like a couple i'll pop a zoom hits pop a zoom all right that's one that's one okay let me know if you go further but we'll get into the limits of screen real estate right um and then we have our style section this is our css right um so it's every component every view component is broken down into these three main sections uh and this is pretty different from react uh just as a comparison react is pretty much all javascript uh and then you have a return statement um out of your component that is your html um which it's technically jsx or something like that um but that's kind of where your your template would normally go and react view is is different it's broken down into these three sections um so this is the basic overview of what a component will look like and we'll actually be building a simple component together but i just wanted to give you kind of a overview of what that looks like um one thing to note actually is you'll see in the script tag we have lang equals ts so we are using typescript for for our javascript sections view 3 as of version three has native support for typescript so all we have to do is implement this tag and all of our typescript type checking will be enabled um and uh and we'll be basically using typescript for the remainder of of that script so we can actually you know utilize the the typescript tag um for any component that we want and we can omit it for any component that we want if we don't want to use typescript for a certain reason or not i don't know why you wouldn't but you know it's an option so that's basically how we specified to view like this is we intend to be using typescript for this all right so as you can see it currently we have a few things we have our data section in our um in our view component and we're returning a an array called cards and in this array we have several objects where we have our rarity our image url these are our cards right and so we have five of these because we're going to be returning five cards so right now we are actually in this iteration of this app we are hard coding these cards um we are we're not you know dynamic at all uh and the cards that are being being used are specified here we have our you know our rarity our image url that's where we reference the the picture of the owls but we are actually okay so the way that we instance the the actual cards themselves is we're using this um this for loop so vue has uh built methods for your template that you can use um to to instance like different sections of your template um as you want so v4 uh is basically a for loop um and so for each card in our cards array that we have in our data section we're going to instance this card flip component and give it the data of that card right so that's what this does so let's go ahead and take a look at our components and take a look at card flip so we have our our basic template here um this is uh essentially just our card that is able to flip around using css magic that we're not going to get into because it's essentially magic as far as i'm concerned um we have a card back which is uh the back of our card uh like the logo the pink side of it that's always going to be the same so we can hard code that in just fine we have our card front that's going to be a component that we create together and that's going to be determined dynamically determined based on whatever data comes through um from the card prop that we're sending through um and then here's our logic it's pretty simple um i talked about props so we can send in properties uh when we call a component this is very similar to react if you're familiar with it but we do have to define the properties that we expect in view so in this case we're defining a specific property called card that we're expecting and the type is an object right we're using typescript so we need to define that it's an object that we're expecting and we have to we have a default uh value of no rarity and an empty string for uh image url which actually this is mistyped it doesn't really matter um and so when it first instantiates this up this uh prop it's just gonna be an empty prop and then when we get that uh that property sent in to the component it will um it will uh update it hey ryan real quick so uh harry has a question here and i thought this was actually pretty pretty interesting can we use multiple scripting options typescript and javascript for different components on the same page is that possible you know yes because typescript is a subset of javascript so um all javascript is valid typescript typescript so if you just if you set your your this tag saying that you're using typescript you could actually write the entire thing in just regular uh javascript and it would work just fine um you would run into probably if you're doing some weird things with types it'll it'll flag it and saying hey you know you can't mutate this type [Music] but there are ways to set the type to any so that you could use it as you know traditional javascript where it doesn't care about types but at that point i mean why would you be using typescript why would you be using typescript that's exactly what i was going to say yeah but there are instances where you might need that flexibility um i can't think of any at the top of my head but there are instances where you might need that flexibility um so it does allow for it but technically all you can type you can code the entire thing in regular javascript flag it as typescript and it should work um so if that answers your question yeah that's right that's right actually super set up i noticed yes exactly i was gonna say uh show son i think is correct there it is a super set of javascript yeah i probably spoke my apologies um all right so we also have this data uh variable called flipped that's basically just keeping track of our state whether it's flipped or not um and then we have a method that flips the card um and that just changes the the class uh for our our css to to flip they're not flipped to to start that animation uh all right so let's go ahead and create our own view component this is going to be a pretty simple component i'm going to go ahead and add a new file i'm going to call it hootcard.view all right and our template is going to be really simple um i'm actually just going to copy it out of the the github repo just for simplicity's sake and typo issues um but our template's really simple all we're doing is displaying an image basically right because we already have the card component that flips around we just need to dynamically populate that image and so we have our our div that's going to have a dynamic a a class of card which we'll define later in our style section and then a dynamic class um that is based on the rarity so what this is gonna do is depending on the the prop uh property that's coming in that determines its rarity the class is going to be um uh specified by that value right and so we'll have different classes for the different rarities common uncommon rare and ultra rare but that's going to be so we're not you know we don't hard code what it is or we don't have to make a bunch of options it's just going to be determined by whatever the value of that property that comes in same thing with the uh the image we have an owl class that we'll define in the style and then our source is going to be a dynamic based on the image url property that comes in as well pretty simple template um in our uh script section i'm gonna go ahead i'm just gonna copy this is basically boilerplate actually if you do uh uh type like type it out it actually gives you uh this intellisense stuff so i can actually select typescript and it automatically populates a bunch of stuff for me um so you can do that as well i like to use semicolons do you happen to know whether or not we can use less css with vue as well that's a question from animesh and youtube um i am sure that you can uh i am not as familiar with um less or sass so i can't give like specific um advice i guess um can you tailwind css yeah you can um yeah tailbone css is basically a uh like a library um for styles actually i think it might be one of the options when you set up the the project in nuxt i think tailwind is one of the options actually um defender asked class versus class yes so in view when you have the semicolon in front of a um a value like this it means that it's a for lack of a better term um a dynamic value so you know when we say class equals card this is going to look in our style section for a a css entry that says dot card right so it's gonna it knows exactly where to look when we do when we have the semicolon in front of it or the the colon in front of it it's not going to look in the styles for rarity it's going to look for a data uh variable that we're going to define called rarity and substitute that in before it assigns it to the class to the class section here so when we have a data what does it look like um so we're gonna have a rarity um variable here if i type that right i'm getting ahead of myself um this part right here so we need to return um so we're returning some certain data variables that we want to use in our template so that's what this data section is for in our view component and so when we return a a variable called rarity we can set it to whatever we want so we could say comment if i could type so now common is going to be substituted here because we're looking for a data variable called rarity and that's what this colon signifies hopefully that answers it daniel's yes uh daniel answered it quickly one is dynamic the other is not so this is static we are hard coding it this is dynamic based on uh the data variable that we're looking for cool and this is a this is one of the the weird like it's a specific syntax unique to view and so it takes it's a little bit of a learning curve once you learn it and once you get used to it um it'll make sense but it's it doesn't really have a like good comparison to something else right react does not do it this way um so it is a little bit of a learning curve all right let me go back all right so let's think about a little bit what we're going to do here we're going to be receiving uh uh a card object right because we're passing in um we're dealing with with that card object from that array right so this is the hard-coded array for our reference um we're looking rarity order is used for ordering it in the pack we don't actually have to worry about that we're really only worried about the rarity and the image your url so we're actually going to be expecting um a prop passed into this component so we need to define that in view we need to we need to define what props we're expecting so we know it's going to be an object that contains at least rarity and image url and so this is the code i'm just going to go ahead and like copy it over and this is how we define uh the props that we're expecting so we need to um we have our props section here we need to name our prop so we're expecting a prop called card and it's going to be a type object and then we have a default uh value so this is actually exactly the same as the card flip we're just passing that object down the line to the child components um but we do need to define what we're expecting because then otherwise vue doesn't know what to look for but now we so now we have the properties passed in right we have this object this card object that's ready to use we can't actually use it in our template yet because we need to define those data variables that the template can use and to do that we have a data section right so that's this part right here so just for ease i'm going to copy the whole thing so now we are we've got our props we are importing them just fine now we have our data section and we're returning two uh two variables that we want to use in our template rarity and image url and we're just assigning that to our our uh card property which is an object and we're assigning the rarity property from that to our rarity variable and we have this um we have to reference do a local reference um using this um so that just that just signifies that we're referring to this card object massey milano asks why do you need the data so the the data section opens up the variables that you want to use in uh the template now could you use the props directly with uh directly in the template uh it's possible that is that is how like react works you can just use the props um this is the best practice um to ensure that you're using um the correct values that you're expecting can you use the properties directly maybe we can experiment with that i think it might be possible in the latest version of you in view three which is relatively recent that we can use the properties directly uh but this is a kind of a best practice to use the data section uh but we can maybe experiment it in a little bit the regular data should be like local variables of the component yes exactly yeah that's a good way to think about it props come from outside the component that we're passing in data is the local variables that we're using uh yeah so if you wanted to use the props if if it works you could do car.rarity you might have to do this.card.rarity and that actually might be the problem i'm not sure we can do experiments and see i'd be i'd be interested as well all right so that's actually pretty much it for our our logic part we're just importing information and we're dynamically changing the class and the image source based on that uh information so now we have to do our style section i'm gonna go ahead and copy this out so in our styles we have um our css it's pretty simple um we have our card which just keep uh make sure that we have the right shape for our card using the border radius uh and whatnot then we have our um class styles right we have our ultra rare rare uncommon and common uh and this determines the colors and then for our rare and our ultra rare we have those shadows that kind of make it look like it's glowing pretty simple and then for our owl this is what is used our css for positioning that that image on the card itself um making sure that it's centered and everything so pretty simple css uh so you can go ahead and say that i think it auto saves now that we finished this component we need to use it uh in our card flip component so i'm gonna go back to card flip and we need to to use that new component here now with nux we actually can just reference it right away like this um without nux you'd have to import it like and then import it here and then export the component here next handles all that for us so it's super easy uh where can you find the css code all the code is on the github repo you can see that under this step we have all the all the styles here hey ryan question for you and i actually saw this one come in a couple times uh but the last one here is from gleefully chill over in discord does view support functional structure or is it purely class structure and i realized i didn't know the answer that to myself uh i know it for react but yeah um i would argue that this is functional um i know maybe you would disagree it is a it is a slightly unique structure i will say um i don't know how to answer that really uh the best way i can answer is that view has a pretty unique structure um you know we're not we're not defining a specific function for our as our as our component we are um defining certain um life cycle methods actually these aren't even life cycle methods are they um different properties for our our component that are then used in our template i don't know that that has really has a uh apple apple's comparison to functional versus class you know interesting i'm i'm now mind you i i am not a view expert here right you know from the standpoint um but i'm looking i'm doing some google searches and the most of what i'm seeing does reference ugs functional components but there seems to be um some information about classes uh class components and view are no longer happening and i'm just kind of reading up to see um if maybe something got deprecated or what i don't know honestly yeah i don't really know how to answer that either i wish i did um i'm gonna go ahead and finish this import before i lose my place uh so in order to import this component we are going to pass in the property that that we're expecting right so we're expecting a card property so we're going to signify that with a a colon we're going to name it card and then we're going to uh import the uh the card uh object and then we can close that out oops so in this case we are just passing in the property that were that's coming into card flip we're just passing it on to the uh the component here all right so that should be saved and now we can actually go ahead and run this uh and see what it looks like so we can npm run dev in the terminal and this will open a a preview browser in get pod actually i'm going to say no to the telemetry so it's going to open a preview browser uh it's going to load a few things so it'll be not found for a little bit and then it'll refresh once it's done make this a little bit bigger all right and so we can see our app and our cards have generated and i can go ahead and flip and these will be our hard-coded cards right so we've got the two commons we have the ultra rare and these are the cards that are referenced in our our main page our index page and if i just click open another pack which just refreshes the page it will be the same cards so there we go we have our our app is all in up and running you can see our custom component that we just wrote that shows like the dynamic background and the image is all working correctly so actually with that let's uh let's test out this uh do a little experimentation what do you think so if i change this to car dot rarity our image url yeah it does work all right so you can actually reference the props directly you don't have to use the the data section uh so the data section might be a legacy uh best practice it's also uh might be a necessary practice uh when you get into more complicated um things data structures because this is a fairly simple structure that we're working with [Music] dana says my cards only show the box shadow nothing inside so make sure that your your class is correct your rarity image url uh are you getting the correct colors because if you're getting the correct colors and the rarity should be fine your image url might not be coming through oh yeah simon that's that's the that's a good point yes you need the data if you want to alter the values um thank you uh yeah so just like i used a data value for our state where we're we're going between flipped is true or false uh you if you want to mutate this this data in any way you do need to have it as a data value you can't you cannot mutate the props yes thank you if you're not mutating the the props if you're not mutating that data then you can use the props directly it looks like then it looks like you fixed it awesome tarek did you did you create the hoot card component because we actually created that together it does not come in the repo when you first start it up uh all of that code is in the github repo and you can copy it over um directly you know ryan um i'm i'm wondering um and i can't tell what this person's name is okay so i have someone i'm talking to in discord that and i saw a couple people i thought on youtube that maybe when they launched their app it did not auto open the preview pane and so they may be having difficulty showing it would you show them where the ports are and how to launch their gitpod endpoint to the right place yes okay so if your simple browser doesn't automatically open which it should on the bottom of uh of git pod you'll see this ports uh and right now it's saying 3000 because these are this is the open port and this is as long as you've you've already executed npm run dev right you can click on that you click on that ports it'll open up this this window on the left side and 3000 should be green and it should be open because it's running and you can click on the open preview button which is the middle that should open the simple browser you can also open the browser which will open a new tab that also uh opens it kind of in a larger format so that will hopefully get you there if your preview browser does not open on automatically that is how you do it qmar uh yes this workshop is recorded and uh and will be available at the same youtube link after the workshop devendra fix it was a typo and hootcard component awesome glad you figured it out yeah i was gonna say the times where i've when i've gone through it uh if i didn't get the cards rendering properly it's usually because i fat fingered something in the code yeah the ports option on the bottom right of git pod oh actually hold on david your head is in the way oh no one can see yeah while he's moving my head while he moves me if you look at the very very bottom right of your git pod you should see a little tiny strip and you're going to see like 3000 888 so on and so forth just click there it opens up open up a port dialog and from there you can get access to your ports and launch them into the preview pane oh yeah see he made me disappear so now you guys can see it there you go all right sorry about that i didn't notice that david's head was in the way all right i know it's my fault daniel totally my head's just too big right in the way all right let me turn you back on now don't forget by the way if you are if you've gotten to a certain point when you're following along with ryan but for some reason the cards aren't rendering properly or something like that notice that in the github repo he does give you the completed version right of each of the sections um so maybe there's a slight typo or something that's been missed so make sure um that if you're if you're not entirely sure just go grab the you know the finished versions that are in the the repository step and then you know paste those over what you have what i says does it work for me it does not if the data part is missing if you if you remove the data part and i would recommend just for simplicity's sake just follow the what's in the repo there are uh other options i guess um but if you remove the data you do need to reference the card property up here in the template um but i would recommend just following the repo use the data section um it is best practice and allows you to change the values if you want to um okay oh who card someone said the who card this this part was not working for them why was it not working [Music] i mean what you typed looks right i'm not sure i'm not sure why it wouldn't work make sure that you put it in the uh card flip component underneath where the card component here comment is that's where that's where it goes if you're working locally and you have not run npm install you do need next uh the next stuff to be installed because that is uh required for it to auto import all the components that it needs yep spelling doesn't matter uh nicodemus we do not need to import the who card component first because we are using nuxt framework which will automatically do that when it builds which is super nice uh which version of view is nux using uh it's using the view three should be should be using v3 cool shivan looks like it's all working for you still no owls on cards to do see if i can find don't forget if i remember isn't this the spot they do they need to remove um they need to remove the hard-coded values or am i getting ahead of them no you're getting ahead of yourself yeah we're still working with hard-coded values so just make sure that okay so i'm going to go back uh to the normal way of doing it so we're still working with the data values we're not going to do the importing or utilizing the props directly we're going to import them so make sure that the image url make sure that your template looks like this in the hootcard component and then make sure you're defining your your prop correctly you're expecting a card prop you need to specify the type and you do need to give it a default value and then you return your data values and make sure everything's spelled correctly yeah case is important for sure yeah it was spelling image you are yeah let's be all capitalized as long as it's all consistent it's fine but right right all right um go back to here let me just check something real quick all right so uh this is all working which is great but it is hard-coded still right we're not we're dealing with dynamic uh cards at all right they're always gonna be the same so we want it to be dynamic i'm gonna go ahead and in the terminal hit ctrl c to stop the service i'm gonna go ahead and close that browser and we're going to make this dynamic so in order to make it dynamic we need to have a few things we need to have our database that has all of our card options in it we need to have a connection to that database we need to have some serverless functions that do do a little bit of work to give us um like randomly select our five cards create that pack and send it to the front end and so that's what we're going to do now so we need to do a few things to connect to our database we're going to run astra setup first which is a tool that allows you to very easily connect to a specific database in astra we're going to install the library astrojs collections which is the document api library to communicate with our database we're going to create a a utility a backend utility function called astra client that will connect to our astra database using all the credentials and generate and connect to the specific document collection that we want to use and then we're going to use netlifycli to give ourselves a environment um that emulates netlify now what is netlify i didn't talk about this earlier i probably should have metalfi is a global cdn content delivery network that is a really good hosting solution we're not going to be hosting this publicly right now but it also provides a back end for our app that hosts serverless functions so we can define our serverless functions and it will dynamically create endpoints based on those functions and stand up a backend for us so that we don't have to worry about backend infrastructure at all so really easy to use really convenient netlify cli allows us to to run that environment locally so that we don't have to run it publicly yet so first things first let's run aster setup now if you use a different database name you'll have to change things here if you use a different key space name you have to change things here um hopefully you use the default ones and you can just copy this over and run it and you'll have to click allow to allow copying into github now it's going to ask you for your uh token here the token that we generated now if you still have this window open you can copy it uh it's still it's the last one here it's under token uh if you don't have this window open hopefully you downloaded the csv if you did not feel free to generate another token it does not really matter what is the key something interesting ryan i i've got a couple sorry i've got a couple folks in discord that they're running the server it's up they're showing me screenshots and everything but gitpod is actually not showing them the port dialogue um so and it didn't automatically launch and i'm trying to track down why that might be um but uh i will i will give them a command to do gp preview so they can do it that way okay sounds good that's that's interesting it is so i'm going to go ahead and paste that token in here and it'll do its thing it'll look for the the database look for the key space uh and get everything set up now someone asked what is a key space key space is a collection of tables uh it's very similar to a schema if you're if you're familiar with relational world um or a name space sometimes is called a namespace it's just a collection of tables in this case it's going to be a collection of uh document collections um but that's what a key space is someone asked about the cli explain the cli again uh so netlify is uh a cdn that we are going to utilize to to host serverless functions rather than create our own back end because we don't really need to create a very um complex backend for this app and so i don't want to have to worry about the backend infrastructure at all so netlify will do that for us and dynamically create endpoints for the serverless functions that we create and we'll get into what serverless functions are in a little bit the cli is a local tool that um that creates a dev environment that emulates that live environment so it will provide us serverless functions and stuff all locally rather than doing it publicly on their servers yes run astro setup in get pod yep and you can just copy this this um line over to your terminal and it should it should run okay so what does astro setup do i wanted to touch on this astro setup will create um a file called env this is for your environment variables let's take a look at that i'm just going to open it here so it populates this uh environment variable file and it has your admin token uh your application token which are actually identical uh your dbid so that's your the id of the database that you connected to the region uh and the key space and then also a graphql endpoint if you if we were using the graphql api which we're not but this is all the information that you need to connect to your database but this is also very sensitive information you don't want this to get out to the public because then anyone else anyone can connect to your database and be authenticated and do whatever they want so the reason that we store these in environment variables is these environment variables will not be committed to any github repo and they are kind of isolated in a way that we can reference in the in the app itself but but they're not like just stored in like javascript that would be exposed to the front end or anything like that they're they're isolated right so when we host this publicly uh if you want to host this publicly these environment variables need to be provided to whatever hosting solution you have so because we're using netlify we're going to be we would be using notify to host it we need to provide netlify with these environment variables but they will be storing them isolated as well but it's just a way to keep things right yeah and be pot um and what kind of security sharing concerns when it comes to any kind of your security tokens yeah as ryan just said you never want to store those out in the open you don't want to put them in your github repos you don't want to make them publicly accessible anywhere um because that token gives you access to your database right so yeah especially to the ones we created were database administrator tokens which is like here have everything right so yeah you just you just make sure you never share those out yeah don't take screenshots don't stream a workshop that shows it um we delete these afterwards obviously uh okay so that's what that's what astro setup does it just makes it a really it's a really easy tool to generate that dot env without having to copy paste a bunch of stuff this is all information that you can get from your astra dashboard on the website but astro setup is just a tool that makes it easy so next we need to install the astra.js collections so astro.js collections uh is um the library that we'll use to uh to utilize the document api when connecting to our astrodb so we just ran that and we'll talk about how that works in a little bit actually we'll talk about it right now because we're going to create the aster client file and we're actually going to create that together so netlify both netlify cdn and the cli that we're using for local development is going to be looking for a folder called functions now we've actually defined this in the netlify.tomol which is a configuration file but it's by default it's going to look for a folder called functions and then any javascript function in that folder is considered a serverless function and it will dynamically create an endpoint that we can hit from the front end that will execute this function and deliver back the results so i have one already we'll be making one together this is upload cards this is what we'll be using to to upload the cards the the collection of cards to the database so that we can use them but we also have some utility functions that we need to uh to utilize and one that we need to create namely we need to create the astra client which is how we connect to the database in the first place so i'm going to go ahead and create the file astraclient.js and this is what we're going to be creating now you can just copy this this is a complete file already you can just copy this out of github i'm going to do that but i'm going to walk you through what each section is for it's pretty simple it might look complicated but it's not so first things we are importing the create client method from our astrojs collections library this is the just a method that's provided in the library that allows us to create the client which is basically the connection to the database and then we are creating an instance of that of client called astro client and then we have a method that's uh that's called get astro client and it's going to check if our instance is null so if the client doesn't already exist we're going to do this stuff if it does exist we'll just return the the existing client then we're going to use that method that we imported called create client and we need to provide it a few things we need to provide at the database id which we have stored in our environment variable right because we imported that already and this is how we reference it process dot env dot whatever the name of your environment variable is in the database id in the database region and we need our application token to authenticate that all of this is is uh you know a valid request so those are the three things that are needed to create this connection to the database and then we have a wait just a 30 second wait to give it time like hopefully it's immediate usually it is but just to kind of have a an opportunity for any delays to to go through and have it not fail so that's a kind of a universal method that you would use anytime you want to connect to an astrodb in any application you you use this is what you would use um so you can actually use this in any application you want then we have a method called get collection and this is how we both create and uh uh acquire the collection that we're going to be using and our collection uh is a is just a group of documents and a document is essentially a json object that we're saving to the to the database the collection is kind of a logical group of those documents and so what this is doing is we are uh creating an instance of our client right so we're you know executing that get astra client method and then our client dot namespace and we're providing it the key space name so in this case namespace and key space are interchangeable the same thing we're providing it the key space name which is uh saved in our environment variables and then that collection and we're we're giving it the name of the collection that we want now this collection doesn't exist yet if it doesn't exist and it and it receives a request it will automatically create a collection with that name um and if it does exist it will just return that collection that is named here so we are we are creating and using a collection called cards and then we're exporting these two methods so that we can use them in other files hopefully that makes sense it's pretty simple uh harik rishnan sorry if i wish your name your name your question is is all the backend functions also being handled by view no view is a front-end framework all this is just plain javascript right now okay so this is our astro client utility this is what we're going to be using in all of our servers serverless functions and now we're going to install the netlife cli by executing this command again the cli is a local uh tool to set up a local environment that emulates what the netlify environment will do if we were to host this live it provides the the dynamic back end that serves up the dynamic endpoints for our serverless functions and allows us to to use those as if they were online um does it return all the records present in the collection if the collection exists so all we're doing is creating a reference to that collection right now we're actually not doing anything to it yet that's what we're going to do in the serverless functions so let's create our serverless function and this is going to be our git card so we are um this is the the function that we're going to hit when we want to get our our new pack of cards right we've just refreshed the page we want our five cards this is the function that we're going to hit so in our functions folder because it needs to be on the root of the folder we're going to create a new file called getcards.js devendra um i think this astro client stuff is very generic is a very generic requirement should have been provided by astro by default uh so um it this is definitely something that you can take and use everywhere um uh the one thing that is definitely dynamic is the collection and the collection name you know you need to define what what collection you want to use and you can actually define multiple like you can make this a little bit more dynamic by providing a variable here so that you can connect to whatever collection that you want so it isn't uh it is a slightly bespoke um it's not there are some definite definitely some universal uses like this could be used in any application um but there are some things that you need to specify um but i mean good point i mean maybe that is something that we could think about providing a jump start on but i do think it's important to know how it connects um okay yes devendra that's yeah that's exactly what i was saying you could you could provide that that parameter um okay so we're creating a new serverless function and so the basic uh layout for a serverless function i'm going to go ahead and copy this over is this so we have the exports.handler asic function and then a return value so this is a very basic service function all it's going to do is say it's return of 200 yes you executed me right so when when netlife looks in this folder for these files it's going to see this it's going to say hey this is a service function that i need to provide an endpoint to and this is the function that i'm going to execute when this endpoint is is hit and obviously this is super simple it's just a you know just a return status code with no with no body just an empty body um basically i'd like to point out real quick about the service function here too notify because i did see some questions on this um asking like you know how are you doing the back end right so that's the that's the code that ryan's just about to fill out what's really cool about this and one of the reasons why we use the netlife libraries and such like that we're not doing it i'm just giving you a little bit of a side information um we're not pushing this to like a global cdn or anything like you could do with the fi service itself but if you were to then this code that you are all going to kind of like fill out now and you know implement with your serverless function up on netlify actually gets deployed as an aws lambda function but it's netlify does that all for you so for any of you here like serverless functions what are these how do i build them oh my god this aws stuff is a little much to get into you're actually starting to work that out right now and if you were to take the end result of this and then you push it up to nutlify you would actually be pushing a lambda function um so it's actually it's really cool that that functionality is here because it really simplifies the whole process uh and you don't need like an aws account or anything you can do it through netlafine you can do it for free yeah that's a good good intro to using those for sure um all right so we'll break down a little bit what this uh function is going to do we want to first off we want to retrieve all the cards from our database that we have stored there we want to randomly select five of them based on their rarity right and then we're going to create a a pack out of those five and send that pack as a as an array to the front end right so that it can use it just like we have our hard-coded array so those are the the steps that we're going to to do so first uh we need to import a few things to this file we're going to import two things first we need to import the get collection from our astra client so that we can reference the correct collection where all of our cards are going to be stored and then we're going to import a helper function that i've provided already and we can take a look at it called pack builder and we'll take a look at what that is first i'm going to import this line and just put it right up here all right let's take a real quick look at pack builder so this is um we won't dive too deep but basically this is how we determine the rarity or the um probability of selecting a certain rarity right so we have our common which is going to be used all the time like uh it's the most common it's going to fill in anything that's not selected our uncommon has a chance of 45 rare is 10 ultra rare is 3. this is just how we determine the rarities then it has a function that that picks a random rarity and then which is a bunch of math stuff and then it's going to create uh the pack right so it's going to take the source deck uh which is going to be all of our cards right so we're going to send the pack builder just the full collection of our cards and it's going to create a a pack out of them by iterating through five times because we want five cards it's going to randomly select a card from our deck it's going to select a rarity based on the the um uh probability of that rarity and then it's going to check if the card that it's selected is the same as the rarity that it's selected and if so it's going to push that card to our deck and uh and then create uh return this deck and then we're using dynamic sort which is another um helper thing that just orders them in the correct order so that we have common to to uh ultra rare um so that's all the pack builder does it just it takes the full selection of of cards and randomly selects five of them based on rarity and creates a pack out of them um so you can you can dive deeper into that if you want uh to know how that works but just know that it exists already okay so we've imported those two things that we need um so first things that we need to do in our actual function is we need to to get a reference to our collection right so we're going to use this line which just creates a reference called collection to our good collection so it's going to execute the get collection it's going to get that card collection and we can use the reference for that so we're going to put that right there so now we have a reference to it that we can do some work on and we also need to wrap this the rest of our stuff in a try block uh because if we run into errors we don't want the whole server to crash right that wouldn't be good um actually i'm just going to copy i'm going to copy all this crashing servers let's scratch the server i've crashed many servers um so we're just wrapping this in a try block so if it succeeds we're gonna we're gonna send back 200 saying yes i succeeded here's the body uh which right now is just empty if it errors it's going to uh save that error to the air console and it's going to send back a 500 saying something happened everything failed uh so that's basically so that will let it gracefully fail so that the server doesn't crash every time something happens because things will happen um now we can actually work with the document api now the document api um provides a lot of different methods that we can use i'll talk briefly about three of them we're only going to use one of them so create is for inserting documents into the into the collection so we have our cards collection when we want to if we want to insert a card we would use the create method if we want to update one of those cards we would use the update method for any editing or updates that we want and then if we want to retrieve documents we use the find method so that's the one that we're going to use um so we're going to use uh this line right here so we're defining a constant called res or result and it's going to await this execution which is the find method on the collection that we defined which is our cards and the empty object is basically says give me everything give me all of the entries all the documents from this collection which will be all the cards all right put that there actually that needs to go in the try block my bad oh and sixit uh over on youtube is asking can we upload files to astra yes you can upload um files in like binary formats and such like that you can do it um i would just say um a lot of times it depends on what you're doing the answer is yes uh and you can upload pretty large files but another convention to use uh let's say their media files videos or something like that is to actually put the physical the actual binary files themselves somewhere else like s3 or whatever and then have the lookup information in your table and then use another service to actually hold all those files because then otherwise unless you have a really really good reason uh that you're maybe doing something item or you're doing something with them now you're just storing all of those bits in the database um when you can do that you know i'd say more efficiently somewhere else so yes you can you can totally do that um but there's there are other ways you can go about it too yeah and that's exactly technically what i'm doing i'm using imager to host the pictures uh but it is essentially the same as if i was using something like s3 obviously i don't need to use s3 for pictures um for like a dozen of them so that's why i'm using imager uh but yes if you it's a really good point um if you want if you have like large files like you know netflix uses cassandra i doubt that they store their files on the database they probably have you know actual you know interestingly enough i actually know of one case uh down in south america company that they in fact stored this was really cool they stored it was a streaming service and they stored all the video files and everything in cassandra but didn't store them as one big long thing they actually cut them up and they got spread around and when you streamed it automatically pieced it all together and they they did it in such a way it scaled wonderfully and everything like that but they had a particular reason why they actually wanted to store the stuff inside the database and they devised a methodology to split them up into the in into uh you know essentially splice them and such like that so you could do it you could totally do it right but again um you might it might be better to just store a pointer in the database itself and then put file somewhere else yeah it depends it depends on your requirements really that's really interesting yeah all right uh so we are collecting uh we're using the find method on our collection to get all of our documents from that collection which will be all of our cards now we're going to use this line to create a pack out of that uh out of those cars now this is pretty crazy right um so all this line is doing uh is using some built-in methods uh for the object um and array so we have keys which is for the objects uh type and the map is for an array type all this is doing so basically when we when we retrieve documents from our collection it's going to come with a automatically generated document id and that's something that the the database generates uh when it when you create a document or you send a document up um you can actually define that yourself as well if you want to um but it's going to come with this document id i don't care about that id and it's actually formatting the the uh the information i get back in a in an odd way in a way that i don't want so all this is doing is taking that data that's coming back removing that document id and re-formatting it to be card card card card all in an array right it's just this is just formatting that uh that information that we're getting back into the format that i want um and getting rid of that document id that i don't care about so kind of complicated all when you see it all in one line but it's not that not that difficult um so we're defining our variable pack equals to uh the the result of the pack builder so it's going to take all of our cards create that pack of five randomly selected cards send it back and so that now we can we have our pack that we can send back to the front end okay by the way uh ryan there is a fun question from gleefully chilly or i'm sorry gleefully chill there's no eye at the end of that in discord in discord um and i'm actually answering a different question so i didn't know if there was a particular um reason why you use one over the other for his question um oh for the okay using require rather than import um so it's a different syntax and i i'm fairly certain that the node version we're using does not support es6 syntax which would be that import git collection so for those of you who are not on discord the question is why are we using uh this line constitute collection equals require that file over something like import get collection from the file like we would like we would do in here right we're using that es6 syntax in our our front end um because um we have tools on the front end that translate that syntax into the syntax that that the server that the node server recognizes uh we don't have those tools for this for the backend side of things uh and so the es6 syntax isn't always supported and so this is a more legacy way to do it [Music] that's the best answer i can give you about that i would love to use the import syntax it's much better in my opinion but you can run into issues pretty quickly by doing that okay so now that we have our pack we can actually send it to the front end by uh including it in our body um so we're just going to uh do uh json stringify and then we're gonna add our pack here so this is just serializing that information and sending it to the front end where it can be received all right that's pretty much it if you want to um this is the in the repo this is the full file so if i know we built it up part by part if you want to make sure that everything is correct you can just copy all of this content over typos typos happen you gotta you gotta be careful all right so that is our serverless function now there's already a service function included this is for uploading all the cards to the database we will be using that shortly um but that should be uh pretty much it we need to now call this serverless function from the front end and use this dynamically generated data rather than using the hard-coded data right so let's go back to our index page right this is where index.view so pages index.view this is where we are receiving our our data so right now it's all hard coded but we need to fetch that data now uh we need to import a new library this may or may not be required i think nux probably does this for us but just just to make sure we're going to import axios which is a library for making api calls really useful javascript technically has a built-in method called fetch uh axios kind of gives you um a bit more uh ability to do certain things and the syntax is nicer in my opinion so we're using axios i think i think nux is set up to use it automatically though and now we need to implement a fetch method in our component so first things first we're not using the hard-coded cards anymore so let's get rid of that i'm going to get rid of all this hard-coded nonsense if i can highlight it okay so now we we need to initialize an empty array so we need to you know make sure that this data point this data variable is available right but it'll start out as an empty array but now we need to to implement a a new method in our view component it'll be an async method because we're fetching data and it's called the fetch method this is a built-in method for for view um and in here we are going to define we're going to assign this.cars which is our data variable right the new information that we're going to get from executing uh this part so i'm actually just going to copy this oops did i go backwards okay copy this over so don't mistype anything um so we're assigning the cards variable the result of this which is which is how we execute um or how we hit that endpoint right so axios is our api uh library it has a get method and we're providing it the url this is the url that we use for all of our serverless functions right so netlify because nutify is what is providing these functions slash functions where that those functions are held and git cards is the the name of our of that file that we created right and then once it once it executes that it's going to uh get the result and isolate the data part of that result right because we the result will have the uh the the status code and then the data and we just want the data part and this gets into something what ryan just showed there in line 40 when he highlighted that the slash.netfi functions git cards this gets a new question that ion was asking our friend ion about how do you get how do you generate the endpoint for that right and when using netlife serverless functions well the first part of it there right is the dotnetlife so it tells it okay i want to go to my serverless functions the functions directory right that's coming from our netliphi tomol so when we're using netlify in your nullify tomo you identify what directory you want your serverless functions to go into i think brian's going there now yep see functions equals functions so we're just saying i want my serverless functions in the functions directory so if we go then back to our app you'll see that functions directory any one of the functions that are in there right now you have get cards and nut bug cards they're all then accessible as end points so if i were to go to dot net if i slash function slash get cards or slash upload cards either one of those would be accessible um and so you just pretty much anything you drop into whatever your functions directory is then those will just be accessible at the that notify whatever endpoint all right okay so this is what uh the script section of index.view should look like now we've removed the hard-coded stuff we're dynamically assigning that cards array with information that we're getting from the database and so we should be good to go so we should be able to launch the app now so we're going to launch it a different way because we need to again create this environment that emulates netlify's environment so we're going to use netlifydev which is part of that cli that we installed wait for it a little bit all right and this is what you should see now you're not going to have any cards because we don't have any cards in the database we have not uploaded those yet so the way that we're going to do that is in your terminal section uh if you drop this down and select split and you can select bash default there's other places that you can do this you can go up to the top left open the menu go to terminal split terminal that will work too that's probably the easier way to be honest so it's going to create a new terminal and we're going to manually execute that that other serverless function that we created the upload cards through the terminal here so you can copy this code out of the repo [Music] this will automatically generate the the url that you have specific to your gitpod and then append the full path to it so if i execute this and keep an eye on this side of the terminal because we'll actually see it execute over here and we want to see a status 200 rather than a status 500 so we'll execute that so we have a request take a little bit status 200 means it was successful so our cards are now uploaded now if i refresh this browser we should have our cards and they should be randomly selected cards based on the rarity so if i flip these over you can see i did not get an ultra rare so we know that they are different cards and there we go that is all right uh you do have to press enter after you paste it daniel yeah it doesn't automatically execute oh yeah and when the upload the upload uh the upload cards function itself doesn't have a return so you're not going to see like you're not going to see it you're going to do it and it's not going to say like upload completed just rerun just refresh the app and you should have data yeah you should you should see a status 200 after you run it on this side of the terminal this is your server that we ran here yeah you'll see a status 200 saying that everything was good but nothing's going to return on the part that you uh that you executed all right yeah maybe maybe we can make a little uh adjustment to that in the future and give a return code or something or like a return message it says you loaded data or whatever yeah um all right so give us a thumbs up if everything worked for you i'm i see a few issues that i'll i'll try and address here in a little bit but give us a thumbs up we just want to make sure that everyone got through it uh jerome got a module build failure error pointing to the await keyword if you have a specific uh area like um if it has like a file and a line number um i can go there and see what i have and uh we can compare it um unexpected reserved word await yeah give me a give me a file and a line number and we can see what it's supposed to be uh i don't see the curl command in github it's all the way at the bottom um someone else nothing happened okay address that gaming uh python script getting response with status 500 well first off uh this is javascript not python script uh yeah [Music] um try try it again see if maybe the communication to your database was um didn't work the first time double check your astra client because if your connection to your database isn't set up correctly that would also cause it to fail um so just make sure that this and this is copied straight out of the github um and this is pretty uh pretty boilerplate code other than the specific collection that we're using yeah and i see now the errors okay so like cone and others if you have if if if in the server you're getting error like you see cohen has there right that tells me you just don't have data on the back end right um because that'll that's what will happen when you try to run the cars but there's no data on the back end when you do when you add the um the asynchronous await axios.get right that last little piece that ryan did if you don't have data on the back end when it goes to get the data it's gonna it's gonna not gonna return anything and it's gonna error out right so make sure that you're running that upload uh the upload cards curl at the very very bottom and you wanna do that in another terminal right do that you can go maybe you could show that ryan if you show them how to create another terminal just in case yep i'm going to go ahead and delete this terminal so to open a new terminal because this is running our service right so this is busy right we can't use this terminal for anything so in the top left you can open this menu and then go down to terminal split terminal this is just so that they'll be side by side you could do new terminal as well but split terminals will be side by side and then then you can execute commands in here and uh that's where you want to put the curl command what exactly are you running when you use curl uh you're just hitting a specific url that you're providing it's pretty simple curl is a built-in um uh tool for command lines in general you know ryan and uh in discord um uh has the most interesting screenshot it's almost like their cards both the front and back side got merged into one i've never seen that right yeah interesting um so that's going to be an issue us either an issue or what browser first off what browser are you using uh yes because if it's an old browser that could provide some issues because we are kind of using some fancy css on this but that's in card flip the card flip component that's where the issue is going to arise if you have one i would check uh oh man i would check to make sure that your card component is in the correct div um it should be in the card front div just double check that but black cat has it happening as well uh daniel i'm running netlify dev in one tab uh in one terminal because we need to create that netify environment to serve up the serverless functions uh so not npm rundev we need to do netlifydev uh and then the other tab the other terminal is where i run the curl command yep and i should see i should see the response on the first terminal hopefully that was clear i know we're going back and forth um i see a few thumbs up that's great awesome for those of you who have it working uh if you're interested in getting the badge take a screenshot of this simple browser portion that is that is what you need for the for the uh for the homework we just want to see first off that we want to see a unique url so we know it's yours but we want to see it all working in this in this browser um canon it's empty no cards for you so that is expected make sure you uh take a look at step nine it says you may not be getting cards we need to run the curl command in a new terminal to that executes the function that uploads the cards because we haven't done that yet devendra task timed out after 10 seconds [Music] is that when running the curl command i wonder if your database connection settings are not correct so if it's running the curl command make sure your astro client.js is uh structured correctly again this is stuff that you can copy straight out of the github repo if you if you're worried about typos uh accidentally clicked on terminal and it opened a new terminal window so all your terminals on the are on the right side here i'll make this window bigger uh so your terminals should be you should be able to select different terminals over here oh and and david said where david's head is that's where the new terminals are no my head's in the way yet again yet again oh no no gitpad because i'm running locally but then i don't have a unique url uh if if it says localhost that's fine uh if you're working locally it it's still valid just give us a screenshot of it yeah and uh shaida and others who are curious like where do you submit the screenshot if you want a badge in the repo itself there is a explicit homework section you just follow the instructions in the homework section the last step there will have a link you just click that it'll bring you right to where you need to submit the homework yep okay um so it looks like a lot of people have it working that's awesome make sure you get your screenshot i'm going to go ahead and close uh do some close out resource stuff uh because we're getting close to the time feel free to continue asking questions uh we will address them as needed i just want to make sure that we get to some of this stuff so first off um let me switch to this okay so uh we have we offer vouchers uh for cassandra certification um for attending our workshops so you can scan this qr code with the phone if you want you can go to that that link i also um put a command in the uh the youtube chat uh that should get you a link that you can click on uh these are vouchers for cassandra certification and there are three different tracks that are offered administrator developer and kate sandra and these vouchers are valid for two three months and they're valid for two attempts uh so be sure if you're interested in in uh in getting certified in cassandra um take advantage of that if you wanna to go through the uh the courses that are recommended for getting certified you can go to datastax.com academy or no it's academy.datasacks.com mybad okay datasex.com.datasex.com we have all the courses needed uh that uh to complete um to get to learn what you need to know for these certifications and it's all free and again there are different tracks um for for each of those certification levels now so you can you can check that out um for homework so for this badge um the the hands-on just completely hands-on portion like i said getting a screenshot of the working app is all that is required an optional thing though is if you want to um try and change the pack size so right now we're working with five cards in a pack um if you want to try changing the pack size and figure out how how to do that um that would be awesome we'd love to see that just a little bit more engagement and uh and also prove that you you did it and you understand it um that would be great it is optional though um and to get there you can go to the repo uh if i if i go back to the repo here um actually if you type in exclamation point homework uh it'll get you a link straight there but it is uh all the way at the top in the homework section here take your screenshot you can click this link submit your homework here it'll create a template for you uh to fill out um and then we'll get to those we'll we manually grade those so we'll get to those over the next week and and grade them as they come in if you are interested in knowing what workshops we have coming up you can go to datastax.comworkshops and that is kind of a running list of all the upcoming scheduled workshops that we have we do workshops every single week sometimes multiple times a week some of the things that are coming up um is we have cassandra day australia and new zealand this friday so if you are in australia or new zealand you can attend that we have a lot of great uh speakers um for an all-day event for that uh we also have the uh reactive apps with quarkus um that is coming up on the 27th of october uh so keep keep an eye on that go to datasacks.com workshops uh to to be up to date on on the workshops that we have coming up um discord again uh we uh have a growing community on discord uh you are very much invited to join if you have questions that you have outside of a workshop right the youtube chat will go away and we can't answer questions so if you go to discord and ask your questions we'll be able to answer it and we have a lot of people just out even besides us that are active in the discord we have a lot of community members that are very intelligent and very capable of answering your questions as well uh so be sure to to join us there um do you need that uh voucher link again um you can go to uh devendra just fill in your name um but yeah you can don't don't use those carrot brackets but you can just fill in your name uh so if you want to subscribe to our youtube channel it would be greatly appreciated all of our workshops are recorded and archived so if you want to see some of our previous workshops you can go ahead and check out our our huge collection there we regularly re-uh do these workshops though we're constantly updating them and uh and re-hosting them so if you find one that you like or or are interested in and want to uh to catch a live version of it we will most likely be doing a live version of it in the near future um so keep an eye out for that but if you'd like to subscribe you'll be notified of when we release new videos or when we go live and that would be great all right so with that if there are any other questions i'll take a look um yeah there's a i called you out on discord for a couple things ryan just so you know okay um and and i would say jerome and in others if you're on the youtube chat and you want to further troubleshoot things come down to the discord do the bang discord there in the youtube chat so you can get the link come down to our discord and then we can totally help you out after this because once we stop the stream the youtube chat will stop uh not only that discord you can give us screenshots which does make it a lot easier sometimes to troubleshoot things yes definitely and i'll i see some of those questions in discord i'll address those uh in discord after the stream it looks like uh some maybe some issues with the component custom component part of things so i'll adjust those in discord if anyone else has any questions and want to give some screenshots then uh discord is the place to go at this point um well oh haha okay you guys i was gonna say i just saw somebody uh one of the folks at discord added a bunch of cards so they figured that out no nice you found it all right well with that thank you uh so much for for joining us uh we really appreciate um you you being here uh if you wanna join us next week for our next workshop that would be awesome if you have any feedback um on this workshop or any other workshop we do have a channel in our discord for workshop feedback um we greatly appreciate uh your thoughts on what you liked what you didn't like what you think would be better um we always want to make these as good as they can be so with that thank you so much for joining us and we will catch you next time see ya thank you everybody have fun playing the game and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for
