    "text": "hello everybody and welcome thank you for watching this video today we are going to dig into a react and jam stack based app called battle stacks so what is battle stacks battle stacks uh is essentially a party game right uh it's familiar if you're familiar with certain other games you've probably uh used to how it works um essentially you have a set of questions that you are asked uh with a group of people and you really try to answer say maybe the funniest or the most provocative and then everybody else votes on those answers and the one with the most points at the end wins right um and so what we've done here is we've implemented battle stacks uh on the jam stack framework so if we take a look at what is jam stack um jam the jam and jam stack is javascript api and markup right and jam stack is really a new standard architecture using the web github actions workflows pre-rendered context statically generated content that is deployed up to um a cdn and then made dynamic by apis and serverless functions right and there are all sorts of different tools and frameworks that you can use for that now for what we're doing today right we are going to use data sets astra is our document store and netlify for our global cdn and serverless functions but we'll get to that a little bit later for now though i've invited some friends with us and we're going to play a quick round of battle stacks to give you all a feel for what that should look like so hello hello friends let's play some battle stacks let's do it alright so all right i'm going to um start a new game let me go ahead and do that here we go let me start a new game so we have a new game of skvg now please don't go in until i do skvg and let's see who i'm yani today i feel like yani okay wonderful and we'll just wait for my friends there's my friends wonderful i have two other friends just two all right so let's start the game and now what we'll see is there is a timer everyone's getting ready uh then once the timer goes down we'll all be asked a set of questions and we answer those questions and then after that there will be a round of voting oops you have to spell correctly now of course you saw what i typed in you're not going to see what they typed in but as the runs of voting come through now everyone's going to start voting and eventually i'll see some questions show up oh good i'm glad to see that one one so that you can see on the left-hand side there some of the votes that are coming in now there's only three of us here oh all right so i get a chance to vote okay and then after that it's going to tell you all the scores and whoever got the top amount of points wins we all get zero oh there it goes all right looks like yani yanni came in with 100 and then rebecca with 50. and i'm sorry dc you have zero you have zero but anyway that gives you an idea of what the game looks like and and how it plays so now let's take this and actually deploy it in our local environment and with that see you friends thank you so much for joining the left-hand side are going to be the instructions that i'm going to follow from the repo and on the right-hand side are going to be the things that the instructions are telling me to do so the repo we are working out of here by the way is github.com data stacks dash examples slash battle stacks right so go there and you can follow along now if i scroll down here the first thing we see that i want to create a data sex astra account so data sex astra is a fully managed cloud-based apache cassandra solution right and astra is free to register there is a free tier so everything we're going to do today is completely free so i've already registered an account i have one and i'm logged in once i you're logged in you should see a screen that looks something like this notice the add database button so i'm going to follow the instructions here click add database and then i want to choose the free tier again that is free forever it's a really great place to take a look you know to just experiment or if you want to test things out like we're doing right now then from there i will select the google cloud cloud provider because that's the only one that's available in the free tier and then the region closest to me in my case it's us east once i have picked all the options that i can configure database will light up i'll click that and now i go to the next section so let's scroll down here this is where i want to set the values of my database things like its name my username so on and so forth now you can use whatever values you want here i have used some previously that i'm just going to choose to make my life a little easier once you have filled all of those in the crate database button will light up just go ahead and click that and then it will go to create your database now this is just take a minute or two right it's not going to take very long at all now while we're doing that let's go back over to our instructions and let's take a look now you're going to notice here the instructions tell you go to the connect screen and pull some data out of there while our database is being created i actually want to go to the next one for a moment and we're going to make a copy of this repository and the reason being is because later on we're going to launch our own application into production and doing so we need our own repository to do it so i'm just going to go ahead and bring this over here and then per the instruction in the data sex examples battle sax repo i'm going to use this template and put in a nice name public is a good idea especially if you're going to use gitpod later you're going to want a public repository and sure to click include all branches that is important and then just say copy repository from the template now github is going to go it's going to take a minute or two it's going to generate this new repository while it's doing that let's go back over to astra ah yes we are active wonderful so now i'm going to go to the connect button here like it says in the instructions and notice that the document api you see you have all these different apis and these different code languages and what's really cool about the connect tab here in astra is that it's actually going to pull all of the connection values that you need for astra for you so what i want to do is we're going to use the document api and i can just go here i need these values later on in code so i'm just going to copy those my clipboard i'm good to go whether or not you're doing the document api or using any of the language variants it's really cool because you can just go down it'll give you all the instructions you need and how to connect to the database and how to use it okay so let's take a look oh good our repo is here so we should be ready to go from that standpoint notice that it is my personal account and not the data stacks examples one so wonderful okay now at this point it tells you to go ahead and clone the repository what i'm going to do is cheat a little bit right that's kind of assuming that you're going to pull this down locally and work within your own local ide we have another option though and that's gitpod so we've actually pre-configured gitpod in this repository to pre-load a bunch of the dependencies all that kind of thing so you don't have to do it and if you're not familiar with gitpod it is a cloud-based ide it's there in github so if you have a github account you can just click like we're doing here and launch one and it's honestly it's pretty wonderful it will allow you to collaborate with your teammates you can just launch an ide with everything configured you don't have to worry about what os you're on all sorts of things so we're going to go ahead and load that here for a moment and let npm install some of our prerequisites okay so all of our prerequisites are now in place so let's go ahead and continue on with the instructions so noticing here the first thing i want to do is a get fetch and then a get checkout full game okay now notice this part here it says create a env file and fill it with the values from env.example so we have provided an example env file for you so what i'm going to do is cat the env example i'm going to redirect that out to env now i have a env file i open that up now here's what i want to do remember the values that we copied out here earlier i just copied those there i'm just going to overwrite all of them except for games collection there and paste them in place now one thing to point out is i am going to delete these export commands because we don't need them they are for a shell and in this case we're in a env file not the shell so i'm just going to delete those but otherwise it's actually filled in all the values for me except for my password right that wouldn't be good from a security standpoint so go ahead and fill that out and do not forget to save i have to save you see that changes the state there and now my environment is configured for my code to connect now we need to do an npm install to get any of our dependencies the pm install completed let's go ahead and run some tests just to be sure that our code is working as we expect okay great all right with that so let's go ahead and now run the actual code and make sure to type that right or it's not gonna work very well there we go and we're gonna run the application you can see that it's bringing in the environment variables that we had configured previously we're waiting for the server to come up okay cool let's go ahead and refresh this real fast that will be where the game is i will put the lobby here all right so the key thing is if we start a new game swlj let's come over here to dave and it was l j join game and we see that a game has started so here's the key deal though if i come back over to our database where we are storing our document via our document api then if i go to my cql console and type games boom we should see that i have codes that match right um the values that i just put in and that's exactly what i have so we know now that our game is in fact functioning is connected to our data store and it's ready to go in our local ide environment so the next step is going to take this and deploy this through our full ci cd pipeline with github actions and netlify in production and we'll do that in a following video thank you take care",
