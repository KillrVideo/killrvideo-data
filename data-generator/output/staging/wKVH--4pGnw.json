    "text": "all right well welcome everyone to another webinar today we're gonna be talking about data stacks vector and this is really cool this is one that I'm reading really looking forward to because I've known about it before you did and I've been excited to share this with the rest of the Cassandra community out there so this is a first look at it so I I'm here with Aaron Morton and Patricia gorila I'm gonna I'm gonna move this over to Aaron here shortly but just so you know who I am if you've never met me before out in the world my name is Patrick McFadden I have been working with Apache Cassandra for about 10 years now so that's one of the reasons I'm really excited about this but before this I was I was an architect and I worked on developing applications on the old internet for a long time and ran Cassandra in production I've been a data stacks for a long time talking about a kiss Pachi Cassandra and part of what I'm my whole mission is making it easier for you to use and that's why I'm really excited today about this because this is actually what we're gonna do so let's move on to an errand I think you can take it from here thanks Patrick for those of you that don't know me my name is Aaron Morton and we'll introduce Patricia in a minute as well I've been using Cassandra for about 10 years as well I started using it when I was working at a company called whether digital and we're making avatar the movie thought you know what these databases are kind of fun started the company called the last pickle back in March 2011 spent nine years working with people all around the world using Apache Cassandra and the beginning of this year thought you know it's about time I went to data stack so March this year the last pickle joined data stacks in it's been an incredibly fun and exciting three months feels like the right place and the right time and we're really excited to be here patricia do you just want to give a brief introduction and then we'll move on yeah thank you everyone for joining my name is Patricia Gordo I started using Cassandra back in in 2013 actually and when we were helping helping different people get started with with Cassandra I worked with Aaron at the last pickle and and I also worked at Apple on the largest Cassandra clusters in the world and I'm very excited to be here with you all and here at data stacks I'm working as a Solutions Architect so let's dive in Thanks so as patrick said we're gonna talk today about a thing we've made called vector vector is to hear to solve a problem that we think a lot of people have that is that it's hard to be consistently successful with Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise like any piece of software there's a learning curve that you need to go through and there's a community we're working hard to get it sandra 4.0 out and to make it easier for people to use Cassandra that's just your distributed system though so they're still always going to be some issues am I consistently successful we mean you can make a system that runs really well on your first month but how's it going to run six twelve months later things change so it could be that your workload shifts as you become more successful users start to use the application in ways you hadn't thought about that changes the workload going through you have to upgrade your servers that new hardware moves to a different cloud provider and that can make things complicated there's new features that can be added to Cassandra or to your application that changes things and there's better way to solve the problems than before and probably the hardest one is stars turnover the people that create the systems initially move on to other projects or leave your company and you bring on new people how do you bring them up to speed and get their skills up to where they need to be as quickly as possible so what we've done with vector is create what the cat credit service that fits into the category of AI Ops now that's a category but really what vector does is we continually assess how Cassandra has been used and we provide near real-time expert advice knowledge and skills all around this idea of making operators and developers both those groups and people consistently successful so let's have a quick look at them here at how we do this as an overview the down the bottom here this little robot guy we have an agent that's installed and runs in your Cassandra process we've had some people testing this they ran it for about ten months so they forgot to turn it off and it was sending data somewhere we forgot to check and they had didn't notice any performance impact we've done some benchmarking we've not been able to find the performance impact there's already some agents Java agents that run inside your Cassandra process what that agent does is it looks at how the system has been used we look for events such as a tables being created a node went down and things like that or it's just been a period of time and then we'll collect the metrics and the schemer will look at the status in the gossip as to whether what nodes are what's nodes state we have we'll look at the configuration the operating system and its performance as well we click that and then periodically send those up to vector where vectors running either in the cloud or on-premise we take that information break the part and look for changes and try to understand what are the important changes that they're happening now we take that and run that through a series of rules that we have that are either heuristics such as code or algorithms such as machine learning and artificial intelligence join that together with our expert knowledge to build this advice and all to drive a situation so that you can come in in the morning and get the best experience the best expertise from data stacks the system is built vector is made so that we can continually update it this happens when you're running on the cloud well when you're running on premise we'll find new things in the field we're always there doing that as well we're with customers around the world and we'll look at new features in Cassandra more battle test them in the lab and understand the best way to use them and what it looks like when they're about to fail and we codify that without heuristics and there are algorithms we have the best way to explain it and then push those out and this is the great part run that against every node that's in vector so those measures that knows three-years-old will go and run today's expertise against that and then we'll do the same thing tomorrow if we update it so as that there's a way to set the scene let's jump over to a demonstration and have a look at vector in progress this is vector running and it's monitoring itself it's an easy way to get things done this is the initial dashboard now's a be the product we're looking to be simple and consistent got an overview of the clusters that were running and here we just have one cluster and the different versions of that and the advice that we generate we're going to start by just jumping into some advice in this menu here for advice we can see Cassandra listed and if we're running with DC we'd see do you see listed there as well each piece of advice that we generate has a category such as the configuration or performance or schema and then we say whether we think it's critical or recommended that you follow it whether you've already done it this is a system where we put some text data in and we try to find out that we're running the rules running away we expect them to some piece of advice may always be recommended or always be critical or some may move between as the situation gets more complicated categorize it and I just want to jump into a really simple one by that I mean the advice around the simple snitch okay click in see the nodes that these impacts then go in and look at the detail so for each piece of advice we have a clear recommendation what we wreck a description of why as well I think this is the important part so why don't we want to use the simple snitch well because it's got doesn't have any configuration it doesn't allow us to control the placement of data centers and racks and if you can control the placement of data centers the rack that makes administration a lot easier well that's great and this is also a good time to understand the concept of what the snitch is because it's a sounds a bit weird and the concept of data centers and racks in Cassandra we think the best time for you to learn about something like this is when we need to know it to make your system better so it gives you this background we give you an example and we show the information that we use to make the decision pretty simple one here just the configuration we'll give you some version sensitive help around how that config setting works and where you'll find it and then effects so in this case moving from the simple stage to the gossiping property file snitch it's kind of complicated takes a numb words we're going to get five thar steps to go through because you have to first configure as a property file snitch which we fall back to if the gossiping property file snitch can't work something out and you know just one reason of why this is so important is that because inertia piece with the default default settings for you to really just get up and running as fast as you can just get that cluster up and be able to be able to start to use it but but the decisions that you make early on in your cluster have a big impact and those those handful of steps especially when you're when you're first starting out will only get more more complex and more difficult to do later on and so vector is really there with you from the beginning to help help make sure that you have the right configurations set up and and have have really the ability to start off on the best foot with your cluster yeah the simple snitch is fine right it all it does is it says every node is in what we say every nodes in rec one-a-day this in a month which is great but if you're running on AWS you would maybe want to set it up so that you could run multi-region the multi eggsy in the future if you're on public private cloud if you're in that hybrid cloud environment or a multi cloud environment maybe want to use the gossiping property file snitch so that you can have some nodes in your private cloud some nodes in your public cloud and replicate between them and you can move from simple to gossiping property file snitch relatively easily just it takes a number of steps in there finding that out early on is really important because it's easier to do with when there's less pressure and less data in there this is a good example of just something that the perceived wisdom that not everyone has access to because if you come to Xander is a new system you don't have the experience and that's really what we want back there's and gives people is better knowledge better experience as quickly as we can source what we have here is if this is a piece of config related just to one node so if we needed this to if this change only had to apply on one node and not some others in the cluster will demonstrate this here so you can understand the whole system and it applies to a node so why don't we tell you what else we need to do for this node as well we've got some other issues here that we can look into and maybe switch those around at the same time that's simple but a gotcha that we want to make sure they you can fix before you get caught there so next thing I want to look at with some things that are a little more eye candy and we know Patrick likes his candy so we're going to chat to Patrick around these I can't I think we mentioned a little swedish fish are fine so go ahead and send those a little bit of monitoring and we be calling this opinionated monitoring ad-hoc monitoring where you can go and build a regression and do all sorts of great stuff such as data dog and Griffin or a really useful and it's important to be able to monitor your database with your whole application but sometimes not everyone has that or it's difficult to get access to for in all environments so we've put some basic things in this is a key space that we're looking at we can just see the currently what our ops per second and our latency is and then this types of things we've wanted to look at as Cassandra professionals over the years is which tables have the most data so this is a simple it's called the tree view shows us that model of which tables have the most data and we can look at that as well for throughput so here are the tables with the highest read throughput and then the highest write throughput and same for latency so where are we spending most time on our read latency now write latency and it's nice to write right sorry Patrick I think and that's cluster wide right yeah a single node definitely this is aggregated on the tables across all of the clusters and at the moment it's giving you the sort of the view right now we'll work that had a time series into this as well and this if you're walking up to someone else's cluster and you're trying to help them understanding which tables have the most traffic which have the highest Layton sees without having to resort to no tool and as Patrick says we aggregate across the whole cluster I've managed cluster look at people's clusters at up to six hundred nodes picking the one that's having the most difficult the node is having the most difficulty and getting the actual values from it or identifying what the averages across the whole cluster gets hard if you're just hitting it with no - oh yeah oh yeah this is like this is where I mean as someone we as we've all done managing large clusters this is what separates the mortals from people who you know you will fold so fast if you're not prepared for how a distributed system works and and having a tool that that follows the rules and distributed systems like yes this is a cluster however every no it is important hey the amount of I really wish I had this 10 years ago Aaron so I'm just gonna tell you right now you want to make my life easier yeah that's that was why we started making it make everyone's life easier so we bring all that together in this thing we call focus bubbles and what we're looking to do here is contextualize how important the table is and focus on some performance aspect so here each bubble is a table the height of the table is the proportion of throughput both are even write that that table is getting for the whole key space the left right position is it's read/write workload mix and then the size of the bubble is the amount of data that it has compared to the whole key space and then we color-coded based on the thing we want to look at so here we're looking at Reed Layton sees the red bubbles are in the top 25th percentile now it may be that they're not particularly slow they're just the slowest now I can shift and look at right latency and see it's taking some time to write to this guy this guy and we've used this with a few places and the ability to just quickly see I look all the Reed traffic's up here but that's not the slowest part here's the slowest part and here's the slowest part really valuable and from an operator's perspective it's it's so great to be able to to compare these these different fields side-by-side again without having to go into the command line and and just looking at Rosa Rosa's numbers vector vector really lays that out for you yeah so then go ahead Patrick I was gonna say I mean and you know using something like graph fauna which is great for you know showing statistics in time series this is a totally different perspective on this is not a time series definition this is this is hey pay attention to this thing it gives I think an operator really quick glance I mean if you look at a graph on a screen and can glean meaning out of it immediately then you're professional but if you're not you can look at something like this just seconds know exactly what's up yeah exactly and they'll click in here and drill into this table have a look at the table configs and the columns and you were talking before about which nodes doing which traffic so here we've got a bit of a mismatch in our traffic load here we could look at the load their traffic throughput we can look at the load their nose as well those only year that you do whatever cluster of machines it is a distributed system you can have one other ten things misbehaving and how do you identify those as we look at the advice later on you know some of the advice we have looks at how a node performs relative to the whole cluster so we won't look at hey does this node have more data in this table than we would expect given all the other nodes or is it getting more traffic for this particular table than the others or does it have more quiet connections or is its configuration different than what we expect given all the other nodes in the cluster understanding of its distributed system it's key part so I'm gonna jump out a little bit there though and look at security now we always talk about security we love to make sure that everybody's got their data nice and secure and here here's a real simple one that the Cassandra user is a super user and we look at the head and determine we should probably turn that guy off and here we've looked at the fact that we do have a password Authenticator running we've looked at the fact that the Cassandra rolls enabled and we've given you a fix here about how they disable that the security in Cassandra changed a bit over 3.0 and became a bit more role based and so it's got slightly complicated but it's something that I think we really as a community want to get more people focused on that this adventure right here could probably save jobs yeah because I think I think this is one thing that you really don't security as always the last thing right and if this is in front of you uh this is great yeah and in Cassandra in the evening security once here running is a bit easier now but it used to be almost impossible used to be quite downtime because particularly if your client had to talk securely to the servers in the old days the only way to do that was to stop all the servers configure them to require the client to have authentication and then bring them back up and have the clients all start to have authentication you can roll that out now it's still more complicated to do it on the running system than to catch it early on maybe in your QA systems and it start to have security be something you're running all the time right so we've looked at some advice that's around configuration we've looked at some advice that's around security the big thing that we always talk about with Cassandra course is steamer and data modeling and it's one of those difficult on-ramps for new users to come in so I'm going to look at the sub schema advice that we have here against their system thinking and look at this one around the use of sequel collection types these are really handy things I remember when they were added because we don't have you know we didn't have indexes back then or that they work in sort of different ways to a relational engine if you just wanted to store the email addresses that the user has that's what they were designed for and often just knowing that is a really powerful thing for developers so here a recommendation is that we've noticed that we're using a collection type we just want to make sure you understand as a developer that it's for denormalizing small amounts of data I think there's a rule of thumb if somebody else gets to decide like another piece of software or a user how much day that goes into that collection type then it should probably be a table unless you're going to limit it and again we want to explain to you why so we've got an example here of how lists work and they they may create duplicate data if you doing replays through your application tier there's some information on how to tiel's work and data purging and the general concept of collections and how they're implemented in Cassandra giving you some links here even to go and look at the tickets that generate that edited or tickets around this behavior here of how many elements you can have in here giving you all the background that you need I think the best time as we said before they learn about collection types is when you need to do something with it reading books is great go to training is great but then we always contextualize that learning and that's the best time so for this one we looked at the column here and for our fix we know this is a map and we can't tell you exactly how the change of this is an example if you've got a map how I could change this map to be due to different tables and in general since how I would then make that fix ID at the back field of data or switch the application over and then drop that column and if it was a set here's a data modelling example for a set and if it was but sits on the list here's a data model exact with a Howard take that list out and this goes back to earlier where we're talking about those decisions that you made right at the beginning have a big impact on your cluster having the right data model is is a key part of making sure that that your cluster is performant you know Patrick and Aaron have both given a lot of talks on this subject and having vectored therefore for your people who are using Cassandra right at day one and helps you to overcome that and and understand what our collections good for what are they not what are they not good for and and really build up this continuous continuous education for for Cassandra yeah you know Patricia that is the part that I think I love the most is you could actually be actively learning this is active learning this isn't passive where you're sitting there watching you know just another course on data modeling that you have to retain that information this is a like it tells you hey here's a change you need to make and that is really super cool because that's now I can make some actions and this is when I when I first saw this Aaron first showed me this I fell out of my chair because this almost makes my job over I have to find a new job teaching people data modeling is done sorry but you know thanks Aaron yeah well we still still need you for some things Patrick you know you know completely automated away people still have to get started on it and it's this I people get started and they play and then understand well this worked on my laptop when I was at where the digital there was 35,000 cause of execution in the render farm and it worked on my desktop where shorthand for I just blew up the farm because I didn't think about exactly what it was to run that as a thousand notes at the time and in a similar story with databases right if it works on my desktop on my laptop how they're going to then work six months later on a 16 node cluster doing a million ops a second that's the stuff that the experience teaches you and we want to get that information to you as soon as we can because it's it's easier to learn the beginning than fix a mistake expert advice the brain from all the brains the collective brains of knowledge from data stocks right right for you that experience right there on your fingertips my I think my record is a gigabyte that somebody put into a set and that didn't exactly go too well for them Patrick have you got a record on that one yeah I actually had someone created database of a database with a map and not it was over again but it was pretty impressive how they figured out how to make it a database inside of a database and you know it's one of those things where it's it's there it is not illegal it's just it's a bad idea and but this kind of tool is like well in this is why which is so much better than me say I know my trends in the 90s laugh at me because I generated HTML in the sequel to have a transaction and then return that out to serve on a web page so it's easy to go and get carried away and I can understand stupid human tricks we do every day it's good fun and will and what we've got here was the ability to expand this out I mentioned earlier one of the things that we think about when we're talking about being consistently successful is what happens when new features come along those materialized views they come along they work in some situations not so well in others there might be new indexing technology usually find hyatt all the new things to come along will battle test those as we always do and understand the best wait but previously that communication this patrick said was webinars and training materials and blog posts and reading and you never knew if it applied to you because you had to go out and look for it what we're gonna do here is say hey there's another way to do this you know this is a frozen set I think that we looked at so letting people understand hey you don't have to freeze all of your collection types you did in when they were first created you don't have to asked her a certain version new changes like that is the stuff we can push out every day and also when talking about education and continual learning of and that experience that comes with working with Cassandra I mean vector is really putting the Y right right there for you so that you can take that and and build on that because you can you can't optimize if you don't if you don't understand why something is happening in the first place yeah and as I get older I fall asleep more so keeping it to sort of contextualise it's something I need to know now and it's you know five to ten minute reader I'll stay awake for that okay so we've looked now at some configuration we've looked at some security we've looked at some schema a little bit something that until a couple of weeks ago Patrick didn't even know existed and we have to thank a guy called Radovan who worked at the cassandra team at spotify worked at TLP now works at data stacks he's level of expertise was it brought this one to our attention a couple of years ago and it's yeah it's a complicated story and I'm probably not going to do it great justice if you look at the blog post on Danis Dexcom that we wrote for the announcement we link to the blog post there on the last pickle that renovating wrote a couple of years ago to explain this but it's a relationship between the maxint window configuration setting which controls when the node goes down how long will we continue to collect hints for the GC gray seconds which you may know from it's kind of starring rollers when you delete data this is the minimum amount of time it stays before compaction is able to purge it it also has a secondary role when we collect hints this is the time to live for the hints and they will not be replayed after this expires so we'll pull them off disk still when we see that node come back up but then we'll drop them won't send them back and have those two things interact that's one story and then there's another one which is about has to do with the time to live if you have a default TTL on your table you also want to get those that information around so that it can if I write something with a default TTL that I previously didn't or maybe had some data then either the default TTL now I do it right that second right that I've done needs to eventually overload you know shadow as we call it internally the first right and make sure that that original value is gone but if we don't deliver those hints because it timed out that's not going to happen so we've got three variables we need to adjust and we need to look at and we kind of want to do this every time we look at the data model and that's even when you know this stuff this is the thing you should be automating because you won't remember to look at a 60 table key space and check every table dad is what blew me away is like this is the kind information that is what I would call hiddenly critical and it's it's not an everybody problem but it's units of nature of a distributed system and a complex system like Cassandra that should be somewhat automated with a tool like vector because it's just it's not enough capacity for me to remember every little detail about a database and man this is this is the game changer part of vector is it really makes this kind of stuff easy and how did that happen and just blows me away and there are times legitimately when you may reduce GC GRA seconds I think I'm glad of operators when you're having those horrible tombstone problems and we also check for that the standard operating procedure is hey drop you GC grey seconds so that those tombstones now you've adjusted your workload then you're not generating tombstones need to get the old ones off drop the GC grey seconds push your compaction a bit faster a bit harder so that it purges all those tombstones and then brings it back up there's some legitimate reasons you may want to do it do you understand all the implications and now you're making an informed decision and then you know what you should be keeping an eye on during that phase where you're doing it or have you just accidentally stumbled across something because you didn't fully understand all the implications of GC grace so this one here we've discovered this it's actually in a an old table in Reaper I'll have a chat to Alex around Reaper and just letting know yeah the things we've looked at we've got looked at the matching window from configuration that we've looked at that table here we see the default TTL and GC grey seconds for the hundred and twenty seconds this one here we're recommending hey we can increase our GC gray seconds we've got the exact setting to use change the default TTL and there's a there's two two parts to this problem where it could be you don't have a default TTL but you do have the GC gray seconds less than the max hint window and in that case we want you to change the max in but here that's not an issue so we said it's not applicable we don't need to do that Aaron where where is vector looking to get all of this information where does it pull the info problem so the agent said sits in there and listens to how Cassandra is used collects data and sends it and we want to make sure you understand what we're doing to make that decision so it's this configuration setting should have some help on this hopefully around what that is and that the table settings here and we use that to make our decision and hopefully then you know as you're going through this you're learning in the same way as if you were sitting next to myself or Patrick and we were doing a one-on-one day the modeling course with you and working through it okay so we've looked at what if we looked at we've looked at some simple configuration things looked at some security things we've looked there that steamer and data modeling and some sort of advanced expert level caches that will that we find out there in the field look at how they can work together and to give you a good understanding hopefully and on-the-job training and you know day to day training and that there's some nice eye candy that helps you identify which tables are the most critical for you to look at so I'd like to do now just drop out of my demo and we'll just look at what those benefits are so I think there's four parts here we've got the automated advice and those customized fixes to help you learn and help you keep your systems performance and available we've got continuous updates from data stacks and we don't I think we really pushed on this enough but as I said in the beginning we continually will codify our best experience and expertise using algorithms and heuristics and then we can push those and test that against every node that in vector whether you're in the cloud or on Prem with the best intentions if we find something in the you know as we're testing a new feature we can't pick up the phone and speak to every customer and just ask them to go out and check every key space and cluster they've got well we can do that with vector we've got some nice hands-off management so you can look at aggregated the information across your cluster you could look at some opinionated monitoring to give you ideas of throughput latency and load the focus bottles to bring all that together to look at schemer and configuration and there's a history of the changes of those things as well and then together this helps us build skill so we're looking to build skills for developers and operators at all levels across your whole team and as we do that we hope that it improves everyone's abilities but it also means that the experts in your organization spend less time firefighting as we're catching things early and it gives them more time to make new things rather then fix the old things so with that it's like to remind you if you go that data stacks comm and find more information and there's a sign-up form there that you can use to learn more as we go through the be the process and we're looking for those great customers out there enterprises and users have really interesting problems Patrick over here I was gonna say I hope we have Cassandra backing up that web forum because I'm sure it's getting killed right now because I come on if you're if you don't want to use vector then you probably don't to use Cassandra right and it's great to have the old team back together again Aaron and Patricia I mean is this just is a great bit of a nostalgia for me too I mean we've been doing this for a while right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna dive into some questions so these are questions that were submitted and I think you got everyone's attention so let's take a look at these um let's see here all right first and foremost Aaron so who and my company would benefit from using vector it says for operators developers or managers I'm gonna go with everyone Patrick developers yes yes and I think I can stand by that for developers we've got schema advice and my big thing is that developers need to know more about how computers work and operators need to know more to make applications catching it with developers early on and letting them understand schema being able to do a performance test and understand how that's impacting and get vector to give you some advice on that as you're in going through your different stages of development there if you've got the QA or a lower production environment catching it there for operators being able to walk up and understand what's important in a cluster straight away with the advice or with focus bubbles and then for managers here a lot of the time when we speak to decision-makers and managers they're worried about do we have the right skills to drive this thing I keep hearing it's complicated and what progress are we making all right well I'll be getting better mmm and vector helps us understand if we're getting better by with just taking off that list we're giving giving everyone the list and checking it twice and picking it off so I think it's gonna help everyone every organization yeah okay you know Patricia I I'm gonna drag you into this queue because you're your consultant with Cassandra is this something you're gonna who you're gonna recommend this to you could say the same well my answer is the same of everyone really can benefit from from using this and from from an operator perspective I mean having having this expert advice and knowledge right there at your fingertips is something that is is really a game changer to help people learn how to use Cassandra learn how Cassandra works as as they're doing it so this is something that if you use Cassandra in any way you want to be using vector you'll you are going to want the help from vector cool I agree with it so this question how do we secure the data I'm assuming that's the data that's going into vector maybe that will just say that okay so well yeah but what about that really sensitive around that we make sure when we're collecting convicts we don't touch you know part of that Cassandra yeah Mel file has some passwords and paths even just to key store files we don't catch those we don't collect the logs either because we don't control what goes in to a log line anybody you can write a log message in the code base and there are logged messages that are useful that come out that say this table has a really big growth and here's the partition key for that now that partition key is your user data and we don't want to capture that we don't catch we might catch the exception type but not the message description because we're again we don't control that and somebody could put something in there that's useful if you are inside the firewall debugging we don't want to take any of your user data around so the agent is sensitive there we take the data we uploaded via HTTP we encrypt it on the wire we encrypt at rest inside the vector system and we disassociate it as a bit from your customer you know we make sure that we don't store that it's you know Bob's travel company comm with every piece of day that we disassociate it so that it's just against the token if we keep that information elsewhere all right that's a great answer I'm sure that's exactly what they wanted to hear not like no no we got it all that would be another cloud provider hmm anyway so does the agent so assuming this has an agent in it but does the agent impact mode performance and I'm pretty sure that's someone who has experience with something like an obscene or even well any anything that really inquires an agent that can cut when they go off the rails it's bad yeah spending nine years helping people run systems around the world a lot of as we designed this was what would make me recommend that somebody should uninstall it so with many the agent as as unintrusive as we can sometimes when you hear Java agent people think about a a new relic or in that dynamics that instruments the JVM intermediate language we don't do that we're in there there are other agents or in running inside your you Cassandra process as I said we had somebody run it for ten months they didn't know that anything knows anything we've done performance tests and we haven't found any impact and the Asia itself has a lot of bunch of code in there that is hey if I think I've just raised an error and I'm going to capture my own errors it shuts itself down and there also is code in there to make sure that it's not keep on trying to do the same thing again and again so we've been very sensitive to no performance yeah I think that's that's a good answer to because there is that is a common problem okay so I think this is a great question because this I think this is on a lot of people's minds so is this software as-a-service central somewhere or do I can I reuse this on Prem I think that probably goes back to the security question a bit so what's the answer there because we know that there are some organizations that they need to keep things inside their firewall or inside their legal jurisdiction that they need to own it so it's a cloud multi-tenant cloud service we just install the agent it's one jar and one config file and the ocean say that agent it's the same jar for DSE and cassandra and for every version that we support you don't have to change it just because you are great your system we put in a bunch of effort to make sure that was the case so when you're running on cloud simple install and you're away if you're running on it's kubernetes install and with these are some of our early beta customers are large corporates and we're testing that out on Prem together the installed wheel of kubernetes as you know you know the kubernetes operator will love we're giving there we're living there as well by making systems that run kubernetes that is so I keep saying it's good answer but that's the correct answer it runs in a love it it's the best thing that's that's gonna make a lot of operators happy okay so round you know there's obviously some some great stuff in here for open source Cassandra but what about DFC does the support due to stacks enterprise and some of the advanced workloads the different parts and does it do mixed workloads how does it handle that yeah so the last three months of being getting up to speed and getting it integrated into DRC we support the 5x and the 6x versions of DAC mentioned going as we're going through that demo if we had deity running there you see that is another menu item you can look at your combined the state do you see in Cassandra or separate it out as DLC and Cassandra we have not built any new rules for the advanced workload parts graph search analytics we've got some rules specifically for the core do you see your thread per core and that type of thing but we will work on those systems we don't give specific advice for those advanced were close yet okay and this is probably based on the question I around the thing or I was saying it's not just another time series chart but none there's a question what about that is there history can we do time range on charts no yet but we really really want to I keep on having to stop the developers from doing it so we can build build some other things we keep a 30-day history 30-day rolling window and we also understand what the most recent values there are the charts at the moment are static as in what it's like now or what it was for a one-day trend and but we are really excited this is the bit that the developers are keep on wanting to do is hey can we go and animate those focus bubbles and show how things changed over the last day or week or months that's what we want to do its own yeah time series again this opinionated yeah this opinionated a big just like your own little TED talk right you can be there do a presentation and show how this little table kind of went up to the top and went red so yes we want to get the time series on there when but in this opinionated monitoring way that we're not looking to build an ad hoc kind of monitoring platform what we're looking to do is what makes sense for a developer and then operator if Cassandra that would be really awesome TED talk how I as a single operator ran a 10,000 ode cluster blah blah blah cute graph thank you for attending my TED talk happen some limited audience for that one it's maybe a TEDx maybe it has to be at a Bex yeah sure [Music] alright so I think this is a this is a question that probably has a funny story behind it funny not so funny story but what about supporting checks for certificate expiration yeah if you can help me out tell me the story and the question cuz I know this is a good one not yet but we built the model built the engine so that as we're working through our with our great teams on support and engineering we've got I think eight different security things were looking at at the moment do you have your own node to node encryption enabled do you have your client-server encryption enabled and you know do you have your role based access set up properly quite enough indication all that type of stuff the next thing is okay that's kind of running stories like this hey we found that someone once had this issue they had a ten modal cluster or whatever yeah it's how long did they set the expiry on that certificate and think that'll be someone else's problem right this thing won't run for five years five years we imagine the database for anything for that long in the cassette early days of Cassandra that's just the sort of thing that we start to add on there is how do we how do we sensitively key answer there the information off the agent though we were doing that in the trust model take that back and and let you know how you've got some certificates or they were going to expire and we're able to add that as on the fly and then push that out to you you know I'm just thinking of our good friend in your community Carlos Rolo who's given a couple of talks on Cassandra archaeology where the poor guy as a consultant has found some of the oldest running clusters on the planet like last year his record was a 1.0 like something cluster yeah and yeah it happens all the time yeah well looks like we're out of time and there are more questions but um you know just that's cool we will we'll pull those out we usually do a really good job of you know following up the questions but I mean I really want to thank you Aaron for this pretty incredible demo I mean I I hope people are clicking on the sign up right away in Patricia it's always great to be in another webinar with you're just hanging out thanks for being a data snacks that's this has been a really really good day for bringing back the old team to talk about what the new team is gonna do so um thank you everyone and we'll see you at the next webinar thank you thank you",
