    "text": "let's do this people hello everyone around the world everyone who wants to do anoun transaction with cassander you're in the right place today so hi I'm Patrick mcen you may know me from various cassander pieces of content I've talked about asset transactions for a long time with Cassandra today is hands on everyone ready for this I don't know it's coming ready or not so let's just get rolling with this whole topic um and I I can't can't start without saying this um get it you know we've been talking about asset transactions with Cassandra for a long time so probably five years I think is when it's been the or even more but um it's it's been a long time and for good reasons this is not something trivial this is probably the biggest change to Cassandra ever and uh for also for good reasons it needed to happen but we didn't take it lightly as a project um we we could throw you know we could throw things over the fence and see what happens and sure it may not work and you'll never want to use it again and we don't want that we need and let's re review just who the users are of Cassandra the people building Cassandra are the people Us in Cassandra we're building things for ourselves and others and when you think about asset transactions it's not because we say oh we did a poll and that's what everybody wanted no there's a real need for it we get it um the largest users of Cassandra around the world could use this feature and to use it means that it needs to be stable it needs to be useful um it needs to have use cases that are actually legitimate and probably and and this is where we are in 2025 and welcome to 2025 is that databases are starting to we're consolidating databases and I believe this many others do that conser is one of the databases you can consolidate to but one of the blockers is the transaction qualities that you expect on if you're going to shrink your database portfolio you need to make sure that you have every bit of features that you need for all of those use cases and asset transactions is just one of those so it's coming so that that's why we're here today so let's move in so before we start I want you to have this this is I created a really cool repo for you and uh John Hadad helped me out with this those of you who John is Rusty Razer Blade Consulting um we talked about this but this is a I'm giving you this link right now so you can go there um do a get clone because this has got all the resources you need and I'm going to walk through it and what it is it'll give you all the resources you need specifically how to set up a dock image and that sort of thing but um I just want you to have this link um if you want to follow along check this out and start you can follow along in the repo here so this is the Hands-On portion of this um and here's the warning right this isn't even Alpha code this is in a branch this is Yolo code um and it's not really YOLO there's a lot happening there that's it's it's actually being used in certain places for reasons because you know we want to make sure that it works in production but this is in a branch this is uh the part of the C15 branch and so I've T what I've done is I've taken that Branch built it turned it into a Docker image there's going to be bugs when I was building this uh this repo I found bugs I reported those bugs I created jurus um there's going to be missing features like hey that should be there all good there is a reason I want you to access to this right now and this is the reason is why why why do I say hey Cassandra Community get your hands on to this because there's some really important things that need to happen now um this will be in the next version of Cassandra uh we we've been talking about 5.1 but I think that we're we're going towards this will be a 6.0 release because it's is so big and you get a chance to really shape a feature for the next 10 years in Cassandra and I'm not kidding this will be the next 10 years of Cassandra that feedback is really important and the feedback is trying it trying some data models trying some use cases and saying will this work this didn't work and uh I think in terms of syntax of you know syntax is still on the table you know this is not a completely baked feature yet if there's a specific syntax that needs to be in there Now's the Time to change it because you don't want to change the AP after you release it um so if there's syntax issues or there's a thing inside the syntax that needs to be there that isn't this is the time to get that Feb back um and also speak the more eyes we have on this the better there is no QA team in the Cassandra project it's us and I've been acting as Q8 for this for a while so this is helpful to get faster with this um and then you know as I said this is this is our preparation this is going to change the way casser works for the next 10 years years or more it's a substantial change U and being doing this together and like going up that hill together that picture show is important Cassandra's always been um a database that has been built by the community and we we fit those really crazy use cases that everyone is using Cassandra for well because we talk to each other now how do you give that feedback as you're going through examples as you're trying new things uh I have a I use the GitHub discussions in the awesome cord repo and I have a few things in here I have one for bug reports and that's just the simple thing here is if you run into a bug uh just try to explain what you were doing like hey here's the data model here's some of the data that I was using so we can reproduce it and then the stack Trace stack Trace is probably the most important thing we can see exactly what broke um stack Trace will be in the system log um when you're running the docker container you can um you can use the log command to look at the log tail the log um bug reports would probably be really important well what I reason I'm doing it here in N the cassander jira is I think we're gonna have a lot of the same ones and this is more of a triage situation so you know this is going to be high volume I I would imagine so uh we'll do the high volume move it over from U move those bugs that are uh that need to be a jira I'll be happy to put those as jeras and give you credit for it um but you know this is a triage system because it is such an alpha pre-alpha setup um there's also then hands it's like hey this this is cool but I would like to do it like this way or here's a change that I'd like to see we would love to hear that um people working on a cord right now they would love to see this too and this is a great way to organize that uh just questions hey does this work or why does work or what questions they have a question thing and then excuse me is the time of year um use cases I think that will be one of the best contributions because as we you know you go to a conference and people are talking about a new thing new feature new database whatever um the part that makes it interesting for you is the use case like here's what I did with it because a lot of times when we're trying out new things we want to say is it similar to the thing that I want to do or can I modify it or is it exactly the same thing I want to do probably one of the best things you can share with Community is your use case and what I hate hearing because it's not true is that oh no everyone else is doing this too no I I hate to say it but you're a snowflake because even if you're doing the exact same thing oh you're using it for user management I bet you're doing it a little bit differently than everybody else and sharing those youth cases is really critical I know a lot of you work at places that um are not so Sher okay uh but if can just you know just a simple thing putting it into a GitHub repo and say hey this is what I use Cassandra for this is what I use Accord for really helpful but I would love this is my my hey help me make this better I would love it if you have a use cases example is create a PR for this awt you'll get credit your friends will love you um You probably get a raise from your boss there'll be out ofation who knows could be a lot of things right but more importantly your peers will think you're cool because you'll be an expert at a court it's probably really the best reason to do it all right so that's kind of the setup right um this is a cool place for us to be I love that we're here because we're actually doing things we're not just talking about it we're doing it so get your hands in there and get dirty so what do we get so in the repo you have a local version and a cloud version the local version is using Docker or if you use some other thing it's a Docker image it's a Docker Hub um and then easy C laab and if you're not familiar with easy Cas lab it's a open source project uh John Hadad he has some videos on it but essentially what it is it lets you set up a a Cassandra cluster in Amazon very easily so we have two options here and if you want to set up a cluster in a cloud it's very easy um if you're want to do it locally that's your jam you have those choices doing the Dockers I made simple the scripting is all in there to make this easy for you to use and and the reason I wanted to make easy for you to use is if you want to just take a quick glance at it it's easy it take you five minutes if uh you want to dig in deep plenty to go into um but the most basic thing is just doing a darker pull you do a darker pull here's the repo pck fat and Cassandra Accord and once it's in there you do a Docker run it has a the docker file set up correctly or the docker Bild is set up correctly um so it'll set up Cassandra inside of it with that version and then you can use a Docker exec to run cqlsh and if you want to do things interactively um if you want to run there's some scripts and I'll go into those about like if you just want to run a script and have it watch it do a transaction and say you can do that too the uh the important thing here though is that it is uh it is built now I did create I I do have the docker build files if you want to build your own um if you have your own special build you want to do cool I I made the code all available in the repo um so you know pick your adventure do you want to make it complicated or you want to make it easy there's something there for everybody um and I wanted it just so that you could have it to get your hands on and in however you want to participate I've also included three uh three use case examples which are probably the most like the number ones like people ask about all the time um the classic you know these are all the examples directory banking is probably the one that everyone talks about even though no one I don't think a lot of banks actually use asset transactions but um not for this kind of thing but whatever um so but we have banking Inventory management and inventory manager is probably the most interesting one that I think I think it's the uh when we rewind I think that's the most interesting use case because of just how a cord works and the things that it opens up crazy and it's not just inventories how it does counters and updates and things like that um and in each one of the example directories there's a setup.sh and what it'll do is it'll run the docker image load all the data and give you the ability to just then do everything um interactively if you want to but it sets it all up and I'll walk through it at the end here I'll do a little demo live demo well hopefully that'll work so let's let's uh let's just walk through those use cases as a review I'm gonna do I'm gonna so this is what I'm going to do I'm gonna walk through the use cases um and I'm going to show you like what what we're trying to accomplish with the use cases and then I'm G to uh walk through some basics of the Syntax for a chord just as a review and then I'm going to do live demo show you how it works and then you can set free to go get crazy on it um Alexander Great question about uh about what this does is this for production I'm gonna rewind of that warning sign do not put this in production this is no I I'll say that but I know somebody's going to so you know when you do let us know um this is this is pre-alpha software and this is for experimentation and learning um I like I said though my experience in the Cassandra Community I know people whove put some of the sketchiest stuff in production and that make it work I mean they're G to put the time in they're like here's my exact use case and it works perfectly for that and I'm fine with it it's open source go for it man just have fun and Alexander when you do put it in production I expect to see a use case pop into my V that'll be a PR I'm looking for so let's go through some of these use cases um the transaction is the the one that I think a lot of people just in general it's this moving data from one table to another one exclusively with order um and in under massive contention um so whatever one that it is Oscars can point Friday right on man that's that's what I love about this YOLO this community is amazing um so Financial transactions kind of things that we were trying to do embody that problem statement where we're trying to move data from one table to another this is multi-partition not something Cassandra's done really well or at all with without putting some guard rails around it this gives you tons of guard rails for free basically you can move those you can move data from one to the other and know that it's being done exclusively full acid all the all four letters are present as well as the high concurrency and concurrency is probably the biggest problem with asset transactions especially in a cassander cluster cassander clusters rarely sit there bored they're usually getting hammered by e-commerce or consumer applications that sort of thing so concurrency was one of the biggest constraints that we had to work with but it has to be a highly concurrent asset transaction system so banking that's one of them the other one is Inventory management and the inventory management is a is a embodies this problem of counting um if you've ever used Cassandra counters you know that they're fun to use but impossible to work with and they're not they're not absolute not even by stretch but uh what is it and this is a problem that's been hard to solve with almost every database is how do I make sure that I can take my inventory to zero even like on a you know a Black Friday scenario or something like that you know where everybody's clicking a link or um a fire sale the Thundering Herd problem I want to take it to zero but also um what happens if I want to have a maximum as well so this you can now control more of what the application is going to throw you from the database level so controlling the Min and Max around counts and having super accurate counts under high concurrency under high contention big deal and then finally um we have um you're in here on purpose okay just make it sure I heard Michelle show up and I'm like uh oh did I did my live stream die now she's embarrassed sorry Michelle Michelle's our our producer in the back unless everyone give her a hand she is a trooper she does like dozens of these a weeks and yes you'll get the slides ATI no problem matter of fact I'm going to put those in the how about that all right after I'm done of course um I'll even post this video in the repo as well so uh the batch batch consensus um yeah this is user management thing but it's also like making changes to multiple tables at the same time and knowing that you're doing this exclusively in order and has some timing the if you um we have to do some you probably have to go back and look at one of my previous uh presentations and I'll put that in the repo as well but like what why does a chord work how does it work that's probably some background if you haven't seen any of my multiple conversations I didn't want to do it today because it's just repeated information there's nothing new there but it's probably worth going back and looking at it and I'll make sure you have the link for that in the repo okay so how do you do an asset transaction I will do a review on this because this is going to save your your time um when you're now that you could actually do this I want you to do it with confidence and uh this is really new syntax for cql so the transaction syntax is about the boundaries so there's a begin transaction and a commit transaction no these are not interactive so that you don't get a roll back that's one of my first questions and I'd put it at the bottom here but I should put it at the top because I always get that question no rollbacks yet we're on our way um like I said this is changing cassander for the next 10 years prepare yourself um what's going to come with this I have no idea I can tell you that with consolidation in mind and thinking about bringing every database to Cassandra think of all the syntax and apis that would be would benefit from ads to transactions there you go so uh the transaction syntax everything so the the guarantee is that everything happens or doesn't so everything inside of that and there's a lot of things that can happen inside of it and we'll go through it um the statements are isolated all the mutations are Atomic this is this is the important part of the trans action boundary the state collection is somewhat unique and I know there are other databases that do this but what you're doing is and this is an important setup is you're Gathering State the current state of a particular like a column of data and with some condition so for instance like how many how many items do I have in you know in my product catalog right now and when you do that it it locks that that that amount and it creates an exclusivity around that so that you know that you're not for instance when you're doing counting you can't go past zero you know that whenever I say tell me the current count and it's 10 you know it's 10 from until that transaction is completed um it's useful when we get to the if statement and I'll get to that in a minute but this is this is you'll see this in the examples quite a bit and this is what it's about it's collecting current state the return value is what is I want to know what it was before I changed it and um this is an important piece of syntax it probably you know this is one for you to evaluate like guess it's useful um I think we already have heard feedback that it'd be good to see the before and after change like did it happen and what did it change to um so that's one thing that um is probably already out there but you you take a look at it you let us know this is probably my favorite part of this is the if state and this just opens up so many cool interesting use cases it can do a conditional test and when I say conditional test I mean that it says if a certain State again like a count if you know the count is greater than zero then and then in the if statement you have update insert deletes and so it's that conditional that sets up some logic inside but also gives you the boundaries you can do boundary checking you can do state checking it could do null not null so for instance if you want to make sure that you're you're creating something that doesn't exist there you go if you are trying to modify something that does exist there you go so it if there's a false condition in the if statement so the count is say less than zero or zero then it won't run the the statements inside the statement so um that's that's gives you a lot of really cool control right there boom and um something that's never been available and the update uh condition the update has new syntax as well um when when we actually I'll I'll show you an exact example um of how that works but so this is the general syntax now I'm GNA walk through a specific probably the one that's the most popular is the bank transaction because how many meetings have I've been in like oh well you can't do a bank transaction with Cassandra it sucks no it doesn't but now you can so now does it not suck yeah you've been in those meetings too if you're in the cander community well you can go back and say Told You So Bank transaction set up let's just's do a little uh walk through of what that looks like and this example is in the repost so you can I'm walking you through one example we can see the rest later but essentially what you were doing is just sending them an account table one table and a couple of different account holders or Bob and Alice are are people that love to move money and they each get a hundred units of money um Bongo bucks I don't know but the you know this is a basic setup but what we're going to do is we're going to do some some exclusive transactions so we begin the transaction with the begin transaction I'm getting the from balance from Alice because we're moving money from Alice to Bob and we say okay so what how much money is in Alice's account so and this will be important for like trying to make sure that we don't overdraft Alice um and I want to collect that account balance so I could see what it was before I moved the money um then here's here's the the really cool part is the so now what I'm looking at is I'm saying okay does the account balance is it greater than or equal to 20 because I'm going to move 20 bucks now with with parameterization and things like that these are things that are you know we can add parameters in there do buying statements that sort of thing um when we create the transactions itself from code and that'll be the next Frontier by the way for me is not just showing you how to do it interactively on cqlsh is doing inside of a python or Java spring you know whatever you're going to use um everyone's using rust now so let's do it in Rust um so but doing it inside a code that's actually useful and not just having to write cql every day um and so in this in this if statement we're looking to see if Alice has 20 bucks or more than 20 bucks so if we move $20 to Bob then we don't overdraft Dallas's account but check this out that update statement is different because that's not the normal Syntax for an update statement at Cassandra we've changed things to have an increment or decrement so you can have minus equal plus equal think of all the things you can do with that now that is a replacement solid replacement for Cs and it is exclusive it's an asset transaction so when you do plusus 20 um or plus equal 20 um minus equal 20 and you do it together both of those change immediately so from an observer outside you'll see both those accounts changed simultaneously and that money got moved under concurrent workload so there is and it is a linear and serializable transaction remember this is one of things about a cord that is changing the way we do distributed transactions and then I'm going to mention this because we're doing Bank transactions Accord is going to be the only distributed database transaction that is strictly serializable no other database transaction in a distributed system is at that level and not spanner not not cockroach not Aurora none of them they they're back in just serializable or linearizable we've we've Leap Frog record is a brand new consensus protocol does that mean that they'll probably adopt a chord probably but you get it first in cassander tidb nope because TB when you do a distributed transaction uses distributed TPC which is not strictly serializable um good question though um and it's just because of the the consensus protocols that were built are mostly around binding two paxos domains with with a uh Two-Face commit and that just that aspect eliminates the strict serializability which is kind of a problem um but it's exciting because we're this is why we're excited about it because this is a new way of thinking about consensus protocols it has computer scientists happy um so okay so we have a got a good question here Alexander with a great questions what differs a tupal from the ordinary list variable where each sub element is record in the field or field of record that's a good question I think I do think that you would have to do two dotted notation and that's worth trying Alexander why don't you give it a shot and see what it does um that's a good question I haven't tried that and welcome to The Cutting Edge I think it would probably do a double dotted so you dot dot so you would you would have the subelement after the sub element of the Tuple um I'm gonna try that though okay so when we commit all this happens at once Good Times okay so that concludes the slide portion of this let's go into the really scary part of it and actually do this everyone ready for this I'm G stop sharing real quick um yeah let's see here yep here we go live the live got now you can see my entire background yep all right GNA move over to a window here now I want to make sure when I switch over um how's the font size everyone um I'm just got to make sure hopefully it made it readable um yeah good got some thumbs thank you um by the way if you haven't downloaded this command the tree command it is awesome the tree command is um no it's not an orange Sila that is a a Rango or I'm sorry that's a Argo CD so that's like the Argo project you know for um cicd in kubernetes no all right see look he's very happy that you have a green light on your cicd pipelines um so I got I got that uh because I wrote a book on kubernetes and data so there you go Shameless plug and that I I talked about Argo quite a bit in there and they they gave me a little stuffy how cool um so if you have if you have not used the tree command it's awesome because instead of just doing LS which gives you the directory um the tree command actually gives you a nice tree diagram of what's in there so this is um this is the osac cord repo sitting on my on my laptop um and go back to the tree and you can see like there's some examples in here um the uh this is has all those examples in there so what we're going to do is I'm going to do I'm going to go into examples I'm going to go into the banking example now inside here I have let's keep using our treat command um we have a read me that describes those things that you can do there's also a few cql files four cql files and there's the the schemas that uh sets up the actual schema so if I was a schema that sets up the actual scheme is file so it's it creates a keyspace creates a table just like the one you saw except the keyspace isn't KS it's banking um and that lets you run the rest of things like you can insert the sample data then you could actually run a transfer and um you could do a verify the transfer if you want to do each one of those manually that's to totally cool uh but I have the setup.sh file which is there and let's look at look at real quick hold on I should say more than that um it does all the commands you need it to do it starts to dock container it waits where to go and then it loads the schema loads the sample data and then it gives you a happy little hey we're done so let's do that so it's starting the container and um it only should since I've already downloaded it it shouldn't take too long to start um firing up a Cassandra container is essentially just waiting for it to stabilize and a single node it's pretty fast so less than you know 30 seconds a minute um but the the script is looping and waiting for um waiting for it to be able to connect to cqlsh at least it should um whenever whenever I'm running this it's it's running you can use like Docker desktop or something like that to see if it actually is running um make sure that it is but if you there's also a Docker command inside the docker directory if you want to use a Docker compose and create a small cluster um looks like it stopped do I have a bug already come on it's just waiting yeah this is why I don't do live demos come on I know now I'm getting all the laughs [Laughter] thanks I'd like to say that it wasn't this but it was yeah I that's great so while while I was doing that I'm going to kill this thing H there we go see this is this is why all right let's I'm gonna retry this again you can laugh at me go ahead I'm the one who's like who's all like hey I think I'll do a live demo all right we're gonna try this again Watch What Happens starting a container why is it not starting is a question time to go to Docker desktop I think part of it is that now I'm trying to create the schema you got to be kidding me hold on now we're going to do this the old fashioned way stop the screen screen share and I'm going to look at my doer desktop and see why it broke oh Docker crash folks yeah I know this is where everyone's going to tell me I should stop using Docker right um yeah hold on restarting maybe Docker doesn't like to work with my uh yeah no surprise I know right Oscar um it's uh so what is everyone using right now instead of Docker I'm just curious I've heard I've heard there's there's options out there container D Etc um it might also not be happy with the fact that I'm doing a screen share and a podman okay um yeah I think I should probably switch to podman then but it might also be happy with my screen sharing right now uh which of course all right so it's a okay so it is crashed all right if I can get this thing started I'm just gonna leave this as a uh exercise left for the user but we'll get it going welcome to my this is like this is what live streaming is like on Twitch like I don't know what I did wrong but I'm just going to rerun this command again there we go it's starting back up again start it yeah I don't think it's very happy with the stream screen sharing bare metal yeah I should have done bare metal you know what I really should have done is moved it to the cloud right um and then everyone would have gave me like that cloud business like yeah you should move to Cloud well yeah is is this Mite 880 still functional well yes it is M of fact it's running CPM right now probably more reliably than my dock or desktop um it's a it's a replica if you can tell it's missing about 18 feet um so um yeah looks like Docker is not going to play well with my um with my streaming setup so that's just the way it's going to be so this is now you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to attach the I'm going to do a live where I'm gonna take a video of me actually doing this attached to this video and put it on YouTube because with live streaming I can't run Docker Docker shuts down um I just found out what it was yeah so it's not able to connect to the socket with the live stream running okay fine so there will not be a live demo there will be a unceremonious end I will take some questions right now if you have some I saw some good ones out there um and if you want to talk about M 880s or retro computers that's a different Channel um so yeah any questions out there leave scroll through here Oscar can we update thousands of transactions at the same time using batches um the the transaction Syntax for for a chord should supered the batch in that regard um now if when you say thousands it shouldn't be something that you're like none of these are exclusive they're just I just want to do it all at the same time that's a different problem you probably shouldn't even be using a batch to do that but if you have uh like three tables that need to be updated at the same time but you need to do it a thousand times you can Loop the batch itself and that use a core transaction for that batches in general for Cassandra are pretty bad because of the way that batches work in a distributed system it's not just a cassander problem because what you're doing is you're shoving all of those mutations onto a single coordinator and letting it figure it out um it's because you're in a distributed system and those keys are probably distributed across multiple servers it's much better to do to use like parallel parallel insert or parallel batching in your own code because it's much faster and that's just a general use case um for any kind of distributed system but um yeah so I I I would look at what you're trying to do um if you have questions about like an exact example I mean put it in the Discord discussion I'd love to see it and we can talk about it there um the tupal is immutable um but you wouldn't be yeah so bar you're right it is mutable but that's part of that let syntax is that it grabs the current state and there is no mutation that's going to happen to that state so there you go and you're correct and also yes that's how a cord works with that um yeah psql peel sill yep um that's gonna be a thing that uh it's starting we're trying to avoid this turning this into a um into like a a code block you know where you can run arbitrary code inside of an asset transaction but it does have a it's going that direction just for the transactionality and having the update commands work and having an if block um I don't know how much more I've already proposed that we have a way to assign variables for instance if you wanted to assign one U ID for the entire transaction have it like how to be able to grab a current like an a uid to use in the early part of the transaction so yeah this is look like PLS Co all over again but I don't think we're going to go to full like you can't build an app with it um asset support in Astra oh yeah it's coming um when and I think that you what you're going to see is right now so here's the time frame um right now asset transactions in Cassandra are a branch so but that branch is going to be um G to be merged hopefully this month um into Mainline trunk and that that's a huge step in any open source project is when you have when it's in trunk that's that's the main line to the next release and so U that's that's being worked on right now once it gets into the trunk um that's we we'll start we'll start evaluating it to like how we want to bring it to Astra of course you know it's going to be how far along an an alpha it is more than likely we will participate in the beta much like we've done with other bet is where we make a beta version of aord transactions available in Astra um and be very clear about this like if you you could click this button if you want a beta version of asset transactions but with all the warnings um and that that's been really useful for the project because it makes it easy for people to go try it and we get a lot of great feedback um so I I I think that that's probably something that will happen when uh next few months and just keep an eye on the prod and you know you you watch what I'm doing you can see me on LinkedIn if you're not following me on LinkedIn um that's probably a good place for that information um if uh you know if that information is available I will be talking about it and I'll be talking about it a lot cool is there any other questions in here besides how to get Docker to work with SQL streaming no all right cool performance ah thank you Oscar yes uh performance is something that the team so most of this development is happening at uh at Apple this is just full disclosure the Apple the the cord team is is almost exclusively at Apple of course they are very interested in this for lots of reasons and I'm sure you can understand why um I know they're working on the performance aspects they the last time I talked to some of the some of the people working on it they said the performance was uh was okay and what that means is that it works and um it it holds up to some load but when when I hear that I'm like okay there we're we're getting ready to do a real solid performance test and a lot of it is just because the features go in and you you run into you have like inconsistencies and how it works and then it can drive a little bit of a performance problem um meaning like oh we have a race condition or something like that that needs to be dealt with um I guarantee you performance will be top of mine on everyone's list so the goal I think is that it will shouldn't be any less performant than using lightweight transactions of course when you're doing a full asset transaction it will vary greatly on how many uh how many different uh select statements or how many different mutations you have inside of the asset transaction um we're not going to guarantee the same like if you're doing one mutation or a thousand mutations it's exactly the same that's never that's never going to be a guarantee um and as of transactions um I'll just kind of blend this into what attia was asking is um we want so this is the goal for a cord is that and this is why we didn't use spanner or raft or any of those other Calvin the reason we didn't go down the path of using an existing consensus protocol is because they didn't match up the way that Cassandra worked and so if you look at our three really important tenants with Cassandra is the linear scaling the multi-data center support just natively and the resilience like how it handles failure you can crush a container cluster and still have it be online so those three things if if those are our our tenants that we can't violate then looking at other like spanner spanner does not allow for that um Calvin does not allow for that and so you know we would have to violate the way conand works so a long way to answer your question um adou you you asked the best one which is yes right out of the box multi Data Center and low latency across multiple data centers um and that's that's just that's the part of what has to happen and um and it will be dialable and just like with Quorum you can do local Quorum you can do full Quorum you can do each Quorum there's a lot of things we want to put a lot of control in your hands and give you the choices instead of just making choices there are some things that you know if you're doing an assd transaction it's going to be assd you can't dial that back um but multi active active is definitely a big part of it but I'm glad that's a good question because it gets down to like why we're doing this why we're spending the time um yeah so the data so this is what's interesting about why asset transactions on cander work the way they do is um in a lot of times when you when you work in a distributed system and you're trying to do an ass transaction it's about how much data are you locking and so if you have a thousand node cluster do you want to lock the entire cluster to have an asset transaction well no and we know and this is the advantage we have to Sandra is we know exactly where all the data is based on token ranges so every node has a certain range of data we know exactly who they are there's another feature that's coming with a chord that I haven't talked a lot about and it's called transactional metadata and this is this is the big change that's coming with asset transactions that that you probably haven't even heard about which is we're changing the way that Cassandra works from an operation standpoint now you've heard about gossip gossip is a way that whenever you make a change it permeates throughout the cholester propagates and says hey I made a change or here's a state change or anything and it's non-deterministic it just kind of floats through the cluster and it could take you know a few seconds a few minutes sometimes it doesn't do take it takes much longer that's not good if you're going to make a schema change or something like that so transactional cluster metadata takes that assd transaction assd transaction um to the metadata in the cluster itself so for instance if you add a new node to the system you know the the guidance right now if you're working on a cassander cluster is if you need to add say 10 nodes to your cluster to scale it then you have to give like three or four minutes before between each one to let gossip settle up to let the ranges settle and now you can just say give me 10 more nodes it's a transaction and you can instantly add 10 notes um that is going to be a game changer for sure U but or you want to take it back you know 20 noes you want to scale back okay bam done well when you look at the data synchronization and large clustered asset transactions we will know exactly where it is so again limiting how many of those nodes participate in the asset transaction so if I only have three replicas only three noes we able will have to participate in that transaction and that's where the performance is that's where the the um resilience comes in and then doing in the way that we do across data center with only one mutation across to a coordinator keeps that low as well so everything we've built in Cassandra for the past 14 years is going to work for us because we've built aord around I know it's a long answer but I I love the questions because yeah we're building it for a reason all right any other questions I don't see any out there um thank you everyone for your time um sorry about the live demo I swear I will do it and I'll put it out there but really this is hands on this is your job um you can watch me type around on Docker but go do it yourself I want to hear some feedback you can follow me on LinkedIn Patrick mcfaden really easy to find me um and you know I if you look in the GitHub we have a Discord uh that we've set up against door Channel and then we also have the the GitHub discussions that I would love for you to use feedback is important bug reports are important um but yeah just let me know how things are going and welcome to the 2025 Cassandra ride this is what we're doing this year aset transactions and I cannot wait",
