    "text": "foreign [Music] [Music] myself [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] hey everybody Welcome to our weekly podcast and today this week we are very happy to have Deepak Kumar from Doc e dot AI coming and share with us um his uh product uh that is uh kind of optimized for devrel so as death row between me and Aaron we are just so excited wanting to learn more about Deepak and how he's utilizing Ai and gen AI to implement that solution so welcome Deepak thank you thank you guys uh so glad to be here thank you yeah it's good to have you on the show yeah yeah so so Mary and I originally got got to talking about about having you on after um I think you Patrick and I had been on a meeting together about the uh the bot that you wrote that's in our that's in our Discord Channel um so so yeah that's that's kind of what uh kind of what drove this uh drove this whole thing yes yes very much awesome awesome yes so yeah I'm in uh uh I have been uh in software industry now for almost 22 23 years and one of the things that uh I I really got surprised with is the amount of work developer relations team have to do and so much of work which is like context switching I mean think of a developer Advocate they answer your questions they create all kind of uh content targeted towards education okay and then uh they they at the end of the month they need to come up with some advocacy what developers are looking for yeah and on top of that uh what they're really expected to do is uh build relationship uh with the developer Community that's right and and what I realized is uh they do so much of leg work so much of context switching yeah that they don't get time to sleep they don't get kind of relaxed and uh you're right right so so in my last company uh which was more focused on email phishing and security I tried to build a small devrel program and as a Founder I try to do it myself with help of a marketing guy yeah but it was hard it was it was really hard yes and that's when I realized that uh something needs to be done we should try and take take some of the mundane work leg work uh heavy hitting heavy duty work such that you know they get to focus on more strategic things yeah and and it's that experience that I thought of a world where a developer should not be held hostage to reading documents all right yeah uh where companies don't have to pay documentation tax what I mean by that is companies today as they build more and more product they write more and more documents and those of us that need to read more and more documents yes like to reach one paragraph of information that I'm looking for I need to go read like 50 60 Pages oh yeah yeah for sure right the whole idea is how do we get that exact nugget of information just as if you could draw an image with Dal e you're able to get the technical documentation the exact nugget yeah with Doc e ah got it and and that's how I got started on this journey and along the way uh we have built Bots which are very very purpose built for Deborah teams to grow adoption yeah very cool very very I am I I like ours and uh you know and that we have in our our Discord server where uh where folks can can ask questions and and it'll come back with um you know some really good information actually like um like somebody just asked um oh yeah if we have oh what was it is it beneficial to move to AWS key spaces what are the pros and cons and you listed all those out I mean that's that's that's really good and and the thing is is there are a lot of people asking that question you know there's a lot of folks out there like oh hey there's this key spaces thing it's supposed to be Cassandra is it really Cassandra does it really you know and and that's that's really great that it was able to draw on that and uh you know give back a good response yeah yeah yeah so in fact one of the you know uh biggest challenges that we faced while building doc e was that llm's hallucinate oh right yes and Hallucination is not really a defect it's a feature yes you're right it's like your ability to say the same sentence or express the same idea in different sentences just that for technical audience many a times that could be incorrect yes right ultimately so so so far you know technical questions what we had to do on top of llms is build this layer of expert feedback and what we have done essentially is we are using AI as an assistant that means let ai go and write the first draft of an answer and then give space to support or subject matter experts to go and edit oh right yeah as you can understand you have to do it only once but subsequent times we just get the right knowledge so you know thanks to uh Patrick and Aaron and other Experts of the data Stacks Community who have adopted docky as a member of their team just as you hire a new person and you know teach them and train them and help them give them small tasks yeah observe and give them appreciation that hey you did a good job yeah right just just work with docky and after let's say 25 questions you will see it act as if it's there as a team member answering all questions for you that's very cool yeah that's really really great idea yeah that the approach yeah for me actually I'm a bit newer yeah just recently joined the team so also learning about this so this is very interesting in terms of the history behind how Taki got introduced to our con Discord community so yeah that's great very good right and and you know when when we started this it's like a slippery slope so first we just started answering questions but then it's the power of generative AI where we not only answer questions but we also started uncovering the developer pain points as to why are developers asking these questions again and again yeah and that took us in a very interesting space where I think we are uh yet to have a lot of tools to help Advocates is to uncover the voice of the community what is it that you know users are struggling with yeah that's right and what we were able to accomplish is after seeing let's say hundreds or thousands of questions over different channels like let's say discourse stack Overflow Discord or slack come up with a report and say hey here are the top five pain points your developers are struggling with and here is how you can fix it you can go create a content that exactly addresses the pain point or you can go create a better ux because your ux is is something which is like the biggest barrier to adoption yeah so uh essentially you know it's a slippery slope support uh leads to advocacy and once we precisely know where our developers are struggling we can precisely create content to address those gaps and you know just as one thing leads to another finally it chanced upon us that this whole developer relations task is around educating users is letting the world know that hey here is a new way of solving this problem yeah and what I have observed again and again as a developer the better I comprehend the technology the more I use it the better I use it right because in past if I have not understood anything and just started using it after a week I I I dropped it yeah I stopped using it right so for companies the most important thing is to ensure Engineers out there in the world which right now number I guess 25 million developers out there all you got to do is just educate them just teach them tell them that hey here is how you solve a problem using my tool and then you decide that's right the better you can educate with all the content and support the more Ardent supporter they become of your technology and then they go and advertise they go and tell everyone hey use this this is how this works and I'm loving it that's right right and and this is what we call as uh you know operating a flywheel which is go answer support questions figure out the top five pain points fix those fin points and then as developers you know use your product more they come up with new pain points and you again fix them and as you go on doing that you have all the developers all the attention you need to grow your business yeah yeah very very true yeah that that is uh very yeah very interesting Concepts that can be put into real use and really benefiting um yeah the the this whole development developer Community helping us devrel out here like you said yeah less of a context switching on our side too we're having a tool that is uh sophisticated yeah by the way one of the concerns I had heard from few members is that uh they felt would a tool like donkey neck developer Advocates redundant and my firm belief after operating this for more than a year now is that no this tool needs experts it needs people who really understand the technology such that they help talk e become smarter okay so this tool needs to be operated by an expert a b we need relationship the ultimate goal is to build relationship tool is only helping you answer questions but it's task of the advocate or evangelist to build that relationship with developers and take help of docky to really scale to really have millions of developers in your community and help them as if you're answering them one to one yeah totally totally I agree I think um yeah I I and I totally agree I think death row especially we're there to build up the trust too as you said maybe we take away some of the more mechanical side of things that you know it just takes up our time to do context switching and so less of context switching we can actually focus more on building up the trust and the relationship with with the developer communities so yeah I like that so very cool yeah yeah wonderful yeah so if you don't mind me asking too just more Curious right I mean obviously you're now you know leveraging on the modern AI way gen AI to do this but did you have any experiment in the past let's say prior to chat GPT did you have this idea and then work on this idea perhaps using an older AI stack to do it and is it was it even possible maybe yeah just more Curious excellent excellent questions so I have been practicing ml for last 12 years now and when I started just getting anomaly detection work like you know in a reliable manner was hard right in my last startup we were trying to solve email phishing problem and we had built something we called identity trust graph okay building a graph and then trying to figure out relationship strength and skill was really hard so this kind of a solution is only and only possible with help of llms and the kind of generative capability you know they have created we may complain that they hallucinate but believe me two years ago if you would have seen the hallucination you would have been so surprised that or this doesn't work it's like it was beyond repair yeah but but what's surprising is that if you can prompt if you can you know craft the right statement yeah around the prompt you get an amazing amazingly nice result which exactly matches uh the the kind of audience you're trying to address okay and and and and it's it's only now it's only after GPT 3.5 and something like this can be built yeah okay very cool very cool yeah yeah and I'm curious since you mentioned about graph right so I I'm aware too of what used to be called semantic web or Knowledge Graph now could that be used I mean from what you know if you have tried even maybe leveraging on Knowledge Graph to help with lessening uh hallucination for example things like that or I'm just mostly curious right now from the bit of research I've done about knowledge graph so right so in our current solution we are using rag rag retrieval augmented generation but Enterprise Knowledge Graph is a very strong Contender it's just that today for our use case EKG takes longer it's a little complicated and you have to be more careful as a compared to retrieval augmented graph okay so in our architecture uh our AG plus uh this expert feedback act layer that we have created uh is helping us contain hallucination literally to zero because in our workflow we have human control at every point and that's why with a tool like docky we need experts it's just that earlier that expert would take let's say 30 minutes and understanding the question researching and then drafting the answer now the expert is needed literally to review the answer and just click OK that's it okay okay right so yeah for us that is working but we do keep an eye on uh Enterprise Knowledge Graph yeah okay very cool thank you yeah thank you yeah so yeah and uh I think those are the questions uh and and a great you know overview that you have given us Deepak and how about Aaron you have uh more questions for Deepak Deepak for the the llm behind um behind the the bot um what did it um I'm trying to think of a good way to ask this yeah for the llm that's that's behind the the bot what went into building the embeddings that uh that you use for it so today we are using open AI embeddings ah okay okay we have found in our experiments at this point in time they are the best they are able to capture uh all the nuances of a technical question which includes normal English text plus the code snippet of you know the most popular languages plus all the settings and different configuration files that you have so so far we are happy with them but again over there uh they are always on Lookout it has as different companies create their own query languages I am afraid at some point in time they may fail right so that's that's the area of of research that I'm I'm sure incoming days will hear more about yeah yeah now that that is interesting I I was wondering um yeah yeah just uh you know because you know there are a lot of examples out there on how to build embeddings you know using you know open ai's API um but but yeah that that's interesting that uh that you're using it that's that that's pretty cool and that you think that it's you're saying it's the best one out there that's that's the even more amazing thing is that yeah you know I would think most folks would would look for something that could run locally or run in-house but yeah you know um that I suppose why reinvent the wheel when open AI is uh kind of leading the way on that absolutely yeah yeah yeah so I think um we're we should be all good in here and uh for today and but before we end we always wanted to share too is basically our Astra that data Stacks we have our Astra database with Vector search and Vector DB capabilities so I'm just gonna well now it covers a bit of errands but uh that's the QR code so reminding folks we have this uh you know you can register and use our Astra Vector search database so and also we we're giving I think still I think we're having the 25 uh free credit every year that's right that's right yes yeah nothing's changes you want to make sure and uh yeah so and then gets renewed every month again you get 300 per year and we're willing to negotiate too if you have more projects to do we can help you out so yep okay cool all right well hey Deepak this has been great thank you so much for coming on the show yeah thank you thank you guys thank you so much and nice meeting you yeah okay take care bye-bye [Music] [Music] Escape [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign",
