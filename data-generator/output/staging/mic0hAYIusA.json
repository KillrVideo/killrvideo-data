    "text": "[Music] hi i am martem chibatko and this is gremlin language introduction gremlin is a graph traversal language defined by the apache tinkerpop project it is the language we use in datastax enterprise graph but you will also find it in many other graph databases gremlin is a very expressive and functional language with a fluent syntax which makes it easy to use and learn it has bindings in many programming languages and we will be using gremlin groovy for all our examples let's take a look at an example of relatively simple traversal with what we call a linear motif our traversal starts with a couple of constructs g is called the traversal source and it knows about the graph we want to traverse and about the traversal engine we want to use v is a method that defines all of the vertices in our graph starting with all the vertices we are defining a sequence of steps that are going to be executed by traversers the illustration of a small graph with one movie vertex and three person vertices will help us to visualize how a traverser in this case this green gremlin creature moves in the graph let's look at those steps more closely the first is we want only vertices that have a title alice in wonderland that is the line that says has title alice in wonderland the second step is also has and we use it to only find those vertices where year is twenty ten how gremlins should end up on the vertex with the title alice in wonderland and year 2010. next step call out instructs the traverser to traverse all outgoing edges with label director the traverser should end up on the person vertex as shown in the illustration finally the value step tell the traverser to get to the name property of that vertex and return its value and as you can see in the result we get tim barton this is a worthy explanation of a really simple question of who directed the 2010 alice in wonderland the answer is tim burton but it is a good way to get an idea of what a linear motif of gremlin looks like here is an example of a traversal with what we call a nested motif traversal steps are not just a sequence anymore they form a tree with branches more specifically this union step in this example has two nested traversals with one out step each as you can see in the illustration we are still looking for the 2010 alice in wonderland movie but then want to traverse outgoing edges with labels director and screenwriter and take a union of all vertices that we find finally we are interested in the names of all directors and screenwriters of the 2010 alice in wonderland movie the result is pim barton as expected who is the director and uh linder wolverton who is a screen writer the main ingredients that we see in a gremlin traversal are traversal source traversal steps and traversers in this example traversal source is created for property graph object using the standard oltp traversal engine in datastax enterprise graph both oltp and lab traversal sources for each graph are already predefined and available to you however you may define a new traversal source for a subgraph that you may extract dynamically the first line of code shows how to do so traversal steps define instructions for the traversal and we will learn a couple of thousands of them traverser is an internal object propagating through the traversal to unify the graph and the traversal steps in other words what it does is find a solution or a traversal result to become proficient in gremlin we can study individual traversal steps there are a few dozens of them lambo steps are the foundational constructs in the gremlin language they are the most general steps that can be used to implement most other steps in gremlin however they are not the easiest traversal steps to use and usually the least efficient because they are hard to optimize as a result lambda steps are disabled by default in datastax enterprise graph later we can take a closer look at these steps mostly for educational purposes derived steps on the other hand are useful in practice most reversals will typically rely on around 10 most commonly used steps so learning all of them is not necessary to start using gremlin there are also a few steps that do not fall under the lambda derived classification they are step modulators that are used to manipulate or pass additional parameters to traversal steps finally there are predicates that are used to relate values and objects gremlin is defined as a lazily evaluated stream processing language this means that as a traversal gets evaluated work may begin on one step of the traversal and if possible even before that step is complete work can begin on the next step it is not necessary to wait for all preceding traversal steps to complete to begin the next one lazy evaluation is not always possible or practical when so-called barrier steps are used all previous steps in a traversal must complete before a barrier step is evaluated for example to other objects in a steam we have to collect all the objects first therefore order either collecting barrier step similarly to reduce a stream to a single number representing the count of all objects in the stream we need to have all the objects available to us first therefore count is reducing barrier step there is also cap the supply and barrier step that can be used when previous steps have side effects and and we want to supply the fully computed side effect to the stream an example of a side effect would be a sub graph that we may extract from a large graph finally combining individual steps into traversals of different types is another good approach to learn the language we will take this approach for this training we will look at simple branching recursive pass projecting declarative sub graph statistical and many other useful traversals",
