  "title": "Document API in Astra DB - First Queries with Swagger",
  "description": "DataStax Astra DB uses the Stargate Document API to modify and query data stored as unstructured JSON documents in collections. Because the Document API uses schemaless data, no data modeling is required!  This short demo shows how to use the built in swagger client.\nYou can get the Javascript 'Collections' client for Astra from NPM ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections )\nTo use the Document API, you must define the namespace that will store collections. Collections store unstructured JSON documents. Documents can themselves hold multiple documents. Multiple collections are contained in a namespace, but a collection cannot be contained in multiple namespaces.\nOnly namespaces need to specifically created. Collections are specified when a document is inserted.\n\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\n\nAbout DataStax:\nDataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandra™.

    "text": "[Music] hi there hey how's it going thanks for spending a couple minutes with me i'm going to jumpstart you through the process of using the document api interface for astrodb from datastax what's astrodb you might ask well it's a multi-cloud database as a service built on apache cassandra deploy deploys to pretty much any cloud and it's fully auto scaling which is pretty awesome so um most developers historically have worked with database software uh and drivers uh using binary protocols so database technology's evolved a little bit today here and what often people are starting to do like data stacks astrodb is offer their database as a series of secure always-on apis for you data access apis so you can use our traditional cassandra query language you can use graphql you can use rest but today we're going to focus on the document api which is if you want to treat apache cassandra running on data stacks astrodb as a document database you can just throw json at it and not define the schema up front you may not realize that cassandra even though it's a quote unquote no sql database it's very similar to a relational database in the sense that you know the cql api graphql and rest are schema first you define the schema first you define your queries and then you work on connecting you know inserting data into that and connecting it together with your application uh document database is however bit different right you can just throw json at it and not worry about defining anything up front and instead of queries you're typically doing full text search because it's either structured or semi it's either unstructured or semi-structured data so um astra is really easy to get started with uh if you you can sign up in a couple clicks with github or google i already have an account so i'm just going to sign in and you get a very generous free tier you'll notice right off the bat it just tells you what what what plan you're on it gives you an extraordinarily generous amount of read write operations storage and network every month when you exceed that then you know it prompts you for a credit card and such so um anyway let's just create our database this is really easy we're just going to call this um document api demo and then a key space what's a key space it's kind of similar to a schema in relational world in the relational world i'm going to call that json data um sure let's pick cloud north america and do a u.s west one i'll just click create database pretty straightforward uh it'll show up as pending for just a couple minutes uh until the cloud hamsters are done spinning the infrastructure wheel and have created all the relevant infrastructure for you automatically sweet so this shows up as active we are good to go you can either click the connect tab here or you can just drill in uh to the dashboard and come to the connect tab here as you wish there's also an embedded uh cql console which connects you right away to a shell that you can start doing you can start working with but you know we don't need to do that because we're going to be you're going to skip learning cql and just work with the document api alternatively you can also use this load data feature over here which allows you to drop in csv files of under 40 megabytes so that's also a good a good option um the document api is really easy to use all you need is just for authentication for programmatic authentication you you need an application token uh it'll prompt you to create one but um you know if you if for whatever reason you know you just you haven't you just haven't used one yet come here into token management and you can select a role like database administrator which is usually what we do for demos because that's sort of your super user um you know for when you come to production use cases you can scope things down to a minimal set of permissions that you need and you can also create your own roles uh there's a link here for for more data one thing though make sure you save off all the token information into a local file because it will only display once uh and you know once that's gone that's it however not the end of the world you could just delete the token and make another one so let's come back here and get started with the document api right i should have gone back to the database itself okay cool so you come to connect and then uh here in you know rest document graphql all these all this information here is dynamically uh generated and specific now to your cloud instance like this is your cloud instance id for example you know if you're using a command line you know shell script or maybe even an ide you know you could set these values uh replace this you know app token with the the token you downloaded and you're off to the races um i'm going to use the built-in swagger user interface which is just kind of like a it's kind of like postman in the sense that it's a sort of a rest client uh almost like a testing harness and here in the documents area i have a variety you know here's the list of others some of the different document apis that i can work with um so all we need to do to get started is to create a new empty collection in a namespace when we say namespace we mean key space that's just the document api terminology for it um so this is pretty straightforward uh all we'll do is uh we'll grab our token that we downloaded a minute ago oh we got to click try it out here so that's editable paste in your token uh and then let's give the namespace an id so i'm going to call this json json json theta and then let's give the collection a name and that also is a json expression itself so we'll just say you know name and it is expecting that particular value and then whatever you want to choose here is your as your json collection name i'm going to get rid of these auto-generated curly braces and then i'm good to go if you just click the execute button it gives you this little happy loading uh script that your your syntax is well formed etc etc it auto it auto sort of generates the curl command for you which is really helpful uh if you're a you know a shell scripter or you just like doing this from the command line uh you know just basically writes the equivalent curl command for you so you can use that um and then great hey you know gives me my 201 response and um ignore everything below here where it says responses this is a swagger thing where these are sort of potential responses the one you're interested in is the one that says server response here that's that's the uh that's its response to your the command that you clicked you know execute here on so now i have a collection uh called json collection and i can get started so i can throw uh json documented right away right so again i'll use the the post api here to do exactly that just click try it out um now what's the namespace id json data and then the collection id was json collection great and now um let's just grab one record um i i went and got a data set from from amazon called the musical instruments i think it's just a bunch of music instrument reviews um from uh from the amazon you know commerce site uh and you know i didn't make a lot of edits to it uh basically all i did was um make turn it into a json array so i'm just going to grab one document and start with that let's come back to our swagger user interface and i'm going to paste that in here great i'm going to get rid of the comma because i'm not doing an array and then this auto-generated sort of curly braces right here uh click execute and boom there's my document id obviously you're going to want to save that in a local variable or something like that on you know as so you can continue to work with it um uh but you know yeah there's my there's my json documentation so it's literally that simple you know let's say i had a bunch of data i wanted to work with um i could uh write a bunch of requirement uh documents in one request if i wanted uh if i come back here um this uh to this file like i said all i did really was the only difference between this file and what i downloaded was i added this open opening square bracket i put a separating comma in between each json record and then at the very end you know the very last one does not have a comma at the end seeing as it's the pen ultimate record and then a closing square bracket so i can take those hundred or you know hundred odd records and come down here to my you know write multiple documents in one request so let's give that a shot i'm going to start from the bottom to the top here since i already cut and pasted that bit i'm just going to scroll back up whoops a little too far sorry about that okay there we go i'm going to get rid of that opening curly brace that is auto generated uh cool and now uh let's go get our uh information about our uh to film the rest of this so let's get our um cassandra token uh and then we know the namespace id was json data and then the name of the collection was json collection that we created all done that's it if i um wanted a uh and i you know it'll assign a random random uuid or i could give it a path uh to you know maybe use the reviewer id here if i wanted you know if there was some data inside the the json as is itself that i wanted to use as an id for the document i could feed it that uh but yeah i'm good letting with it randomly generated so click execute great it's going to generate a massive curl statement for me so i'm going to skip to the bottom of that and then lovely there's my response body there's all my document ids letting me know that astro database has um uh has you know processed all these and we're we're good to go um so what i'm i'm just gonna do is save those off onto a local file here and then i don't know let's say let's query for one of them just to make sure everything's kind of you know everything's looking good so i'll grab this top one here there's my document id okay great so let's do a query let's go back to the top of this and let's say yeah get a document great okay cool let's click try it out and uh let's see i'm gonna start from the bottom and you know and paste in my document id um because that's the one i want and then again uh you're just adding the the same things as before your um i'm going to put in that that security token the namespace id being json data collection id being json collection uh and there's my document id now i could also add things like a where clause and i could use all kinds of filters uh boolean operators hints that sort of thing um you know i could restrict it to certain fields do some pagination etc etc i'm going to just keep it simple for the demo demo purpose for now and boom hey there's my json document coming back so you've got a multi-cloud serverless highly scalable database that is you know deployable in multiple cloud regions um you know just by throwing json at it uh you know now i've done it here by this this uh console um you can certainly do it uh using the astrojs collections api that's what most folks do you can go grab that from npm right here and basically do the same thing that i just did in the user interface in code well listen hey thanks for spending a couple minutes with me today and um let us know how what you end up making uh with astrodb you can find us on twitter for datastaxdevs or you can find us on linkedin at the same looking forward to yeah hearing what you built with it and look forward to seeing you in another video bye",
