    "text": "hello everyone I'm aarin from data stacks and today I'm going to take you through advanced Cassandra operations using Cube control and flux so for the beginning here I'm going to be bouncing around a couple of different instances of uh data Stacks mission control so I'm going to start with the one that's in our like Dev playground area over on Google um where in my project um my cooworker Jeremy created a cluster and um you know I have this uh six node cluster called permanent waves so if I go ahead and click into here yep you can see I have two data centers three nodes in each um I think I've used this cluster before and and kind of shown you know videos on creating it and adding a new Data Center and whatnot but what I want to show today is real quick there's a new feature we have if I go to modify cluster this new feature we have is to switch between simple mode and expert mode so simple mode gives you this um you know web form UI switching to expert mode actually shows you like the um you know the the kubernetes Manifest behind it um and you can actually go in and specify things that may not be in the web UI so one thing that I I want to demonstrate here is take this um manifest yen by the way I should mention this warning here that once you do modify something in expert mode you can no longer modify the cluster in simple mode they will actually prevent you from going going to the the simple tab um so it's important to note that what I'm going to do is go ahead and paste that into a new document next is actually move that into um my other mission control cluster that I have running not on Amazon eks as you can see here you know we just have one cluster roll the bones but what if I want to bring permanent waves into this project let's go ahead and do that first of all get rid of the um the resource version line because that's just really going to throw things off as you um as you go forward next we want to make sure that we update the name space properly now I use Aaron's prge as a project name in both of these Mission Control clusters but what I'm going to want to do is make sure that I have my exact unique slug on the end there so if I say uh Cube control get Nam spaces and it brings back oh look at that aon's PR just like that actually really all I need is just that unique slug on the end so let's do that and paste okay boom there we go okay now as we go through we can see that we're setting a heap size of 4 GB here with g1gc for the garbage first garbage collector um we're having a data center name of Entre new and yeah rack name of R30 three nodes in that data center um and then another data center of um data center named Jacob's Ladder so I just really want the one data center here for now so let's actually pull this out of here just like that all right so we're going to end up with one CPU we're going to end up with four gigs of RAM or sorry 8 gigs of RAM four gigs on the Heap um storage of 10 gigs yeah let's let's bump that to maybe 20 um we are not going to have a backup configuration so let's just get rid of that whole line with Medusa right there and of course we have our permanent waves super user um the thing is though is that in here we don't really have a way to specify a password so one's going to be autogenerated for us that we will actually need to go in and pull out of there okay I think this is sufficient here so let me save this let's just call this PW eks3 Dot and I want to say yaml just like that okay let's do a save oh yes and of course don't forget to update um the storage class so if I do a h control get storage class there you can see I have a gp2 and gp3 defined um but if I go here you'll notice that the storage class from Google I was using is standard and the ones in Amazon are gp2 and gp3 that I have here so I'm going to change this to gp3 just like that and we're going to save that control apply DF local permanent waves ek3 yaml so I run that command we can come back to Mission Control here and boom just like that we get permanent waves uh zero nodes up three down okay you can see that our first node here permanent waves Entre new R30 STS 0 um actually has one out of two containers running and the other two nodes are now in an init State hopefully things will progress real quickly here there we go there you know what let's just do a GP permanent waves just so that we can only see the pods that relate to our current Cassandra cluster that we're trying to build or in this case hcd cluster that we're trying to build all right so if we Circle back to Mission Control hey you can see that these actually do have IP addresses all right they are definitely on their way up looks like everything is good to go here so yeah we've just taken um a cluster manifest yaml from One mission control and successfully run that yaml and you know created that recreated that cluster inside of another mission control from One Cloud do another so let's go ahead and uh let's go ahead and use this we can go to the cql console here and it asks for a user um but we don't know what our username and password is just yet well actually we do know the username it's permanent wave super user but the password in this case would have been autogenerated so let's go ahead and get that so we can do a cube trol get Secrets permanent waves super user and we want the name space of course errands frage and then our unique Slug 5hc 6 U XB um and we want that output as yaml here we have our 64-bit encoded username and password what I'm going to do is let's copy this line here just to make sure that it works the way we think it does and we can say Echo and then paste that then we're going to pipe that to base 64- D and this should come back yep there it is permanent wave super user perfect um now for the password we're going to do the same thing we're going to say Echo we're going to copy that base 64 encoded string right there paste that in and pipe that to base 64- D there is our password just like that now I can go back up to here and say permanent waves super user and then paste my password and we're in look at that outstanding next let's say that um we want to be able to access this cluster using the uh using the data API um what I'm going to do is create a load balancer that will allow us to access our cluster via via that data API uh so let's go ahead and do a cube control get services and we'll have our namespace on there as well um and let's also do a grip permanent waves okay so our data API service is right here so now let's do a cube control expose service I'm going to past that in uh we want to expose it as a type load balancer name um same name just with an lb on the end and let's make sure that our name space is on there Port 8181 8181 now if we go ahead and say get Services again we ought to be able to see the load balancer that we just created and it'll have this DNS entry that we can copy now if I wanted to use something like Postman to access this cluster I can go ahead and you know I can paste that in in the headers I'm going to want to make sure that um I have my Cassandra token in here and if you remember from some of the other vide videos your Cassandra token is U the word Cassandra um and then a colon and then the 64-bit encoded username and password um which we just saw via this get Secrets Cube control command so let me grab the username and paste that and then type a colon and then grab the password and then paste that and we should be okay um so now if I go back to the body we're going to do a create namespace we want it to be named default namespace uh Network topology strategy three let's let's do that oh we want to make sure that these match our um our data center names so the name of our data center is Entre new so let's grab that and replace that there we go now we're data center name we're saying we want three replicas for that name space so now let's try that hey there we go status okay all right um so now if I grab my password here again and I go back to the cql console I should be able to say permanent waves super user and paste the password password and we're in and now I should be able to use that default Nam space and boom there we are describe keyspace of course under the hood this is you know a um a data API namespace is a Cassandra keyspace so this is how you know you'll you'll see it defined underneath there notice um Entre new as our data center name and our replication um so yeah this is all this is all good so now let's say that we want to make a change to our cluster maybe I want this to be automatic what if I use something like flux flux is a git Ops package that allows you to perform operations on your cluster while having that cluster definition versioned inside of a GitHub for Source control pretty slick if you ask me one of the things is that um you have to have flux installed locally and and I've already done that and just to make sure that we're all installed okay I can do a flux check pre there we go okay it figures out that we have uh we have kubernetes going pre-flight checks are good one thing that we're going to need to do is uh first of all create a GitHub repository we're also going to want to make sure that we have a have an access token created for that repository and if I go down to settings here and in my own my own uh profile here I can go to developer settings and personal tokens and fine grained tokens you can see that I have in fact created one for flux here okay and you can see that when I I go ahead and look at the token settings I can't actually see what the token is here once I've created it but you can see that I've pointed it at this AWS eks3 flux Repository and it has access um you know with my user and uh those actually need to be environment variables that um that you have set you know while you're using flux is your git user and your and your git token the next thing you'll need to do to get this to work is to run a flux bootstrap command I'm not going to rerun this again because I've already run it once but the idea is it's a flux bootstrap GitHub um then you set your user as the owner and remember that's an environment variable um you set the repository of you know the same one that you pointed the token to so in my case AWS eks3 flux uh Branch main path is going to be clusters eron zash 3 it's going to use a personal token and we want to set for token off so that we don't have to like type it out on the command line all right but this has already been done real quick why don't I do a cube control get namespaces and if you look in the in the Nam spaces here you can see we have this one called flux system uh so now if I say coup control get pods namespace flux system you can see that by running that bootstrap command that it has actually added the namespace and these pods out to my kubernetes cluster which of course is running in a US West 2 of Amazon eks so what this is going to let us do is work with this directory structure that it puts in there too so you know I can CD into my clusters um you can see yep we have erand eks3 so we look in there um there's the flux system and there's my there's my project as well so let's go ahead and get in there inside my project though there isn't anything so let's go ahead and move our file in there let's say we're going to copy from local PW eks3 yaml and I want to copy that right here go ahead and look sure enough there it is so let's go ahead and do a get add uh Dot and then get status okay excellent there's our there's our new cluster definition get commit M adding permanent waves cluster all right and then we going to say get put push origin main okay now if I go and um have a look at my repositories we have a look out here Aon eks3 have a look at the project and Bam here we are just like that so now let's say that uh we want to make a change here so let's go ahead and um and say get check out or noes all right let's go ahead and do a VI on our yaml file here let's go ahead and page down to our ENT new Data Center and you'll notice we have a cluster size or a data center size of three nodes well I'm going to update that to four nodes just like that and then we'll do a right quit and then we can do a get status yep get ad there we go commit adding another node we're going to say get push origin and then our our Branch's name is four nodes what I'm going to do now is go open a poll request so let's go ahead and do a new poll request um we want to go from four nodes into Main and Y yep you can see in our um in our get diff here that um you know we have a size of four um replacing that line that has a size of three inside our yamel and yeah we can create that PL request adding another node let's go ahead and create now let's merge this pull request and see what happens and I will confirm okay with that we've merged in our gaml oh and look just like that we have a fourth node that has popped in um so it took about it took about a minute after that command ran for flux to pick it up and to recognize that there were changes inside the cluster and to go ahead and to start building out that node and oh sure enough look at that it has an IP address already it's in a state of starting um we can go here to our Cube control get pods command and again let's just grip permanent waves hey there we go look at that permanent waves ENT new R30 sts3 already has one of two containers running it is on its way up oh and there we go we have two out of two containers running on node three if I go back and have a look at Mission Control look just like that we have added a fourth node into our cluster so hey in this video we've gone ahead and really just use mission control as a way to view our changes and view um how our cluster reacts to what we run on the command line so we've run a cube control apply to build a cluster just using the Manifest yaml from a completely different cluster we've gone ahead and you know retrieved the password and we've used that password once we uh once we've also exposed the data API service we used that password to create a token that allowed us to go ahead and um access it with the data API we could create a new a new name space which of course is a key space in Cassandra and then we just did a real quick introduction into flux and uh ge Ops and how to go ahead and essentially version your cluster definition inside of git seriously I think this is all pretty cool so yeah that should do it for more information on data Stacks Mission Control just head on out to data stacks.com SL products slm Mission Control there you can find all the information you need including downloads and documentation
