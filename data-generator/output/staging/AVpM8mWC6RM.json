    "text": "in three seconds hello everyone and welcome to the advanced data modeling workshop delivered to you by developer advocates team of data stacks that's alex walaschner and today together with me eric ramirez hi eric hi alex are you going good to be here again thanks everyone for joining us again this week yeah that's always a lot of fun uh okay so uh if you can see us if you can hear us then please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat or i don't know write something so we will see what we can start and let me check that by the way it looks like we are good and i can tell we have a lot of people today we have many dozens of people together with us that's incredible thank you so much for joining we can good yes sound good looking good okay so we can start finally very good so uh what's this workshop about a topic of data modeling is always very important when we speak about apache cassandra the point is a cassandra offers you a great performance great scalability and many other features but with data model done wrong you can let's say politely decrease all of those features possibilities and of course we want you and your data models to be successful so your applications will be successful as well and we will speak about a lot of many important things today about how do you design a successful data model for a successful application important thing we will do it working with real examples and with real code you will be able to touch as well so you will put your hands on these as well as we will do uh today we use uh four main tools four main ways to communicate with you first one is this youtube stream and we also streaming on twitch maybe you prefer twitch but we answer only in the comments of youtube so if you want to communicate with us you may use youtube chat or better use discord because as soon as stream is over all this chats messages are frozen and you cannot add anything and we will be not able to answer your messages so it's better to go to our discord server i give you the link in the end also as usual we do quiz with main team and we ask few questions uh in the beginning with main team if you are new uh you may you well it's a very easy tool to learn there is no problems using mentee usually and finally we work with our friends at katakoda.com to have all their examples not only just as a video for you but also as a real hands-on experience for you so those are the main questions so those are the main tools we are going to work with today and now before we start i want to ask you some questions so we will better understand what's your uh level how much are you experiencing in using cassandra and so on and so forth so to join the workshop quiz and answer our questions easiest way is just take your mobile phone go to mendy.com and to use the code 5830266 i repeat five eight three zero two six six uh to join and i see people are joining already that's great so uh don't be in a hurry for the beginning we just first asked a couple of setup questions uh how it goes for you how much would we work with cassandra and the others and only then somewhere after the main part of the content we will have a funny quiz so you will be able to win some swag and if you answer fast enough and correct enough the questions we ask and i see many dozens of people already over 100 viewers so that's amazing and we can go i think already my first question is how much cassandra or datastax enterprise experience do you have okay as always we have pretty wide distribution but most of the people have some experience or at least basic understanding that's already good and if you have no prior experience with cassandra this workshop may be a little bit too hard for you because we will not cover basics so if that's like in general cassandra is a very interesting topic for every developer or database architect or administrator whatever so but we do suggest you also to watch introduction to cassandra workshops we have like a dozen of them on our channel so you can choose for any one of them to understand because cassandra is different i always say what uh cql cassandra query language is a curse and bless for cassandra and many people agree what it's blessed but how come it's curse what's wrong with that an answer is simple cassandra very language is so similar to structured query language sql so many people who know sql they start to say oh okay that's like sql i can do it i already know cassandra and no they don't because cassandra is different so um despite secure looks close it's not sql and there are a lot of big differences so that's important to also make a deeper dive into the introduction to cassandra and cassandra fundamentals then how much no sql experience do you have in general not only regarding the cassandra but other nosql databases because well there are a lot of great databases in the nosql field it's a good number sorry that's a good distribution of um users today that's good yup definitely yeah and anbajagan says in chat with basics uh out of free courses data stacks and data stacks academy website is good start for beginners yes thank you so much and yes it is it's definitely our courses at the academy.datastacks.com are great and they are free and you can always use them to develop your skills in nosql and that's always good for your salary i would say so academy.datas.com and also community.datastarts.com are very important websites to develop your skills in the no sql world and as data grows over the world you we we will need more and more of the nosql enabled developers and we have some pretty nice uh distribution here for normalization and denormalization now um someone uh probably asked um is it enough for the developer certification so you have to do the courses at data stacks academy for you to be able to pass a certification um but if you're um fairly new to cassandra and fairly new to data stacks it's better that you go to datasacks.com there are uh you know like really quick 10 15 minute tutorials they're hands-on tutorials that you'll do um live that gives you all the basic fundamentals and then there's even lots of courses there that um will tell you um get you into the you know do a deep dive on a lot of the cassandra concepts um how to develop apps all that sort of stuff it's all at dailystacks.com yep exactly okay so um i see uh people ask for the links i will ask uh jack fryer could you please give links for aha i see the slash dev already there and we also have academy and community that would help so enough for the questions let's start with learning and what i have for you today is at first we have to say how cassandra organizes data and that's very important because data model is about accessing patterns and the way how you work with data and if you don't know how database organizes data we cannot successfully work with this data so first uh first basic container for us we start to work with is the key space key space is the uh group for a data group for tables which those shares some rep some settings at least replication settings maybe some more settings but we start with replication in this case on the example on the right we create a key space name it library with replication network topology using replica factor for free and dc west and 5 on dc east and then we create tables we create tables with statements like that create table key space name table name and all the following properties year name country homepage and primary key and that's a so just really quickly just really quickly on this point so i know that about half of the people that are attending right now are fairly new to cassandra um so a key space is like a namespace um um what what other names would you call it um alex but it's just really a database instance right and the the replicas that alex was talking about there is this copies of the data so in the west data center just in the example here there are three copies of the data and then in the east um dc there are five copies and the key space contains um lots of tables it's a logical group yep exactly um so and um so far so good now take a look at the last line in this create table statement we have primary key year and name and the beginning the year part is taken in the parentheses and what does that mean in general any first part of a primary key will work as a partition key so cassandra is a big date already many companies like netflix instagram apple huawei and others are using that to store really dozens petabytes of data and how to handle that we cannot hold uh we can we cannot hold all the things together in the single list of rows let's say because it will be too much no server can feed such data and still will be able to respond to your queries within a couple of milliseconds how it's done then all the data within a table spread to multiple partitions and we use a partition key in this case that's just a year to agree to separate those rows into them groups so call it partitions so we can spread them over multiple servers and so we will be able to dispatch answers uh very quickly even if you work on the petabyte scale so cassandra is really big data reading now speaking about the data centers on the right you see two data centers one data center consists of four servers that's a data center vest and another one consists of eight servers that's the data center east for them as you remember we have set different replication factors for replication for the west we have set replication factor three and for east we have set replication factor five so what does that mean it means whatever partition exactly like eric say it will be replicated multiple times so the blue partition for example will go three times on the west center and five times on the east center but also all the other partitions will be replicated multiple times that's uh define it by the replication factor of key space we created in the very beginning then then we work with data in cassandra using cassandra query language for the data definition language there are statements like create key space create table also create index or custom index and also create materialized view and data manipulation language you all know that's a pretty typical create read update delete so select insert update delete very familiar and sql create table has some features you need to know so first of all we create table with some name obviously then we can define column name its type and if it's static static means what it will have the same value through the partition a primary key primary key consists of a partition key and clustering columns partition key is required with a partition key you identify the partition and as you see partition may consists of multiple rows in this case rows will be grouped into partitions based on the value of multiple rows of multiple columns sorry and then all the columns after the definition of a partition key will be clustering columns we need them to ensure uniqueness of the primary key all together i will show it to you on the example if you aren't getting something right now don't worry you will get that when we work on the example and finally optional version with clustering order by the point is clustering columns here they not only needed to define the uniqueness of a row in the table but also to ensure sorting order how it works and how well it's optimized that that's a question more for the right path discussion so it will be not covered in this workshop but you know what to do there is eric ramirez and directly under him you have a subscribe button so you are going to push this button in order to get more workshops from our from us let's go on so as a result we may have two kinds of partition in the in the tables first one is called single row partition it's a pretty simple thing when we use a universally unique id as the partition key and very end primary key when every partition will consist of one and only one row like take a look at this example that's a table users and our id field is universally unique id so it's a long long string of numbers of digits and characters and primary key consists of id so how does that work primary key was longer before i will explain you in this case that's just a partition key which also works as a full primary key there are no clustering columns uh why don't forget we need clustering columns to ensure uniqueness but we don't need it this time because that's uuid they are unique already and second we need to ensure sorting order for the table in this case we don't need these so they are already there is nothing to sort in our case we aren't going to use any things he has sorted as a result i have single row partitions every partition has one and only one row and that's perfectly fine if you are going to access them by id but also there is another technique which is more widely used multi-row partitions when you have multiple row per partition on the table which looks like that i'm creating table artifacts by venue uh where venue will be text and year will be integer artifact text title text country text static uh why because whenever so that's the location where some events happening if venue is located in the united states and we have a partition key like in this case by venue and here of course i doubt if anyway we'll kind of move jump from united states to europe or australia i don't know uh somehow on its own so we can use static country in this case it will be usa for or whatever you use when inserting a row for all the data within the partition and finally we define partition key and partition key in this case define it as venue and year so then is the location and here is the year when it happened so we have a composite partition key that identifies the partition based on the venue and here there um something happened in this then and finally as a clustering column i use artifact what's the point and why to use artifact don't forget those two are defining partition but that's not enough if i would have a primary key of just then and here it basically means what i can have only one event per venue in a year because that's not unique enough and then i'm adding names or ids or whatever artifacts of this pair event and as a result i have enough unique primary key so i will not overwrite existing data don't forget in cassandra every insert is an update every update is an insert and so on it's called absurd in general that may be a familiar behavior to you if you have already experienced with nosql databases and by the way take a look at this nice um table on the right we will it's called chabot diagram and we will work a lot with them today because that's the language you use to describe data models in cassandra in this case you may see so what's that's a table table name we have all the columns we have their type specified so text integer text and so on we have k meaning that's partition key on two so we have composite partition key from then you in here we have artifact as a clustering column with a sorting order by default default sorting order and we have country as the static field now yeah so um so there's this um we've got a few questions for this uh i know a lot of you are going to get confused now because we've talked about a lot of um terminology so let's start from um something really simple so a a prime table which has a primary key that only contains a partition key is what we generally refer to as just a simple primary key it's simple because it just has um one component in the primary key which is just a partition key um uh alex used the word uh the expression before compound primary key um it's sorry uh composition composite partition key is when you have multiple columns for the same partition within the partition key let's just go back a second so a primary key must always contain a partition key and if it contains also a clustering key meaning that um there's additional columns apart from this partition key that's when it becomes a compound primary key now we've got a a keyword there in in this table in particular where the country is a static column so the type the data type here is text for country for the country column and where where it says static so static means that the value is the same for all the for all the contents um so um in in within within the partition key so say you've got a venue i don't know um uh give us give me an example of a venue alex well uh what was this nice place where we did accelerate last year i'm trying to remember the name it was next to washington uh in maryland uh national resort and um whatever center i don't remember sorry right so but so in this instance the country will always be the same for the for a venue that has lots of rows within the partition and so it's set to static because it only gets set once and uh it's the same for all the rows within a particular partition um we talked we keep talking about the partition and partitioning keys um in in no cql and um and in cassandra a partition is the equivalent of a record in a database but if you're if you come from a relational background a record in a table in a in a say in an oracle or my sql database it's really just the one row within that table but in cassandra tables are multi-dimensional what does that mean here's an example where you've got one record which is um accelerate with the year 2019 but it has multiple um multiple artifacts in it so each artifact within that same partition within that record has different rows which makes it multi-dimensional so each each partition can have multiple rows if you have lots of clustering keys like if it's a compound um compound primary key and so when it says one of the columns is static for all the rows within that particular partition all the values are the same across all the rows if you can have one row you can have a thousand rows the value for the country will always be the same because you've said it is static yep okay where is one question i really would like to answer because uh it makes some doubts uh even for experienced cassandra developers as i've seen before so vivec asks why do you need subset in composite key so parentheses parenthesis here comma venue parenthesis closed artifact id why not just year venue artifact id what's the difference between two very simple and thank you for the question vivek the point is i can emit parentheses and in this case cassandra takes as a partition key by default only first uh value so if i write just then you come my year comma artifact then only then will be the partition key in this case and if i want to set a set a partition composite or compound key as some people say then i have to specify parentheses so it will be together the partition key not just the venue and that's important about code style so you maybe know about the code style and you need to write code accordingly from some code style depending on the language you are working with in cassandra we also think of the code style even if your primary key is not uh composite and would be just whenever even in this case i recommend to take first value in the parentheses so it will be obvious what that's the partition key that may save you a lot of hours of debug if that's like code style that's optional but that's very recommended it may say you will save you some time later on debugging yes and i see new launch mishra answering exactly this question it may be much easier a better manner than i do so thank you so much thank you uh everyone so let's move on then because we have a lot of great things to show to you today and here we go so cql select with uh select so it's looks exactly like sql select but there are some things to consider those are very different and i want to explain them so select what do you select columns aggregates functions maybe user defined functions very powerful feature and so on from table name one table per query one table per query that's it no joins no foreign keys why many people ask me why cannot we have all these things they are pretty cool we use them in postgresql for example and we are happy to have foreign keys and all the join table to table to table answer is very short all those databases supporting foreign keys and relations are great as long as you don't push too much data into them when you start to push too much data into them they're getting very slow and at some point that's uh basically impossible impossible to use and then you start to switch to the normalization again and keeping some data you have to dispatch within a single table and utilize the normalization heavily and when we speak about the cassandra scale which can easily handle petabytes of data when databases supporting foreign keys and relations between entities aren't going to behave very well the point is yes there are some databases that cause what we could handle a lot of data while storing foreign keys and relations but there is one thing cassandra is designed to deliver a lot of data within very very very milliseconds so very quickly if you have if you want to do multiple joins even a single join on the distributed data over a 100 of servers how do you think how long will this operation take if we speak about thousands of servers biggest cassandra distribution now consists of a 160 000 servers that's huawei and apple has apple deployment has around 100 000 servers dedicated for cassandra so yes at some scale doesn't foreign don't work too much well for you so let's go on one table per query no joins uh how to handle that state unit we show exactly in this workshop when restricted to primary key columns notice where you can use where conditions only for primary key columns it means what we have partition key clustering columns and data columns all the columns those not mentioned in primary key are data columns and without index in without indexes we cannot search by them it just will not work so where clause is restricted to primary key columns you can use it only for partition key and clustering columns group by again clustering key columns order by clustering key columns ascending or descending you can set limit as always and finally we have here a low filtering and there is a big red label danger why because it's very dangerous statement we say you can search only by primary key conditions and indexes if you are trying to search without them or if you don't specify the partition key then uh it will not work so cassandra will tell you like i uh cannot execute the statement you may use a low filtering if you know what you are doing and allow filtering enables so call it full cluster scan what is it and why it's so bad answer is very simple imagine you have a cluster of 100 servers and you have a big table with a lot of partitions if you specify a full partition key in your where statement as you should do and actually must do then your driver in your application which is a very smart thing driver knows data allocation data schema allocation over cluster driver calculates partition and know which exact node to ask and that's very cool so that's a very cool optimization what even at the application level already your driver knows which exact node to ask which nodes is responsible for this data so it will not go to random node it will go to some particular node and the trick is if you do not give enough values to calculate the partition like in the last example we have had venue and here as the partition key if you don't give them both on the select then how driver uh could calculate which server to ask there is no way and what does that mean which note you are going to ask answer is you have to ask all of them that's called full cluster scum and that's what you have to avoid at all costs by default cassandra will drop such a request and say like okay i'm not going to do that it's dangerous but if you insist you may use a low filtering statement and cassandra will do a full cluster scan and return the data to you and of course it's going to be very slow and of course that's a very very very bad practice so it heavily affects cluster performance and you do want to avoid that if you're responsible for the things like continuous integration and continuous delivery in your company you definitely may want to add a low filtering to code style checks in your code so you will be sure so people are not committing pushing color filtering and it will not reach production to heavily affect your database performance so sample sql queries those are good examples those will work with this table select all from artifacts by venue when we equal something and years equals something this query will work yes it will work we specify all the parts of a partition key therefore it will work and we will get all the rows of this partition when whenever and here and artifact here we use full primary key so we will get one and only one row and that's very fine again as long as uh we have venue and year specified for this example we know which partition to ask it means we know which server to ask finally wherever anyway equals and here equals an artifact is bigger an artifact is smaller so in the range will it work yes absolutely we know which partition to ask and we can use inequalities for the clustering columns notice i say we can use inequalities for clustering columns because we cannot use inequalities for the partitions and partition keys exactly by the reason mention it above if you do not specify the particular partition when we don't know which server to ask and boom that's full cluster scan and those are examples of bad keys bad queries so we are doing the same select with the same table but in first case i am specifying only the part of a partition key because i also need here which i am not specifying what does that mean we cannot specify a partition cassandra drops with request you use allow filtering cassandra executes the queries that's a full cluster scan avoid when we venue and artifact again year is missing so we have two parts of a primary key but at first we need a partition key partition key identifies the partition will not work where artifact more and smaller okay again we are missing partitions at all the venue and here and title okay what's wrong here would you ask we specify venue and here what's wrong then answer is and title title is a data column it's not a clustering column it's not there part of a partition key as a result you cannot search by title or at least you have to set index on that and finally where country equals something again country is a data column and that doesn't matter if it's static or not we cannot search by that so important implications for data modeling you have to remember all the time primary key define data uniqueness partition key define data distribution over cluster partition key directly affect partition size clustering key divide row order and help you to ensure uniqueness primary keys are responsible for data uniqueness and partition keys define data distribution what's that and why do we need data distribution again cassandra is a big date already what is the big data there are a great number of amazing definitions most of them are scientifical so you need to spend a couple of years in the university to understand what do they mean with this academic language i prefer to have simpler definition big data is the data which doesn't fit in a single server it's also not perfectly clear but at least much shorter so you can read it faster in general we want to spread our data for two main purposes only two first one we avoid too much data per server we spread data into multiple servers second reason is to avoid hot servers or hot partitions imagine uh we work in some kind of e-commerce and we do a lot of um operations in sales like i don't know maybe amazon you could take a look at and a company we are working in is very successful in country i don't know like let's say like china or india and there are a lot a lot a lot of people so it's a big country with a lot of citizens and we also have uh some uh cells in europe and in europe you have a lot of smaller size countries like luxembourg belgium so the income comparison of amount of people difference is very big and if we would separate our customers or ourselves by country what then it leads to if you use a country as a partition key it leads to a problem do you remember in the beginning we define at the replication factor for key space so we will have three replicas in west and five replicas in east so doesn't matter how many servers you have three and five or one hundred and one thousand or maybe ten thousand replication factors still three and five for different data centers and that's the amount of replicas we have and as the data is spread accordingly to a partition key as a result if you have one hot partition because people for example in india buying in your application something all the time and there are not so much sales in europe it means what all together eight servers in two data centers will be busy all the time and all the others will be idling so we uh use we have to think when we think of creating partitions we need to think of two things if it will be too big we want to avoid big partitions and if it will be too hot like it will be the most used one we want to have even data distribution over cluster because only this case you may utilize the full potential of your cluster then query primary key define how data is retrieved we need primary key to it interfaced indeed to identify data we are going to pull partition key allows only a quality predicates working with a partition key you may specify where x equals z or x in one two three list but you cannot use where x is higher is bigger than or x is smaller than inequalities from the partition lead to exactly the same problem we don't know which server to ask clustering keys allow inequality predicates and ordering very good and finally only one table per query no joins then we are getting closer to our final sample we will work with today final samples and the thing of uh data modeling so data modeling usually what we call data modeling is uh only the process of creating of table definitions and sql queries and shamma creation queries but actually data modeling is wider from the scientifical point of view we have as a data modeling process first there's a process of a collection and analysis of data requirements we have to do the identification of participating entities and relationships we have to identify uh data access patterns how we will access this data uh we have to do uh to we have to organize and structure our data in the particular way to support the success patterns we design and specify shama of the database we will store our data with and finally we do sham optimization and indexing to reach um following qualities for data access and data as it is data has to be complete consistent and accurate and data access must be queriable they don't need data which we cannot request it has to be efficient and most importantly scalable there is no big deal to design something for the situation when you have 10 rows per table that will work anyway but we have to think of a scalability cassandra is used by the biggest companies in the world with really a lot of data and soon year by year every company will become a data company so that's we all have to think of a scalability and we will teach you some of those scalability tricks um later today so now there is a data modeling framework designed by rtom2.com our colleague from houston and the data modeling process data modeling workflow for cassandra consists of four particular states or steps maybe first we have to identify conceptual data model so we need to understand the data we work with we will do it now step by step i will show it to you how it works exactly then we have to do application workflow we have to identify access patterns what does that mean application workflow is the workflows their actions what our application is going to do to fulfill customer requests or i would better say a user workflow so what exactly our users want to do with our application like it's if it's uh i don't know facebook you mostly probably going first to login then you are going to see your profile page when you will see this news page with all the updates from different people and so on and so forth so every step of them is an access pattern login we have to compare data profile picture we have to deliver data news page we have to open news for this particular user what we think interesting for him or her and so on when we go to a logical data model applying a very first approach and as a result after optimizations and implementation of logical data model we are going to have physical data model so uh we finally have table definitions and we know what exactly to do and how we are going to create our tables and that's the data modeling framework again now already as a workflow we have conceptual data model and application workflow and we map them together based on the section we can create logical data model we optimize this data model and we receive physical data model which uh already completely cassandra specific so first steps aren't cassandra specific you may and maybe should use them with other databases as well to have better understanding of your application workflows and conceptual data model but logical data model and physical are already cassandra specific that's always about learning uh by example and learning by doing those that's not enough to just listen but we have to do something and first example eric uh are there any questions you would like to read aloud right now yeah so um keep getting us so things like our materialized you know posted this this i get asked about materialized piece a lot um we'll cover it a little bit in the slides as well i think i'm alex we'll cover that um but i did post an faq and i posted the link in the youtube chat um that explains you know why and why you shouldn't use materialized views um there's lots of questions about um indexes as well if you've modeled your data correctly you they'll need to create indexes um for your tables um but there are uses for indexes um i understand that but try to avoid them if you can model your data correctly yep and materialized views are not included in to this workshop because at the current state they are considered experimental and those are dangerous grounds i would say so i know some companies successfully using materialized views and they're very happy with them but i also know some stories where people were using materialized views and were not happy at all so uh at the current state there are some limitations that's why in cassandra version 4 coming uh later this year that's in better state already i believe materialized views are enabled by default to have backward compatibility but they are in ex they are experimental so there are some issues to solve first before we will be not experimental uh i will not cover them today because we have another things to talk about and let's work with our first example because it's always to work with real examples and you will see in first thing we speak is iot data or global sensor network in our case so in this case we are going to work with a practical example we speak about the temperature monitoring sensor network that's the temperature specific sensor network but replace temperature with humidity or replace it with whatever is interesting to you uh and it will be the same the data structure and the same tables as a result um the typical networks of the sensors like that data is a very um has a very interesting character usually every record you have is small for example one single um temperature sensor usually reports only the float value so that's the temperature i've registered and then timestamp at what exact time it happened basically that's it so you have just uh some bytes but first we are going to have a lot of sensors and second they report their state regularly so uh that's the thing we have to consider so we are going to have a lot of data over time and as said we have to remember what data gathering together over time may be dangerous if you don't do your data model right so at some point partition may be too big so we need to think of kind of bucketing or something to separate the data into different partitions and we start with a conceptual data model conceptual data model again that's the way creating a conceptual data model is a way to understand your data which entities you have which properties they have they have and how they relate to other entities one to another so on the right side you have an entity relation diagram and i think i will make us a little bit smaller so we will not hide the content yeah good so um that's uh we say we have main entities on the right network sensor and temperature so what's the network uh we don't want to work with sensors at first directly and second we would like to have some aggregations so network is a group of sensors for example i may have network of sensors melbourne covering all sensors in melbourne and every sensor belongs to one and only one network but one network may have many sensors so there is a relation one to many and every network has some properties like name description region and number of sensors and then we have sensors as they are and every sensor has id location location to simplify is not an address but latitude and longitude so geographical coordinates it has some characteristics those are simply key value map and every sensor does records and every record belongs to one and only one sensor and every sensor may have a lot of records done so it's again one-to-many and every record consists of a timestamp and value so value is a float it's uh like a particular temperature it's registered and time stamp is obviously time when it happen good oops when when we start to think of the application workflow what's the application workflow thus actions we are going to do with our data so first we think uh of uh what are we going to do with this data in general and how we are going to access that what will be what would be workflow step by step at first we think show all networks so we don't want to show to our user or operator like a list of billions of sensors at once but in the beginning we may have not so much so we but we will split them into networks at first we are going to show the list of networks we have when we have two possible follow-ups we may have to show to display a heat map for a network so there is a nice visualization things you maybe have seen like heat map looks on them i don't know whether forecast uh channel or something like that or another option we may have to show all sensors in the network so customer click it on the network and we have to show uh what this network consists of and finally out of the list of sensors in the network we may need to show row temperature values for a sensor so here you open list of networks here you open list of sensors in the network and here you click on the sensor and you we show a list of the latest temperatures registered by this sensor and finally we can define data access patterns using this application workflow find information about all networks order by name ascending so that one's going to be pretty simple show all networks order by name just to keep it more convenient for user to scroll through them and find them then q2 display heat map find hourly average temperatures for every sensor in a specified network for a given date range order by date descending an hour descending then a q3 query free a display or sensors in the network that's also simple find information about sensors in a specified network and finally q4 find raw measurements for a particular sensor on a specified date order by timestamp so that's should be pretty clear at all so records sorted by order by timestamp for a specific date uh there is important point to mention by the way aggregations and user defined functions are available in cassandra but pretty limited for the reasons i've mentioned it before so in general we plan to do aggregations um on the application level and store them in this table beforehand so we will not spend time calculating them on the out time when we push print the data so based on the conceptual data model and application workflow we designed it before we proceed to logical data models so we map together data from previous two steps and we design logical data models step by step logical data model results from conceptual data model and application workflow organize it into already cassandra specific data structures based on data access patterns logical data modules can be conveniently captured and visualized using chabotsko diagram what can feature tables views indexes and so forth and here we start to speak cassandra but we are not done yet so that's the first approach and we may need a second one to have final result first approach is first we have a list of networks and every network has name and this name uh will be k k means in chabot diagram partition key you remember i told you some minutes ago what we will use with diagram a lot that's well what we are doing name will be the partition key and i'm going to grab all of them and every key every network will have description region and number of sensors number of sensors you ask why don't simply do select all count select count all answer is start to think cassandra already cassandra operates with big data if you do select count all with no conditions it's a no go it's a bad idea how much are you going to count maybe 10 records maybe but it also can be a thousand it can all be a million billion and even more cassandra is ready and elastically scalable to handle basically every amount of data and therefore we don't want to cache the values we are going to show so when we add some sensor into the network we have to increase this and when we remove counter when we remove sensor from the network we have to decrease that and it has to be done at the application layer but it's also important so you always know which amount of sensors you have per network when we think of the sensors by network list in this case sensors are grouped by network and as you could guess network is our partition key when someone clicks on the button show network sensors we will show this and all the sensors of this network are stored together in a single partition what does that mean doesn't matter how much networks you have maybe really a lot of them doesn't matter how much sensors you have maybe billions of them but they're partitioned by a network so they are in the single partition and we can easily load them with one single select statement touching only one server and that's great then we are having here sensor and sensor is a clustering column and that's important thing why do we need a sensor here for two reasons first of all we need to ensure uniqueness so if we would have only network part of the key well we would be able to have only one sensor per network but a primary key we need to ensure uniqueness of the data so we go with the sensor to add it here and to have uniqueness but also it defines a sorting order so we may use that for some purposes when we have latitude and longitude and to define the location for this sensor and we have some characteristics we don't know yet how to better structure that at the logical data model we don't need it yet we will do it while proceeding to them um a physical data model and finally with a query for we show temperatures by sensor in this case we will feature sensor id as the partition key date as the partition key and type stamp as a clustering column and value as a data column so first of all why do we have to think of a date as a maybe a good candidate for a partition key take a look if we don't use date as a partition key will this table work yes it will but only few months because as we have partitioning based only on the sensor and every sensor reports its state i don't know let's say every 10 minutes after some months we are going to have over millions of records uh within the single partition and that's already getting nasty as they are small that's not so bad so again we have just some bytes there and that's not so big deal to have a lot of small records in the partition but anyway we want to introduce some better isolation there so at first we think of the date but later we will show you a better way to do that when we need time stamp to thurston churunicness and second identify sorting order and finally value is the temperature and if we speak of q2 so a second access pattern or user workflow we have temperatures by network aggregate table so we have network date and hour and sensor as a clustering columns average temperature latitude and longitude so we can easily map that to a real map and show that and finally we proceed to physical data model which already defines our table so that's physical data model chabot go diagram and we have some nice optimizations here and that's a final result we want to reach and um there are some optimizations to discuss so first of all network table looks like it was before with name description region and number of sensors but there is a new field called bucket and that's a very cool technique i really would love to know uh some years ago bucket in this case is um not required in our example in the beginning because in the beginning for our demo we are only creating our sensor network and we will have only two of them do we really need bucketing for a table which has two rows two entities isn't that an overkill yes and no uh yes we don't need buckets to load only two rows of data we are only building our network so it may be fine for a beginning but we always as a good data modelers we always have to think about the future and in the future we are going to have a lot of networks how do i do it then i organize partition based on this packet value just a text volume and in the beginning i set a simple word all and every network i add will have this field value equal to o and then i can read all networks specifying partition key oh which is kinda maybe even hardcoded in this step and hardcode is bad but don't be in a hurry i will show you something and when i have a list of my networks so only two in the beginning that's fine and you may say okay that's an overkill just remove this bucket and get your network's answer is yes no uh problem is um what then we will grow at some point we will define what finally we need some partitions to load and what happened then there is no way to change partition alter partition key inside the table because why why i want to change my table can i yes you can but if you don't touch partition key you should not touch partition key why because your partitions and your data per table may again be petabytes and if you change a partition key it means what data must be reallocated inside the cluster and it means what in some cases your cluster really should speed spend i don't know maybe weeks transferring data from one server to another so you cannot change partition key and then second question you ask okay but i have to i did a mistake and my data modeling or maybe just some maybe not mistake by itself but something has changed and i want uh in the user workflow we have new requirements you know business business requires something new every next day and answer is as long as you cannot change partition key you have to create a new table with a new structure and migrate data and that's sometimes pretty painful process if you want to have zero downtime so you may think of different approaches to avoid that and one of the things to predict that and prevent that is to have this empty bucket you will see on the practical step better so we have bucket but all the rows have the same value and that's pretty cool so when another optimization we want to talk about is temperatures by network here we suggest a new k new partition key called weak for the temperatures by network what does that mean don't forget data will grow over time and i may want to watch a heat map for last week but i also may want to watch a heat map for one year ago and so the gain data grows how do i control that i'm using again bucketing but in this case bucket will be not based on the text but based on the date so i use uh first monday of every week to create a bucket and all records within this week starting from monday uh zero hour and ending sunday 23 59 59 will land in this partition so one partition will be limited to one network and one week and as a result maximum size of my partition will be all the averages within single network over one and only one week and as long as week is gone i will start to write to a new partition it allows me to solve the two uh goal to reach to goals i've mentioned it before i want my partitions to be not too big and i want my partitions to be not too hot then finally one more optimization is a date hour so that's a timestamp i don't need to separately store hour and date but i just use stamp stamp as dye timestamp allow me to have sorting order speaking of temperatures by sensor well sensor and date will be the partition keys so i will have partition limited by date and 12 sensor id and with sensors by network that looks exactly as we expected so network partition key will be text id or name sensor name or id will be text again it will be clustering columns then latitude and longitude will be decimals and characteristics is a map of key value text text so i can set some a lot of different values with text key and text value inside the characteristics map and i'm getting to han yeah i like questions just before you go so i i just wanted to quickly cover because i knew this was going to come up so narayana asked the question about why um was it narayana yeah it was why you can't change the primary key and particularly the partition key um if you i know that there's about half of you here or actually no 25 percent here who are new to cassandra a partition in in cassandra is a unique identifier that determines where that particular record gets stored within the cluster so say you have 100 nodes in your cluster the partition key gets hashed into a value and that hash value determines which node that particular partition and all the rows associated with that partition gets stored in the cluster if if we allow you to change the partition key of a table then it means that whatever data is already stored in those 100 nodes you will no longer be able to access it so hopefully that makes sense that's why you cannot change it once once the data is written once once you've created a table you can no longer change the primary key for it you can only create a new table and copy the data across and that that copying mechanism will redistribute the data because you change the partition key in the primary key um the the primary key determines how you know the physical storage uh the physical layout of the data on the disk and and how it's distributed around the cluster i have a question to answer from juggernaut billiam uh why there is no link between sensor by network and temperature by network don't forget those links are not based on the relations anymore because it's a no sql database no relational database the links you have here are the access patterns so uh viewing temperatures by sensor uh it means what you are at the sensor page let's say and we think of sensors and temperatures by network is based on the network so we proceed to temperatures by network from the network those are workflows not relations so that's the answer i guess can we store json in a column yes absolutely actually uh you may have uh to consider user definer types if you have if you use all the time the same json it will be very convenient i mean the same structure why can we rename only primary key column why can we not name table i think you can rename table actually never try it yep so how can we migrate data from sql server to cassandra well uh migration is a special story which is not covered in this workshop because otherwise it will take us a couple of days i'm ready to speak about that for a couple of days but i'm not sure if you have time so maybe actually eric i think we need to do a migration workshop for real because that's what people demand all the time data migration from one database to another that's not a simple thing okay no we can't rename table thank you nilanish never tried that never had a use case for that um what compaction strategy do you recommend it's very it's out of scope for this workshop but in general it's very depends on your data and if you had read first and right first to cover compaction straight yep eric oh no i was just gonna say um yeah keep going for the compaction strategy i do recommend very seriously we have a great resource academy the stocks and there are a lot of courses including maintenance and operation scores i don't remember numb number it's something like 210 maybe but you can find there are not so many of them okay there is a lot of them but administrator puff is only one and it exactly explains how different compaction strategies work and which kind of compaction strategy is better for which situation um uh ashwin uh so we've got a lot of stuff to cover so i think we're gonna run out of time but let me just spend um 20 or 30 seconds so actually ask and we store jason in the column yes you can use the cql text um shush what asks can two partition values have the same hash no absolutely not there can absolutely be no collision so that when you hash a partition key there are two to the negative 63 all the way to two to the 63 um possible values that um in terms of the hash tokens in a partition um so one really smart guy once told me that that range of values is so big that there are there are uh it's bigger than the number of all the atoms in all of the in all of the you know universes in all of the galaxies um in the whole universe so it's not possible to have collisions at all um we keep getting asked about data migration you can use um the dsp which is the data stacks uploader it's an open source tool um you can use kafka where you can work cassandra is a sync um so you know and you can also use we also have the spark cassandra connector where you know for example you can stream um you know from one uh data source to cassandra as the end um lots of different uh selection there um what is the total what was the question this or the total number of tokens in one node of cassandra um sides configurable the number of tokens um by default you you can have a single token node but you can if you use virtual nodes you can have 200 you know 64 tokens you can have 256 tokens you can have 512 1024 whatever you want our recommendation is to keep it low either pick 8 or 16 it's a good number of tokens if you're using virtual nodes um it can have a bit of um data skew like the data sizes um on each node will not be the same um so if you're concerned about that you can use um num tokens 32 or num tokens 64 but really if data size is your concern um you know storage is cheap this is cheap don't worry about it the ttl data will will it be deleted in an efficient way without tombstone um yes it is ttl is um just automatic deletion um you don't have to worry about tombstones if you've done your um data modeling properly it's a it's a big subject um uh sorry uh just a second to add something to you uh with ttl ttl is indeed a great way to remove data you don't use but it doesn't guarantee the time of the deletion so uh don't expect it to be um like uh very very on time because data may be deleted a little bit later when you would expect that for if it's fine for you when ttl is perfect um what compaction strategy do you recommend i think you've already covered this but i always pick sdcs unless you've got a time series use case in which case you need to use the time window compaction strategy and is it possible to query the keys in the json um no because you can only query based on the partition key and clustering key um geez so many questions um we're gonna run out of time so um if you've got any questions i'm very very happy to answer them just post them at community.datasacks.com um i answer questions um whenever i'm i'm awake which is pretty much 24 hours a day community.datastax.com yep so you know uh eric you need to have a business card with the only way to contact you just a blank card and community.datas.com that's enough so um and i want to answer one last question what's that what is the bucket in network table what is the value of this bucket is it fixed or dynamic wait a second you will see because we are getting exactly to this point so iot hands-on so you have two points you have uh two ways to do it or actually you have three ways to do it first you could at first just follow me and see what i'm doing because i will explain you some an obvious moments i would like to explain second you can do it on your own and third you can do it um you cannot do it at all third way is not recommended because the best way to learn it is really put your hands on and class clock click some uh buttons and i suggest you to first follow me and second do it on your own directly after a workshop so in my case i will start right here i will start scenario links are in our github repo you are going to have in the moment i've posted it with a board i'm happy to review it uh wait a second for what kata called a url that's um i would suggest you to watch first and we will give all the required links in the end okay so if you never use katakura you're going to love it because it's a great way to learn things uh doing learning by doing in a very convenient way so and now we are going to execute the example data of this first internet of things sensor network example we will do and we always start with a key space so at first we create sensor data with replication network topology strategy and we set replication factor to 1 and it will be dc houston we can just type all the comments here or as i am lazy i will just click on the field on the left and category will do a job for me so i'm created key space this one no error so we can go on and i set this current working key space use sensor data now my console attach it to his key space and all the commands i execute i execute and sensor data key space and by the way i am working now in cql sh so cassandra query language shell then we have to create four tables we defined it before out of a physical data model you've seen we have now a shama definitions so we have this create table networks bucket text name text description text region text number of sensors integer primary key and bucket as a primer is a partition key as name as a clustering column boom it's done when i will need temperatures by network field table with all the required steps boom and i have it done two more tables if you as you remember sensors by network we need that's a list of sensors per network done and temperatures by sensor so that's the values registered by sensor very well so i'm simply clicking here on the left side and i have a result here on the right side and i continue to the next step now we have tables but they have no data so i can say select all from networks and i will have nothing and now we insert some so some data with a source command i am reading a file sensor data sql it's not so big as our uh internet of things uh global sensor network is only in the beginning so it's loading pretty quickly but now if i execute this command it now returns some networks and now let's take a look at those networks now i'm answering questions uh regarding what's the bucket so bucket is a simple text field i don't need in the beginning at all in the beginning i set bucket to simply all and that can be a for real a hard coded value and all my networks will have bucket all but if at some point i will have too much networks and i will i would like to move them from a single bucket to multiple buckets to have multiple partitions in this case i have only one partition bucket is my partition key and all my networks belong to a bucket o when i will simply create a new bucket new partition move some of the networks to a new partition and that's done so the trick is in this case select from networks doesn't lead um to reading from multiple partitions as i have only one well that's a demo example we would like to avoid that actually basically what i have to do now in the beginning it will be select whatever i need from networks where bucket equals all and then i have the same result uh reaching one single server reading one symbol partition having buckets there in advance may be a lifesaver in some use cases where you realize okay i need partitions i cannot have partitions and now i'm going to migrate my database and it's hard to do now i'm going to create a new table it's not a problem but then i have to migrate uh data to a new table remove old table and it's not so easy to do it without downtime so it's possible of course but it may be painful especially when you work with a lot of data and if you need partitioning mostly probably you already have some data so that's a very nice trick to know uh thinking of a future of your table if you may need buckets in the end for the table then i want to read all rows from temperatures by network to see what i have let me make it a little bit smaller one more time okay that looks better and that's my data from temperatures by network and we have there's always forest net uh recordings with some average temperatures and there are some anomalies maybe one of my sensors was somehow damage it or something i have to take care like hours are much smaller but anyway and i can select all from sensor by network and i see what i have five sensors say we are in the very beginning of our glorious way to the top so i have two networks forest net and volcano net five sensors overall they have some characteristics which is the key value map and very json as you see and latitude and longitude decimals with their coordinates and finally i can take a look at the data which was loaded to temperatures by sensor and that's the registered values per sensor we have with date and timestamp and value don't forget date here it's highlighted red because cqlsh does a good job for me i see immediately here what sensor and date other parts of a partition key and timestamp is a clustering column i can proceed to the next step and now we are designing queries we are finally going to use uh to save some of our time i will use queries from the solutions but when you do your job please try to define your queries on your own okay that's uh pretty important so you can type [Music] whatever you want to type right here and use your hands don't just copy paste only if you can't find the solution when copy paste in our case we are going to select name description region and number of sensors from network the bucket equals oh so that's the final optimization bit preliminary every network has a bucket name all and we don't need it right now but we may need that in the future and i execute the statement and i receive all networks in my bucket all good then design query q2 q2 query is to find hourly average for every sensor in network that's the heat map we are going to be to visualize and show to a customer uh so first query we have to design find hourly average temperatures for every sensor in network forest net and date range uh today specified within single week order by date and hour so you remember maybe due to our model uh q2 table heat map table is partitioned on a per week basis so in this case those two dates belong to the date range within the same week so again we have to ask for one single partition only and order by and if we open the solution we see this request select all the data we need from temperatures by network when network equals network we work with and week is a week we need and date hour is bigger and date hour is smaller than notice date hour is a clustering column that's why we can use inequalities and week is the partition key so we cannot use inequalities on a partition key and if i execute this statement again a little bit too big so one more time okay so i see the average temperature pair this network for the last for the day i've selected okay but that's not enough we have one more interesting example find hourly average temperatures for every sensor in network forest net and date range within the weeks of within two different leagues and that's important we have partitioning by week and in this case we are going to reach two weeks and partition keys doesn't do not support inequality so how do i do that at first we can take a look at the first solution and you will not like that this one because well i don't like it as well in this case we have to do two queries and aggregate the results in the on the application layer and only then show to uh customer it means more work for programmers and i'm a programmer i don't want to do more work i'm lazy and when we have a solution to which may look a little bit better to you we are doing exactly the same we are reading exactly the same data date hour temperature latitude longitude sensor but now instead of doing two queries we do one single query specifying network forest net and week will be in range i told you before what partition key does not support inequalities and that's perfectly correct but i may use ranges and in many cases it's going to be much more convenient way so here i'm specifying weak in range and giving two weeks i'm going going to cover and eight hour bigger and eight hours smaller as a result i have one single query boom it works which aggregates results from different partitions and we can see here what the dates are from different weeks and it perfectly works q3 find information about all sensors in network forest net this one is going to be easy read require data from sensors by network the network equals forest net so we have id of a network we can use and then oops wrong button and then everything is easy if you read all the three networks those belong to forest net and by the way notice characteristics is a simple key value map there are no bounds you may use any values and different sensors might have different characteristics so some of them may have uh accuracy and sensitivity and some of them may have accuracy and sensitivity but also i don't know model name for example and some of them uh may not have that depending on how do you create this data it's completely fine so you can have multiple different keys here um so that's pretty convenient to use different rows may have different characteristics it's perfectly fine and finally q4 so the last workflow for this example we discussed it before we need to find row measurements for the sensor s1003 on the 6th of july year 2020 order by tempstamp and the solution then will look very simple select timestamp value from temporary temperatures by sensor given sensor id and date and it will be very easy so it looks like something happened with this sensor uh something not really nice happened over time that's sensor in my forest net so it looks like uh we have a fire in this forest so that's uh would be nice to investigate then maybe but that's out of scope of this demo and we are going to proceed uh any questions i think i've covered all of them now great okay so we can go on and we still have some things to do so what i want to do give me a moment good and we are getting back uh to the investment portfolio data to the next example we are covering today and there is a question i would like to answer one querying multiple partitions using in-clause result in lot over coordinator node as driver can decide which node to send query first of all driver can decide which node to send query when using in-clause so a driver you see any distributed system is a very complex mechanism or maybe better to say organism if you don't do it smart then you will have to do a lot of work i mean you as a developer so cassandra notes and driver done very smart and driver can perfectly calculate partition to ask given it has inquiry and i can't guarantee it for every driver but java and python drivers definitely were able to calculate partitions based on that so it should be not a problem so just to add to that so there's two to two ways that you know users use the in close one is when you're doing a multi-partition uh select so for example if your partition key is an email address then you say select from users where email address in and then you provide the email addresses that's a bad way of using the in close um another way of using it is when you're doing a a select for based on clustering keys which means that you're only um you know selecting from within a single partition that's a good use of the ink close because it's not like you're doing a full table scan the reason that the first one is bad is because when you're doing a an in-class on the partition key it means that the coordinator just like um uh you know when you're doing in the the coordinator for that uh request has to fire several separate um read requests from different um nodes and replicas so let's say in your in close you had um 10 partition keys the coordinator doesn't just get the one request it has to fire off 10 separate requests to satisfy that one read request yep i prepared an answer for srini s but he has got that already question was don't we need the partition key network id and the last query for temperature by sensor no we don't uh because uh in the uh table temperatures by sensor we use sensor and date as the partition key there is no relation to network and that's for good because in some cases we would like to we may like to rearrange sensor move sensor from one network to another in the border cases or maybe we physically reinstall sensor from one place to another place and we have to attach it to different network so we want sensor data temperatures by sensor to be um not directly connected uh to the network otherwise it will be too much okay so we have limited time and we have to proceed and we want to cover uh another uh use case which is different to a one we discussed it before and we are going to cover some work with investment portfolio data so investment portfolio data is something an example which demonstrates data model for investments accounts or portfolios it features users accounts trades and different financial instruments so let's relates to uh trading or investment and we have users users have accounts accounts feature trades done and which instruments were used for these trades let's take a look at the conceptual data model it looks big but it's much easier when it look like again important point of the data model we have data modeling we have to understand at some point which job better to do on the database site and which job better to do on the application side for example when we uh store trade so for example i've invested some money i've bought some um stock shares of a company i don't know let's say tesla doesn't matter uh let's say tesla and uh the trade done has to uh record the price i've paid and price it was at the moment of the trade so what was a particular price when i've bought my like i don't know let's say free share option stock options uh this value isn't going to change and i don't have to calculate it in the application i just keep it in the database that's clear trade is done money is paid stock shares received it's all fine but also there are some values which change all the time for example what's the investment value of my account it will be different every next second because the prices are changing all the time and if i have not a single stock share of one company but i have multiple etfs uh exchange transformed i have some of the mutual fund shares and i have stocks from different companies calculating there is no sense to stare current uh investment value of my account in the database because it will be different every next second because position prices are changing in this case i would better not store it in the database but calculate on the application then user requires me too it's not a hard job for the uh browser to multiply some values if you do it on the front sense front-end side or even for your application server so that's not so big deal okay so let's take a look at the conceptual data model we have on the right don't be afraid we will walk it through step by step so main four entities we have to cover up i will need my pointer so user of course we work with users every user has a username and name username to login name well just as a name user opens an account account a second entity i work with and one user may open multiple accounts but one account may have only one opener only one owner account features account id account number cash balance so how much money i have on it investment value so the price of all the stock options and etf shares i have at the moment and total value of a force or cash balance plus investment value notice those two are specified in this how to say it in english not a solid circle or oval but um with these uh lines that's because they are for me virtual i will not store them in the database i don't need them in the database because they will change every second then i have every account owns some uh shares or some options every account owns uh something what i've bought and uh there are three kind of instruments in this example i can buy stock shares so normal stock shares mutual fund shares and exchange trade want shares only one of them so i can buy something it's going to be for example an etf and every etfs has a symbol kind of id let's say and the quote so which trait was done and how many of them i own and quantity of course and um every account may place a trade so we can do a trade uh and every trade has id so every uh trade transaction isn't has an unique id it has uh shares uh was executed price amount and date uh and every trade operation i can or buy or sell every operation may be only one of the type and every trade involves only one instrument and this instrument is or stock or mutual fund or etf so that's how conceptual data model looks like and next step is going to be application workflow and application workflow in our case is very simple we have three main queries we are going to cover so like it looks much easier when this one but that happens uh pretty often date you see data structure is not always directly relates to the queries we are going to execute on that so there is no big surprise and i have three main queries i'm going to do first one first workflow is to show investments investment accounts of a user as a user i can open multiple accounts and first i have to show to release the lists of accounts then two options i want to display positions in an account so what are my investments and third one will be display account trade history so what trades were done and what are the latest changes and uh first two queries are pretty simple fight information about investment account of a user find all positions in an account order by instrument symbol and q3 find all trades for an account and optionally a known date range transaction type and stock symbol order by trade date so query free consists of multiple queries technically because as a customer i may want to uh want uh to see different kind of trades so today i'm interested for example in the old trades with my recent actions with exchange trade funds and tomorrow i'm interested more or to see what happened yesterday for example and so on so take a look there are two kinds of situation you may want to search data uh in the first case we are watching on right now i know exactly which searches i'm going to do in this case it may be easier for me to prepare tables for these searches if i know their list i know exactly what i'm going to search for and if i uh and i'm not going to add more types in this case i can go a simple way in create tables if i need to know to have a very flexible search and today i work with this kind of search tomorrow something another uh next day something completely different you may need to have more flexible tool for example kind of the typical solution in this case uh great team for vivint apache cassandra and apache spark they're perfectly integrated uh thanks to data stacks data connector and you can easily use spark together with cassandra and as a result you can use all the features of the spark including machine learning including sql so with spark you can run structured query languages over cassandra data its aim going to be as quick as cassandra usually dispatched responses because if you want to have joints over cassandra it will take some time for spark to execute but it gives very powerful tools so you can do any kind of analytical workloads over cassandra using spark and that's a very great team i really like good by the way we need to have more workshops regarding spark cassandra integration i think and i think we will prepare something in the future let's move on so finally investing the investment portfolio logical data medal and that ain't looking so complex in the end yes we have only six tables so first two tables uh for the q1 and q2 for workflow 1 and workflow 2 are very simple simple we have accounts by user the user will be a partition key because when i'm logging in i have to specify my username so you can an application site easily load all the accounts using my username as a partition key and we don't expect user to have dozens thousands or hundreds thousands of account that just makes no sense then we have account number which will be a clustering column of course to ensure uniqueness when we have some cash balance which we have to store so the amount of just plain old money user have on this account and uh name then so how do we name this account position by account consists of account so which account it belongs to and it will be a partition key we have symbol which will be a clustering column symbol in this case is the id of a position so if it's an apple share or s p 500 exchange trade fund so that's just an id of a position we have and quantity so how many of them we have and finally those four tables are dedicated for the search operations you may say what like that's looking to me like an overkill i use it to have a couple of tables when run join over them and so on but again as you have a lot of data ability to uh that's called a denormalization exactly an ability to read all the data i need in milliseconds extremely quickly with the normalization it's the easiest way to reach this ability so uh and we cover different use cases in these tables so we cover q31 q32 use cases the first table a free free with the second one and so on and first one is trades done by account by a account and d date in this case we have account as a partition well account will be a partition for all of them that's the same when we have clustering columns we are going to use for them data reading date will be um for us clustering column of course we need because that's for to read trades by date and trade id we need in this case to just have the uniqueness just ensure uniqueness then the second one trades by account and type and date and we have partition key account then type as a class string key date is a clustering key and wealth rate id to ensure uniqueness and all the data and at this point you may ask why can't i use they look very similar why can't i use a v stable or v stable better because well i understand i need to be able to search by type you vote type as a clustering column i cannot use that and the answer is you could use uh trades by um account type and date uh to run searches three one and three two but uh if you are going to use um clustering column date and you have another clustering column before that which is type to to limit or a searching order here you have to also specify type here so that's not going to be convenient uh to run queries3132 on this trade by atd table it will be it will require extra action from you so it's really easier to have multiple table in this case and if you are going to insert data into multiple tables you must consider batch statements which are part of our basic workshop so i will not speak about that in the advanced for too long and when we have trades by symbol type and date so mostly the same but without the id of um particular um share so i can search by only show me all my operation with apple for example apple shares and finally i have trades by asd so that states for account uh symbol and date so i can search everything not involving type and getting to physical data model we put that looks mostly like logical we put only one optimization here instead of specifying like it was before date i will use um trade id so take a look before it was account date and trade id now i put optimization on that and i remove date and i have only trade id with type time uuid and that's a very uh great type of data in cassandra very convenient one you remember universally unique ids this long long string of digits and characters universal unique identificator you must have seen that or globally unique identificator maybe you know it is good gu id so time uuid is exactly the same plus time the timestamp is integrated within this universally unique id so it's still as unique as universally unique id but also it has time integrated within so it behaves like uuid but you can at the same time sort it by time and you can extract timestamp out of that so that's very convenient and you don't need to have more table more fields in there and you can sort by time uuid as you see here sorting order other things are pretty well expected and a username on accounts by user is going to be s static because all the partitions all the rows in this partition will have the same username and we have a couple of minutes to walk through the investment data example and next scenario as you see as you see we have more scenarios them uh for you to use and that's actually a part of the let's say homework or kind an assignment after this workshop if you really want to get all we told today that's not enough to listen you have to put your hands on and do a job on your own and i can't do it for you i would love to but i can't you have to do it on your own but you are not alone so we are always there for you at the community.datastax.com or discord so i will be very quick because we are getting close to the uh end time at first i'm creating key space as you've seen before i want to make it a little bit bigger and i switched to use these key space you've seen that before then i'm creating tables i will not stop for too long on them because those exactly the tables we just discussed but now in the fee in the view of cql commands so i am creating tables step by step you can review them on your own then we are going to load investment data and we can read values from tables we have so for example we see what we have three users and four accounts overall jennifer has one account james has one account joseph has two accounts and we see what positions by account we have some apple google amazon tesla and so on and we can read through them to see the trades done for example then we have to design a couple of queries i will read through main of them first you want to find information about all investment accounts of a user with username john so it will be select fields from accounts by user where username equals john i'm running this comment and i see all the accounts of this user very well q2 i has to find all positions in account joe 1 order by instrument symbol so that's going to be pretty simple select all from positions by account by account id and you can say stop stop stop stop order by instrument symbol but you don't specify order by anyhow so it's wrong no it's not wrong it's correct the point is and you sit back sorted by apple already why don't forget this red one for partition key and this c theon or blue how you name that color is for clustering column as i have clustering column it defines sorting order and that's sorted already for me on insert time on create time when i add those records that's a really cool thing of cassandra like it's sorting press sorting done so i shouldn't even sort it when i'm showing these uh to them customer so i save time on sorting and that's really cool so i can dispatch answer immediately good and we have those done we can proceed and there are some queries search queries find all trades for account one order by trade date so that's again going to be very simple as long as we have um date um as long as we have table prepared for that select account to date blah blah blah as date trade id type symbol from trades by account date the account joe one and i'm getting all of them because i don't have any limits here set and if we see different transactions buy google sell google sell apple buy apple and so on and other queries are mostly probably going to look the same the only point i would mention first you remember i told you what trade id is going to be time uuid so that's how we do operations with time uuid if i want to show you uh the date i'm taking trade id getting date off out of time uuid and converting it to date for the user to uh show uh so that's very easy to use uh uu time uuid to show the date simple as that and finally as you see here downstairs i can sort by time trade id is v slang long one one a six two f six eight blah blah blah blah blah blah so very long one but i can sort by them because they encapsulate my uh time of operation oops i wanted to execute this one okay so that's executed already and you can see what their feed into the range i've specified yeah that looks better so you see they are sorted in the range i wanted to and the date is formatted notice date in this case is not the column of the table but that's that to date date of trade id as date simple as that and others are going to be mostly the same i don't want to stop on that for too long if this example is interesting to you you can find it in the website i'm going to show you in a couple of minutes and we are done with this one and i like this one as well so i will set five stars for it definitely and finally it's like this time eric are there any questions we have to answer before we proceed to please um i think we're good to go to quiz but while you're setting it up the jagged up ask is the order by time uid based on time or character the time you uid has a time stamp component in it which is microsecond since epoch so that's how it gets yeah exactly good okay so quiz time and warm up your hands we are going to answer some questions so get ready for the quiz it's quiz time and i need your thumbs up admin team don't forget easiest way to use mentee is just to open it with your mobile phone at menti.com and use the code two 5830260 six uh to join our quiz we have a lot of people today we have over 220 users that's amazing and it means we are going to have some competition so there are only five questions every response matters be careful you have to be quick but if you do a wrong answer you get zero points and you well it will be definitely hard to win doing even a single mistake and so really really important um do it on your mobile and don't follow the stream because the stream is about four seconds delayed so you need to be quick by doing it on your mobile yeah don't look at the questions on the stream thank you so much uh actually uh thank you eric that's very important to mention yes uh youtube has a serious delay of around uh yeah three four seconds today is higher than usually yesterday it was around two seconds now it's like a bit worse as you see so um watch your mobile phones questions will appear there and i'm reading questions a little bit a couple of seconds delay due to youtube i'm sorry so i see we have almost we have 90 people join it with please we give you 10 more seconds we are almost over for today so but as we have 200 viewers i definitely want to have at least 100 people on mentee again uh if you are afraid to use mentee don't be afraid it doesn't require your real name or credit card nothing like that just completely yeah yeah it's completely free and requires no registration you don't have to put your credentials or anything into the mentee it's a very great project and a simple one manti is a little bit slow well yes mentee can be slow we have a lot of people using that okay so 108 people attached five more seconds to join and we start five four three two one we go you still have chance to join very last seconds to be on time and we are starting so first question answer faster get more points what's the partition key an optional column to allow group by a column to define partitions required required column to guarantee row uniqueness a key to all the doors and time is up and most of you answer it correctly it's a column to define partitions requirements partitions and it's required and the answer required column to guarantee raw uniqueness is not correct primary key is to ensure uniqueness and it uses partition key forward but also clustering columns partition key define partitions so let me take a look at the leaderboard so who was the quickest here okay bran the broken was the fastest with 964 points congratulations very close to him we have agent x9 and thomas but that's only the beginning so let's take a look how it will change after the next question and question 205 and you still have to answer fast to get more points table can have many rows per partition true false it requires special configuration in cassandra.yaml file it's illegal so that's like being out of the house in melbourne it's illegal at the moment yeah i've been in mountain for eight months oh my god man i'm so sorry yeah so correct answers yes true table can have many rows per partition that's perfectly correct answer let's take a look at the leaderboard are there any changes and i think there will be some changes such tight competition this time point to point so uh after the second question we have avijjit at the first place with 1932 points uh goobins and the second place pretty close and shikhar at the third place already so like at least completely change it after the second question so it looks like you are very well warmed up and let's proceed question three of five answer fast to get more points inequality predicates are allowed on all table columns partition key columns clustering key columns no inequality predicates i love it none of them so one second to go and time is up and the correct answer is yes inequality predicates are allowed on clustering key columns and no inequality predicates are not allowed on the partition key columns at least by default you can enable that with a low filtering but that's a very very very bad idea so let me take a look who did a mistake are there any changes in the leaders list who is the fastest for today we have a lot of people in the competition narayana gets higher a little bit but still a little bit too far from the top three list and hours unchanged so everyone answer it pretty quickly and we have 105 people competition here so that's pretty big one let's move on and that's a question four don't make a mistake you can lost everything in one second answer fast in the data modeling framework we start modeling the physical data model with logical data model the conceptual data model and application workflow we've copy paste from stack overflow and correct answer is yes we start uh modeling in data modeling framework developed by artem chabotko with conceptual data model and application workflow and logical data model is the intermediate step and physical data model is something we want to reach in the end and take a look no one told with copy paste from stack overflow come on i know what you are doing that i know you are doing that don't lie to me okay so leaderboard leaderboard okay that makes you think a little bit so answers are a little bit slower and two people answer it very quickly avidjit and vamsi justi were the fastest one with the same time for today but avidjit did little bit better on previous questions so with 3871 points he gets the first place and wamsi on the second and hemanth on the third one and competition goes on because you know what that's the question number five and you still have to answer fast but don't make a mistake primary key defines raw uniqueness false correct primary key is deprecated that would be a pretty funny thing to say regarding kaido nomi cassandra 5 but i don't think there will be changes like that so correct answer is yes primary key indeed defines row uniqueness that's the correct answer and there are some people told what primary key is deprecated no that's not like that so finally no one of the leaders did a mistake and that's a very tight competition very very close numbers and drake0110 gets to the third place in the very last moment doing correct answer here and that's incredible like uh very on time uh last chance so ivjeet got the first place with 4843 points and that's a great result so congratulations vamps and justice manager to have to keep a second place with 4721 points and drake was a surprise final jump was very beautiful one uh taking down uh simahardim so first three leaders avijjit phamsi and drake make screenshots of your phones right now and send them to jackfryer at jack.fryer datastax.com or use our discord jackfryer is in the chat and he asks you to send him your shipping address phone number and t-shirt size and that's really sweet because our t-shirts are usually very very cool and if you didn't win in this quiz don't be sad because you know what the main thing you get from this workshop is that knowledge and skills and if you get the knowledge and skills you are going to have higher salary and isn't that sweet it may be more important than t-shirt seriously okay and last questions don't drop mention don't drop men tv are not done let's answer it quick so we will proceed to the next uh what to do next step how do you like the workshop um what's your thinking of this workshop and i see it looks like we did a very good job thank you so much for the warm uh answer and you know what i said directly under the eric you have a like button and subscribe button so if you like it to this workshop so much please push like and subscribe it always helps us to have new subscribers to persuade our bosses what we have to release new great content which content i'm going to ask you then what domain specific data modeling example would you like to see in the future today we discovered two examples investment portfolio and sensor network so which domain specific data modeling example would you like to see the next i can say by secret what next example is as far as i've heard going to be based on e-commerce and i know we have a heavy request on banking and financial like really a lot i.e ml okay sounds good that sounds exactly like oh smart home io team i have that for you uh the one who brought smart home iot you will have it just in a moment because it's created already isn't the great the thing ahead finance sql to cassandra migration yeah that would be a big one banking use case medical finance trade modeling payments workflow process request one by one okay and final question now open feedback what would you suggest any feedback regarding this workshop what would you ask us to do in the future as well no no no no suggest or no feedback that's oh it's a great session thank you thank you thank you we are always happy to see feedback like like that less talking well i don't know certification vouchers are coming stay tuned how do we get certifications coupon just a second follow-up session in the session i'm not sure i understand great workshop thank you again okay great nice session thanks okay i will keep this one open after the workshop so if you would like to add something in the end you will be able to do it and thank you for warm feedback now okay so thank you i will keep this slide open so you can add your questions on your mentee and now we proceed to the last slide which is kind of a workshop assignment or better what to do next so overall we have now five examples available we have messaging data model digital library time series uh example and time series is exactly regarding smart home and internet of things more advanced scenario and you can find them on data stacks dot com slash dev or data stacks dot com slash learn slash data dash modeling dashboard example as specified right here then the workshop is done but you can ask your questions at the community.datastax.com or chat with us at discord and finally voucher get your free voucher pass prepare for the exam using for example academy.datastux.com great courses absolutely for free and then pass the exam and become cassandra certified developer as the data volume digital data volume on the planet grows more and more you will have more and more companies will use big databases distributed databases and cassandra is first of them of course so more and more demand on the casa it's already high but it will only grow for cassandra enable it and cassandra certified developer certification is obviously one of the best way to boost your job position and salary and all the other things so grab your voucher at bid.ly slash get voucher yeah and please submit the form just once don't submit it to any too much time i'm not able to enter your mail id i don't know what you mean could you plan session in the evening time est uh so take a look i see a question could you plan session in the evening time est take a look vgr be every session we are kinda unique uh from the workshop and online education point of view because we do every workshop two times live that's not a recording but that's what i'm speak i speak for real right now during the live stream if you watch a live stream not a recording of course uh first one uh second one is right now that's the second run second show and the first one was done exactly evening time est yesterday so when you register for our for our event and eventbrite you can select the date and first date was evening time esteem good what if submitted form twice nothing bad don't worry but you will not get two vouchers good can the voucher be used for the cassandra administrator exam uh from alex for administrator or developer whatever you whichever you want to do you have to submit using the eventbrite email that you use because we have no way of knowing whether it's a random person feeling in the form yep uh can we give another email address when the one we use it on evan bright uh that no i think no it's the same one as again how long before we take exam after claiming the voucher uh what's life so as when you register and you claim the voucher you you get straight to the exam you don't book an exam there are proctors available 24 hours a day yep exam is hands-on practical lab or multiple choice exam so first of all wait a second and let me show you something uh we have here this eventbrite datastax page evanbright is the service we use to manage events as you could guess and first of all if you are interested in our events go to eventbrite find datastax and push follow button we have a lot of events coming on so now in the background on monday we have had docker session and next monday we have introduction to kubernetes session that's data stacks monday learning uh we just finished second show of advanced data modeling workshop and next speak next week we will speak about new indexing then finally the one i want to show you i let me make it a little bit bigger is the certification exam preparation workshop that's exactly the exact workshop which answers all the questions regarding certification and it will be as you usually do executed two times uh first one on 4th of november um 12 p.m 2 p.m est est is eastern standard time i believe and second one is uh next day first day november the 5th from 3 a.m to 5 00 a.m est so if you open it with evan bright you may see it in your local time zone so it will make it easier for you uh to uh decide so there are two dates fourth and fifth uh and pick the one those are exactly the same but pick the one which feeds more your data time zone sorry good and the very last word i have to tell you is very simple and obvious thank you so much you are amazing thank you for great questions thank you for staying with us during all the workshop keep learning keep investigating keep asking questions keep being awesome and that's perfect always perfect too and great feeling to answer your questions and to work with you thank you eric very happy always happy to work with you happy everyone for being with us i think we are done for today and thank you so much thank you okay see you next week thank you someone new now i have more room no more formats to change [Music] [Music]
