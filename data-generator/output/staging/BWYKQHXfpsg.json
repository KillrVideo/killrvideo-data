    "text": "hello and welcome to this session today on working with datastax astra devops and data apis with ansible my name is madhuvan sridharan and i am a senior solutions architect with datastax let's go right into it today we'll be seeing how using a single ansible playbook that will execute to perform the list of activities that are displayed on the screen all it takes is to set up a service account in with astra and then supply it with a couple additional parameters for the name of the database that we want to create the key space name and then of course table name and then you will get it going let's go into the astra console here is the astra console and i have a variety of choices to create a database in here and as we all know datastax provides a free forever tier without requiring to enter any payment information as you can see i don't have any credit cards or any payment information stored in my account and i'll have the choice to create my free tier database we also have other options like dev and test database protection workloads high density production workloads and we have a choice of cloud provider to choose from for today's demo uh we will use the ansible playbook to create a free tier database so for first but first we need to create a service account in here so for creating one only go into your astra console under your designator organizations or your default organization and then create a service account at the bottom so what we want for this is go ahead and then copy the credential from our service account and then we will use that in our playbook as you're seeing here on the screen i have my playbook set up in here and i'm using the copied service account credentials it has client id client secret and then the client name and i'm giving a name for me as to database i'm giving a key space name and i'm choosing my cloud provider which is gcp i'm choosing the tier developer tier is the free tier database which is going to have a capacity unit of one and i'm choosing my region which is us east one and i'm also choosing a username for my astra database if you don't supply these additional variables the playbook will interactively request the information from us so right now i've supplied it in here for making it easier but i left the password in there so it's going to ask me for a password once i supply my password boom there you go as we discussed it is going to perform a set of operations that we see on the earlier thing it's going to create the astra database for me so what it did earlier was it listed all the available regions and then the tiers that are available we are just leveraging the developer tier in here but as you can see there are like additional cloud providers aws azure and gcp with various tiers like for example in here this is a d40 tier which is having 48v cpus 192gb ram 1500 gig storage space on azure and es in east u.s region similarly we have a variety of regions that astra supports out of the box so what it is doing right now is creating the astra database and we have our database created and then after each action i'm also going to print a debug information i'm finding the created asta database using the id as we saw it's created the key space that we requested it for and then it is also creating a token so this token is required for doing a variety of data operations so right now up until now we were doing the devops operations for creating an astra db and for creating a key space creating a table and so on we will be requiring an auth token for using the data api so it created the table name it's going to return all tables in the database as you can see and what we are also demonstrating is couple other actions like trying to resize which we are skipping here for the free tier we will not be able to resize a free tier database in astra and we are going to park and unpark our database which is going to take a couple minutes to park and unpark so what i'm going to do here is i will go switch to my astra console to see my database astra is already created it's a free tier database zero dollars per hour and free for a word uh capacity of five gigs and here is my cluster id here is the username that we supplied and right now it is trying to do the parking as as you can see it is also displaying the gcps the provider and us east one which is what we supplied and it has also gone ahead and then created a key space for me there you go i'll go ahead pour for pause for a couple minutes and then come back welcome back here we are with our astra database in active status our ansible job is already completed we have our astra database we can get into the cql console to see the key space that just got created using the ansible as well as the table we have our aster key space let's describe it there you go we have the key space created we also have our table created there is also other things that one can do we also have a load data set in here wherein we provide with some data sets that are pre-baked let's say restaurant locations or movie and tv shows and you can pick and choose here is a layout for the preview and the data types you can choose all the variety of sql data types from in here i'm just going to use the defaults in here for now pick your partition keys pick your clustering keys there you go go for it you get to pick your database if you have multiple database in here we just have one single free tier database in here so there is only one here and you get to pick a key space of choice since there is only one and then once you enter your password boom there you go what it does is the data loader is going to take the pre-made data set and then import that into our ester database once it is completed we will also get a notification similar to how we get notified whenever we create an astra database or park it or unpark it are terminated similarly one will be notified of all these things so here is a sample of an email that you will be getting in here and there you go you'll also be given a github repository containing the ansible playbook and instructions and prerequisites for creating a service account and whatnot and then the command to execute that and there is also a number of resources that are available this is just the beginning beginning and we have only scratched the surface go check out the documentation to see what are all the available apis because there is new apis that are constantly being added we have stargate document apis for dealing with namespaces schema list documents there is also other apis like rest for doing your schemas or data and here are the ones that we just scratched today for operations as well as the data we also have other apis to do migration proxy and whatnot so as i said this is just a beginning and we have numerous apis that are lined up to come here see you all next time with another video you'll also be given a github repository containing the ansible playbook and instructions and prerequisites for creating a service account and whatnot and then the command to execute that and there is also a number of resources that are available this
