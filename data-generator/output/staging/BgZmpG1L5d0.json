    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hi everyone Patrick Fadden for distributed data show we are live at developer day Texas here in Dallas and I have Carter with me today how're you doing doing Wow no thanks Patrick so tell everyone about yourself what do you do sure why are you interesting I don't know if I'm interesting but I always introduce myself so I'm Carter Bradford I'm the president of precocity we are a technology consulting company we like to say we take data technology and creativity and use that to turn great ideas into digital experiences so the way that sort of manifests itself is we have really three core areas that we work in starting on the data side so everything from machine learning and analytics to modern data platforms and we've got an engineering practice focused on cloud native and we have a user experience practice so really anything that in or that any kind of technology that impacts or touches a human we have folks that optimize that interaction Wow all right well okay so data is kind of taken over the world right absolutely nothing fuels everything if Dave Dave's taking the world on a to hell you're gonna hold a handle right that's right it's probably not in your mission statement right all right good but it is true I mean I what you and I have talked about we had a little talk beforehand it's very interesting but let's start with a little background what is your background with Cassandra DSC how did you come here sure sure so we get started using using Cassandra and data stacks actually a while back back in 2012 so we were we were working with a major retail customer and they were starting a journey around customer personalization getting to know their customers both how they shop in-store how they shop online merging that the behavior and the transactional data and then being able to take advantage of truly optimized experiences all across the board so that all obviously started with a set of data analysis that that allowed us to really kind of understand the customer once we did that we needed a way to actually operationalize that we needed a way to get those get those insights out and push them to a point of sale system push thing to the e-commerce site mobile devices in real time and at scale and that's where Cassandra came Anand data stacks came and allow us to do that at a scale we couldn't do with the traditional data pod one so really was about scale absolutely scale and speed speed yeah what about uptime those are like those are your big three but I think uptime is kind of table stakes anymore true true but that was a big part of it so obviously if if the digital sites aren't up and running you're not making money in retail so making sure that when you've got the ability to scale up during peak season so obviously we're getting close to that that point it's a time of the year right now we wanted to make sure that it was always available so the use case specifically I think is really fascinating when you started describing it I first was like what are you talking about but in the more let's just get into it sure what is the use case you're using Cassandra at DNC for right now yeah absolutely so it's really when you think about it we we do a lot of work in the data science space and and people tend to think of data science as as folks sitting around looking at data and and cranking out these models that then can produce you know interesting insights can can help businesses make good decisions about half of the talks at strata it's exactly so that's all well and good you have to do that part but then how do you actually make it operate at scale right how can you actually take those insights and and make sure that they're being delivered to every single channel every single other technical component that might depend on or benefit from them and that's really where Cassandra came in so it starts at the beginning of the pipeline where we are ingesting massive amounts of data whether that's transactional data customer behavior data and we want to try to get some insights on that data in real time because those are ultimately features or aspects and components of the data that are useful for those machine learning models so it really starts at the point of ingest so we're doing things like as an example we'll use real-time processing to create real-time aggregates of data so over specific windows of time those then get fed as features into the machine learning models the models then get trained and then we use Cassandra as a model repository so at the end of the day we've done all this work we generated the insights and now I'm actually at the point of interaction so whether it's a website or whether it's a mobile device or any any kind of machine to machine interaction Cassander serves those models we score in real-time and deliver the insight and power the experience that that is the most fascinating thing about this is using an operational database like like Cassandra senators not the database you use when you need to do a lot of ML big analytics you know terabytes petabytes of data like what's going on but I think and I've said this before that's almost too late to manage your data so having an operational data layer with those ready to go models is really I think that's genius I think that's great because you and I were talking about this last mile problem when collecting a lot of data now what do you do with it absolutely it should make you money right absolutely that's that's what it's designed to do so this is the layer that in one it has to be fast right if you think about it personalizing experience and we'll use retail as the example right personal personalization isn't the only thing going on right now I got to serve up product information your your your rendering cards your making all kinds of decisions so the the personalization component can't impact the overall customer experience it has to enhance it so we're talking about the need to do this and you know sub 10 millisecond time frame so you've got to have that speed and two you have to have the reliability and scale and that's really where having something like like data stacks kind of at that last mile and kind of the the delivery end or we like to call it the activation end of the day of pipeline that's that's cool too it's really important yeah well and it's it's very similar and it sounds very similar to like a fraud detection absolutely you don't wait around for fraud detection absolutely that's a now yeah if someone's using my credit card in another country I want to know Sam but it's it's fascinating to me you're doing the same type of activity for fraud detection fraud detection would do for retail experience yeah we're actually working with a customer right now doing exactly that that's a very similar thing we're coming in we're getting insights on the data upon ingest and then we've got models that then are scored in real time and can indicate fraud or not fraud so let's get into some of the nuts and bolts here so it seems like if you're building an operational data layer that holds a repository of models is the data model very dynamic or are you storing blobs how are you doing that in a data model it really depends on the type of model itself so in some cases we use we may use an algebraic model right I mean really it's it's a it's a matter of taking very well-known intangible features out of the data so things like number of past purchases that are and applying into an algebraic model and many times and more complex models it's it's actually quite different so we the output of a model is a set of matrices right so we use similar to what you said to go standard to effectively store blobs we pull out the relevant portions in real time do the matrix math the matrix multiplication and then we get a result in real time how often are those updated though you're saying that there's a lot of dynamic in the model and you're speeding features in but the features change not the model absolutely well it is both right so this is so obviously the data changes sometimes the the features that are used in the context of the model change so you know one of the things that we found is that the models can't remain static great models incur technical debt just like every other type of software so that feedback loop is always important and what we typically do and it really depends on the use case so many cases we're training models once a day in some cases we may be training models once an hour right and so I can I can tell you an objection I can hear in my mind I can hear you saying it I'll say it for you is this seems like something I would want a strong acid transaction for but you're you're not doing that and you haven't done that for a long time right why um and in this case it's not really necessary right and again it depends on the the use case but but for the purposes of personalization you think about what's the penalty of getting it wrong right what's the penalty of not being 100% correct so if it's a banking transaction and you know you want to know exactly what your balance is and and you know $100 you know it makes a difference in this case and from a personalization standpoint if I am serving up based on yesterday's model right chances are the penalty for doing that is very small because it's such an evolution of a model not a radical change and anything and from a customer's perspective listen using the the retail model if I see you know yesterday I thought you would prefer a black shirt today you might prefer you know model says you prefer a green shirt are you really gonna be aware that it's a bit stale right I'm already creeped out enough with my retail experiences online so what's a little more everything and it's funny cuz banks you know it re commonly uses asset but banks have never been strongly consistent because that's where overdraft and they made a whole business around eventual consistency sure there are transactions in the world you want it I think commit rollback is probably more important than making sure that you have a strong transaction but you're right there's what you pointed out I think it's such a clear thing know your data know your use case you can just throw features of something but is that really needed do you need to cost with that no right yeah that's really interesting so what so where is this going in the world so you're using ingest for like in the stream right now that seems like everybody's doing in the stream not a lot of do you also augment your stream with like back-end processing or is it just all stream right now it's definitely both it's definitely both I think it's you know depending on the use case depending on the type of data involved we we build models we do analytics both in real time and in batch there are certain use cases where the volume of data or the type of model that we're trying to build just doesn't necessarily lend itself to doing a real-time analysis but there are certain things you know kind of continue to don't take fraud analysis as an example or even doing contextual changes to an e-commerce site as the customer is browsing right based on based on who they are and what they're doing at that moment those are perfect cases for doing analytics in the stream that's yeah it seems like that's where we're more as going to the stream because you can't wait absolutely can't wait yeah data procrastinators is what I call them yeah absolutely can't be a data procrastinator there's some use cases where you know the opportunity is lost right if you wait till tomorrow yeah I'm buying a shirt right now exactly nonsense maro I don't want to get an email saying oh you should have but then I'm gonna have a regret I don't want to live with regret I want now you're right exactly and that's what the retailer wants and using the right data layer for that is really important absolutely yeah well this has been really interesting I wanted to talk to you about this because it's it's so unique but then whenever you distill the problem down it's it's just like where people are with when they arrive to Cassandra yeah I need scale I need high availability I need this volume of data that's coming at you really quick okay we got a database for that sir I can fix that problem but thank you very much card I really appreciate absolutely thank you for staying happy to do it all right everyone well we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data stacks Academy and tell us what you think you
