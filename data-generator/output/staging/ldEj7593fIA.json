    "text": "all right hello and welcome to today's workshop building a netflix clone with javascript i am ryan welford and i'm joined by david gillardy hello david i'm doing very well um so okay like as i said i'm ryan wilford i'm a developer developer advocate here at data stacks um and a historically a front-end developer so i'm really excited to get into um this project we have today and david you want to introduce yourself as well here at data stacks um god i've been 25 years into this right between various i.t things coding used to be a dba at one point and such so i kind of run the gamut um and done matter of fact i guess i would consider myself a full stack dev i've spent a lot of time in um the backend world a lot with java and c sharp and stuff like that i also had mobile development time javascript my original javascript experience came back way before all of the awesome frameworks and libraries we have today so it was a different world that is for sure but anyway yeah that's just a little about me let's do it all right i'm trying to get a link for someone uh there we go all right i'm gonna post the link to that video that we were talking about earlier uh in the chat there you go uh okay so let's uh make everyone small let's do a little bit of housekeeping uh to get started uh youtube and twitch is where we stream um you're probably on youtube twitch is kind of our backup in case youtube gets uh weird um we don't really follow the chat on twitch so if you are on twitch and asking us questions there head on over to youtube and ask questions there or uh better yet we do have a discord that we monitor as well during streams and outside of streams uh where we can answer your questions uh more long term so go ahead and check that out uh join the the community that we're very close to thirteen thousand people i think by now um so it's really really cool uh and also mentee.com we are going to be using a tool today called mentee.com if you've never used it it's a kind of a quiz um application that you can run in your browser and we're going to be using it to ask you questions kind of at the beginning to get to know you to kind of kind of gauge your experience level and what you expect from this workshop but then at the end we are going to be doing a game uh kind of a quiz about the content and you have a chance to win some swag the top three winners our top three scorers will um get some swag sent to them and we send to the swag worldwide so stick around for that uh and it'll be really fun all right uh just to answer a quick question yeah oh you got it david thank you yeah we should just go ahead and answer that one out loud anyway because i'm sure other people have the uh the question um so the question being though is how and when uh do i get the link for the github or where is that gonna come from we are gonna give you all that information so if you're jumping at the bit you're ready to go and you're like how do i do the things tell me the things we're going to tell you all of that right um so we will give you uh the information i'll drop i can actually drop the github repo here so you can follow along if you wish but yes everything that you need today we are going to present to you yes i did drop the link in the youtube chat i haven't done it in discord um there you go i just dropped it again awesome the uh so to answer the the question that was posed uh we would drop the github link nothing is needed to download or install that's right for the entire workshop uh everything will be done in the cloud or um actually yeah just in the cloud nothing to install all right so that's our github that's where we have all of our source code that's where exercises are gonna take place our hands-on parts so uh that link is available for you there uh we also have uh our cloud ide like you said nothing is needed to install so if you don't have an ide already that's fine we're going to be using git pod which integrates very tightly with github and we're able to load up the code base in a cloud ide that is virtually identical to vs code and make it super easy it allows us to to uh get an environment ready uh so we don't wait around for things to install we will have to wait around a little bit but uh netlify is what we are going to be using to host and deploy our app today so we are actually going to be deploying uh this netflix clone to production um and netlify is going to be the tool that we use for that it will be our global cdn as well as our serverless backend i don't know if i'm saying that quite right but some really cool technology there and finally for our database we're going to be using astradb which is a managed cassandra database in the cloud and we're going to be using the uh the stargate uh api layer for our graphql commands all right so as far as uh experience level this is uh designed to be um beginner friendly as well as intermediate level um everything you should be able to even if you have no idea about javascript or if you're just kind of stepping into this whole coding world you should be able to get through the workshop today you may not be able you may not understand every single nitty gritty detail uh but you should be able to uh to get through the whole thing and we'll walk you through all the steps um but uh obviously there will most likely be we expect a lot of questions so please ask questions um we do have a lot of content to get through so sometimes it might feel like we're moving pretty quick but you know two hours is not a lot of time to deploy a full netflix app so we're uh we're going to be kind of riding that line between speed and making sure that all of your questions get answered so uh please uh be aware of that and we'll get through it all right you know and just one quick thing i just see a couple questions coming in that i feel like we should address and some of our helpful uh uh attendees here are answering as well the session time it's it's about two hours right we'll try to keep that within the two hour uh time frame um so yes for those of you saying two hours you've got that correct um i saw a question i want to say it was artemix ask can i put this on my resume you know that's a great question i think there are a couple things you can do um especially as front end or you know full stack front ends we tend to have portfolios right now would i go off and say that i created this netflix app completely from scratch probably not um but could i put it in there and explain all the various components and what we did today and how how i use them and how maybe you know that translates into another app that i built or something totally um not only that at the end if you do the homework that we give you then you can get yourself a badge right those badges are verified um you know that is something that at least gives you a little bit of proof point that you went through this material and you did that so how you choose to use that is up to you but it's definitely something you can use to help level up your knowledge a little bit yes speaking of badges uh as david said at the end of the workshop we will assign some homework um i believe yeah it's gonna be fairly simple fairly straightforward and when you complete that homework and submit it we will uh um verify it and we will issue a badge as you can see the example here and you can use that badge to put on social media put it on your linkedin profile um just kind of as a uh a proof of uh your continued learning and some of the things that you um have done i think i don't know how many badges that we've issued so far it's probably it's over 500 now yeah i think it's getting probably getting close to a thousand right now because we have had a lot of popular ones lately so it's been a lot and we grade them all by the way yeah bring them on like you know yeah yeah definitely submit your homework get your badge yeah uh artemix asks if this clone will be close to the original netflix web version or will it be a little different it'll be a little different but it's it's designed to look and feel very similar um we are not going to be getting into the ui ux side of things today uh that is enough for its own several day workshop probably um yeah but the the video that we posted earlier and we'll put another link um that anya's video that this workshop is based on goes through the whole thing so um that is also available that link is also available in the uh github repo as well okay so and i do see one other quick one yeah from pranjal and then we'll get going pranjal asks how long do we have to submit the homework technically there is no limit but we ask that you do it within about a week um because we're actively watching for those so when you submit we'll try to get to them as fast as possible if you start going outside the week um we'll still see them and we'll still grade them um but the further away you get detached from the actual event um you know there might be a little bit more lag time so try to do it within a week if you can yeah because next week we'll have another workshop that we have to grade to so just uh if it takes longer than a week be patient we are going to be uh giving you a mission your mission is to deploy a netflix clone to production over a global cdn using a nosql database with paging and infinite scrolling and you have two hours so uh good luck and i guess we'll check in in two hours we'll see in two hours yeah see everybody and uh we'll just see how you guys do of course we're kidding um but what will be very cool is that uh we are going to do all these things uh in two hours and uh and we'll walk you through the whole thing brandon i was like what that's great as long as one person yeah ben ends the stream that's awesome it was a good joke yeah okay all right so first thing we're going to do is we're going to break our application down um and this is kind of kind of our basic structure we're going to have our user interface which we're going to be using react we are going to have our database where we're going to ingest content store that content and be able to retrieve it and then we're going to use the graphql api to communicate between our our node.js backend and the database so this is kind of our high level view of what our application is going to be this is this could be applied to you know any application um but we're going to be using it for our our netflix so first order of business is we need to have a place to uh store all of our data right we're going to be creating this netflix clone we're going to have um movie information you know the the title the the trailer all this different stuff and we need to have a place to store that information and we're going to be using astra db uh astrodb is based on cassandra it is a cassandra cluster in the cloud and it is a nosql database so that's what we're we're going to satisfy that part of the mission using a nosql database with astrodb so uh why don't we jump right into our first uh hands-on and we're going to set up this database so if you go to that link that you see on the screen i'll also post it in the chat you should also see the link in the github repo i'll go ahead and drop it too okay i'll spam that out for everybody oh looks like someone's beat me to it all right so if you follow that link you should uh be brought to the astrodb sign in now i know some of you have already be kind of pre-signed in that's great um i'm going to walk through it for everyone who maybe has joined late or has not yet done it um you can sign in with anything you want you can sign in with github with google you can with your own email it's going to be very simple i obviously have a account already so i'm just going to sign it with google uh when you first sign in well if it'll let me it just timed out one second yeah i just noticed by the way um that link that was just dropped um the netflix clone one ryan yeah that is not functioning not working nope and i have a hunch i'm gonna take a look at what i think it is i think i wonder if it's a fat finger did i mistype it yes it is [Laughter] yeah it's dtsx let's get the right one back out there yeah no worries about that yeah we know we we saw ryan ryan totally fat finger the link go to the link he's dropping right now you'll see that dtsx.io yeah that's the the ones he just spammed in the in the chat right now um use that link please sorry about that yeah sorry i to be it's funny i do that all the time and i like have to check it every single time now and i still i still do it sorry about that yeah dtsx the new link is in the the chat uh jeez all right it's embarrassing everything every time there's something there's just something i know this is live right if you have any doubt this is live session you know it's a live session vikram i'm trying it's hard yeah oh by the way for a plan select let's just say this right a friend select pay as you go you will not pay a thing yes right um you automatically are put into a free tier that's 40 gigabytes of storage you know like many millions of reads and writes and that rolls over every month there is nothing to pay there is no credit card to put in so just like page ago by the way this actually ties into the serverless question i saw a ton of people earlier ask what is serverless serverless essentially means that the database is effectively indefinitely elastic right so if you if you start out like these clusters we're going to start off today there's three node clusters that could expand up indefinitely depending on your usage now what we're doing and what we do in these workshops you'll never even touch needing to go past a three node clutch cluster but astra is serverless and in such it can expand or can condense completely uh automatically and without you having to do anything so that's really what's kind of meant by the serverless piece that's why it says pay-as-you-go but again for what we do since there's a free tier that's in there that gets rolled over you shouldn't you will not have to pay a cent yep yeah so select this the pay as you go as david said um i'm gonna someone asked for the github link so i'm gonna post that and when you create your when you start your account it will probably bring you to this screen right where you're going to create a database and this is where we're going to create our database so i'm going to scroll down i wasn't ready okay so we're going to create a database we're going to use the database name netflix underscore workshop underscore db you can technically use whatever you'd like but uh we prefer if you use these so that if there are any uh troubleshooting that we have to do we're you know reducing as many variables as possible and then the key space name is going to be netflix underscore key space and a lot of people usually ask what is a key space a key space is uh if you know relational databases like mysql or postgres or anything a key space is like a schema it's basically just collection of tables so we're just naming it netflix under underscore key space for provider and region you can select any provider you want and you can select whatever region is closest to you i typically do us east one on google but you can use whatever provider in whatever region that is closest to you and as far as these costs that you say that you see don't worry about that um it's free for you it's not free for us uh but it's free for you you get that 25 credit so you don't have to don't let this uh scare you it's not going to charge you okay i think just click yeah database and just again just i'm seeing a bunch of the pay-as-you-go questions yes select pay-as-you-go you will not pay a cent because the the way it starts it starts in a free tier um and with the amount of storage and region rights i mean we're talking millions of reasons rights you know gigabytes 40 gigabytes of storage you will not any come anywhere near touching that you do not have to put a credit card or anything so yes pay pick the pay as you go plan um no you do not need to enter a credit card um and uh ensure if you would as well because i saw some other questions come in ryan um that if you're following with us along in the repo the database name the netflix workshop db and the key space netflix key space which we're asking you to use today in those fields because the rest of the exercises are going to key off of those i'm going to make this big uh yeah it just has an anecdote about the cost um i don't have a special astra db account here i get the same 25 credit that all of you get and i have never of all the workshops that i've done have never touched basically touched it so i don't have a credit card in there either so you don't have to worry about it all right so once you have created oh abdul uh are you deleting the live stream after it ends no we save these live streams it will be available at the same link uh it is recorded um jordan we are still using menti for the quiz at the end um i have left up the the last question where you can put in what you want to learn but we will be using that mentee uh at the end so feel free to leave it open or close it and you can join later but all right so when you create your uh database you will see uh the status it'll start out as pending and then after a little bit it'll be active now it usually only takes a minute or so but we probably have uh close to a thousand people right now hitting it all at once so it might take a little longer than that um so just uh be patient let it let it run and while we are waiting for it uh we're gonna go ahead and create a security token now um the security token is used to authenticate our app's access to our database uh so this is quite important so pay attention i'll i'll go slow and i will probably have to do it a couple times so that everyone can can keep up so if you on the top left where it says current organization and it has your email if you drop that down and then click on organization settings and then token management right here all right william roberts it says ensure database remains active after uh use free credit you do not have to add a payment if you were to use this database if you were to create a database that you are actively using and it reaches that limit it may ask you at that point to add a credit card but you still don't have to it'll just cut you off at that amount right and then the next month it'll refresh the 25 so it'll never require you to but if you are using that much maybe you have a successful or potentially successful business working on it so that'd be good uh so that's why it asks ensure your database remains active um but you do not have to hopefully i answered that well all right so we are creating our token we are in token management and now we're going to select a role uh let's select the database administrator right here and then we're going to generate token and it will generate our token now uh for security reasons uh if you were to navigate away from this page you would not be able to access this token again um so you can download a csv do not have permission no did it log me out there i think it logged in yeah maybe i saw the same thing pop up in my screen so i'm checking it out [Music] oh some others have had a crash uh-oh okay i will uh i will hit up the team real quick just to make sure we're all good man two too many people we hugged it to death it's the reddit hug to death we'll get that fixed uh i'm just gonna maybe try refreshing wow i don't know that we've ever had this happen before i've never seen that one yeah yeah i'm talking to the team right now okay so we'll get on it all right uh so yes obviously it most people have had it crashed um if i guess this is a good time to answer any questions um while we are waiting for that to come back congratulations guys you made our workshop history yes it's not letting me end at the website either william when 700 people make an api key at the same time that's funny yeah garrett yes this is a cassandra instance um astra is a uh a managed cassandra cluster in the cloud so we are using cassandra if you're familiar with cassandra then you'll be right at home but we're actually using um a api layer called stargate so we won't have to do anything with cql or anything like that we're going to be using graphql in this workshop manish is data stack's yours uh yes i work for data sets we are yeah we're data stacks data stacks developers is the youtube channel that we're on um arjeet no previous experience with graphql will you face any problems um it will look interesting for sure uh i am i have more relatively recently um gotten into graphql but it should not be uh too difficult to get a hang of uh get the hang of so uh looks like i'm back uh so yeah um my mind did come back and then it flipped right back to the other thing but i am actively talking to the engineering team right now okay i'm just gonna do a quick refresh see if it sticks around for me uh from mod uh elaborated on graphql we will elaborate a bit on graphql when we get to that portion of the workshop yeah man it crapped out on me again [Music] unable to generate token yeah yeah we're we're having some issues with the the portal here so repeat database creation so uh for those of you who are still trying to create a database um if it's letting you in which would be great uh here are the database name and key space name that you'll be using when you create your astra account uh choose the pay as you go option it will not require a credit card you will not be charged you get 25 free credit every single month and uh that is more than enough for this workshop for sure i mean i've done many workshops on that same deal and i have not used hardly anything so create the pay as you go database use netflix workshop db as the database name right here and then the netflix key space as the key space name and then you can choose whatever region and whatever provider you want um usually we recommend choosing the one closest to you and uh then click create database yes manish perfect point that's right yeah we helped crashing it so that it can evolve yeah no you never know right you never know when you might run into something like this uh when you have so many people on so this is definitely one of those cases where uh if we clearly ran into a hiccup then we need to make it better um can we trust some apps clone bundle sellers do they really work i don't know what you're talking about probably not uh sonya do you receive any certificate we don't offer uh certificates per se we do have homework that we assign at the end and when you complete the homework we issue badges um and you can use those badges to post on your social media or um or like linkedin or something and they're really good brandon asks a very important question are hot dog sandwiches they're actually tacos yeah it's pretty surprising um can we integrate this technology with uh kate sandra and docker uh which technology astra maybe that'd be a question for alex and i don't know that he's on oh what's the question ryan uh can we integrate this technology i'm not sure what technology so uh uh can we integrate this technology with kate sandra and or sorry kubernetes and docker uh so we have kate sander which is cassandra on kubernetes yeah i'm gonna drop some links to kate sandra go take a look yeah the astra runs on a kubernetes control plane um this is actually something i'm funny enough i was answering a similar question in discord um and so uh you can you can take a look at cait sandra dot io it's open source um and that's that's something a matter of fact you'll find that data stack suite stargate is open source like all these projects and programs that we have um we open source a lot of the most of it honestly um so if you're interested to find out what astro is running on and how you can do it take a look at kate sandra i just dropped those links i'll just spam them again for fun there you go uh druvesh asks can you give a roadmap for becoming a good front-end developer wow that's a big loaded question um [Laughter] i mean i think you're on the right track already doing um these example projects uh just getting familiar with the different technologies react i like i am a react fanboy for sure um it just makes a lot of sense in my mind it does not but i'm not saying that react is the best uh it just makes the most sense to me and i think that's kind of key is figure out what what helps you like uh do the best work that you can do and just do a lot of different examples try different things and that's just how you get get better um to do uh please don't spam in chat milan uh yes the error is happening for all of us yeah we're working again if you're seeing that 403 or if you're seeing something like that uh we are working on what's going on in the back end here uh to get that up and running um so we do see it we do we do see it and when you do have questions uh and stuff please don't spam them like ryan just said um there are a lot of you here there's a lot of you know a lot of things going through the chat and if you spam it it actually makes it that much harder for us to keep track of the things that came before and such like that so again ask your ask your questions or make your statements but please don't spam them um how is astra free um well it's not free for us it's free for you um we are offering that 25 credit every month um as uh you know as a way to to make it easy for people to get started and and see the the the power and the ease of use of astra and cassandra in general so it's free for you any substitute for astrodb there are lots of different nosql databases out there i know many people have mentioned mongodb it's a pretty popular one uh we're using astra for several reasons um one is that's you know what we are known for um we're known for cassandra stuff and also it allows us to do um using that stargate api layer we can do a lot of different things that other standard nosql databases can't do um i'm just gonna refresh this let's see can you correctly pronounce my name probably not siddharth siddharth i guess at earth i know starts but yes sorry does react require any ide or can we type its code in the inspect element feature in a browser uh so react compiles into uh html and um javascript i mean you can there are add-ons to like chrome there's like chrome extensions where you can manipulate the components on the site exact uh like as you're developing but that just i mean that's just a um kind of a temporary you know tweaking thing that's you're not actually coding at that point ides are still needed i think code sandbox has react support perhaps i don't know i haven't used it i mean i've used it for some things but i haven't used it for react [Music] you mentioned netlifly yes netlify i guess i can go a little bit deeper uh yeah into now if i were trying to do something while we're waiting um so netlify is uh a a global cdn a content delivery network so it um hosts the uh the sites kind of on the edge and correct me if i'm wrong david i'm trying to explain this from memory because i don't know the yeah the sheet but it hosts sites on the edge of this network close to the users so you're not going to have your site if you're using uh something like netflix you're not going to have your site on a central server that everyone is hitting it's going to be distributed around geographically so that when you know when i'm using it i'm in the united states and i hit this site it's going to be somewhere close to me and if someone i know we have a lot of folks from india if you're hitting that same site you're actually hitting a different instance of it on a on a different like um uh server because it's hosted um distributedly distributedly uh geographically i like that distributed yeah it's a new one uh yeah and another thing to know about netify as well is that um you know it's based off jam stack right uh so jam stack especially for front end full end devs this is like an awesome stack to take a look at if you're not familiar with what jam stack is do google search for jam stack you'll find real quick i believe there's even jamstack.org but it's javascript apis and markup right so that's the jam part and netlify there are other services like that they allow you to employ jam stack to deploy your applications so the one we're working today like this netflix clone so you've got um you've got nullify that as ryan was explaining right is a global cdn right uses edge networks and everything so when you push the content out um that automatically fans out geographically around the world so as he said you don't need a single server right in the in the past how would we do web servers well we you know we'd have a data center somewhere we'd set up a server we'd install everything and everyone would go to that one server but things are at such a scale today and we expect things to be almost instantaneous um so we don't really have that luxury in a way um so services like netlify they essentially handle all that part for you the other part about jam stack is you are essentially building you're pre-building static content so when you build your site it's going to generate all the static pieces and everything so that way when it gets served it's actually serving sata content which actually meets makes it a lot faster than it would be if you had to render your screens in such real time um you might be wondering then wait a minute if it's a bunch of static content then how do i update my screens right how do i change things on my screens and that's where things like react come into play the serverless functions come into play um so you can still have this nice kind of interaction uh between what is traditionally back-end code and asynchronous you know updates to your website so even with a static page i can actually get real-time asynchronous updates that occur on my page so nullify essentially encapsulates all of this into a single service where you can deploy your app right out of github we're going to do that actually you can deploy your app right out of github and then it's providing this for you right out of the box so you don't actually have to worry about installing your code on a server you can just go to something like nutify and it's automatically gonna be all around the globe all right oh you know i see a question from k pratt's that i totally want to talk to here uh on discord says any big players that use data stacks that we might know of i love this one um so data stacks is the company behind a patrick cassandra right we've been we've been doing that since patrick cassandra became a thing really so it's been 10 11 years or something like that cassandra is used by something like 90 of all the fortune 100 companies um some of my favorite ones that are on this list um apple siri siri is backed by cassandra netflix is backed by cassandra spotify uber starbucks home depot low sony playstation um god there are so many more you know there's pretty much if you pick up an app somewhere um especially some of the newer disruptive apps on your phone you're it's most likely using cassandra on the back end um so that's where you know if you're curious about like where um data sex comes into play uh fedex is another one um pretty sure ups is on that list i'm trying to think of others yeah there and apple actually has one of the largest um cassandra clusters in the world it's many i believe like a hundred thousand notes or something like that it's pretty insane i wanna say alibaba is another one yeah there are a ton out there um that in fact use cassandra uh yeah i'll i have a there's a question i'm kind of going back in time and and seeing some questions uh uh oh did i just miss it i just lost it oh justin asks uh about react versus react hooks and which is better um not really sure the that that's the way to think about it react hooks uh if you're if you're talking about uh class-based components versus functional components i'm certainly more of a fan of functional components i started out doing class-based components but functional components i think are kind of the future it it's a little bit syntactically more awkward especially if you're coming from i guess class-based like uh type stuff like java or something but um the uh the functional that's kind of where they're moving yeah it's functional components hopefully that answers your question react hooks and versus react is not really doesn't really make sense because it's still react hooks versus redux uh are they mutually exclusive i mean i think there is a more recent state management thing that uses hooks but redux is really popular uh for how long can we use the astrodb account after the workshop is over as long as you want this is your account um seriously use it and make apps and um you know utilize that free 25 you're not going to even touch it for this one really um so if you have any app ideas or want to experiment use it use it forever i guess tomorrow the stream is going to be really smooth you know if anything sometimes the wednesday ones right you know these are the ones where um then this isn't a new workshop for us but these are the ones where we this is the first one the first instance and there is no doubt that sometimes come to the thursday one and we have smoothed out some kinks or something like that this actually what we're experiencing today is an absolute first we have done hundreds of these workshops and uh this is the first time we've ever seen something quite like this so we really appreciate by the way all of you bearing with us today and uh going through kind of like a question and answer session right now while we get this fixed um so yeah i sure hope so that tomorrow will be a lot smoother that's for sure yeah i i was it looked like it might have been working and then when i went to token management it crept out on me again ah man okay so some of you are are generating tokens okay i think i think we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel unfortunately that ate up a bit of time that did it by the time there uh so what is what is good is that the uh the github repo is designed to be self-service as well so if you know if we run out of time um it sucks but you should still be able to finish it and um and the homework will still be valid uh there was a question how long for the homework technically as long as you want we prefer it in the next week so that we don't get a huge backlog if you uh if you if it takes longer than a week that's totally fine it might take a little longer for us to to grade it okay i've seen some folks say they're back in and i am seeing that so far my screen is i think i'm good i think i'm good okay yeah i don't know if i am no okay i'll wait a little bit mine seems to be working it looks like it's it's coming out of it i just don't want to get too far ahead in case some people are still waiting for it that's right you know and just a couple things to address um while we're doing this uh for those of you we totally understand that you know this is the two-hour session and we intend to keep it within that time um and if you know if it's already getting late for some of you we also you know we understand in different parts of the world it might be getting late um then this session is going to be recorded right so the second we're done that will come back and as ryan was talking about earlier the repo itself is fully self-service um so you can actually go through this on your own time totally and then we're always here in discord right so you can always reach out to us in discord now there is another session tomorrow at the same time right so that's also an option um if if you'd like to do that now ryan i don't know about you um i guess if it comes back and we can move forward we could probably still try to get through the material but i know that people are probably gonna have to end um at the two hours for some yeah we will we'll continue on um we might have to end early or we might have to skip some things um i think there's a section that we can probably skip i just do like a high-level overview of it um but yeah and i am seeing a lot of folks saying that theirs look like they're coming back okay i'm gonna i'll strike i'll go over the token generation again for those who maybe have missed it um yeah and city boy can we get the badge if we watch the recorded one absolutely the badge is actually about doing the homework and getting through the material it's it's not only that you were here right we know you're here um if you do the homework and you show us that you got to the end of that good you can totally get the badge yes okay so if everything's working hopefully you are on your dashboard as you can see here to generate a token for our authentication we're going to go up to the top left where it says current organization and then your email i'm going to drop that down and click on organization settings okay and then click on token management we have to scroll down and then we need to select a role and we're going to select the database administrator and then we're going to generate token and what i was saying before or before i got cut off by this whole deal is uh this is the token that we're going to be using i'm going to go ahead and copy it to my clipboard but if i navigate away from this page which i will be uh i cannot access this token again for security reasons uh it only lets you access it this once so in order to reference it later go ahead and download the csv and this is basically just a csv with all of this uh all this information so that when i navigate away from this page i can still get that information from the csv by the way for some of you who are getting an error in your database that's okay if that happens given what we just saw happen there may have been something that happened just recreate it just go back to create database recreate it you can do the same name same key space and everything leave the one that's an error alone it'll go ahead and generate a new one for you that's no big deal yep um okay abdul and anish looks like uh oh okay and vikash still a few that cannot get in okay um well i know they're they're rolling through nodes right now so i have a feeling it's gonna you know have to go across um everybody so i'd say just give it a little bit more patience and again appreciate the patience already and it looks like they're they're all coming back online okay all right i'm gonna move on just in the interest of time um yeah as as we've said before it is recorded we do have another session tomorrow and the the github has all the steps okay so let's move on uh we've created our security token we have our token value i've copied it to my clipboard i've also downloaded the csv um now we're going to create our tables um in uh with the graphql playground so if i go back if i just click on the big logo at the top bring me back to my dashboard uh yeah and i will say if it's still uh erroring out for you feel free to just while you're waiting for it just sit back and watch try and learn as much as you can just by watching um and and hopefully when it does come back you'll be able to uh go through it very smoothly uh so i'm going to click on the connect button to the right of the netflix workshop db uh database that i have actually i guess you can't see that here it is right above david's head click on that and then i'm going to select the graphql api on the left side here all right because we're going to be using graphql api to manage this database i'm going to go ahead and launch the graphql playground by clicking this link right here and this is a unique link for each one of you it's for your database specifically so i cannot drop that link for you if you're still seeing a 403 just give it a little bit more time as they are getting through all of the problem areas it's just going to take a minute all right uh when you guys are at this screen this graphql playground why don't you give a thumbs up in the chat just so i uh know that i'm not going too fast uh justin if you go to the connect tab so um if you click into your database on the left here and then there's a tab at the top connect and the left side you can click on graphql api and then launch the graphql playground using this link um just real quick i'm not going to go there but to go the token management you drop down this organization drop down on the top left and go to organization settings and then there will be a token management section all right getting lots of uh thumbs up and dabs it's good to see all right we're in the the playground awesome first thing that we need to do is authenticate this uh tool and we're gonna do that by clicking on this http header actually i need to make this bigger don't i dark mode yeah a little better yeah harder to read right ryan can you can you explain a little bit what graphql is what graphql is uh it is a yeah i mean i'm sure you could probably do it better it is a query language um graph query language uh that man i was not prepared to do a overview of it um that allows us to create tables uh add data you know just like you would with like seek uh cql or sql um but it uses a very different structure i guess yeah it's it's a it's a query language that for one you can use natively in javascript right um it it also allows you um to access more than one data source so you're not limited to you know to a single database or something like that um so it's actually kind of nice because um let's say that you are trying to construct a query that uses multiple data sources well you know in one way you'd have to go to each individual data source have to pull the data out maybe do something in your application with those with graphql you can actually do that right there out of the language and query across the data sources and such in in that single language so it's it's it's definitely adds a lot of query power if you will especially to javascript because you can do it natively in javascript um so i would you know i would say that it is it's yet another api um but it's on the newer end and it's definitely something to check out uh for those of you who are you know full stack front end developers uh when you're working with databases yeah and as someone asked earlier uh about like not having any experience with it it will look way different than what you're typically used to for um apis or like a rest api or or a query language but it's but it don't let that scare you um it is fairly uh easy to get the hang of once you dig in uh all right so to authenticate we're going to click on on the bottom here there's the http headers go ahead and click on that and this is where we enter our token you see the populate me part you can highlight that and i'm just going to paste in my token there again if you need to reference your csv file you can go ahead and do that and that has authenticated this uh this session uh gandar still seeing status pending uh it might take a little bit obviously we had that issue um that might pick up there yeah set back a few things um yeah there are a few that are still pending unfortunately just in the interest of time we're gonna keep going feel free to just watch um and and learn as much as you can and then when it comes back you'll be able to go through it um much faster so apologies for the for the hiccup and the delay there all right so we've authenticated our tool uh and we're going to go ahead and create a table using graphql and this is the uh the mutation so mutation in graphql is how we edit data and this is going to be the create table uh mutation so i'm just going to go ahead and copy this right out of github you can do the same there's a little widget up here that you can copy i'm going to go ahead and highlight that and paste in this mutation so just to go over a little bit we're going to create a table we define our key space netflix under course underscores key space so if you use a different key space name this is what you would need to change this here and then the table name is we're calling it reference list right and you can see that also referenced here reference list is what we're calling this whole mutation so we're saying we're doing a mutation we're calling this mutation reference list this is the mutation we're doing we're creating a table we're defining the key space name uh giving it the the key space that we have already created we're giving the table a name reference list then we have the if not exists equals true so if it already exists it's not going to do anything pavitra if after the after the token after you've gotten the token we're gonna go to the graphql playground um which the instructions to get to are in the github repo uh and that's where we are right now uh partition keys uh we don't really have time to get into what partition keys are uh but this we're defining one of our um columns basically to be a partition key and then the clustering keys as well um we're defining a few columns to be that and we don't have time to really get into what that is it doesn't really matter right now i think and then we're going to click the big play button uh and it'll it'll kind of give us this uh reference list true means uh we successfully created this table oh a mutation critique a mutation essentially is just when you're making some kind of change right you're mutating the data so maybe i'm inserting data or i'm updating data or something like that that's a mutation yep and if we're just reading it it's called a query and we'll show you that in just a bit all right so we've created that table using graphql uh now we're going to insert some some data into the table so um once everyone who is who is able to do it um has done this step and successfully created the table give me a thumbs up because the next part uh that i'm gonna go over um i i really need everyone's attention because it's can be it can can cause some hiccups if you're not following along uh server cannot be reached on playground yes so you need to authenticate this um so push we see your message you need to authenticate it by going to http headers down here and entering your token that you generated it'll say populate me just replace populate me with your token here and then it will authenticate it and you and the server cannot be reached message will go away all right authentication error in creating table again shashank you probably need to enter your token in http headers where's the mutation code all of our code is hosted on github on the github repo um and that's what i'm talking about uh i'm on i just finished step three in part one okay so let me let me give him the link to step three there you go yep so link to step three oh you got it thanks cedric okay cedric beat me too wonderful all right yeah and i'm just copying this directly out of the github repo so feel free to do the same yeah oh yeah for the token you do need the astra cs part uh that is part of the token so if you just copied the text itself um then you're gonna need this part thank you uh thank you siddharth all right so i saw there was a lot of thumbs up um i'll give it just a couple more seconds this next part can be a little tricky if you're not following along so i want you to uh to watch first and then we'll go over it and you can follow along because you're gonna have to you'll you'll see why yeah and uh kamal uh if you get in if anyone gets the error that says unknown key space netflix key space um one be sure you don't have a typo because i did that myself earlier today and i had netflix sticky space two if you didn't create the key space name with the key space name we gave you in the instructions earlier and use some other name you're going to need to use that name instead right so if you did not use this is by the way why we set you up and we say hey please use this database name and this key space name in the instructions because that way later on as we're going through the rest of the exercises we're going to reference those if you use something different just use whatever you used and that should solve that issue yep and yeah right over here this is where you would change that if you use a different key space name you're going to need to change this if you if you misspelled your key space name you're going to need to change this all right sami raju what are partition keys and clustering keys they are something that we don't have time to get into today but we do have a workshop called introduction to cassandra that goes into exactly what those are uh i would recommend we also have a crash course uh pre like a pre-recorded produced version and that goes into detail on what those are not really necessary for today's workshop uh okay so i'm gonna move on up at the top we have another tab this tab is the graphql tab currently we're in the graphql schema tab that's where we create tables and everything we're going to the graphql tab so switch over to the new tab to this tab over here and we're going to need to authenticate it again so if we click on http headers you'll see populate need populate me needs to be populated again and actually i'm going to go back to the schema tab to just to copy this because i have the other thing copied i should have you do this first so again just watch for now and you'll see what you have to do so we're going to a new tab we need to populate the token with the token again so that's authenticated and then this is the tricky part up at the top you still see silver cannot be reached because in this url up here that i'm highlighting it's pointing to the wrong thing here hold on let me uh let me make this bigger i have to make it a little smaller to show okay so see how it is pointing to system right here we need to change this to netflix key space to netflix key space right did i type that right so you need to change the url at the top to point to the correct key space and you need to copy in your token all right so we'll go over it again you're in this you're in this uh tab right now um if you go to if you go to wow i'm i'm just doing all sorts of different things there we go i'm trying to i'm trying to zoom out here we go all right so if you go to the other tab if you go to the other tab graphql tab you need to populate the http headers again with your token right so go ahead and do that and then in this url at the top not the url of your web browser but the url of the graphql playground at the very end you need to replace system with your key space name which we are using netflix key space all right give us a thumbs up if you have successfully done that i know that can be tricky so i wanted to make sure that everyone understood all right lots of thumbs up awesome i'm glad everyone followed all right so we're going to copy in some data into our tables uh so this is a collection of a bunch of different um uh genres movie genres right so we're gonna have a lot of different genres in our netflix clone and this mutation is inserting genres to our reference list right so insert to reference list and then we have all the values um that our label is genre our values action anime award winning children etc right i'm just going to go ahead and copy this whole block and paste it into my playground and i can just click play and it should return uh all of this giant object with all the different genres that i've added all right so it should be pretty easy just copy paste uh now we are going to move down and let's uh let's retrieve a list of values so we're going to go ahead and do this query so we've been doing mutations right we did a mutation to create the table and we're doing a mutation to create all the genres to insert all the genres now we're going to do a query and the query is going to uh retrieve all of the um genres so we're saying uh we're creating a query we're calling it get all genres uh we're referencing the reference list table and we're giving it the values that we want so the value anything that's label genre give us the value of right that makes sense and i'm just going to highlight all this delete it and paste in this new query and when i execute that it should give us in our values array value action anime award winning children and family all of our uh all of our genres are returned so this is querying our table that we just added all the genres to and we're getting back all the genres make sense all right i know i'm probably moving a little fast but we are definitely behind so now let's create another table we're going to create the movies table so we're going to go back to the schema tab right which is where we create our tables and we're going to copy in this mutation we're going to create table in our key space uh the table name is movies by genre so i'm going to go ahead and copy this in here so you can see movies by genre is the name that we're giving this and then we are giving um our our columns right so we have a column as our partition key obviously we can't go into detail of what that is yet but we're going to create a column called genre we're going to create a column year title synopsis duration and thumbnail right and the thumbnail is going to be our uh our trailer videos that we'll we'll have playing autoplaying remember netflix always out of place all right so we're going to go ahead and execute this to create that table and you can see that movies by genre is true and so we have created that table successfully uh now we're going to insert values into the movie table so this is the mutation that we do for that we're going to move over to our graphql tab i know we're going back and forth but remember the schema is where we create new tables and graphql is where we uh both insert data and query data so we're gonna go over to this tab and we're going to insert movies um here and this is going to be uh our sci-fi i think this is all of our sci-fi uh data so you can see for example the inception mutation here um you know we're inserting into movies by genre and here are the values our genre sci-fi the year is 2010 title is inception the synopsis is the synopsis you know we have this description here the duration in minutes we have this number 121 and our thumbnail is a reference to uh an mp4 hosted on imager that will autoplay when it's up and then our value that's returned is the title which will be inception so i'm going to go ahead and copy this and paste it in here and if i execute it we should see all of our data the inception prometheus aliens and blade runner has been inserted all right i know i've been moving very very fast so i'm going to go ahead and pause here to address some questions adomas i have no idea what is happening i i i apologize um so we're going over this is graphql which is a query language and basically allows us to manipulate data in our database and we're using graphql to both create tables which is what we've done in the graphql schema we're creating tables here and defining the columns uh that will still store all of our data and then in this other tab we are inserting data into those columns and our columns are here genre year title synopsis duration and thumbnail and this is the data that we're inserting into those columns hopefully that you know again just to add on ryan so pratik asks do you need to know something to understand graphql i mean any prerequisites well you know just like any query language if you're not familiar with the language itself um it could be hard to you know just look at it and know what does it actually mean um so there are a couple things you can do ryan if you wouldn't mind on the very right hand side in the playground there are two tabs one called docs one called schema so what's really cool here about the playground is when you open up those tabs they'll build in a content context sensitive way um they will thank you ryan um they will give you documents and show you what kind of apis what methods you know like what things do you have available so you can kind of use that to help understand what can i do with the data right um i'll go ahead and drop the link that i had in before about the graphql.um there it is yeah um i i think it's probably good to take a look at that site and here let me go ahead and drop that graphql.org here it goes aditya the mutation is the graphql word for editing data um it's both for creating tables and inserting data that is just the kind of the keyword that it uses to say i'm making changes right now yep that's what mutation means i know it sounds crazy and different but that's just that's all it means oh yeah is there a difference between query and mutation yeah so mutation is when you're making a change a query is when you're just reading something right if i'm querying something i'm just going to read and see what what's in the database or what are the results where the mutation i'm inserting or i'm updating i'm mutating the data in some way uh philip asks if i make a mistake how do i undo it or do i have to start over it depends on what the mistake was so if you can elaborate on what you did um i will say though if you made a mistake in data the cool thing is with cassandra you have upsets you can just reapply the data right um so if you let's say you made a mistake and you did something you you put something in a column you didn't want to you just reapply the statement with the fix in that column and you'll be fine uh bellagi asks is graphql specific for cassandra or is it a standard for all nosql databases it's certainly not specific for cassandra it can be used with a lot of nosql i don't know if it's a standard for all of them um yeah i know some nosql databases have very specific uh query languages that they use what is thumbnail thumbnail is uh the the picture that is behind the title usually uh we're using videos so that they kind of show the trailer siobhani uh per your error make sure that you are in the graphql tab not the graph schema tab i believe that might be what you're seeing there yep and i do i think i did see a question of what the difference between these two are so the graphql schema tab is where we edit our schema we're going to create tables we can do uh we can uh delete probably we can delete or truncate tables here this is where we're basically creating um schema levels changes and then the graphql tab is where we're manipulating the data in the in the tables themselves so we can insert data and we can query data ryan do you see that question from jordan halliday uh where do you get the page state we were just talking about that earlier oh yeah we were we were so you're a little bit ahead of us uh that is actually something i was going to skip in the interest of time but uh the page state will be returned on this side uh so this is where you're typing in the the graphql queries on this side the the results your page state will be returned and you can use that page state so you can just highlight it over here copy it and use it on the query side to get the next page um so i know you are you are ahead of us um and that's totally fine uh but hopefully that answers your question obviously i can't show you specifically because i'm not there yet you know one thing i just want to say real fast by the way pedro fpv in youtube asked where did it go i mean i've seen this question come up a couple times could this workshop rely on instead of cassandra are there specifics that would force one to choose you know choice over the other from a from a technical standpoint as the workshop the code could you modify this to work with the document database and you totally could um but case in point netflix is actually a huge consandra user um and reason being you know we travel a lot a lot of times uh you know in our job and if you've ever started like a show in netflix let's say in one part of the world and then you fly to wherever else it is you're going and then you can just pick up where you left off left off it's completely seamless and one way netflix is able to achieve this is because with cassandra cassandra allows you to scale indefinitely um and not only that you can you can have you know replication across like a geographic you know you can have a global database really is what it comes down to um and that means if i'm making changes over here in this part of the my data center is per the this part of the world they'll automatically be propagated at the speed of wire over the other ones um it scales um extremely well it's actually one of the things cassandra is known for so to me the case and points netflix actually uses cassandra for for netflix right um so could you make this app work in yes you could you're not going to get quite the scalability and the performance you're going to get as you will with cassandra i can't say for sure you know i i'm not one of the netflix engineers i can't say that's why they do that but yeah so you can make it worth but that's you know it's just not going to get the scalability um that you're going to get and that's a big reason why netflix uses it right i'm going to go ahead and continue on obviously we have quite a bit to go through and i just want to go through this quickly so we're going to retrieve this is an example of querying those uh those movies that we just uh inserted so we're going to query movies by genre and we're going to get all of our data from there so if i just copy this over to here and i click the play button you'll see that we are getting uh you know we have our title prometheus the synopsis of it the duration is 134. so we're getting all of our data from this query and we're actually getting all the data from um everything that where the genre is sci-fi right because we said um you know get all movies by genre where the genre is sci-fi all right now there's a part uh paging so i want and i know we're kind of uh making this uh decision on the fly and david you can uh let me know what you think in the interest of time i'm thinking maybe skip the paging thing um yeah i know some people have already kind of gone ahead of us and and done it that's awesome i think we're going to skip it for the workshop part because we're we're very short on time at this point um but this just as a quick overview this was talking about how to query um a certain a limited number of of data points and then saving the page state so that we can query the next batch of them uh which is used for the uh infinite scrolling and eases up on the database okay so we only inserted um a few things i'm do david do you think we should skip the bulk load data as well we have some data in there that's yeah we do have some data in there i believe we could be okay with that just remember if we do skip this now just the interest of time for those of you who are going to go do your homework so you can get your badges you are going to want to do the data loading piece you're definitely going to want to do that um but yeah i think we're safe to skip it for now all right uh we're gonna skip to step nine in the interest of time but this is where we're gonna get all of the all the movie data it's all in this csv and there's a way to upload bulk upload all that data philip asks a question about where did uh the synopsis has come from where that information come from in step 7a this is the uh insert data uh thing that we did and this is where all the here's the synopsis for inception right here here's the synopsis for prometheus right here so this is where we inserted all of that data this is a step 7a okay so i'm going to go ahead and skip the csv stuff this is just to uh upload all the rest of the data all right i'm going to go real quick back to the slides to talk about the next part which is how we're deploying this so we have created the database we've inserted information into that database we're using the stargate api layer and graphql to manipulate and access that data now we are going to deploy to netlify as we've said before netfly is a global cdn that hosts the content uh kind of on the edge of uh the network so that it's close to the end users it is not a centrally located server that everyone is hitting and what that means is uh that um it's very very scalable right so you can you can host you can handle a lot of traffic because it's going to be distributed through uh over lots of different nodes if you will um so we're going to be using git pod to uh uh for this part um this is a as i said before it's a cloud cloud-based ide that integrates very well with github so we're going to be manipulating the uh code directly and then netlify is going to talk to astrodb directly so let's do hands-on number two finally and do the uh deploy to netlify so i think david are you uh prepared to do that part yeah let's do it all right give your fingers a rest and i'll start answering questions as well right right and i should you should already have my screen so i'll just wait for it to uh pop up here you are up and running okay there's lag that's all okay great um all righty so what we're gonna do is we're gonna move to part two as ryan just said let me go ahead and get all of you the link oh art of mix um when we said we're going to skip so what we did right um and let me know if i need to make this a little bigger i'll try to blow it up a little bit more here if my there we go um so what we did is there is a data loader uh section i want to say that's step nine load a csv data set we just skipped over it as what we did um so we just skipping over for now because we wanna try to get you to all uh happy paths since we had to you know spend a lot of time uh earlier um so so we're just skipping this for now now the good thing is we've loaded some base data already in graphql that's what you were just doing when you created some of the tables then you loaded some data with the insert statements the mutations and so we do have some base data in but for the full complete thing right you're going to want to do this step 9 that you see here um we're just skipping it for now that's all we're just doing that for time but if you go back and do the homework right that's going to be part of it and then you can get your badge and everything so all right so i'm going to go now we're gonna come down here to part two deploy to netapp i'm gonna get you all link and let me go part two [Music] part two boop boop boop all right yeah pavon we already this this application does use react yes it does okay so we're going to follow the instructions here and and you know i'm just going to go down try to go to a pace where everyone can uh keep up and everything like that now you'll notice in each of the little sections here they have these little these little drop downs right um so i'm not really going to you know go into many of those but you'll see cases of these show-mes we have these nice little animated gifs in there um so if at some point maybe you're doing this on your own or whatever if you're not completely sure go to the show me right the show me is going to kind of show you show us going through the steps so you can see it as well but i'm going to do this with you so the first thing we're going to do is just deploy to netlify now key thing you either want to right click and say open a link a new tab middle click control click whatever it is for you but the point is you want to put this in another tab unfortunately markdown does not allow us to put a target equals blank in there so i can't automatically do that but you'll want to open that in a new tab and you should see a page that looks like this what this is going to do is this is going to take our it's going to create a new github repository it's going to take everything out of this repo the code and everything the netflix app and it is going to automatically deploy to notify and create you a brand new github repository right so the first thing i want to do here is this connect to github why because i needs to authenticate to my github now if you're not familiar with github it's a source control uh tools there's things like github git lab right github is one you know in the development community it's used you know it's i think it's the largest used source control uh site out there right um if you don't have a github account it's probably a good idea to get one it's really good too um to have one for your portfolio right and to be able to share code and stuff sign up is free and everything so if you don't have a github account go ahead and sign up but if you do you say connect you say okay well i want to authenticate and now you're saying i'm allowing netlify to go ahead and create my new site so leave this name alone it's going to go ahead and create a new repository called workshop graphql netflix in my account right so we're creating a new repository in your own account so i'll say save and deploy okay now this is what's there's something seriously cool that just happened right now and i i have to i have to labor this just a little bit nellify has literally now copied this repo with the application in it and it is automatically starting to deploy this app on a global cdn and do the whole thing for me right it's this is really powerful stuff and cool thing about it netify like astra if there's a free tier i don't have to pay a thing matter of fact i've been using this all year um and i can't tell you how many of these workshops i've done i've never paid a cent right now mind you as you start to actually go to like real production use that's where that comes into play but it's they're a really great service especially if you're trying to learn things like jam stack like we talked about earlier okay so now once i get to the screen right and i'm deploying my site i want to click on the site to play in progress this is where it's going to give me you know essentially any of my deploys or anything and you'll see this here you should see this main at head what is it talking about here well if you take a look at the github repo the the main branch is that the main default branch that everything's going to go into right i didn't tell it to do anything else it's going to default to deploying from the main or the trunk whatever you're familiar with there um and so when we said deploy it's actually going to deploy what is actually what is in the main of my github repo that's what it's doing right now right so if anyone if any one of you are familiar with doing things with npm or whatever since this is a node app with react and such like that and you use npm you know then it's actually installing all the dependencies right so you can start to see um some of these kicking off right now actually so you'll see all of the logs come through it's saying okay it's deploying the site and by the way by the site what am i talking about right so if i come up here and if i do this if i look at the github repo itself notice there is an app in place i have functions i have my source right so the app this clone we've already built it right it's already here so it's literally taking this and deploying this code come back down to where we were okay all right so hopefully if you get to a point where you see this where you see the site is live netlify build complete give us a thumbs up let us know that you're there i did see a couple or at least one that said that the build failed um if you if you go to the deploy log where david is right now uh it should give you a uh an error and if you let us know what that is and we perhaps we can uh troubleshoot it for you nicholas my github my nickel uh my github repo is empty so if you click to your github repo right away and it hasn't finished the new deploy it's not going to have anything in it yet right so you have to give it a moment and let it finish this first initial deploy because it actually has to transfer everything over from the parent repo over into the new repo um but as long as you get to this point then you should be able to go and take a look at the github repo you may want to zoom in a little bit david oh yeah okay are you talking about this one yeah i'll try to open that up a little bit that dark background makes it a little like it you make it bigger than you think i think you know and kita that's an interesting one um failed to prepare repo i've never actually seen that happen here's what i suggest um i would go and i'm going to go to my github repo anyway just for i'm going to go there in a second i'll show you this so just um um yeah just watch me ankita and i'm going to show you what to do aditya totally i got it um okay so what we want to do next after we get this netlife build complete right um is you're gonna go up you're gonna see you have this this link up here right i'm going to click on that it's going to just bring me back to the site overview for the site we created and notice here it says deploys from github if i open that in a new tab that is now the new github repository it created for me what i want you to notice is notice it's my account this isn't the parent data sex devs one it's my account and it's actually created this now for um let's see for in quita if it said fail prepare repo like i said i've not seen that i don't know how familiar you are with github don't everybody do this this is only if someone ran into an issue um but what you can do is if you go to in the github repo itself if you can get to this if you go to settings at the very very very very bottom again don't do this unless you ran into some issue with the repo and it says delete this repository just follow the steps there delete the repository and then go back through the steps over here i've like i said i've never seen that particular issue in netlify and a lot of times if i do run into something and it's with the repo itself i'll just recreate the repo with netlify and it seems like it's all good okay let's see are we doing on the questions there uh pretty good i know cedric's very active in here um i see a question from shivani shivani what is an ide so we're going to use github here in a moment an ide is just a development environment really um back in the day we used to juice through everything directly in the command line or in vi or emacs or whatever in like editors um now ides are these fully integrated platforms where you can code and have a terminal and have plugins and all sorts of wonderful things we're gonna use the id here in a moment okay so hopefully you got to a point where you built the site you saw the site build and you've got your github repo now this is very important this next step from now on we want to work out of your repo right not the parent repo the data sex devs one your repo so i'm just going to bring this over here so i can work off of it because for the rest of the work we're actually going to do out of your personal repos why because your repo this is something that was really cool when we did this deploy to netlify thing this now linked the repo that was created to netlify anytime we make a change now to the main branch it'll automatically deploy to netlify this is so powerful so that means as you're coding if you have an app deployed this way and as you're coding as you make those changes you can automatically be deploying and getting redeployed out to your cdn so it's really awesome so again just make sure i'll belabor it make sure you're working out of your repo minus sonic dmg that's my account it'll be whatever your account name is okay so on the next part here um it says on step two clone your github repository well guess what netlife just did that for you um so you we're already at that point now at this point this is where we want to launch our git pod ide and that's where i was be laboring make sure you're out of your repo because as you do things if you do amount of data sex devs repo it's not going to quite work the way you expect you want to do it in your own repo so what we've done though is we've kind of really belabored this here in this whole section but the gitpod button is where it says click here to launch gitpod right you'll see a button in here now something for brave users i'm actually using brave um so i know this is not going to work off this button i'm just going to do it the manual way if you're in chrome or whatever you should just be able to click that link it'll automatically launch your gitpod repo and it'll take a moment to load everything up it's actually going to load up all the initial dependencies and such but notice though uh oh what happened here oh no something went wrong not found error if you're seeing this and you're a brave user it's it's because this kind of referrer link doesn't work in brave that's all it is um to fix that what you do is you need a reference to your repo so i'm actually going to copy my repo link again this is only if you're in a browser where this doesn't work and where it says that https github.com i'm going to replace that with my site if i would only hit the right key there we go so notice that it's got the hash after github.io hash that is my repo and then that should load up just fine um again for those of you who weren't using something like brave you're using chrome or firefox when you click that button it should automatically have done this at this point gitpod is actually launching in the cloud it's automatically going to download all your dependencies and everything it takes a moment to come up and then we're going to have the full ide the development environment that we're going to work in from there all right so if you've gotten to a point where you have something like this give us a thumbs up you want to do oh i can increase the font size yeah i'll i'll increase the size sorry about that you know funny enough i had it zoomed in the other one and then i didn't um here let me let me fix that real fast do this come down to where we should be here we go all right we've got the button let me know if the size is better i see lots of thumbs up great job keeping coming awesome all right then eventually uh yes we should see yeah it says opening ide here it goes there it goes all right yeah i should start to see a screen that looks like this i'll go ahead and blow this one up a little bit and you're gonna see down here it's already it's already doing the dependency installation it's doing some initial setup something else that's really powerful about git pod by the way um is you can you can configure it to do a lot of pre-setup for you so for workshop it's great you know because we can give you an environment that has everything going but if you're working in a development project with your team and you you have all the dependencies pre-install themselves then that way when somebody else is working on they just launch and go right it's actually kind of neat from that standpoint oh dark mode how uh maxim you know i changed that a while ago and now i don't remember how i did it i yeah i bet you it's in the preferences or something i obviously maybe the settings i honestly don't remember changing the i did it so long ago now real quick i'm gonna answer a question from william who's having trouble finding the get pod button so i'm switching over to my screen to show step three there's this uh click here to launch git pod just drop that down it's hidden and we hit we hit it because we wanted to make sure that you were in the right uh repo so just drop down the click here and there's the button and uh do you money i'm seeing a login to get pod screen yeah so you do need to be logged into your github account to use github gitpod is used out of github so you need to log into github um you should only need to log into github once and then once you're once you're launching git pod from there it should it should be fine oh anthony found the the thing for uh the dark stone mode cool ah yes uh jordan if you're getting a not found error it sounds like you're probably using a browser that does not support the referrer link uh capability here's what you need to do launch still use the button launch it into a new tab and you're going to have a url that looks something like this notice the hash and then https github.com you need to replace that with your repos address so replace it with your repos address so where it says hash from that point on replace it with your address it should look something like this then use that that will launch the yes same thing for you adita if you're seeing no refer or found it's the same exact thing this is why by the way in the instructions we say use chrome or firefox um if you're not using one because it's unfortunately the gitpod button is not supported in all browsers across the board um so if you're using a different browser you just have to do it the manual way so it should look something like what you see up here again this github the gitpod.io hash and then the name the link of your repo and then if you do that you'll get something that looks like this cool thanks jordan thank you for letting me know let's see and i'm going to show come on hello yeah go ahead thank you yeah got it it's uh it's under the click here drop down yeah so under launch get putted yeah and get pod is wonderful in a lot of ways um as far as the speed as it takes to get the dependencies that varies right so if you're if it's still sometimes it takes a minute right and i recognize that some you're like wait a minute you know it's not there yet um obviously in lieu of time we're going to have to keep going you could always go back to the video and and kind of do it but yeah sometimes uh sometimes get pod does take a minute it just depends like matter of fact this right now is actually going a lot slower than it normally does so that's you know that's one of the things you get when you're in the world of the cloud in some cases like you know you can't always be 100 on the pipe or how many other instances are using the same you know hardware or whatever under the hood but generally it's really good so that's why we use it william is all this up after git pod is up oh oh is all of this after get pot is up yes i'm still waiting for that's right i'm still waiting for the initial pod so you see all of this where it loaded all the dependencies and everything mine just got to a prompt now and then after that i'm gonna move to step four here let's go ahead and drop that one okay i said tip four but i meant step four yeah dts something is downloading and it's not downloading directly to the terminal but it's actually downloading so there's kind of a joke uh npm kind of downloads the whole internet uh so it does it looks like it's downloading like all the things in the world um and it is so what happens is in um you know a javascript a node app like this you're going to have something called your package.json it's going to have all these packages right so all this stuff here all these are the libraries that we need for our application so when you first start this up it's preloading all this it's actually getting all these dependencies for us so we don't have to do that part and that's what it's downloading right so yeah it kind of downloads the world a little bit okay so what we want to do then is we want to go to step four here and do this npm install g netlify cli what is that about so now what we're doing is now that we've installed all the base libraries and everything on our app we need to add the netlife cli so we've got this link between netlify and our github repo that's awesome and matter of fact everything we're just about to do you could do from the netlife ui or with github actions and so on and so forth but what we're going to do in the next couple of steps is we're just going to use the cli which is a command line interface that's what that means so it means now it's going to open up capabilities that we get to do here at the command line that's what this is talking about so the netlify cli is just giving us the ability it's just giving us the ability to run some of the commands that are coming up okay oh i'll zoom in yeah let me zoom in more on the vs code see if this is a little better for everybody there we go okay okay by the way if you see all these things about oh vulnerabilities things like that all these issues that's npm don't worry about it it's okay um yeah it looks it makes you freak out right you're looking at this thinking that everything is broken in the world and it's just how npm works okay yeah a pratik um if it's been stuck at starting for a while you can try to load a new one that's fine um you know usually it just it just means it's taking a moment you can always try to load another one all right okay so now we've installed the nullify cli great now the next thing we need to do is we need to go back and we need to get our token so if i go down to step 6 here notice it says create.enb file so i'm going to copy this into my buffer now what does that mean well in order for us to be able to talk to our database from our application i need an environment file dot enb file that's like a default that's used um pretty much in most most javascript frameworks that i know of right so what there's a couple different ways you could do this the way i'm comfortable with it in the way i'm going to do it is i'm going to say touch dot env that'll actually create an amv file notice now a dot env file showed up in my directory my file explorer i'm just gonna double click on that boom i've got the file if i paste in the values that i just copied here from step six and don't forget to save by the way um want to save you can also turn on auto save there's an option for that right now this isn't done yet right notice i have to put in my token and my endpoint so the token we already did that before so we want to use the same tokens that you used before and we'll paste that in there and then your endpoint well remember that graphql this is the graphql endpoint remember the graphql oops wrong one wrong place it's over here the graphql playground we're in before this one specifically the one for graphql not the graph schema graphql i'm going to grab this this is my endpoint and i'm going to paste that in here okay so these two things make sure you save and as long as you have that your env file should be good to go you know cedric it's not in mine i i i have to turn it on explicitly so i think i'm missing a configuration in my get pod yellow oh make sure um siobhan make sure you have a space between touch and dot env yeah if i were to try to do uh yeah make sure you have a space there like you see here okay so hopefully now you have a file that looks something like this next thing we want to do is we want to say npm install i'm going to say i'm just going to copy that in it's going to install the world again oh saruba is already ahead of everybody wonderful okay all right so no no worries william no worries no we see it yeah i keep i'm trying to see kind of um i'm trying to understand william where you're at all right i am going to move on a little bit i know we've got 10 minutes left so i want to i want to make sure that we at least get to nullify dev this launcher app this is the next important part now to be clear this dot env file when we set this in our application what are we doing well remember in the playground here we authenticate our token zoomtype and then we're able to use our graphql endpoint to then what you know add tables add data read data things like that this is the api this is the interface that we're going to use to talk to our database on the back end so notice i have the same values here in my env file and this application is going to use that same endpoint to again read things and change things and such in the database so when i say nullify dev there we go now notice ah see it applied the environment right it's applying the environment here and it's going to start up the app and hopefully you see something that looks like this right notice that i have an app now here's something key if the database configuration was wrong you would not be getting any videos this this data is coming from our database now in your case since we skipped over the big data load part you might be only seeing like a small subset of this but if you're seeing anything at all in here that means that you have good connectivity to your database right that this is actually working and doing its thing now if you've gotten to this point give us a thumbs up let us know you're here i see some questions that are coming through in here and i want to see if we can answer some of these oh alex um let's see alex pepe in discord where do you find your end point yeah so if i scroll up a little bit okay notice here so there's a couple different ways you can do this um i kind of cheated and i just went to the graphql playground we were working in however if you go back to your aster ui you find the database that you're working with so netflix workshop db in my case i have a ton of them you probably only have the one if you go to connect let me go ahead and make this bigger okay if you go to connect this is for those of you looking for your endpoint go to graphql api right here it says launching graphql playground uh actually let's see yeah you still have to yeah you still have to edit it yeah here it is yeah just scroll down a little bit right um but you'll find it see this is this is if you notice what this is notice the value here this is exactly what i had grabbed out of the graphql playground right so i just went here because i already knew it existed and grabbed it but you can go to the connect piece and say hey if you're going to write data or whatever then use this one yeah william go to our discord um if one of the team can drop william the discord link perfect thank you whoever's up there yes oh wonderful thanks ryan yeah go to our discord drop some screens we can help you there yeah wardenson if you only see netflix at home is it normal let's take a look at something i have a hunch i'm going to go ahead and kill my app again i'm just doing this to troubleshoot something real quick let's let me invalidate something here let me break something and see what happens because i have a hunch um warden said i have a hunch all right let me break this and let me try to relaunch i have a feeling i'm gonna have a blank netflix app i think that's what you're seeing because i should not authenticate it'd be funny if it worked like how did that even happen you know waiting for the refresh here yeah uh okay i actually get a flat out error um if i if i invalidate my key or if i have the wrong endpoint or something like that um i don't know if you're i would think so because it does need to talk to the database but yeah lord of sabers please yeah just put your screenshot there yeah and if you only see pam if you only see thumbnails for sci-fi that's probably because we skipped the data loading step in lieu of time so if you go back um through if you're going to go do the homework and you go to step right here yeah yeah step nine load a csv data set in part one you'll get all the rest of the data right so since we only we we skipped that you're only going to see some of the sci-fi stuff um and things like that all right so let's see what happens now i should be good yeah there we go i've got my data back wonderful okay make sure so for those of you who are having trouble with the getting stuff to show up in netflix make sure your endpoint is correct notice my endpoint here is that same one we used in the graphql playground then netflix key space right api graphql netflix key space if this is not the correct endpoint then that's not going to be able to talk to the database correctly uh the token is a string but you do not need to put it in quotes if you're talking about in the env file notice mine is just a string i don't need any quotes or single ticks or anything sorry if i butchered your name for the homework you can just reuse one of the other video links uh that we've used for like inception or aliens or whatever that's not really important just the the other information the description and the synopsis and stuff that should be the uh the custom stuff so you can use just copy one of the the image or links from something else uh philip moss where did the play button and more info buttons come from so so that is already in the app um those are components uh react components and you can feel free to to dig into the app uh code itself and see where those uh buttons are defined um obviously we did not create that in this workshop that is um something i think anya goes through in her video uh which is the long form you know from square one from scratch stuff she goes a lot more into the ui ux side of things um we are really just covering the data side of things here um so um sashankar nullify dev command not found what should i do sounds like you didn't install the cli that's exactly what the cli is doing for you so when we install the nillify command line interface what we're really doing is we're now giving access to things like nullify dev network login and so on and so forth so make sure that you have installed the netlife cli at step four here npm install dash g notify cli that should probably clear that up i hope you're excited for this video now michael butts you say now to make a back end for this here's what's cool all right there is a back end already and that's exactly what's responsible for getting all these videos we haven't really talked about it here again this is where you get into surveillance functions but in this functions directory notice you have get genres and get movies this is the back end funny enough this is the part uh matter of fact i should show you let me deploy mine real quick so what i'm gonna do uh you know part of your homework is now to go through the rest of this from step eight on right now i'm gonna go ahead and do this real fast um like super fast so you could try to keep up if you want um and see if that goes but i'm just going to do it like real quick because i want to show you something that's really important and then we can get to the mentee and everything but this is what i'm going to do now is actually part of the homework so i'm going to go fast again don't mind me as i do that all right i'm just going to pop through these so what i'm doing here by the way is i'm logging into netlify with my account the one that we created earlier i'm going to let me minimize this down i'm now linking this app i'm linking what i'm doing here locally to my netlify that we deployed earlier again this is all in the instructions right i'm not doing anything that's out of the instructions this command here is telling networks this command here is telling netlify i want to copy the environment information from my.env file and i'm going to put that i'm going to import that into nutlify that's important because when you go to actually deploy your app to prod it needs the same configuration information and then by building it i'm actually just if i didn't build it netlify would build it on its own but i'm just doing the build here locally and so it's a way that if you want to you can kind of shortcut um you know if you're already building locally and such and you want to see how that works from the local build you can do that and then you can just push that up to netlify and again i am speeding this is part of the homework i'm speeding through this because i want to show you something in particular um this nullify deploy dash dash prod something i want to point out about that is normally i would not use dash dash prod normally i would just say nullify deploy that will actually do um here in netlify it'll it'll do like a pre it'll preview it'll be able to deploy preview and it won't just deploy right to prod what i just told it to do was deploy right to prod so um you know if you really want to do that that's fine that's not the way i would probably do it i'd probably do a deploy preview first but you notice right here um it went pushed it but also noticed that it didn't have to do a build why because i'd already done the build the last thing here is this open site it'll well then it's linked it knows where it is so i'm actually going to go open the site and notice the url difference i'll put this in a different tab so we can see it notice this this here this url up here right this is my site if i go to notice right here this is my netlify site this is me actually pushing this right now why did i do this even though this is for the homework well what i want to show you is going back to something in the instruction here so remember i was mentioning that it imports the env information so that command grabbed my env file and this is really neat this is i love this part about it um i almost for a moment kind of forgot uh no i need to go site settings there we go site settings so if i go to my build and deploy again you don't have to follow me on this i'm just showing you to my environment check this out that command injected my environment variable values into netlify why is this important you never want to store this kind of stuff out in the open ever right you don't want to hard code this into your repo nothing like that so by injecting the very the very the values from my env my environment variables into nutlify these environment variables are protected right so later on when i have my serverless functions and if i take a look at my functions here you'll notice i have get genres and get movies just like i have here okay when i deploy these i don't have to put any of my authentication credentials on the open that's being stored in a safe secure way inside of netlify so that one little command is actually seriously powerful and now um these guys can just authenticate you know obviously you have to have code in there that does that that you know talks to them but it makes the transition going from local to production pretty darn seamless is is what it comes down to so it's actually really neat uh here you go notice this process.enb astrodb application token that's your astrodb application token right so it's using the values from the environment variables right there in the function and i don't have to do anything special other than just inject the environment variables up to netlify using the command here right so it's it's you start to get the flow of it and it's really powerful stuff but i just wanted to show that to you yes yeah the command just injects it that's right that's right yeah you've got it right okay so the homework by the way um i guess so at that point by the way for the homework the end goal what you're trying to do is you want this you want to get to a point where you have your own production netlify deployment with your netflux clone going and we'll know that it's working because we see that we see the data here this tells me you're talking to the database if i see these videos i know you're talking to the database right also at the very very very bottom you'll see this extra resources section and this was anya's netflix video so for those of you who really want to get into more of the ui components the react pieces that that piece watch on this video and go through it and and struggle a little bit honestly go through the video and struggle a little bit so you can you can kind of get the feel and flavor of how to actually build it so then you can combine what anya is doing and what we're doing to get the whole end-to-end package okay all right so what do you think ryan i mean how are we doing on questions um i see some but i'm not sure where we are in answering things yep okay yes yeah i'm gonna matter of fact we can drop the homework link directly here it is or i can just you know remove it completely yeah yeah that's right um someone's saying they can't hear you yeah so i you were echoing in my mic so i muted myself sorry about that everyone let me repeat uh so the error with netflix uh only getting the netflix logo is because your env file is probably not formatted correctly make sure that it is the application token and the end point uh without quotes so the the token and the endpoint should not have quotes they should not have brackets they should just view text and uh do um do a money there are two different ways you can get your end point one if you go to the playground right when we were here at the graphql tab you actually had to this is the end point right here this is the right endpoint right and by right i mean writ not like the correct endpoint but both are correct technically yeah so this is one way to get it or if you don't have this handy if you go back into your astra ui and you picked your database okay i've got like a million there it is you click on it and you go to the connect tab by the way this is all in the instructions in the readme okay um so you don't you shouldn't have to watch this to see it but i just want to point it out go connect and graph ql api if you scroll down a little bit um to the right you want to write data that's the key thing you want to write data here it is right it's going to give you the endpoint as well it will tell you what that is so that's where you can get that for the application talking token at token walter again if you go back either to the playground and you have your token down here in the bottom of the http headers um if you don't have that um then you need to either get it from your csv uh if you did not download one then you'll probably need to create another token right so that's where you would actually come back over here to token management and create another because once you've as ryan talked about earlier once you've created a token you can't go back in for security reasons and go get that in the system you either have to download the csv or just create a new one so you can come in you can create as many of these as you want you can come in here create another administrator generate a new one and use that token if you need to and william uh i saw that i saw your uh screenshot in discord um you're using the dot uv dot sample don't use that one just create a new file env and copy the uh the variable definitions from the git hub which is just the two the token and the endpoint and follow what david was just saying about getting those yep and we're gonna critique we are just about to we're gonna do the quiz and for here's this it's not a certificate here's how you get a badge to get credit for today do the homework in the link for those of you asking how do you submit at the very end it'll tell you just click on this link it'll submit an issue here in the homework and it'll give you it'll it's a nice template you can just fill out please do not though when you submit your screenshots we just need to see the end deployed app we'll know that it's working do not submit your astra token because that's a big security thing um you don't want to do that because that puts your token out in the open so just make sure your image doesn't having an image by the way that looks like this with your netlify live site and these and the videos will know it's working we'll know you've done it so you can literally submit this image um not mine but yours you can literally submit your image and that's fine uh you'll also see here um you know if you to watch we really suggest to watch the anya video and go through um and and trying to do that also you want to insert a movie of your choice into the database as well um so go ahead and just do those things again the homework will have a link for you to submit so homework we talked about this a little bit uh you're going to import a movie you like into the database with graphql um you can emulate step 7 to do that uh and also as an optional watch the anya video if you were more interested in the react and uiux side of things she's gonna go into much more detail on that so it'll be a great resources resource for that um i think it's like two and a half hours long um yeah so go check that out all the info is is in the github repo so if you uh need refresher on what the what the homework is that is all uh specified in the repo as well um we have a few resources for continued learning academy.datasacks.com we have a lot of courses there that you can go through some certification level courses so you can go there and check that out we also have datastax.com dev which is another place for for some um self-service courses as well uh community.datasacks.com is a place that you can ask questions specifically about cassandra and some of the like astra and whatnot it's kind of like stack overflow for cassandra um so that is a good place for a community obviously we do have our discord um but you can also ask questions uh as well and our youtube channel which is probably where you are right now uh consider subscribing we do these workshops every week we do multiple workshops a week if you want to be notified when we go live or of upcoming things you can subscribe to our youtube channel and we are offering uh free certification vouchers uh for attending today's workshop so if you use the link uh that you see on the screen or you can scan the qr code i think i'm gonna try and drop that in uh the the chat as well but you can use this for uh vouchers um it's valid for two attempts at 145 value each uh so it's a really good um really good way to you know get certified for cheap for free um so you got you can go to that link um it should be open um if it's not open right now oh awesome uh if it's not open right now it'll be open soon um it's only open for
