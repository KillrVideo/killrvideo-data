streaming but you stream the splash screen yes with nothing else okay okay cedric yes can you hear me yeah uh there was a lot of eco at some point and i was under the impression that it was broadcast in youtube which but that shouldn't be right i yeah i mute my youtube so it should not be the case now okay mine is not muted then i don't hear anything so it's okay but at some point i hear a lot of i heard a lot of screen freeze so maybe you can start the loop with the video i don't have a loop i mean they're starting soon that should be it i don't have it okay sorry uh i thought that was it because i i have the countdown video then which is one minute one minute and 15 seconds right yeah i think they can hear us which is totally good okay yes hello everybody we will be uh we are live but we'll look at your screen in a minute so there was indeed some glitch with my setup which i still can't seem to understand oh good all good as long as i see myself on youtube in a couple of minutes i'm good yeah we will be there you will be able to see us very soon hello everyone hello everyone we need to to take our best voice hi everyone hi everyone welcome we will start soon five minutes to go it's a full packed agenda guys you sound like indian by speaking geez yeah that was that is a funny way to enter right yeah never did that it's great so everybody today it's week three of a program of three weeks so it'll eat the latest but you can find the recorded the recordings of the two first session in this youtube channel and i think you know what i will also share the link with you something that you can bookmark if this is the first time you attend click on the million link editor okay we are back i was just uh hi we are again i was just uh we are back i was trying my wonderful powers with the sound we are here and we are ready to start so let us start with some introduction [Music] video the same page [Music] [Music] uh okay here we are for real hi everyone welcome hello everybody okay [Music] okay okay wow people are on fire that would be hard to to keep track with only all of you today so okay let's get rid of this echo okay uh no it's good no i think it's good sounds okay now okay uh sorry i'm seeing the different opinions on that okay i muted so okay um still echo for me or for only for me that's for me so let's see how about now how about now better echo it's fixed yeah we made it okay great you made it i did nothing so yeah i muted a few things here and there but it should be okay so welcome everybody now you can hear me good and you can hear cedric as well hi cedric hi stefano so happy to be here for yet another workshop for two hours we do have a full pack agenda we will play with netflix today so let's get rolling okay so shall i switch to your screen there you go yes yes please you are on okay so today uh um yeah so hi everybody i'm stefano i'm in the developer team and today we will guide you through this fantastic adventure it will be an amateur indeed okay so this is week three week one we did and twitch but twitch is really just a backup uh we will monitor your question on the youtube chat and also on the discord room here is the link of the discord room we would rather use the discord room because there um we can take no it's easier to have a 101 conversation because on the youtube chat and you might already have seen it's pretty hard to keep track okay so live on youtube question youtube and discord it's an interactive session that just it is not only two heads moving on screen we will ask you questions and we will play games together you will have to answer questions and if you want for fast you can win some price prices in the end so stay with us until the end to win some swag t-shirts cup uh and stickers you will do amazon and and yet you don't have to install anything we have you covered all the source code all the slides all the exercises are in github and we will share the link with you we will use a real database and this database is free to use because we will never reach a limit of 40 million queries per month uh you don't have to install an ide we will use gitpod which is vs code in the cloud if you want to run that on your vs code that's okay and the last net netlife okay as the two previous week we will keep deploying our frontend application in netlify for you to have a full working application for free okay so how does the series work so we are together for two hours of live stream we will play games we will do ends on i just say that in a minute in the end we ask you to do some homeworks and you might say oh why do i win to get my homeworks you will get some badge so there is no certificate to attend the session but if you complete the homework you will wait the badge so here you see three badges for three weeks and if you completed if you complete the four uh the three weeks the three homeworks you'll get the golden badge so if this is the third week um you attend so almost there you almost complete the golden page and we will probably ship you a real sticker of this global golden page to you okay but we have even more yes even more oh let me shoulder even more and we will go back to mentee we have opened a lottery you can win 3 500 bucks gift card on amazon so how do you win that well here is the url of a form you need to join us there are some multiple steps you need to do to complete the form and each time you do one thing you will get a point and the more things you do the more points and chance you will have to win so complete one of the homework one point and so you can have three points like that uh share about the series on linkedin or same platform social platform at one point write a blog post five points and build your own app with what you've learned over the past three weeks ten points so the competition is open uh again for ten days uh so it's your chance to win even more real money okay that being said i told you it was an interactive session so you know what we will start by asking you a few questions i guess right stefano yeah absolutely so uh first i want to ask you if there are echoes around because i think i fixed everything so so as cedric was saying we will have us a quiz later in the show and uh okay great thank you for the feedback but first let's uh let's uh start with a few introductory questions so um as you see here we we are doing we are asking you questions through mendy.com so i would i would jump to my mentee doing these exactly so if this is the first time you attend open a new tab on your brother uh go to mentee.com or even and enter the code on screen or or from your phone so there is this code here okay please enter go to mandy.com enter this number this code 62793278 and you should be able to enter so maybe somebody can drop it into the chat let me show it again 90. yeah 6 2 7 9 3 2 7 8. so okay see you are entering the competition so these these first questions are just to warm uh warm you up and get you connected to mentee and to get some feedback on on who are you so sure we can start let us wait for somebody more to yes so once you are on the page i think you do have a thumb up to click on these menu yeah you get the thumbs up and we know how many you are yes and as of now let me move myself yes indeed asan as of now no uh no question we are waiting for a player or uh people to to join the the phone so you can see the number to enter also on the top of your of your screen here okay so people are joining in very good okay okay so let's start uh okay so somebody asked for the qr code maybe you can oh yes okay sir okay i once again you can also tap scan this code and get in absolutely so again for uh juan um just go to mentee.com enter the code or scan the qr code we will ask you a few questions yeah okay and i yeah let's go let's let's go let's go okay so uh let's start first question were you here last week for the ticktop app workshop which was episode number two of this three episode series so okay i see wow i see many of you are new to to the series that's no problem because every episode is mostly self-contained even in that case we suggest you to go and fetch the previous episode because they cover different topics and they might be of great interest to you to build your app development skills so okay it says invalid code okay six two seven yeah put you back the code again yeah the code is written at the top of the screen three two seven eight i think you should be able to jump in also in when it's started already so okay so let's move to the next question yes uh this is the important question no did you do the week or one or week two homework did you well this does not apply to those who didn't attend but ah so even here there are many more no's good that means you have exercise ahead to to refine your skills because as a cedric say explained every every session comes with homework which you can do to get badges and also to well get knowledge which is in principle even more important right so okay okay so it's good to see that there are so many newcomers so okay so let me stop here before moving to the quiz time uh let me jump again to the slides yes for the mission of today right cedric yes so i think my screen is live right yeah it is okay don't worry if you did not complete the homework or if this is the first time you join it's a self-sustained workshop so but hey in the beginning we just need to know how many of yous are with us by three weeks okay so let's get rolling um we need to be on time okay so your mission for today is pretty simple right as the title stated your mission is to deploy a netflix clone to production over a global cdn using a nosql database using paging and infinite scrolling and you have two hours which is more than enough right so good luck and see you in two hours bye see you of course we're kidding yeah we will do that together exactly we are the teachers so let's get rolling so today we will build a front-end application the application is written in javascript hosted in node.js as as we tend to do the user interface is built using react.js and for the backend to interact and retrieve all the data we will use yet again an api which is new is we are not using a rest api anymore but the graphql api and i will explain you in a minute what it is and as usual we are working with a real database okay it's not mock data we will have real data somewhere store on the database okay so this is the overall architecture of our web application you are using a mobile browser or web browser or even a progressive application that will connect to our application netflix clone right here i put some little screenshot for you it's running on node react as i told you implement it with html css and javascript and we will interact with the back end the backend use astra db we will explain you in a minute what it is using that graphql api so exactly the same schema as before but more detail by the way the slides are also on the github repository we are sharing everything everything is free for you today so what is graphql graphql is a way to expose some apis so some functions over http you know what rest api graphql api or even grpc apis all use the same protocol http but the payload and the way to interact with the http server is not the same in graphql you will describe your data there is a real schema based on your the description on your data you can retrieve create read update delete data and you can define exactly what you want to retrieve so how how does it what does it look like okay so if you see here the screen and by the way i'm not reinventing the wheel i took this screenshot from graphql.org this is why you see that link on the bottom on the top right hand corner so first with graphql you invoke an hd you invoke an http endpoint and by shaping your request you will retrieve exactly what you need so that's super interesting uh over rest because now if you are working with limited bandwidth like mobile phone or you know 4g well you can exactly uh tell that hey for my screen i and my hero maybe i only need the name and the f and the mass and nothing else even if in the database there are others filled you define exactly what you need part of the query and you will do that no later than in 20 minutes with a real graphql api okay so one thing to know is you can shape exactly what you need in your request second the endpoint have some auto discoverability if i give you the url of graphql endpoint you will be able to ask for a please list me all the types all the functions all the methods that are available for me to use and it's completely different from rest okay so go on big big strength of the graphql and last point of graphql is by executing a single query a single request you can do something that we call federation you can have a piece of your data coming from multiple sources and this is the graphql api layer to aggregate the data and push that data to your customer this is this is called graphql federation um in two hours pretty hard to go up to the graphql federation but i promise it will be uh presented as in in in depth in another incoming workshop okay so what is good with graphql graphql is taking the world why first discord availability and documentation i don't like to read the doc you don't like to read the doc everybody don't like to read the doc so if i can invoke the endpoint and the endpoint just exactly tell me what are the function available and how to invoke them hey that's better and you're sure that's the the documentation is in sync with the code because it's the same custom payload i told you you x you invoke exactly what you want match the json http center now it's not 100 uh the best thing first in a graphql you have a single endpoint so it's pretty hard to do versioning monitoring sometimes complex to implement if you have to build your own graphql api by yourself could be it could be tricky uh but to use super easy to create not that easy good news for you you will have to use an existing graphic api we provided that to you so the use case to use graphql is backend for frontend and this is exactly what we want we do have a front end we want a fine fine-tuned back-end to do exactly what we want composition aggregation with the graphql federation and you can use that when the bandwidth matters okay uh a lot of slides to start with but hey we will go pretty soon in the end zone right last slide is how do i use graphql and i promise you will use graphql in 15 minutes and i will put you in front of a tool called graphql playground okay when you interact with a database and data in the graphql playground there are two endpoints one for the data definition this is the first circle graphql schema this is where you will define your table create table and that's it and the second tab called graphql only graphql is for something called dml data management this is where you will insert some data so the first part of the of the workshop is initialize the database so you will create a table switch tab in third data in that table switch tab again create table number two switch tab again and insert data in table number two hope having this precision even before starting will help you i told you that a graphical endpoint will give you all the schema types and function available those are available on the right part of the screen see docs here the little rectangle in green you will create your query on the left part click on the triangle to execute the query and get your response output on the right side and i mean that's it let's let's let's do some demo and work with that together yeah okay great so very good i think this introduction is very important to know what we we are going to do in a second thank you so let me switch to my screen so i can show you is what we are going to do so okay first uh okay first thing let me show you this this is the repository that we will use today so let me drop the link into the chat to the youtube chat so this is the repository we will be using today uh it is hosted in our data stacks devs account and you can look at it and this will indeed provide all the instructions for today so let's start looking at the repository first thing is okay there are some questions but let's jump to the point i want to point you to the existence of this part homework so i will i'm also past pasting the link to this in particular because this is a question that is recurring homework instructions are in the rib and the repo and you find them there exactly you know stefano let me copy one yeah one million links to the team no problem okay i'm here okay okay so this is these are the instructions for the homework and we you will see later what it is and when you did when you do the homework you take screenshots and you upload it into github as an issue okay so let's start as cedric was saying we will start by creating an instance in astrodb so what is astradb astrodb is a product by datastax and it's a a database offered as a service built on apache cassandra that we will use today as a backing database for the application uh let's see let's look at the instructions there is a link to uh unless okay cedric is pasting the link i guess so okay so you click to this you click on this button create astrodb or you go to the link anyway and you will be required to register if you didn't already to create your free database that we will use today so i want to stress that it is free so it is very handy because it you can use a real big powerful performance database without taking care of all of the operations all this administration so you you can create a database here and use it today and also in the future and there is a very generous cap of the free tier so you can actually run uh small business workloads with within the three tier limits and by the way you will get a free allowance of request and storage every month renewed every month so you can start using it and you most likely will never reach the point where you should have to pay just to make it clear okay so let's say you are registering it it will ask you for name email etc please do it in the meantime i'll in while you register that should be very quick you will end up with so i'm already registered so i will show you my logged in window you will end up with such a screen so i have my dashboard which lists the various databases that i have because i already have some but that's not that doesn't that is not for today so uh okay so let's say you have created your astrodb uh account and you will see or there are also more detailed instructions here in the in the repo what what you should do today is create as it's in as it in written here you should create your database for today which will host the netflix uh data the next netflix information that will be given to the front-end application right so i click on create a database or you probably have to do it while you create your instance because you start with one database at least and what we suggest so let's see register i see somebody registering so let me get to creating the database and then we wait a little so what we suggest uh okay so i'm trying to make my github window as large as possible as readable as possible i hope it's big enough for you to see yes so people are waiting for the db2 to to start okay pretty good question from muhammad safi yes astradibi is free okay you it's there is a free tier so if you do not use 40 million queries per month it's totally free okay it's called the free tier so you won't be asked for any credit card and it's totally free for you you know do not worry about that yeah okay so back to back to us i create a database with the name of netflix workshopdb as instructed here and i create a key space called netflix underscore key space next thing i have to i have to tell astra where is this database created so you can choose any provider you want let me choose aws and you can you have to choose an area in a region so i'm in italy so i will choose europe and frankfurt but obviously you can do whatever you prefer probably you want to choose a location a region that is closer to you for latency yeah but technically speaking or yeah it's financially speaking no change okay that's just where the database will be created yeah just the best practice to have as close as you but you know it does not change anything else especially because we are deploying in a cdn so again there is not this much dependency on the on the latency and don't please don't be fooled by this uh payment information because that is that are the theoretical charges that would apply if you ever went beyond the very generous monthly allowance and i i can promise you there are there is no amount of netflix or clones that will make you go beyond this ever so this is so i click my create database and the dashboard is showing me okay my other databases don't don't mind them and the dashboard is showing me that this netflix workshop db database is in the pending state and it will stay in the pending state a few minutes because behind the scenes astra db is provisioning my database as i requested so i think this is a good moment to wait a bit and as you get your database up and in the pending state so up and pending please give us some thumbs up so we know that you that you reach that point so let us look uh did you see questions that we want to say to to answer aloud uh i i i can say a word about a good question i was about to answer on text we had a question sql versus nosql why you why are you using nosql and such so spoiler alert next week the session we will do is introduction to nosql databases things you need to know is no sql means not only sql so some nosql databases are running on sql nosql really have been designed to scale in the first place so the underlying architecture is different from a traditional rational database to be able to scale more easily so you know netflix is using a lot a lot of uh cassandra on this channel we do have a talk from the netflix tech lead engineer explaining all the use case that netflix is using to cassandra so hey netflix is a big user of cassandra so let's use the same database as them yes okay yeah that's a good point so i've seen a lot of thumbs up so i think we are good to proceed and let's go i think okay so you can see my database in the meantime as we speak became active so you can see it's a it's still a bit small perhaps but if i make it bigger i have to scroll but anyway you can see it's active here so it should yeah sorry now i just say it should take two to three minutes to get active because hey we are starting for you a real distributed database so you know be passion let's wait for two three minutes for db to to be active yeah another question is is this workshop going to be recorded yes it is you can watch it later at the same link this is true for all of our workshops so if you head to our youtube channel you can see all our previous videos there for you to watch at your pace and you can follow along and do everything uh at your rhythm afterwards so yes uh okay so let's say your database is created and is active now it's time to [Music] create a security token which is the next step that you have to do so what's the point uh okay you have your database there but you this access to this database is sure not open to anybody so you need some credentials right some some way to authenticate yourself and make sure and make the database trust you and make you make it make it uh good to speak to the database so it's a consider that you might need a username password authentication but in for a more secure and more standard way to authenticate between services what you usually do is you generate a token what does it mean we are now going to the astra db interface we create a security token which will be then given to the application so that it can speak to the database authenticate in itself so it's like a password authentication right okay so to create the security to create the the database token you go to your dashboard here you click your current organization and you go to organization settings okay that brings you to an administration page where you can go to token management here right and this is where you can create and destroy tokens why why would you ever destroy a token let's say it's compromised it's not used anymore you want to revoke it for some reason you can go here and you can make it invalid so you can destroy it but now we are generating a new token now for this application to work you need to generate a token with the administ with database administrator role here so the role is database administrator and you can click generate token now what is happening astrodb is creating a secret and it is sharing the secret with you to store it in a safe place on your on your computer for example and then you will later give this token to your application which is then which will be then able to speak to the database right now an important thing is that this token you will be able to see these secrets you are seeing now the secrets on my screen you will be able to see these secrets only once as you navigate away from them from this page you will never see them anymore this is for security so what is very important is that you download the token in the form of a file a csv file so please do that you are in this page you created your token with database administrator role okay i will copy the token because this is the only thing we need we will need the token itself which is i hope you can see it it's a string that starts with astro cs colon and then there's a long string of letters and digits this is the whole token including the astra cs part so i'll i'm going to copy it somewhere for later use but you you never know what happens to your clipboard right so please download the token here you see i'm prompted to save a csv file let me save it so whatever happens the file is there for me to use later okay so let's see okay where to map the token to the database joy dip that will be shown later just keep your token after generating it make sure you have it and let's move on because we were we are going to use the token in the very next step okay so i've seen somebody done token and saved it so i think it's safe to go ahead step three okay so as cedric was explaining this database is there for me to use so i go back to the to the main dashboard of astrodb here yours is probably going to be to fit in a single screen but mine i made it much bigger for you to better see so let me go to let me choose my netflix workshop db that we just created and i click on it so what are we about to do we are about to uh yeah we are about to con to play let's say to go to this graphql playground and start doing some graphql queries on it for now we are doing them manually in this uh playground interface offered by the astra ui but these are basically the same kind of queries and they use the same graphql language that the application will later do so now we are doing them manually just to get to get a taste of how they work but these are the same queries that will be later embedded into the application code okay so to do that click on connect here and you will see that there are various ways of connecting document api graphql api rest api that's because your one database that you created is actually accessible in different ways at the same time we today we play with the graphql api we use it so let me click on graphql api here which brings me to this graphql api part now i think my screen is even too big for anything properly to show the graphql link i think i have the opposite problem as a david right okay so using the graphql api you will see that here below launching graphql playground there is a nice url here and this is different for me and for you everybody has a different url here because it encodes that particular database that is yours so open this url preferably in a new tab so we keep this open for later and you are and you will end up in this view let me make it a bit bigger again surprise surprise here come the graphql playground here we go and that's exactly what sedek has shown you right so at the moment i want to draw your attention to the fact that you have two tabs here one is called graphql schema and one is called graphql and each one of them supports different operations schema is for ddl operations so creating tables and similar graphql tab will be then used to read and write data in the tables and those are two different endpoints so it it's important to know that you which tab you're working in so let's go back to the readme here and we have to go to graphql api we go we open the playground and we go okay this is now let's start with the schema part because the first step is to create a table now before doing anything you see this server cannot be reached here well that's because yes the url is the right one but we didn't yet give the token so we we didn't authenticate so it's impossible to reach the database because it's there's a closed door here so let me grab my token that i pay i copied before or you can open the csv you downloaded the important thing and this is very important and it's a source of many much puzzlement go to these you see at the bottom it says http headers click on it and it will expand a section where you can set the headers so you see there is an x cassandra token populate me now if you replace the populate me with your actual token ha did you see the graphql schema endpoint does not give a server unreachable error anymore so we are actually speaking to the database and this is very nice because as cedric mentioned before there is this this issue of the this discoverability indeed if you now click here you are able to access schema and mutation so schema and documentation which is now available for us but let me close this somehow how do you close it here okay okay okay so uh now we are in the graphql schema tab that means we are in the right place to create tables for example and this is what we are going to do you see there are two panels i i leave this visible for all to see this header part so so on the left panel you would write your query then this is the big play button in the middle executes it and on the right we will see the results so let's have a look at the first mutation to execute i'm just copying it and pasting it here so i hope you can see it this is a mutation meaning that it is an operation that writes something or changes something in this case it creates a table and this is the graphql syntax to create a table in the underlying astradb database so what happens if you click execute well it worked the fact that it worked is reflected in the fact that this reference list true in the return true means yes i executed it and reference list is the name i gave to this mutation to execute you see reference list here yes i executed it true and that's it now the table has been created and this will be the table containing the genres of the movies you see there is a label and a value and you will soon see some example of the values of the rows we are inserting into this table okay so you copy the mutation on the left you click execute and you see the result make sure you inserted your token on the bottom left in the headers otherwise you will get an authentication error obviously um can i interrupt just sure we got a great question asking so these graphql stuff is also part of the datastax uh platform uh and yes you know as kirsten said in the chat before we would like to have as many people as possible to use the apache cassandra databases and so the platform astradibi not only not only have you the database ready to go but also the layer of apis for you to build application because as developer what you want to do is just building the app who cares about how the database doing these internals and this is the purpose of these three-week series make you build up so we are starting first with the db but with the db also come the api and this is why we use that path yeah yeah absolutely okay so we have the table and let's jump to the next next step in the instructions inserting data in this table so now it's it now it's important because we have to switch from the graphql schema tab to the graphql tab so from the tab that makes us create tables and change the schema of the database we jump to the tab that makes us read and write data in them so make sure you copy i can't hear it doesn't okay so you let's switch to the graphql tab which has a different url now there are two important things to do one is again we have to make sure the token is here also because it is a different tab it has a different token setting so make sure you paste your token here as well in the populate me part not only that i have to make it a tad smaller not only that but you have to replace the system part in the url you see there is a url here next to history well now that that has in the last part of the url says system and that's not correct because we have to put our own key space which is if you remember netflix key space now you probably might wonder what a key space is this is not even that important today but it is the way for astra db and for cassandra to group tables together so usually one key space corresponds to one application in simple simple cases at least so okay two important things to do replace system with the name of your key space here and make sure your token is there now let's go getting the mutation that inserts rows which has a different syntax than before so this mutation is to be copied and pasted here and you can see it's a it's a list of repeated uh items each one has a name and it's an insert of a particular row in the database with a label and value which were the columns of the table and i'm doing all them together and asking the graphql api not only to insert the rows but also for each one to give me back the value of the column called value which is the upper case here action and email and etc so let us send this this query this mutation to the graphql api and it seems that everything worked because we get back what we asked for so value value value and here we are action anemic award winning and so on you see so we actually inserted rows in the database in particular in the in the table called reference list containing the genres nice shall we wait for um um i don't know shall we wait a little for some for people to tell us they are they reached this point please can you give us can you give us a yeah we could pause a little and wait for some up just to see if people can follow were able to execute the first query create the table then change tab and insert data nice okay i've seen some i see some thumbs up so if you get lost the instructions are in the repo and uh we are actually following them word by word so there is nothing you shouldn't be able to catch up with so i see thumbs up okay shamburai if you see server cannot be reached you most likely have to make sure your token is inserted correctly and in your tab you might end up having uh trailing parts of the token that are that do not belong you might and you might have copied the whole csv line of your text file you might have forgotten the astra cs prefix part you might have wrong quotes so that is most likely the point somebody asks for showing a failed query uh this i'm not sure but i think if i no this is idempotent right so if i run the create table again this will just run again so okay yeah but you know let's say if you remove the token you get yeah that's okay let's let me have a name yeah yeah that can have an invalid query this is the wrong this is the wrong token and it gives me it gives me authentication required i might i don't know insert some curly brackets well maybe it doesn't even let me run the query in this case i see because it is too smart for me okay i think there are various ways to make this fail and you will have to play a bit because we we have to move on sorry okay so um yeah i'm just um yeah yeah sorry to interrupt yeah for 20 seconds so in the graphql world there are two flavors of request first is queries query are for read-only like like select and the second are mutations and mutations are for update delete or create so mutation is ready to edit the data and in query israel just to read the data when you access a graphql schema you will see the list of all the available types object and then you will see all the available queries read-only select and finally all the list of mutation and everything that you can edit yeah so this is just to give you in the docs here you can go to the create table for example mutation which is for the schema graphql schema part and you see the syntax the expected syntax and well the details of the syntax here uh relate to how is uh how our table in the underlying database structure so there is the concept of partition key and clustering key which are part of the primary key defining unicity now this is probably carrying us a bit too far so maybe we should stop here and go and go ahead but so the syntax here is made by parts that reflect how the table is mapped into uh the underlying apache cassandra table after all so maybe yes let's stop here and go and go back to on track okay yes so we created the table we inserted values very nice we might want to skip this query point five we want to skip so we can spend a bit some time more time on other parts uh this is left as an exercise for the reader you can go to the graphql tab and try this query which will read data from the table and give you back give it back to you so this completes the circle now creating writing and reading and so far we skipped this now it's time to create um another table because so far we created a table that will host that contains the generous we now create a table where every row is a different movie so we go to the graphql schema tab again because we are creating a new table luckily the token is there already for us no need to paste it again because the token stays in the tab and we create a new table that is called movies by genre it's written here and the table will have columns such as genre year title synopsis duration thumbnail okay so it will have a bit more columns than than the genre table so this is this is my mutation which will create the table everything should be set because i have my url i have my token let's run it ah nice you see movies by genre true the table has been created and guess what at the moment it is empty it's brand new right so we go to step 7 and we will insert values in the in this new table now guess which tab do i have to use for inserting values well graphql because this is now to write and read data in tables it's not anymore to create them okay so let's take this big mutation you will see that it is again a mutation made by four items inception and it's an insertion prometheus it's an insertion uh aliens it's an insertion blade runner is an insertion so i take the whole the full thing which will as you can guess insert four different rows i paste it here and i see some server cannot be reached i think i messed up with my token in some demonstrations before let me see let's see okay i don't know why i see this it's wrong because the okay so the mutation is executing correctly because it's inserting data and i get back the title why why am i getting back title inception because the mutation is made by two parts in a sense so it does two things an insertion and after that it also gets back it also gives me back the value of column title so i get that inception which is here because i ask for title indeed this is what i get back but in at the same time the insertion on the database have been executed so i i am now now the table contains four rows for for four different sci-fi movies nice okay uh let's move on okay there's an interesting question if i run this again yeah i get duplicates the answer is no the answer is no because the structure of the table has a primary key well yeah the if you re-insert these rows you will overwrite the previous rows because the values of genre and i think here are the same as the previous insertion and uh since this is the primary key the row will be overwriting the previous one so you'll still have four items but if if i change sci-fi to sci-fi aaa then this will be if i run this query then it will be a new different row and i will find more rows in the database yes in the table i'm not doing that now okay more on that in the upcoming uh workshops about uh how does how cassandra works but yeah yes that's again yeah there are so many yeah there are so many directions to explore here but yeah that's true that's true you know in casama every insert is an upset so if it does not exist it's inserted if it already existing it will be updated that's for the data and for the table what if you try to create the same table twice well it will still work and why this is because in the request we put if not exist true okay yes that's serious okay right okay so so far we've been creating tables and writing data let's have a look at reading data from the table which is still a query it's not a mutation it's a query so we just ask the api to give us data and to do that we stay in the graphql tab so this is how this is how this query is structured so here let me copy and paste this query here 0.8 this is where we are query get movie action and then there is table name what column i want order by to have a sorting and values here okay now let's run it oh no sorry okay yeah i can fit these are the values i want back and this is my where condition expressed in the graphql language okay so indeed now if i run this query i get back exactly what you expect so i get movies by genre which is the name of this query here and then it contains values and there is a list of items each one is one of the movies that i inserted into the table now you see i asked for year title duration synopsis thumbnail and this is exactly what i get back and this is for all movies that have genre equal to sci-fi now just to make so if i just ask for ear and title for some reason you will get year entitled for your four movies here right okay now there is an important point which is pagination because uh okay this table now contains for for movies and i asked the api to give them all to give me all of them but suppose there are four four thousand movies it's probably not useful and not performant if i ask for all of them all the time and there is hardly a web application that benefits from that so what usually what you usually do is you just ask for small slices of the whole data one by one and then you might want to browse them right to to get to ask the api to give me the first slice then please give me the second slice and so on until i i might want to go all the way to exhausting the full table the full data set but one chunk at a time and these chunks are called pages and this operation is called pagination by the way this is what makes api work uh smoothly because otherwise the payload would be too big in general and also it is what enables the interface of infinite scrolling that is very common in many applications so how does pagination work let's start with this query i'm still i'm asking so we are querying the same table in almost the same way except except we ask for we explicitly ask for options page size two that means dear api give me just two results and that's not the end of it because alongside the values for each movie we also ask the api to please gives us a page state now what is a page state let's run the query first okay so the result of these different query first there are only two movies you see there is a first movie prometheus here and the second movie inception and that's it because we asked for two but alongside the movies i also get this page state and there's a funny string here you see now this page state is a string that is created by the api when it replies to me with the answer and it is like a ticket and the api tells me dear clients i give you the first two items and please keep this ticket when you ask me for more give me back this ticket i will look at it i will know where to start from for the next part so it is a string that the client is not supposed even to look into it just takes it keeps it ready for the next request so indeed every time you do a page you ask for a page you get back this page state this ticket and you will keep it you are the client you will keep it ready for when you will ask the next page and in general you will get back the ticket for the page after that so what we did here and we are pretending to be the application the client we are asking the api to give us the first page the first two results and we keep this page state here now let me copy it and store it away for a second because we will now pretend to be the client in asking the next slice so again this is a this is given here the query is very much the same the only difference is so we still ask for page state and we still ask for page size 2 but we also in the options besides asking for page size 2 we also give back the ticket give back this ticket to the api which says dr api last time you gave me this ticket use this look into this and know where to start from by giving me the next batch of results so the first query gives us parameters and inception now if i run this i get haha i get aliens and blade runner so it worked it gave us the second batch of two movies and there is a new page state which is a new page state now as an experiment you remember that we had only four movies what happens if i ask for this third slice of two movies which there aren't right so i get values empty because there are no more movies and most important page state null this tells us the client that there are no more pages so we stop here the infinite scroll has reached its end which is also very useful information right okay so this this is somehow a brief summary of how pagination works and what does it mean let's be serious because so far we've been inserting only four movies in our netflix clone which is a bit sad right let's make it a big a bigger thing so we don't want to insert manually more and more films so we can download a nice ready-made data set here step nine you can download this data set okay if you open it you see it's a jumble of stuff we don't care so i go back you can now this depends a bit on your operating system but you can probably be you should be able to right click on this green button save link as and you make sure to save it with its name which is movies by genre dot csv now this is a csv you will not need to open it but because we are now feeding it into astra asking astr to please load this data into the table for us so just make sure you're downloaded and saved this file okay now i have this file somewhere in my computer and i hope you also do now let's go back to astra you probably kept this ui open for convenience let's go to okay we are we already are in our netflix workshop db database let me click on this you see next to connect there is a load data link here which makes us able to just take the csv containing tabulated data for the movies and ask astr to please insert all of these rows into the database so you click here so it's a three-step operation first we have to upload here by clicking on this region we have to upload the csv file we just downloaded so let me take this movies by genre it's important to well it's it's a the best thing is to have the name to not change the name of this file so movies by genres.csv works best because that will be by default the name of the of the table indeed it matches right okay if you so okay you upload this file and you see this upload successful here hopefully now you can now click next here okay next uh will bring us to the second step you see we can make sure the table is the right one which is movies by genre if you saved it with a different name this is the right point to make sure you write the right table table name name here you can see some preview of the data you are going to upload you see there are films written here now before moving to the next step make sure you select the partition key now what is the partition key again this is an apache cassandra concept primarily it is basically how uh the rows are organized in your database the important thing is that you it has to match what was done in in when creating the table so we click a genre so make sure make sure of the table name here in step 2 and the partition key genre here now you can click next i see somebody has trouble saving the csv but cedric and kirsten are helping them so yeah depending on the operating system it might be that the extension gets jumbled you have to make sure it is renamed to a csv file otherwise this step would not work okay so partition key table name let me click next here okay so no trouble no errors i can then finally tell astra what is the target database well this is already chosen and i have to choose the target key space well there is only one most likely which is netflix key space so this is where is the table located in the database where are the rows going to be written so i click next and i will get just a notification here importing in data import is being is under undergoing why is it a synchronous well in general it might be a very big data import so you will not have to wait in the ui uh i can ensure you that you are you are getting an email telling you that the data import has started and in a little while you will get also an email saying you yes it's finished i don't have my email here but you know what i can probably wait one or two minutes and at the end of this my query will be showing more data so i can go back to my movie query maybe the non-paginated one i can just concentrate on title only for example you see there are still four items here in one or two minutes they will become more than four and that will tell me it's one of the way ways to tell me that to find out whether the import has finished uh in the meantime maybe we can have a look at uh okay joey deep we do not need to add clustering keys in this case no worry just the primary just partition key when importing the csv file okay somebody got the email why when you get when your data import has finished please give us a thumbs up cedric did you see some questions that we might want to address loud um just keep answering the question just see some error maybe probably due to many manipulating the the astra data loader but you know as of now i think people are following very good we are doing great okay very good uh in the meantime you might have seen that my data has been imported you see my query at some point starting showing uh seven different movies so happy we are there so this is one of the ways to check right so you see there are many many movies let's make sure i don't know i can try with drama are there drama maybe i wrote it in the wrong way oh and if you do not like the movie you see ah here it's my fault yes if you find that the movies are super old this is because i'm old well i i i today i inserted a movie that is from that it was made in 1902 just for fun and it's a sci-fi movie oh okay that was one of the oldest movies ever so you see the queries work so we sure have more movies than the four that we inserted here so the csv import has succeeded and we are good to go okay so we are back to step nine finished we imported the data and we are sure the data is now available in the database okay so i think we it's a good point to stop for a while to wait for no naruto for an email yeah whatever no but i you know i put bleach and such hey i could have put a lot more i don't don't know don't push me that direction or we will start yes for too long yeah by the way inserting your own movies in the interface in the database is part of the homework so please be creative right okay so let's stop here for a second and let's have a look at the architecture of the next part so i would like to switch to cedric's screen now yes let's do it okay there okay so i'm back again um so until now what we have done is really initially initialize the database create the table and use the graphql api to create table insert data and doing some massive data loading with astra data loader we are done with the with the database let's have a look to the code so the code is written already fully written ready to go on the github repo it's a react application what we want you to do now is build the the code and deploy the code so on the github repo you will have a button called deploy to netlify behind that little button you will upload the code to netlify exactly what we did last week and the week before it will fork the code and it will create your own repository of this of this code okay your own your your own repo on with your github account okay that's what deployed to netlify does so far so good and then we will use that code so the the latest step is where we need to have an ide something to edit the code and navigate the code and this is where you can either use vs code by cloning your repo or as we promised no need to install anything as soon as you will be in your repository you will see a button called open in git pod you open you click that button and it will open in your browser again your browser yet another tab yeah i know i know i don't know how many types did you open with us today but probably five to six already and there you will have the code to edit and what do you want to edit in this code which is already working what's missing is how to connect to your database so we will edit some configurations file to make the connections and when it's done we will deploy the full working app on netlify with your full working database under the hood and it will keep running forever and it will be free and it'll be you know pretty nice to share that with your friend or linkedin or search so overall this is all the step that stefano will go through i went fast but do not worry we will now do it slowly and we are here to okay so let us go back to the practice right okay uh here please okay so we we are starting with part two deploy to production as cedric said we start with the deploy to netlify part so what does the netify button do it does three things you can see here it creates a new repos repository for you in your github it creates a site in netlify which is uh basically a distributed cdn distribution of your of your content so the application and it will link the two together for later uh injection of credentials and stuff so the next thing to do is you just click the deploy to netlify button and it should all go by itself you might be encountering a a model window asking you to connect to github and probably you will click on it if it's the first time you might have to give some permissions to neglify on github so the two can speak to each other because this integration will automatically push repository in your github from here so the next screen is repository name leave it like that it's perfect save and deploy so if you click save and deploy a lot of things happen because within netlify which is this nice platform serving your application your web application in a smart and distributed way within netlify the your website so your web application is going to be built and made available at a particular domain so you see well this takes a few minutes so you can start by looking at the site deploy in progress that makes you a so it makes you so brings you to a view where you can see the deploys that are currently working so production main head is building you see uh this you can also reach by deploys you probably you might have only this one site anyway this is the one that that is now undergoing deploy and if you click on main here you can see the full deploy log you see a lot of things are happening within netlify basically an npm installed followed by a build is happening behind the scenes but not only that but so there is a git clone here then everything every everything of the node environment construction and the application building is happening here and this takes another maybe two minutes or so the final result is that this rep so you will end up having a repository in your github and the website so that what the netify calls the site will be ready for you there on netlify waiting for further refinements so let's see this operation will yeah now i think we are close to building now yeah very soon you see a lot of things happen because this is how node applications are built okay so you see here this netlife build this is where the build process starts and very soon you will see uh compile successfully yeah so it's one another minute or so function bundling deploy site netify build complete so post processing and the thing i was looking for is this pushing to repository you see if you look closely this push into repository is pushing not to the data stacks devs repo anymore but to your own so this is my own github identity so i end up having so by clicking this notify button i end up having my own repository with the same content by the way this is not a fork it is just a copy an independent copy of the repository that will be there in my github so how do you how do to reach it if you click on or there are various ways but we have now to jump on that repository we have to uh abandon the data stocks devs copy and that's very important i will stress it a few times because it's very important otherwise you will have trouble in later steps so if you can click on the name of your site like this stoic pane whatever here and it it says here deploy from github and if you click on this github here you will go to your own repository in github you see it's very important that this here now it okay let me make it onto one line otherwise it's too different from what you see it is important that here it doesn't say data stacks devs it's very important so please make sure double check it otherwise in later steps you will have trouble and you will have to start again from here so you make sure you are now on your own repository which is absolutely identical by the way it's just yours okay so we are in your own repository let me show you again how you reach it yeah well there are various ways you can go here site overview there are this is my site deploys from github yes you click here on github and you're brought to your github so okay so you are let's say you are in your own repository let's scroll down in the readme because you have a copy of the readme as well let's scroll down to part 2.2 which is what we just did click on the github and get back to your new repository scroll down to where you were in the readme so we are here okay now uh what we are about to do now now netlify will wait for us a bit and we would we we go to our ide to work on the code now uh you can do this part in your local machine with your own ide your own npm your own vs code using your node and everything and there's nothing preventing you from doing that today to make it the to make all of the so differences even to make everybody use the same environment we will work with gitpod which is an online ide that we configured so that it works the same for all of you but if you work on your own please make sure you have node 15 at least and npm 7 at least everything has no problem okay so again make sure you are not in the stacks devs repository and starting from this point you can go you can scroll down from this launch git pod id and you can there is you see there is this small triangle here click here to launch git pod that will reveal a magical button this magical button makes it easy to take your code and bring it over to a git pod environment where we will be doing the code development so we will be touching the code and injecting environment variables now those of you who do not have who are not using chrome or firefox might have trouble using this button so if you want let's see if it's the case there is a workaround i will then give you instructions to that but let me first do the ordinary things if you open and get if you click this open in gitpod and you have firefox and chrome at least those two browsers work somebody reported that also with some other browser it worked now it will what will happen is that your code is going to be pulled by a virtual environment an environment online in the gitpod ide which will act as your development environment so it will take a bit of time now this is how gitbot looks like you see there is a file browser on the left an editor on the file editor on the top and a console here terminal now this terminal is doing a lot of things already you you haven't clicked anything yet but it's already doing something well yes it's doing a npm install basically so it's and it's making sure this environment has the right version of node and uh npm you see that here ah it went away but it was there so at some point the magic of these is in a particular file called gitpod.yaml that describes what to do when this repo is pulled within gitpod so you can treat gitbot as if it were your own machine with your own ide so what is happening uh yeah uh the environment is being prepared for you to be able to run it so let's wait a bit of time because it takes still another couple of minutes or so and by the way uh those of you who are not familiar with node too much might might jump a bit by seeing some notices such as this warning eight moderate severity vulnerabilities uh don't worry about that it's always the case node is has such a complicated and yeah rich ecosystem of packages that are there is always something that is being deprecated or has vulnerabilities and they will be cured eventually so don't pay too much attention it's usually nothing so it's sure nothing that blocks you so while this git body installation completes let me show you for those yeah yeah exactly anusha brakash for example is saying no referrer now let me share my secret with you trouble with the gitpod button yeah so you have to build yourself your url and open a tab in your browser with this url this url is done like this https gitpod.io pound and then you just paste your pool repo url so for example https gitpodio slash pound and then immediately https slash github.com your name your repo so i'm probably going to paste these instructions in the chat as well because that's the point that puzzles everyone who didn't see the button magically do its magic because they might be having just a different you know a different browser so while the gitpod installation completes i also copy paste okay um and and just i it each time you copy the link i gave you you need to replace your account by your account so yes so it should be it should be fine okay so john and my netflix are fake data okay okay so let me let me go back to the git pod it says you don't know maybe somebody's watching absolutely well i can just try and open it later okay so we are in git pod you see the terminal is ready for me to do something it's a usual uh console shell uh in the upper panel i have i have uh the readme for convenience so i can stick i can stay here and just scroll down again to where i was um so let's go down let's go down a lot because we are part two step here launch git pod with it okay so as a last check just to make sure you are working okay i may try to make this bigger as is my custom okay maybe it's a bit better to read as a check you can also try this command git remote minus v and you will see what is this repository configured to use as a remote and if you see data stacks devs here or here then you have to repeat the gitbot part because you started from the wrong repository okay so it is just as a last check okay so let's assume uh i think i lost my i know okay yeah my making everything bigger i lost it i lost myself again okay uh here we are everything is okay maybe just make the terminal a bit bigger when you can bigger you mean larger fonts yeah please yeah yeah i'm not sure zoom zoom i'm not sure how how larger can i make it yeah maybe this should work yeah no that should be fine i only see the character eight maybe it's too big no i think this is a good compromise okay so but i have to retune my upper panel here okay okay good so next step in the instruction is i have to do an npm install which is a global install so npm installs minus g for global netify cli so what what this what does this do this command installs the command line interface of netify which comprise uh contains uh actually a full environment which is able to emulate the netlife platform locally so it will not only be able to serve my statically built application but it will also provide and emulate the serverless functions that netlify also offers so in particular the thin layer of api if you want that is between the application and the graphql api there is a thin layer that you will be you can look at into this function part functions part of the repository netify cli will be able to locally emulate these serverless functions that will be in the real deployment will be available through netlife itself okay so uh this is installed you are not able to type the npm command on the terminal maybe it's still doing something so darshan maybe it's still working otherwise you might try okay if your terminal if you think your terminal it gets stuck you might go to this hamburger menu here on the upper left click on terminal new terminal which is which will open a new terminal maybe somehow okay so if it's just hung maybe this is enough to continue working okay so with network cli installed we have we still have to do an important thing because you see so far the code in the repository has no idea what is your database has no idea which database to speak to so we have to provide to the application to provide information to reach your database and connect to the real movies right so to do that we create a dot env file which contains environment variables and let me first create the nv file you can do it in various ways you probably can click right click somewhere and create a file what i like to do is you just i just do touch dot env the touch command creates a file so i'm now seeing it here i can open it for editing and it's empty so it's empty but i can start copying it so the nv file the environment file will have to contain two pieces of information my token and it's not the page state it's the token that you got from astra at the beginning so i will copy here my token by the way the token is a very private and secret thing so you're now seeing it and be sure i will delete it when this workshop is over otherwise i know you will jump on my database and do all sorts of things to me to my database so this is by the way important when you submit homeworks and when you write in the chat please do not share your token the other information that i need here is your graphql endpoint and to find that i have to jump let me jump to the astra interface let me go to the this is very big connect as we did so far graphql api exactly so far it's where also we found the playground but we now scroll down there is a heading called write data here and under this write data heading i see an url this is a full url ending with my key space name so let's copy this full url which is the endpoint to query for getting and writing data the one we used in the playground basically and i'm going to paste it here and remember to take out the curly brackets so my n file is now done i save it so a quick repeat of how i get here connect graphql api and then you scroll down the text until the write data paragraph and here is my url this is what we are going to paste in this end file alongside the token so now the m-file is done so touch to create it and then for example with this gitpod file editor to change the values inside and i'm done okay now this is a node application so let's make sure every pack every required package is installed so i type npm install which might take another minute or so and it will also maybe warn me about a few security vulnerabilities here 17 don't worry too much and live happy okay so the environment is ready npm has all packages it needs uh your secrets and information on how to connect to your database are there so let's see if everything works so far in a local run so we are running locally what will later be deployed in production to netlify if you run this netlifedev command here you will see a browser a mini browser window open here if you want to give it in full glory please copy it running now copy the url and open it in a new tab because you might see it might be just nicer to see right nice okay in some cases we noticed that this window opens incomplete and this is when you see 3000 instead of 8888 here in that case you go yeah you can't hear in that case you wait a bit and the new window with the right address should open so let's go to here yeah this is an issue that is still a bit of a unclear it might be a glitch but on the git bot side okay so you are seeing your netflix clone so there is full screen yeah yeah you do have your app running in github which is to say locally and could you know connect it to your own database yeah that's pretty cool already but we are not done yet no we are not done yet uh monstrum gfx the info for the lottery will be given at the end of the workshop so don't worry for the moment enjoy the content enjoy your prometheus trailer and if you scroll down you will indeed see that you have your movies so the application is properly speaking to the database now uh a detail if you ever find yourself just with the netfix home part and no contents no movies most likely you have to check your dot env file because there might be wrong credentials a curly bracket left somewhere in the token or similar so okay where do you find the endpoint again uh this is explained uh yeah looking for the link but maybe you can show it yeah it's here so the endpoint for the graphql access is to okay let's start from the beginning for everybody you are in your astra interface uh yes you have a terminator trailer because there is a logic that chooses a random sci-fi movie for the big trailer so ever if you need to see promoters try again i need to see promotions so drop anything except promoters in the site so there is a randomizer but you can play with the code and make it so that it chooses parameters over all other that would be also a good exercise okay so you are in the astra dashboard uh scroll down find your netflix database click on it and you are now in your netflix workshop db database now you choose connect here this connect tab you see here sorry and then there are various ways to connect we need the graphql one so here graphql api here and then you scroll down and besides the playground url which are not which is not what you want now you go down create a table describe your key space describe your tables write data here we are so under write data you will see this url that starts with https some some string of id and should end with netflix key space these is the url you copy and you get you go to git pod and insert into your env file now let me close this this is the url that i paste here after astra graphql endpoint while the other the others information the secret proper is the token and then that you might find in your csv that you downloaded i hope okay so back to us sorry now do not try to pause the video and steal stefano token because he will delete the token after the session yeah and don't try to use my token for your database because well it would wouldn't work okay so you see there is here the nice uh interface and your netflix is up and running but it's local so imagine you're running on your computer which is formally the same as in git pod now you switch off your computer and your application disappears and this is not what you want because you are deploying for the whole world to use it right so there is another step to do namely the deploy proper so far we've been running in development mode with this netlifedev we need to connect the real thing to this gitpod so to tell gitpod or better to tell the code in the netifycli local please connect to this netify site and deploy there when you build so first thing let me do a control c to kill this local run i don't need it anymore so we stop this local development run now uh we need to connect this the code and the settings in this uh in this repository local copy we need to connect it to our netlife so i i take advantage of having installed the network cli which will take care of most of it most of the process and i click and i type netlify login now there is a trick here because if you type netify login a window will be open to ask me for authorization but the window will not be able to properly open within the gitpod simple browser so this is also important you might get stuck for hours waiting here waiting for authorization here forever if you don't but if you do this you will proceed so you go here to this mini browser you copy this url and you open it in a new tab you guessed it so this this what does this do this goes to netlify and asks me so netlify asks me do you want netfly cli within the gitbot to access netlify for you yes please authorize aha okay done i can close this window i go back here i also close this browser that is not needed i go back here and you see it tells me you are now locked into your netlify account nice so we are ready to rock uh i lost my way again because these very big browsers have problems scrolling but here we are okay so next i have to next okay now i establish the connection between this git pod environment and my netlify account i still have to specify or better to make netlife cli connect to that particular site we created back in the time with the netlify button so if i run netify link i will be given options how do you want to link this folder to a site well if you did everything according to the instructions it will be there will be this option use current git remote origin which is again my own copy of the repository and not the data stocks devs that's why it was important so i just click i just hit enter here yes please connect like this done now a configuration has been saved that linked this gitpod environment code to the netlify pro that particular site on netlify i am now ready to do a very important thing i have to send the environment variables in the mv file upstream to netlify because so far yeah all is nice and good in netlify but still the netlify side of the world has no idea what is my database and how to speak to it so i write netlify amp import.m which again is something offered by the netlify cli tools and this sends environment variables upstream to the netlify deployment ready for me to use in principle with those also the netlify side of things will be able to access my database which is what i want so this is a very important step netify import of the environment file okay now it's already we have to build the code so netlify build will you know read the source code and the source code can be seen here in src components so now this is the reactive part of the code and by the way for the react part we suggest you to have a look at the very well done video by anya where she builds the application itself the client application from scratch using react and explains a lot of things that we have to you know gloss over today because there's so much to do so the build has completed netflix built complete and we are ready to actually deploy to net netify what we just built so netlify deploy oh i'm not writing sorry okay netlify you know because i'm used to another window manager where you just hover the mouse on a window and it gets focused but this is not available here in windows so i'm always a bit tricked netfly deploy minus minus prod so this simply sends the files of the build application over to netlify and it also tells you what is going to be your final url but i'm lazy and instead of copying this link i want to do the full thing so i do netlify open column site which again opens a browser well here within the gitpod but that's not a problem because i can copy the url or you can copy this one as well which is the same and you open it in a new tab and finally finally you see that the application is deployed and is working you see this time i'm opening a domain that is my stock pane netlify up so it's not something in github anymore i mean in this at this point gitbot can also go down can also explode i don't care anymore because i deployed so my application is running there in the cdn offered by netlify everything works i'm now seeing no title for some reason not clear to me but here you see the full movies which are loaded uh progressively as you scroll and just to illustrate you see that there are maybe you remember that we were focused on sci-fi at some point let me look for sci-fi which i don't seem to see it's automatic yeah scrolling so you need to put your mouth at the bottom now okay sorry right now to make all the general okay thank you so you see sci-fi you remember how many movies we uploaded in sci-fi it was seven but now you see six so there is prometheus inception strange days terminator don't don't mind the trailer the videos aliens and blade runner now there is here nice button and these if you look at the code this will use pagination so after having asked for the first six it will know that there is a page state that is not null so if i click here i will go to a trip to the moon which is the seventh okay don't mind the trailer we didn't find in the proper trailer on time but still the pagination is illustrated here okay so with these i think that we reached the end your application should be up and running deployed in netlify so all good all nice and i think yeah there are various questions but i see i see they are being answered so uh promoters again so uh those of you who managed to have your your netlify deployment up and running please give me a thumbs up or you can also write which film you saw in the big page yes and congratulations very good everybody you did well did all the steps very good so it worked it works very good a lot oh these apps won't stop inception this app won't stop yes so very good everybody else who had some trouble along the way don't forget that you can look at this workshop at your pace uh you can look at the readme and you can reach us for example on discord for any doubt any problem you might have so we are happy to help you i think that now we can declare it a victory we deployed we did it so yeah i think congratulations everybody yeah yeah there are a lot of thumbs up very good so i think it's time for the quiz what do you think yes yes i think for the quiz uh if you enjoy the content you see today uh do not hesitate to subscribe to the youtube channel put a like you know click the like button on the video that keep uh the channel growing and help us to to to come back every week with that we can play the game yeah okay do you want me to play no i won't play today to play under the fake name of alex needs coffee yeah i know you know me right yeah yeah okay so let me go here and let's start with the let's okay so i i you probably want to you all probably want to connect again with your phone or with your browser tab on mendy again maybe we can paste the the number the code again that is now on screen but anyway never hurts to paste it again so how can we view the database data well you can use graphql ahmed you can use graphql to query the tables as you you have seen or you can actually you can also go through cql console in the astra db or you can write your client and you're actually seeing the the data in the application by the queries by the functions that are executing yeah so and press the k yes please definitely for everybody to see the qr code yes okay so go to mentee.com and join us for the final quiz this is the real thing so those questions will have a right answer and wrong answers and if you answer fast and correct you have a chance to win and if you end up in the first three positions you will win some nice swag so let's see there are many participating now so shall we start so get ready um yeah i mean yeah let's let's be on time so uh i was keeping before you click start yeah you did not click start no if you want to be as fast as possible look at the screen of your phone of your tab yeah not your tube there because at youtube we do have one second delay we want you to be as fast as possible to win the swag so no question that we do not talk about today so good luck everybody and let's have fun yeah so let's start be fast and be correct answer fast to get more points so question number one what is astra db it is a managed cassandra in the cloud it is a local in memory database it is a movie with brad pitt or it is a gateway to the stars cedric what do you think well it's not a movie with rap yeah because the movie response read was called ad yeah and time's up many answer correctly because it is a managed cassandra in the cloud yes so it's we foresaw the api with also a rich layer of various apis to access it and tubes yep so let's see who was the fastest was the fastest part and correct and correct and agent x9 exactly the same points so they are first both dinesh tony soprano and but everybody is very close to each other so it's going to be a tough challenge nice question number two and i can we yeah we recognize the names here so in graphql which operations do you use to edit data query edit writes mutation or pencil now this is a concept we have been seeing a few times today yes with the properties so let's see properly explain it today yeah so let's see and mutation is correct and many of you answer correctly don't forget that query in graphql especially means uh those particular requests that are aimed at getting data back so interrogating to get data so let's see let's see who is the fastest uh park gulen defense his position shivankar kritika montija dinesh yeah okay very good so everything can still happen question number three let's see answer faster to get more points what can't you do with graphql so i think we explained that properly today so auto discoverability schema less or federation or response customization what is it that you cannot do with graphql it's one of one of the four okay and time is almost up and let's see federation is wrong because you can do federation that means you can have a single graphql api server collate results from different sources well it was a tweet yes yes what you cannot do is schema less indeed there is also there is even a dedicated tab for the schema so when you create the tables and everything you have to provide the schema so schema less is what you cannot do so let's see the results of this question yeah because leaderboard exactly on graphql you do have a schema you do have objects okay and what's the fastest i think we have a super a machine winner because the fastest answer was given every time and it's a tough challenge and yeah particularly ivanka and kritika are still defending their positions question and you know i'm yeah i'm suspicious with the not ryan yeah there might be so what are the terms used for paging paging size and paging cursor or just page number or page size and page state or book title and bookmark so we have been seeing how pagination works and here we go i can't trust ruin i trust you okay page size and page state is correct so many of you paid attention that's very good to know we played a bit with this page with pagination during the workshop and and critical was the fastest which made them skip one position and jump to second place and let's see what happens with the last question no sorry the fifth question so what is netlify it is a platform to build and deploy web apps it is a java application server it is a code review tooling or it is a software to calculate your tax rate well those are all very important and very useful things but netlify is only one of them what is it time's up yes very good almost everybody a platform to build and deploy web apps including serverless functions which come very handy because yeah they make you usually skip building your own api basically and deploying it and managing it so leaderboard critica fastest again but okay that's not enough to skip to first place so the leaderboard is unchanged and let's see it it's really uh a battle between giants last question yes last question okay who what is the main benefit of using serverless functions it is that you only need one function to retrieve your data you or it is that there is no back-end infrastructure needed or there is no benefit because serverless functions are only for local development you know stefano this one i think has been covered yes last week but i don't know okay but many many many guessed it right or maybe we're yeah rewarded yeah that's so very good you know focus with us for three weeks you know that's a good gift i guess so very good serverless functions are actually making you without having to manage your back-end infrastructure and the fastest critique again so at the end the leaderboard is unchanged so part guillen critique and shivankar congratulations and congratulations to everybody else also but the first three positions not easy to to be to be leaders yeah it's not easy at all so the first three positions are eligible to win swag so let me jump to your slide so first second and third place win to claim your price please take a screenshot now of your phone or your winning position and send it to jackfryer datastax.com yes so this the swag is i think uh a t-shirt cup some t-shirt t-shirts stickers cup but you know depending on what we do have at the store it could change yeah t-shirt for sure so yeah please do a screenshot of your phone just to be sure that you actually win and send an email exactly we will ship that to you uh wherever you are on the planet and with that uh now is the time just to do giveaways and we'll be almost on time so we told you about the homework you know the big badge you can win or you can get so no badges to attend the session but this nice badge if you do the homeworks what are the homeworks not complicated simply redo all the steps that we did today okay after working app and add your own movie either using a graphql query or re-importing an updated csv you can do both you can also if you really would like to go to the code because we are totally aware that we really take an existing code and deploy to show you a full working app if you really want to understand more the javascript code the anya video here will go you go you through the step to starting from scratch and having this code running how to submit the homework we provided the link on the github readme but this is what you need to do you go to the issues on the repo you create a new issue and you will click get started and you will have a form to fill with your name your email uh and some screenshots just to proof that you completed all the steps and you uploaded or created your own movie simple as that and you know what i think we have almost 300 badges reading for the netflix cloud so why not you yeah okay um we are sharing a lot not only through the workshop but also we are sharing a lot of courses on the underlying database apache cassandra so you can go to academy.net.com and found some free mooc for you to learn cassandra you can also go to datasacks.com dev same courses to learn about apache cassandra more about asta db a little bit about streaming okay community.dallas.com is stack overflow for cassandra or anything related to datastax to be honest and of course this youtube channel i mean we need to reach that 20k subscriber please help us subscribe to the channel tell your friend how fun you are today share on the social network the experience the link the video is recorded same link so don't hesitate to share this session if you like it and now comes time last minute for even more gift to you because you attended the session and the series we will offer you a chance to pass the certification for free the certification cost 135 dollar per attempt we will give you a voucher with two attempts to try the certification there are three certifications but don't get me wrong it's not easy certification if it's too easy there is no value right and so beef so this is the link to claim your voucher again use qr code use the link that we shared but if or if before be able to get your voucher to pass the certification do the mooc there is no point to ask and try the certification upfront you will fail and it's free for you not for us so we would rather just check that you did the mooc before giving you the voucher just to be sure uh you will pass okay and when you feel ready okay do it as soon as you ask for it it will be valid for three months and two attempts so no rush do the mooc before and when you feel ready ask for the voucher i told you about academy.com three certification this is the underlying mooc that we recommended you to to to do to be able to pass the certification and with that back to the lottery i show you in the beginning okay i don't know how many workshops did you complete how many homeworks did you do do you want to share what you learned on linkedin or social network do you want to write an article on mediumdev.eo each of those actions will get you some point but the best and what we really would like you to do if you feel confident about it is build something on your own over the three weeks you learn about html css javascript react rest api graphql api document api no sql database all that for free the best way to thank us to pns is to build something on your own and share about it and it's 10 point in the form so the more points you get the more chance you have to win this gift card you know what you have to do so good luck everybody last slide for today is again back to the youtube channel uh please again subscribe if you have not done it uh go to datastack.com workshops to see what's coming so next week we will do introduction to nosql databases what are the flavors of nosql databases and which use case each time and with that uh oh no just i keep having more slides you know we told you about the the discord in the beginning just to slide at the end to say hey the session will end pretty soon and the chat will stop with the session but if you keep having question for the homework or anything else go to the discord we will be there to help you uh

on discord right this code i'll see you next week bye have a great day bye and as always don't forget to click that imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats you",
