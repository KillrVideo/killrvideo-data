be with all of our guests here today with you so welcome everyone let me check how it goes for us and if you can hear us if you can see us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat and i will know we can start and looks like we are good yes yes we are good and we can start smoothly but surely so uh what do you have for us today well alex uh well thanks for having me back again uh it's good to see all of you um today we are doing a second um presentation in a series of three uh today we're going to be talking about how to do a migration um really the same methods could be used in any type of database migration but specifically when you're moving into a serverless cloud database how do you prepare for it we talked a little bit about that last time today we're going to talk about some nuts and bolts of actual tools that that we could recommend and some methods on how to do that but yeah that's pretty much it we'll get into the nitty gritty in a minute right and yeah you know migrating an application or managing services is well at first i wanted to say much easier than the database or data layer but maybe it's not the right very right way to call it it's not easy in no way but despite the application migration is not easy data migration is way much harder anyway it is it is absolutely um well let's go ahead and get started um hey everybody my name is uh rahul singh and i am a leader of a small boutique sander consulting team um i also uh as part of my work but i love doing it i am the creator of cassandra.link and a maintainer of awesome cassandra so uh if you want some authoritative well curated links uh i i take a lot of effort and pride in in finding the best links on cassandra and putting them there uh and then i also maintain a few other ones uh just because i you know they piqued my interest another thing that i do which is uh again i love it uh is organizing and managing some meetups in the washington dc region uh you may have found some of the data wranglers data engineering lunch every monday at noon and we also have casino lunch every wednesday at noon both times eastern standard time alex yeah so uh we are doing today and what you need to know about our uh workshops webinars and all the other events we are doing uh you mostly probably now watching us uh live stream on youtube and that's a primary channel for us in case you have any problems with youtube or you just prefer twitch you can switch to twitch it works we have which is a backup platform data stacks developers channel but youtube is a primary channel for us so we don't uh monitor we don't answer questions on twitch uh speaking about questions you can ask your questions right in the youtube chat and it's a live event so we are happy to get your questions and answer them uh but as soon as this workshop is over as soon as the stream is over uh questions are gone forever and answer answers as well so we suggest you to join our discord at bid dot list cassandra dash workshop and join the huge community fellowship of the cassandra rings with a great bunch of incredible developers engineers administrators to have fun to chat with ask questions answer questions and share your knowledge then um today in the second part of this workshop we are going to run a quiz a competition where you give questions i give you give the answers to our questions if you do it right if you do it fast enough you will get prizes from data stocks that's incredible and um today as the base uh for the data migration we will use cassandra as a service which is a datastax astrodb but we will talk a bit more about that a little bit later awesome very cool thanks uh for uh getting everybody uh in order um just back to the presentation um as i mentioned this is a second presentation in a series uh last time we talked about planning migration best practices uh today we're gonna talk about the actual data migration some best you know some patterns and and then some tools and methods uh to to use and then next next week we're to talk true transformation which is uh how do you how do you really create a truly serverless platform that is uh as as much in the cloud as it can get basically um without you having to worry about any any hardware any uh infrastructure at all so what do we want to get out of today uh well we'll do a little bit of a recap um on what we talked about last time we're going to talk about a few migration patterns um and we're going to talk about three or sorry four tools uh that i think are going to be very helpful there are other tools and i'll mention them lightly but i'm going to point out some resources for diaspora for spark liquid base if you haven't heard about it for schema management and airflow which uh is one of my favorite tools uh these days um and how to really use that and i've organized the tools in a way so that you can start to kind of build up how you would use each in a different scenario and then finally at the end when you when we look at airflow you'll understand how you can tie all these things together with airflow and i'm not going to go through the hands-on exercises but every single topic there's going to be a link and i'm going to give you the location of the links there's also some resources where you can find in-depth articles on how to use every one of these tools so don't worry about you know copying and pasting links uh just focus on the talk if you have questions please ask them alex will relay them to me to thank the sponsors uh a lot of the examples that we use are hosted on git pod gitpod is the serverless it goes with the theme right serverless ide um and datasets of course helping with this workshop and also providing you guys with free astr databases to play around with and of course my company and not which is providing the content and the source code for you guys to use i am an architect uh what is an architect well it's a noun and a verb uh architect means chief builder uh i'm actually in greece i was in greece last week and uh i'm in greece this week um and i see actual architects and it says architect. well what does it mean architect means chief builder uh but in computing architect means to design or make well at our company and not we architect platforms on cassandra and related technologies we'd love for you to join our team uh as an engineer operator or if you're an architect what do we love doing we love scalable fast data and that involves cassandra if you're doing anything with big data and it's fast uh of consequence you're probably using cassandra at some point and you're probably using spark and you're probably using kafka well that's what we play around with uh and data sex is a great partner we love using all the tools and technologies that it they provide thank you there is a link you're going to see it a few times but it is a shortcut to a actually an index page on our blog which has then six articles on in-depth uh how to use ds bulk how to use uh cassandra with spark for data migrations and things like that so i will mention it again um just bit dot l y slash cassandra dash data ops again that's bit dot l y slash cassandra dash data ops and in each of those articles by the way are also links to the actual code if you're curious all right so a quick recap on what we covered last time well uh like most people uh i remember things in the form of story so the the story that i'm going to retell is how we as a team have been migrating our application to a completely serverless platform and uh you know what we started off with was a set of tools that we were using running on vms and then on containers uh and then uh eventually migrating them into serverless systems such as netlify and versel for the front end uh um some search indexes that are managed separately now we were in the middle of migrating our apis to talk to astra and hosting our own api layers uh and at this point astra has its own api layer so we don't even have to worry about that serverless transformation like any application transformation requires a lot of planning and we talked about the fundamentals of how do you document your infrastructure do you understand the infrastructure layer do you understand your uh you know your databases uh your your interfaces uh and your software logic where does this all set and finally what we really talked about was making a plan uh for your applications and your services and and then managing that change using devops and data ops we also emphasized git ops as a foundational uh you know methodology or strategy whatever you want to call it getting your devops and data ops uh sound from the very beginning is a must when going into a transformation it's not just for serverless transformation it's for any transformation and we're going to talk about the same theme uh today uh because some of the tools we're gonna be talking about are useful in devops and data operations we also talked about astra and actually alex will uh talk a little bit more about it uh astra is a yep uh so uh is the cassandra the service or better to say uh heavily based on the cassandra uh providing cassandra api as a service which is perfectly right which is perfectly right for many many kind of businesses and projects cassandra offers great features but there is always a problem of the story what you have to maintain it you need to manage servers you need to maintain servers and operating systems and all the patches security things networks and so on and so forth so there's a stockpile of work if you want to take care of your own cluster especially for multi-disease for multiple data centers that's uh quite a lot of work and most of the people most of the businesses just want to have some database available always fast somewhere but we don't want to maintain it we prefer to develop something and bring some value to their clients so that's exactly what astrodb offers it's cassandra in the cloud on multiple data uh multiple cloud providers of your choice but manage it and taking care of by data stocks uh so for many people it's almost valuable because it suggests no operations it's all of us it's owners it's serverless it's a global scale security and so on and meanwhile there is no log in because you can use a cloud provider of your choice or you can migrate flexibly but uh also for developers who want to try something new who want to learn something new and for startups those want to use cloud database as a service but not ready to pay it is free to use even for small production workloads and definitely free to use for educational purposes for self-educating for running a small project test project um checking something that's completely free to go and we don't even ask for a credit card so i like it excellent thank you and can you tell me a little bit about uh stargate because i think it's fairly uh uh i mean i know what it is but uh uh and of course astra is powered by it but can you talk a little bit about uh astra's target layer yep stargate uh stargate is a great thing uh basically uh yes that may be very important for many projects because sometimes you want to have cassandra for its reliability and many other great features but uh then you don't have time to teach all your team to use how to use cql cassandra query language properly and sometimes you just want to throw some data in the database get it back and don't want to be don't want to think about the data modeling and so on and so forth with stargate which is an open source technology so you can use it with your own cassandra deployments completely and it's enabled by default for cassandra as a service as 3d beam it provides multiple different apis of your choice um with steel cassandra's storage but you can work through it using a rest api like you would normally work with any kind of a back end just a storage base address api graphql if you prefer something more advanced document api like mongodb if you prefer the flexibility of schema-less or flexible schema um data model and that's what steered stargate does so stargate is a great tool and i love it actually the flexibility what it gives it's incredible awesome thank you yeah stargate's uh really one of the gems out there in the open source world uh showing how to uh not just make a good api layer but to make an api layer that is useful for many people in the organization and uh you know if you've used cassandra in production once it starts to get some traction in the organization people want to put more and more and more services on top of it and stargate's the type of thing that actually makes it a lot easier for more people to use so a very cool tool and if you're using astr it's already part of it so if you want you can go ahead and you know make an account if you haven't made an account as i mentioned we're not going to do a lot of hands-on stuff but um it is uh something that if you haven't made an account before it takes a few seconds as alex said no credit card needed um and uh you know just check it out just play around with it we're gonna talk a little bit about data migration patterns uh data migration patterns are uh again not for just transforming an application you may have to move data from one system to another um and these migration patterns still apply um the the reason we talk about these patterns as patterns are that it's not just a specific piece of code right it's a way of doing things there's a pattern of doing things and you could change it you don't have to do it exactly the same way first and foremost i would say this is the most advanced um is to do an event-sourced architecture an event sourced architecture requires you to have your software built in such a way that you send all of your updates to a queue all right and and as the event processor takes the item from the queue it can then write that to the first database and if you have a second database that you're migrating to right so if your first one is your uh regular my sequel database that you're transforming to astro or if it's cassandra database you're transforming to astra um your event processor would write to both places and we talked about the astro migration service we're going to come back to this concept in a second but at the end of the day uh if you don't already have an event queue built into your software either with kafka or rabbit if that's what you use uh google pub sub whatever you happen to use right sqs uh it doesn't matter if you don't already have an event sourced architecture this is the hardest thing to achieve which is to then change everything to event to event source architecture um i mentioned this because if you're building new software uh and you you ha and you look towards event source architecture it makes migration much easier and the reason is that if you are storing all of your uh messages in your event source system by the way it doesn't necessarily have to be in a queue uh uh like gravity mq or or or kafka you could have all of your quote events going into a table and you can replay those events into one database or another database or simultaneously process them uh and that's really what on online migration involves no downtime right your your users are not going to know the difference whether they're using uh the platform that's running on the new database or the old database because you could change the load balancer to point to one or the other and when they're using the application there's no difference uh necessarily between uh you know the processing to to a or b uh this is a new concept to you look up uh event sourced architectures or event driven architecture you can also look into something called cqrs command query request segregation and uh really good article by martin fowler on it who's one of the gurus in software architecture that explains why cqrs is useful and cqrs is basically the only way to build really really really large scale applications moving on this is something that most people are likely to do uh if they want to do a no downtame uh no downtime uh online migration and that requires some code changes um you know normally you'd be writing to your old database right and reading from your old database and at some point you move your schema to your new database a and at that time you would like your right to uh you know use both databases right you want to be able to write to be your old database and to your uh uh new database but you're reading from b because that's where your most of your data is and at some point right when you when you start doing that we're going to move some data right and this this is involving some offline tools we're going to cover that in depth today this mass movement of data we're going to have to do that at some point right just because you started using astra your data just didn't magically go from your data center from your old database your your your current uh you know mysql rds database to astra right this doesn't magically move over at some point you have to actually move the data over um so this mass movement of data is generally done using offline methods unless you're using event sourced platform and even then you're going to do a mass replay of that data and at some point after you move the data you're going to have a continuous cycle of validation and as you validate you may do some syncing of the offset okay and this operation here the migration of the schema the movement of the data validation of the data and and doing the sinks of the offset all of this if you don't have automations you have to do it manually so just keep that in mind when we start talking about some of the tools right um and as you can see this is a multi-step process that that doesn't just involve one database this is likely the same for every single table every single service so if you have five tables right okay imagine how much work you're going to have to do to do this so the tooling is important right exactly what to use but how you do it how you run these tools do you do it manually do you do it with automation that's also important and this is why i was talking about devops and uh and data operations before because if you don't have the tools in place this type of change is super super hard and even even even if uh data stacks is helping with the astro migration service you still have to do a little bit of this you still have to do a little bit of this finally offline migrations uh this is the easiest way to do a data migration but it involves some downtime um i i wanted to say here a moment if your business can afford downtime that the only one right way to go for real there's no jokes it's so way my it's way so much easier what it will say tons of work time on adjusting your software for online migrations when you don't need downtime if you can afford downtime it's like the easiest way to go with i prefer of course zero downtime migrations but i love challenge and i prefer to work for companies who go with zero downtime approach uh but in general yeah yeah absolutely and and this is the you know this this last one is involving dual rights right you're writing to the old database uh in this in this one you're doing dual rights so in an offline migration you don't do dual rights you write to one database you stop your service you move your data and you switch over your application to talk to your new database and then you're on and by the way this this process is not just for the database too you could do this for new services new iterations to your software um but the point i'm making is these tools that you use for offline uh migration is the same tool you use for moving your data in mass in this online migration because at some point you have to move the bulk of the data right and you have some continuous process to then synchronize it here you're doing it through your application your application is doing the dual rights and then every now and then you validate and you and you sync some uh you know offsets here but for the most part your application is doing that for you but here you're responsible for it hundred percent uh again this link bitly slash cassandra dataops has all of these uh different tools outlined we're going to cover a few of them we're not going to cover every single one of them uh you know we're going to talk about spark in general but there's like three ways to use spark right we're going to talk about ds both but there are some very specific code samples on the git pod example that you can check out here are all the different offline methods i'm not going to go through them in depth but i'm just going to go through them uh because i feel like this is fairly exhaustive um sql copy so there's a cqlsh command copy right if you've taken any of the data sex academy courses you you know how to use it because they have some really good examples um you can take data out using cql copy and take to put data in uh don't recommend it in production because at some point over again gigabyte i think it starts to be problematic um but it works for small workloads uh it will work on astr too um spark jobs so spark jobs are again it's a spark is a big tool we're going to talk a little bit more about it but it's it's it's probably um if you're if you're running a big application and uh you have you have services and you have data operations you probably have some spark jobs there um but at the end of the day uh a spark job could be a part of your deployment to move data or to migrate data um it's compiled um a spark script is either a python or a scholar you can make changes to it you can do this uh pretty quickly um there's a tool called spark migrator uh google it it's a compiled uh product um where you define your from and two somebody actually made it to migrate away from cassandra but it works perfectly well between cassandra especially from cassandra super cool tool um ss table loader again this is the part of this uh managing a cluster that um alex was talking about that nobody wants to do right people use sstable loader for backup and restoration um if you're going serverless you're probably not going to use it and then finally ds bulk ds bulk is like a swiss army knife um it is way more powerful than cql copy it's it's out there it's free data stacks is giving it away use it it doesn't just work with data stacks it works with cassandra period and it has support for csv and json data and you can use ds bulk with said and awk to manipulate data in flight in fact one of the examples uh exports data using vs bulk manipulates it in unix pipe using saturn awk and then pipes that into another ds vault to import it into another database so you can do that type of stuff with with ds vault if you're interested uh and again all this stuff unless it's scripted and it's managed in some sort of operational tool you're gonna have to do it manually right so every single thing requires some change management and some some devops uh we're going to talk about that later ds bulk is probably my favorite tool for moving data between cassandra clusters because it's it's not only powerful it has a configuration engine where for every major migration you can have a set of migra uh migration configs so that you know exactly what's happening when the data is coming in and coming out it works with astra it works at datatex enterprise it works with cassandra 2.1 and later um there are a few people that i know that are using considered 2 20 but most people use consinter 2 1. so you can definitely use dsp load data unload data um some people actually use it just to count i just want to count how much is you know with this query without running spark you can get an accurate account for a large amount of data um and you know the the more you learn how to use ds bulk the more you're going to appreciate uh how well it performs with large amounts of information as i mentioned uh you can you know talk directly from a database to a file and then from a file to a database those file formats being csv and json standalone tool right it doesn't necessarily have to be a part of your actual stack where the database is you can run it literally on jenkins server or airflow server it doesn't really matter it's it's agnostic from where the database is it can connect to the different databases um and lots of lots of options if you go to the repository which i will quickly show um this repository you can open up um in and just you know clone it um if you have your astro account set up it will show you how to load your data um in this case uh we're using an uh you know a dockerized apache sander to move data out of that cassandra into astra a really in-depth article here sorry a code here with good documentation take a look at it i highly recommend learning ds bulk if you're in the casino that's indeed a great tool and i'm very happy what it's finally available for apache cassandra because it was originally locked on data stocks enterprise and frankly speaking i believe now it's much better when it supports all the sides of um cassandra including diesel and data stocks enterprise but open source apache cassandra as well that's the right thing that's the right way yeah um absolutely and and there there are different tools that you know you're going to encounter um that commercial companies put out there open source uh people put out there um but ultimately there's people getting paid to do the work right there's tools like medusa and reaper for example from uh from the the tlp people that are now part of datastax but you know it takes some quality product developers to make those tools so i'm glad that datastax put in the time and effort in building it and now that it's open source it is available to a lot for a lot more folks um definitely check it out worth it um spark uh i would say i was gonna say it's a tool kit but it's actually a whole garage full of tools not just one toolkit spark is a very powerful ecosystem to deal with data migration is just one part of it as i was mentioning you could have a spark job as part of your deployment to be managing mass data migrations offset migrations of data um in very kind of elegant and complex ways we're just going to cover a few of them so if you're a spark master no pun intended um you are uh going to probably have better ways of doing what i what i'm suggesting here if you don't know what spark is uh you know it's kind of like the next generation after hadoop uh and um it is so widely used that if you don't know apache spark and you're in the data world in the in the big data world i would question uh what you mean by big data um everybody uses it it's apache spark is part of data stacks enterprise it is also part of uh every hadoop distribution um it is available on google dataproc on uh amazon emr on [Music] azure hdinsights and then databricks of course commercially supports it we covered these uh different variations of of hadoop and spark availability on the google uh amazon and microsoft native clouds um but it's it's basically an api to manipulate a dag and we're going to talk about dags a little bit later as well dag is a directed acyclic graph so you have a sequence of tasks you need to do you define it in code and then spark takes that and breaks it into a smaller smaller chunks of work and then spreads it out into as bigger plus you as you have if you have six node cluster you'll do it on six nodes if you have thousand nodes it'll do it on a thousand nodes um and it will do it and it'll finish the task so if you have to move terabytes of data you kind of have to maybe start thinking about apache spark right now dsp may or may not be able to cut it for you yeah you can trust spark is an incredible thing it's very powerful and has very many of different uh possible usages it supports very many different uh scenarios it's a very very powerful and configurable tool one of the usages of spark not for migration purposes also maybe for migration as well is a spark sequel so uh you can for example run sql queries over cassandra which is no sequel but with spark you can have sql over cql which is quite quite cool of course it's not going to be as lightning fast as cassandra is but there are some places here to have this ability which is quite interesting uh we have a question uh from uh raul um rahul uh pojack hopefully uh spark what is the spark um to compare to any uh another tool used by developers what would you call a spark competitor for example um a spark competitor um compared to spark there is apache flink which is also open source compared to spark in the google ecosystem there's something called data flow and connected to spark there's a thing called apache beat an apache beam actually runs on spark and on flink anyways it's all kind of connected uh but apache beam apache spark apache flank are kind of not really competitors because you can run beam on spark and flink um but beyond that um you really have to think about other programming systems so for example in python there's a technology like dasc there's another technology called ray uh in python um if you are in the c plus plus world there's a lot of massively parallel programming platform like libraries that you can use to to to run applications but spark is so widely used that um and you can use python you can use scala you can use java it has an sql shell we'll talk a little bit about that in a second um you can even program in c sharp microsoft has a project called uh you know c sharp for apache spark um so you know uh and it has the ability to do compiled jobs as well as scripted jobs meaning you could interactively do operations on a cluster in spark with with python or especially with with the scala shell it has a redeveloped print loop rebel and you could you could do stuff on a cassandra cluster with 100 no's or a thousand nodes with spark that you pretty much could not do with anything else so in certain case working with apache cassandra spark is the only game in town for certain things um hopefully that answers your question yeah i think so where the mention of google bigquery is leading as present i would say google bigquery is a great tool uh but it also has some limitations first of all from my experience spark basically can do much more yes so second of all spark is not limited to the one and only google cloud platform and if you will uh desire to move from google bigquery for example to amazon web services now man you have problems because it won't work and spark is a platform agnostic and it belongs to apache software foundation uh not to a proprietary owner like google cloud but to an open source non-profit community and from this point of view it may be also be quite cool thing yep yeah and that's a good thank you for bringing a big query i would say bigquery is is is again it's only useful in google world but it's more like a uh data warehousing uh kind of uh you know engine in that you connect your data and it brings it in and allows you to do queries into it but it's more closer to i would say snowflake or redshift okay and apache spark although it can do that with spark sql that's not the only thing it can do like alex mentioned it's it can do so many things right you can do machine learning uh algorithms in spark right you can do graph you can do graph processing in spark you can bring up data frames from different databases in spark and do manipulations on them which you could you just couldn't do that in bigquery um so it's it is a good tool but it is a it has a very limited scope where spark is a much broader scope which is why i mentioned it's like a whole garage full of tools right like when i when i'm when i'm talking about spark uh you know what before when you said what is hadoop hadoop is like a thousand tools not really but it's a lot of tools right spark is one tool but if you zoom into it there's a lot of different libraries uh and things that you can use to to do anything with data basically um coming back to uh you know kind of the talk here um spark works well with cassandra because cassandra scales horizontally spark and scale horizontally um and it works with astr um and you know we have some code examples that you can take a look here uh but i don't want to necessarily have you guys copy and paste and run these commands but if you go check out a couple of these uh links and again the cassandra bitly slash cassandra data ops will point you to all these links there's a previous talk that we did it talks to you about running apache spark jobs against astr you can take a look at that and see here's another example [Music] just simple operations against uh astra with spark right there's lots of stuff out there this is just one of the examples you can run this in git pod you can talk to your astro database with spark in git pod so that's why i would recommend take a look at it okay and what we want to do once you learn how to use spark what we really want to do is something like this right get data from one place and put it into another place right from 1.0 insert into this database select from this you could do this in um in a relational database like mysql or mssql or postgres you can actually do this with cassandra if you're using spark right you can say read table write to or you can so you can say insert into this select statement um it is possible but you need to connect your clusters properly uh it's kind of magical so um if you were doing things like this offer a mass data migration it can work it can also work uh if you do properly with with filters to do sync offsets um but this is not the only thing that you know spark can do i'm just showing you that if you connect two different clusters you can do magical stuff like this right really cool um again we could talk about spark and cassandra for days but we're going to move on another tool that again very few people have done schema management for sorry change management for schema but there's a tool called liquibase which is how do you manage schema changes how do you manage changes to a database period um in in git and their tooling is uh there's an open source version of it and that's really the only one that supports the cassandra connector um but what it allows us to do is uh manage the changes to the database that we're using now as well as the database that we're going to be using in the future and to be able to track it properly you want to use liquidbase.org it's the only one that supports the cassandra connector they do have a pro offering but i don't think it supports the cassandra connector right now what does it do well you have it talk to your database and it infers the status of your database now and as you start making changes to it it starts tracking those changes and it saves them as xml files and it can store things like exactly what happened right and you can change these files as well um why is this important as you're doing changes to your current database your current application or starting to involve new databases um you want to be able to redo that work in development staging and production right well this type of tool allows you to make the same schema changes with an audit trail of exactly who did what right who made the table uh and and it also gives you a mechanism to do rollbacks um at first i was very skeptical skeptical right because i was like sorry maybe you can go full screen oh sorry thanks thank you for reminding me um yeah it's much easier i was fairly skeptical because um i thought i don't want a random tool to be managing my database migrations but when i learned it one of our team members actually learned it and started a presentation on it i started to understand what the purpose of this tool is the purpose of this tool is to track the changes the schema changes it's not going to move your data for you it's just going to track them and execute the schema changes for you and it does it in a repeatable manner that can be automated right we've been talking about different steps that can be done manually you can use this tool manually but once you have the change set you can then apply the same change set to the tool to run it the exact same way between environments um there's a couple of tables that it stores this data into uh it allows you to uh have a consistent execution uh via a database change lock table and this is the most important part it doesn't allow two different people to make changes to schemas uh in any environment because essentially this database change lot table is used uh with it with the tool um really powerful tool um we have actually a presentation on it you can look it up on our blog um if you're a database a pro most of the time you come up with your own homegrown solution to manage schema changes uh alongside with your application development team uh in the cql world cassandra query language world we didn't have such a tool until the guys at liquid base actually made it that's really cool um i'm not gonna go through all this stuff but there's a really rich uh workflow uh you can have tags to kind of organize tables organize changes um and uh you can have even your own sub commands essentially to deploy different databases uh but once you use this and you have your workflow you're not going to be running this stuff manually we're going to be using some sort of automation to then manage the execution of this tool um at the end of the day if you take a look at our code base i'll bring it up right now i'm just curious how to use it this thing can actually work with uh astra and you can just open it up in git pod right and you can walk through the examples and start to see things like hey take a look at the database update my liquid base chain set right and then you can apply uh or you can do rollbacks to your schema using liquid base um it's like git for your schema um and it's managing oil it's like a git for your schema i like it that's incredible definition yeah i will i will uh like steal that for my own presentations thank you yeah super super super useful uh i want to thank uh shout out to arpan who actually put in a lot of work uh a while ago to to learn this tool and to put this code base together and a lot more people on our team um are using it because well he did all the hard work so thanks arpan appreciate your work on the code base here um back to our presentation um now airflow i kind of mentioned it a little bit before um it's the command center so we plan out whether we want to do an online or an offline migration more more than likely you're going to be doing a online migration with dual rights and it's going to at least require schema deployment it's going to at least require schema changes it's going to at least require some sort of offset management if you did an offline migration it's going to require all those things and especially if you're doing an offline one you may have to do schema offset syncs and data uh syncs more than once until you're super happy with the state of both of your applications um airflow is as as good as the operator right it's a robot and how well you give it instructions uh is how well it performs um you could you could say well i could just do this with my own scripting system well yes you could uh you could do it with with quran you could do it with um just write a bash script and run it right each step uh and script out everything yourself right you could even use python and script out everything yourself um but why would you um with airflow you're getting the ability to take a sequence of tasks that have already existing operators there's a bash operator there's a spark operator there's a sql operator so a lot of different operators exist to do things for you and airflow can manage a dag which is a directed acyclic graph of tasks so if you have three steps that need to happen before a fourth step all three things need to be finished first before the fourth step airflow can manage that directed acyclic graph meaning the sequence of things in one direction and you can do things as complex or as simple as you as you as you uh want it to be some people can use uh jenkins to manage most of this that i'm talking about here um but jenkins has a at least the last time i checked a very sequential fairly simple um sequence of steps and it doesn't have the ability to create new tasks dynamically whereas in apache airflow you can do that because your your code is python um at the end of the day let's just take a look at the interface so imagine you have specific dags that you have created for a mass data migration or an offset migration or a schema migration all those things you could schedule them and you could turn them on and off you could hit replay you could play it right now and you could see in the big complex tree of tasks that need to be finished which ones were successful which ones failed which ones are up for rescheduled uh which ones are up for a retry and you could see it in a different view this is the same well i wouldn't say the same one but it's a different view of a different task here but what this is showing is all of these tasks run me with zero one two and three have to run before this thinking right right and these are just uh actually a part of a loop and dependent on some logic you can have it run something uh first or just skip something right i'm gonna go back to uh one of the the slides earlier so you can imagine how you can leverage air flow in basically tying all the things that we've been talking about together right we'll go back to that in a second and i would say this is probably the most useful is when you're doing these data migrations and if you're doing these sinks every part of your dag can be measured you can measure how long something took right and and you would hope that after you do a massive data migration that every subsequent sync of data is going to be much quicker right so this thing actually showed to you it can prove you prove to you that things are actually not quicker and what does that look like well in this case we're doing a basic etl um with with cassandra and using spark um and i'll take a look at that right now so you can see by the way all these slides will be made uh you know available online but uh in this one uh you can open this up in git pod you can run this in git pods you don't have to install airflow yourself and you can connect this with astra and what it will show you how to do is essentially make a simple etl where you're taking data from uh one uh table and putting into another you're doing some operation on it basically looks like this right and and what we're doing here is we're just saying do this task before we do this task and you can use the same syntax to create this dependency tree of tasks in this case we're using bash operator there are tons of operators in airflow if you just google airflow operator you'll find it and so just imagine you want to do let's go back to this this diagram here right let's say you want to do this operation right here where you're maybe creating the tables you're migrating the data you're doing a mass move of the data and at that point your new database is ready uh airflow you probably will not use to deploy your new software that's going to do reads and writes something else will probably do that but you can consider it i wouldn't recommend it and once that's the new application is deployed and it's writing to a and b airflow can then be used to run a validation and sync process every hour every day right it can do all this for you and you know what this process right here if you construct uh your mass move of data properly it's probably the same thing actually it just has to be filtered with the right uh you know filtration criteria uh and in most cases this same operation you're just gonna be running it until you're ready to wean off of your old database going back here we have a few talks on airflow airflow is very popular these days um there's lots of code examples out there um for pretty much everything you're trying to do and like spark you don't have to just just use airflow for etl right you you don't have to just use airflow for data migration uh people use airflow for managing complex data pipelines um and it's kind of like a the jenkins for data right now let's say you don't want to do a lot of this you need some help um well finally uh you can ask datastax to help you um you can ask us to help you too but uh datasex has a very specific uh astra migration service um and essentially you know there's i think there's a bit of a consultation uh they understand what your current setup is and it's actually specifically for cassandra i think to cassandra to astra um and you know what we've been talking about so far has been agnostic you could use the same general methods and tools to move from my sequel to to astra postgres to astra um but uh this particular kind of product service offering from datasacks is is uh i believe primarily from cassandra on-premise or cassandra on your own cloud machines to uh to astra and the way that they do it is the there's a uh technology that you deploy uh in your cluster and i haven't used it i can't delete specifically uh but you you it's deployed and it's a proxy and your application needs to be configured to be able to talk to this proxy so this approach is actually the online migration method the second one that we talked about the one that we just looked at it's just done in a different way so that's why what we talked about at the very beginning is a pattern right it's a database migration pattern and data stacks happens to use that pattern in what they call the aster migration service and uh you know your application will be talking to your own database and at some point it will do a batch update right map move data and mass and then you can do dual writes to this proxy and sorry this is the historical data migrator this is where you do the mass migration and this is where you have your application essentially talking to your old database and your new database simultaneously and after you're happy you turn off your old database because everything is going to be on master so um as uh you were talking earlier you can use ds dsp like we talked about you can use spark like we talked about right um the actual methodology is the same it's just that there's a new technology that data sacs is going to give you to make it a little bit easier to basically talk to the astra database in your own application world and of course they're going to help you look at the system at the very end you know post migration uh make sure everything is good to go and then they can turn off the uh the migration proxy um and and uh you know one thing again i haven't used it because it's part of their offering um there's a data comparison that they can do using something called cassandra div that's kind of cool so that's it for today um as i mentioned i just wanted you guys to learn the different tools uh and and kind of assemble them together and use them in a way that makes sense for you um there's a lot of cool stuff out there uh but i would recommend taking a look at this link here uh i'll bring it up again uh data operations guide for apache cassandra and uh you can go to it by going to bitly slash cassandra data ops maybe you could send the link to me and i will send the link to the guys yeah i'll there we go uh but that that is all i have for today uh alex um very short and sweet today um and then next week we're going to cover true transformation right and you know what you did a great job with airflow i and well with all the other things as well but uh speaking about the other things i used most of them already and but not the airflow and you completely sold it to me yeah um definitely take a look at the code examples uh and give us some feedbacks uh alex but uh yeah if you if you use any of the code that's out there on gitpod um and if if you have any suggestions or questions just just ask us with the github issue or just directly contact us give me a moment i'm looking for a link i believe you send it to me right yeah just seconds give me one second i'm going to verify ah right you got it easier got it got it you got it yes actually what i sent you if you if you lowercase it uh i think it'll work i don't know why it uh slack did some funky things okay okay i will fix it ah okay now it's in keryllic won't work as well okay https so right that's filling and that should work um no uh here here i'll just get it directly from um and i'll send it to you here i'll find you in skype and i think you got you got the right link down okay okay yes that is the right link i think sorry guys okay now you have a writing and i will delete the old one which is wrong boom right yes it works for me so that is a great thing uh have at the moment any questions on youtube at least everything what was asked was already answered i believe and that is incredible now the next thing we could do uh for our best of the best attendees as we promised we will have a quiz with surprises because you did very well listening and learning through these works and hopefully the previous one as well but before we start please give me a moment we will uh switch off for a second and we will get back to you in a minute okay so uh hold on and we will be there in a moment just a second okay just okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] transition hey we are back i hope that wasn't for too long and i picked the good music for you to wait for us in the waiting room i hope no one quits because now we have to [Music] run the show so give me a moment and boom now yes i see you are here so let's run the quiz it's competition time don't forget you have to give the right answers but you have to do it fast sooner you answer um higher the chance you get the maximum points and get the price now how to participate uh i will send you a link and that's the easiest way to jump in if you want to jump in from another device then you have two options first one go to mentee.com and put the code 89856500 i will put the code in the chat as well eight nine eight five six five zero zero let me check eight nine and five right or you can simply scan the qr code next to uh rahul if you want uh like my suggestion personally i prefer to visit uh [Music] mainly with my mobile phone it's just the easiest option so you can watch us on your laptop and answer questions on your mobile phone so and let me see how many people have joined us already okay i need some more i need some more vera prices from data stocks you can get so jump in push the thumbs up and we will start in the moment uh we are waiting for players to start question number one okay then one more one more and we start jumping don't miss your chance don't make the competition too easy for when we can do it better okay good thank you so let's start then ladies and gentlemen that's question number one answer fast to get more points what is astra let's start with something simple we mentioned it this week and last week it's a database as a service based on cassandra it's a local in-memory version of apache cassandra it's an integrated development environment it's a gateway to stars so everyone has voted and most of you give a right answer good so that's good but who was the fastest one who one of you was the fastest one let me see and looks like it was javier that's a good job uh rahul is on the second place i mean roll one from the comments not from the screen i hope you don't participate you are not allowed to and adrian takes the third place we have more questions so jump in everyone will have some chances to win and that's going to be question number two so answer fast to get more points what is stargate today it was mentioned briefly but we do mention that last week so it's a new mario game it's a tv show it's a data gateway to give you rest to graphql api on cassandra it's a gateway to the stars this one's still quite easy okay and both answers tv show and date gateway are right so let us move on to the leaderboard who was faster speech time okay so javier again was the fastest and adrian takes a second place that's competition that's good so only top three places are getting the prizes now simple answers are over now you will have to think to give right answer question number three ask for fast to get more points what type of a schema migration requires a new table in apache cassandra when changing only partition key columns when changing only the clustering columns all of the above now that's not going to be easy everyone has voted and right answer all of them both schema migration requires a new table and apache cassandra then changing both partition and clustering key columns or any of them so answer first to second answer are wrong both clustering and partition may require a new table well now we will have time here oh no no no at some point i was scared what caviar made a mistake no it was again fastest answer that's a good job and adrian on the second round on the third and lck on the fourth ready to fight for referred so raul take care there is someone very close to you let's take a look how it goes further question number four answer fast to get more points what tools are not useful in moving data into and out of apache cassandra tf bulk secure copy command spark sstable loader note tool you see it like starts very easy but with every next step question some more and more complicated and most of you made it that's a great job that's a great job so yes right note tool note tool is the thing what's uh is very helpful but won't help you moving data in and out of apache cassandra right so and now oh rahul it was a mistake now looks like sck will use this yeah to jump in the top three and have here is fastest again that is something that's a performance few questions in the row that's a good result so question number five answer fast to get more points if you have to keep both the legacy and the new platform data in sync which methods work offline migration involving downtime forever refresh online migration involving no downtime but a change in your software hybrid migration involving both online and offline data migrations all of them both hoping a simple backup restore at the very last minute works well enough right answer all of the above all those methods despite their different approaches but technically they do work for this situation and they will keep you help you keep the data in sync so they work but you but they're different different thing and no we don't think simple backup restore very last minute will work well enough okay so i cannot believe javier it was a mistake unbelievable now adrian adrian gets to the first place how here is on the second and george is on the third place because sck looks like was too slow for his question that's interesting so we have uh rahul casper and sck have chances to fight for the third place but looks like adrian is unbeatable so i see no chance to make adrian out of the top three at least or maybe he will be able to hold the position ladies and gentlemen that is the question number six two questions left now focus we proceed you know what to do answer fast to get more points what tools do you think are useful in online migration as a stable sql copy ts bulk capcom as a stable secure copy ds bulk capcom ok that was a complete wipe only one person made a right answer uh what you uh missed what most of you missed is an online migration for online migration and online sync ds valk won't help you it's a tool for offline migration which is very helpful which can be and good addition to account connect but it's not really a tool for an online migration so only one person gave the right answer and who was it who made the right answer casper nice nice that that took some time but casper now jumps directly to the second place with the fastest and the only right answer that was very interesting now adrian casper and xavier are keeping top free and we go directly to the last question so breath out breathing warm up your fingers get ready ladies and gentlemen we start the last question of the quiz for today's second episode second episode out of free for our data migration to the cloud series and here we go transfer fast to get more points what is not the goal of data operations in a cloud migration automate repetitive import export and syncing tasks build our software and release it allow automated quality control in each release to save time and money what if that is not the goal of data operations in a cloud migration okay you know what that's quite an interesting outcome no data operations are not responsible for build and release of the software this question was a hard one indeed but indeed data operations goal is the primary the goal of it is to save time and money and make your application uh running in the cloud with all the data stored where it should be stored so the first very goal of the data operations is to save time money and effort of your team and then it allows uh for automated quality control in releases for data and it allows automatic repetitive import expert sync tasks but it's not for building and releasing software indeed now i you know what i cannot i cannot push the button i just i just i'm scared to see what will happen next yeah here it is so okay casper slow but we've no mistakes casper that's a great result wow good work good work that's a good work take a look never fast enough but always with the right answer that's a very good approach almost always almost always okay so casper first place adrian second place sck third place please contact um me actually it will be i believe easier if you contact me at datastax.com alex i will that is my link so contact me on linkedin link is in the chat and i will take care what prices will be dispatched to you don't forget to make a screenshot of your winning screen with your place first second and third places and to the others don't be this okay if we of course it's always not the best feeling to lose in the competitive competition i do know that i lost a lot of competitions in my life with some of them actually used to but what matters is you're learning something new today you become a better version of yourselves as an engineers developers administrators architects and that's what really matters uh not for prizes from data stocks although they're quite nice better luck next time we have next workshop of this series with a role uh in next week tuesday but we have one more workshop out of this series for another things tomorrow actually so you can subscribe to our youtube channel jump in tomorrow and try to win the prizes in the next workshop which we do tomorrow and i believe that was it uh do you have any more things to say any more slides no that's it uh yeah looking forward to talking next week about what true serverless transformation can look like where every everything is in the cloud and um you know we're gonna talk about some practical things that you can do today uh but really uh what i would like to do is to open up people's thought processes and and and have everybody think outside of the box like what is an amazing uh serverless platform look like so lots of cool stuff to come next week and uh yeah looking forward to it great so uh thank you so much and that was incredible day incredible work with you today thank you so much for joining every one of you and see you next week or maybe even tomorrow thanks so much alex appreciate everything and see you guys next time thank you a little bit of music in the end you know relax and enjoy you spend this time very well [Music] now i have more room no more formats to change [Music] living in the future [Music] [Music] you",
