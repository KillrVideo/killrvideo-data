    "text": "[Music] hi i am artem chubatko and this is introduction to graph analytics with datastax enterprise graph it is a short course but it relies on many many concepts covered in two prerequisite courses please make sure you have prior knowledge of the property graph data model graph schema gremlin traversal language dsc graph architecture the ac analytics offering spark cassandra connector spark sql and data frames you can review these and other prerequisite topics in our data stacks enterprise graph and data stacks in the price analytics with apache spark courses we begin with some important preliminary notions about graph analytics graph analytics is about delivering value from your graph data by combining and applying well-known analysis steps into a data analysis workflow with the goal of doing data-driven decision making information discovery graph exploration and all kinds of ad-hoc analysis such data analysis workflows are built using well-understood steps and algorithms like classification clustering regression similarity matching and so forth these algorithms are frequently studied in one or more related disciplines such as the ones shown here in general graph analytics is a very broad and complex field that requires knowledge and understanding of many disciplines for example graph analytics benefits from data engineering to extract acquire and prepare data it benefits from data mining to find patterns and build predictive descriptive and other kinds of models it benefits from statistics to analyze data and its properties graph analytics also benefits from visualization to improve sharing reporting and evaluation many real-life problems and data sets are naturally represented as networks verbs or graphs they also primarily focus on connections links relationships and dependencies complex relationships such as those captured in the domains of customer 360 recommendations fraud detections and so forth are best modeled and traversed using graphs of course this is not a complete list of graph analytics applications but it is quite representative for dse graph it is useful to distinguish between real time and batch analytics and understand how those are supported by dse graph some analytical applications have real-time user-facing components requiring fast response examples would be recommendations personalization and fraud prevention it is quite possible that a recommendation system has batch analytics components too they may pre-compute recommendations overnight but eventually recommendations must be served in real time by recommender subsystem similarly you may have a real real-time fraud prevention component that makes a decision about a current transaction and a batch analytics fraud detection that analyzes many historical transactions to find fraud that was committed in the past in dhc graph in some cases real-time analytical steps can be implemented using kremlin oltp traversals with response times measured in milliseconds or in case of infrequent traversals in seconds alternatively one can implement near real-time analytics in dsa graph using gremlin lab traversals for near-real-time analytics we are expecting a response time in seconds batch analytics would always rely on dsa graph or lab capabilities those are gremlin allop traversals and dsc graph frames the two approaches complement each other in their capabilities grammar lab traversals are automatically translated into sparkcon and executed as spark jobs they are suitable for long-running computationally and memory expensive traversals the ac graph frames while also have limited support of kremlin are frequently most valued for their ability to perform non-gremlin graph data manipulation via spark combining graph and non-graph data for analysis ingesting a data stream into a graph and bulk data mutations to decide between gremlin allop traversals and dac graph frames it is useful to distinguish between deep and scanned queries deep queries are targeted traversals that heat large number of vertices due to a high graph density and longer traversal paths gremlin allop traversals will do best here scan queries are traversals that touch either an entire graph or its large subgraphs the ac graph frames will be a better choice for scan queries we cover both gremlin a lot traversals and dse graph frames in much greater detail in separate videos as a result in dhc graph there are two olap engines with different apis and capabilities these engines rely on apache spark but use different data abstractions the spark graph computer engine is the primary engine for executing gremlin a lab traversals which we already know are great for deep queries the dac graph frames engine is the primary engine for executing the c graph frame queries which we said are good for scan queries the two olap engines are starting to converge where intelligent analytics query routing if you have a gremlin a lab traversal that performs a simple scan query the spark graph computer engine will automatically delegate execution to dsc graph frames engine currently intelligent a lab query routing works for count group count and drop queries that involve no more than three hubs use steps like has has label out in bose and out e the feature will keep evolving so always check the documentation for the most recent list of requirements intelligent analytics query routing is an automatic optimization feature that is implemented as a dsc graph frame interceptor strategy therefore if for any reason you need to disable rerouting for a particular traversal it is quite easy to do by disabling this strategy",
