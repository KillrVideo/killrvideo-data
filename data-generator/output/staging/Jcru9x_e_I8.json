    "text": "[Music] so let's talk about ss table dump probably one of the oldest tools in the cassandra toolbox but still really useful so ss table dump was custom built to do one thing guess what dump an ss table so it's just that it takes an ss table and it pulls out the text representation of what's in the file now i can do it only in one format and that's json and it gives you all of the data deep down inside of the poor ss table including things like tombstones and ttls it's really good though for things like diagnostics and you can understand what's happening inside of your data file at a level that you can't get anywhere else when you look at the output of an ss table dump in this json format you'll see all the different parts of that file this is one from a 3.0 node which means that it was after we had a big storage engine change so some of this is different if you had this before 3.0 it would look a little different because there was a different file structure this file structure shows okay here's the key here's the position the type which is a row it breaks down all these pieces into the really small parts you can see the liveness like the time stamp that the data was written into the system and the actual values of what they were so way more information than you ever need and usually a diagnostic problem you're looking to solve an issue that you may have a bug you found a bug or something like that an option to the json format is if you use the dash d which gives you a much more terse output this gives you pretty much the basics here's what's in the file not a lot of ceremony around it the json is much more structured of course and there's a lot more information this is just the basics so if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to know the exact data this is the tool to use",
