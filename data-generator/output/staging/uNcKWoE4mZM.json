    "text": "and welcome again this time we're in our final exercise in our intro to casandra for developers crash course video 607 this is the execute crud operation um so the last link here again we're going back to our repo notice the hash three execute cred operations again the link is in the video details all right so we were we left off at the end of two we created our table wonderful so what we're going to do is go down to execute crud operations now this exercise is probably the it is the longest of the ones we've been doing so far you know originally we just kind of created our database and created a table kind of going along with the videos you watch hopefully you watch the art of data modeling and now we're here where we're going to create some more tables we're going to see more about our crud operations our create read update and delete type operations and these are the type of operations that you're going to use in any kind of interaction from an application to a database right you're always going to have a case where you need to create things where you need to read things where you need to update things and you need to delete things so we're now going to go over what those commands look like okay so the first couple things we want to do if you remember we talked a lot about comments by user and comments by video so we're going to go ahead and create those tables just like we talked about in the video let's go ahead and create those again now i am continuing on from what we did previously so i'm already using the killer video key space if for some reason you left and like came back or something make sure to do that otherwise you're probably going to get some errors okay so we've created our tables let's go ahead and describe them again you can just copy the commands out of the command execute and we see we have our three tables comments by video comments by user and users by city we created earlier now the first operation we want to look at is the c the create right so when you create things in cassandra you're going to use an insert statement now by the way if you've come from the sql and relational world and you're checking out cassandra for the first time insert should look very familiar that's because it's the same thing um sql or i'm sorry sql is a subset of sql it looks and feels just like it right so yes there may be some differences under the hood like you don't join between tables or anything but the syntax is largely the same except for some commands that are specific to cassandra but for what we're doing now this should all look and feel very familiar okay so the first thing we want to do is insert some data we have our tables right so we want to insert some data into our comments by user table now something i want to point out here um is that for those of you who are familiar with something like a uuid uh you might be asking why are we using these hard-coded uuids would i ever do this in the real world um the reason why we're doing this is for our when when we do our workshops and our crash courses and everything we usually have lots of people who are doing them all at the same time so it is much easier for us to use these hard-coded values so if somebody runs in some trouble we know exactly how to help them if everybody was generating their own uuid it would be very hard to track down so my point of this is you're going to see a lot of cases where we're using these hard-coded values however in the real world i would actually be using something like this where i would use uuid with these prins if you're interested in that right you can just go to the docs there it'll explain all about it they're extremely easy to use like i like you see where i'm using now with the prinz i would literally just put uuid with the parens to generate that on the fly right i'm not really getting into a lot of detail about what uuids are for and how to use them essentially they are a way in a distributed system to ensure that you have unique keys which is very important if you're coming from the relational world and you're like well if i'm going to have a user id i'll just use an integer and then i will just increment that integer and for a relational database that's fine but for a distributed database where i have multiple machines multiple nodes if you remember from the very beginning of this course then what happens is if i have say two users that are being created at the same exact time and there's say a network partition and two nodes can't talk well if i'm using integers and both users get created with an integer of one what's going to happen is when that network partition recovers and those two nodes can talk to each other last right wins right so one of those is just going to disappear and that's a collision we don't want that in cassandra we don't want that in any distributed system so we use uuids instead for ids that way i know from a distributed sense my ids are safe i don't have to worry about those collisions okay enough of that so what we're going to do is we're going to grab all these insert statements i'm just going to go ahead and put those in we're just populating our data right you see this insert into comments by user we're specifying the fields now i purposely kind of like spelled them out this way to make it very clear what each one was for um in the real world like i would probably more do something like what you see here where i'm just listing out the columns and then for whatever values or whatever columns i have i'm now saying okay the values so if you were to take a look at this i'm saying the user id value is this first one a comment id value is the now right so on and so forth so they have a one-to-one relationship and you can see that we're using now to generate our timestamp and we've just inserted some data okay let's scroll down a little bit let's go ahead and put some data into our comments by video table as well and again the idea here is just to give you a feel for how the insert statements work right we look over on the side you can see i have my insert into whatever table the column names and then values with the actual data okay that's inserting right that's that's pretty simple you can use it insert you can also use update i'll get there in a moment but for now create is insert okay so moving on to read well now we've put some data in the system so how do we read it so that's where you see this command the select star from comments by user i'll go ahead and do that and look at that oh i can read back all the data we just inserted now something i want to point out and this is very important so if you were falling asleep at all wake up at this moment because what i'm just about to say is really key the way the only reason why i'm even doing something like a select star from comments by user when using cassandra without specifying a partition key in my where clause like i am here is because i know that we only have you know four rows of data and a couple partitions and that's it if you were to do this on a real cassandra cluster with a real production data set and i'm talking if you had a case of you know like thousands or millions of partitions in rows if you issue this you would have just caused a full scan on your whole cluster that's this little blurb i'm talking about right here this is never something to do for real in your app especially in a production system again we are using a very small data set here so i just happen you know we just happen to be able to do this i just want to point that out i'm not going to belabor it anymore and if this goes back to what we talked about in the very beginning of this crash course with the way that cassandra works and again it is you always want to use that partition key right and that's what we're doing here so in this example we're doing the same thing but we're saying okay well i'm going to put the partition key because user id is my partition key in the comments by user table but i'm going to put that in my where clause and now i'm pulling back just that partition notice the difference right i get that single partition back compared to multiple again i have a couple in this case but if i was working with production data i could have millions or billions and you do not want to cause a full scan across your cluster okay so we've just read some data pretty simple right let's go on to some others we're going to read all of the comments all the data from the comments by user and comments by videos table okay you can see that those came out this is again based off the data we inserted earlier so this is us reading with a select statement all right scrolling down a little bit more now let's go ahead and update by the way before we do that i do want to point one thing out um we talked about the time uid field back in the data modeling portions of the series here time uid is actually a really cool field it essentially combines both a uuid and a time stamp into a single type a single object it's really nice and convenient actually so if you do have a case to use it i suggest go ahead and use it okay so now moving on to step 3d this is where we're going to update some data now if you take a look at what we had done previously right and we created some data using this insert statement we said oh my god that oh my god that guy patrick is such a geek right and in the data here it is right you can see we've got that data right here and if we take a look at the comments by video table here that we created earlier right this is the same one you don't need to copy these we've already done this in order to update some record we need to know what the primary key was to create the record right so if you take a look at the primary key here you'll see it's video id so our partition key is video id and then we're clustering by command id and this forms my primary key so i need those two values because if i'm going to update a column in that particular row remember the primary keys they do what they they determine you know a unique row so if i'm going to update some column in a row i need to give it the exact address to where those things are so i need both video id and comment id so what we're going to do here is notice in our statement i have both in my where clause so i'm going to say update the table name comments by video i'm going to set comment i'm going to change the comment so it's existing right now it is oh my god that guy patrick is such a geek and we're going to update it to oh my god that guy patrick is on fleek right but notice what i'm doing in the where clause here where video id is that id and the comment id remember a primary key is a combination here a video id and comment id so i'm passing both of those into my where clause so i'm essentially saying hey update the comment column specifically for this row with video id and comment id okay let's go ahead and do it okay and notice i did a select statement right there after it so it does select it and now you see that that has been changed oh my god that guy patrick is on fleek so we've updated the data from one value to another value all right so then moving on to delete the d in crud so we're going to delete some data i'm going to scroll down um now one thing i want to point about point out about deletes real quick right and i kind of talk about this right here so in cassandra when you delete you're actually inserting now if you want to you can look up what are called tombstones as a matter of fact if you go and i'll talk about this here in a minute if you go to any of our free online courses where you really get into the deep fundamentals of cassandra you'll definitely find out about tombstones um so cassandra is built to perform at scale and it's also built in such a way to ensure that when you do insert and i'm talking this is a petabyte level database you could have thousands of nodes and when you perform a delete operation it's actually creating what's called a delete marker tombstone and that is an insert on its own now why am i telling you about this well because how you delete matters right so if let's say that you had a table that had a million rows in it right would you want to delete and let's say you want to get rid of the whole table right now if you knew you wanted to get rid of the whole table the way to do it is to use truncate right if you're like okay i just want to drop everything from this table use truncate that is the most efficient operation from that standpoint however if you just want to say delete a subset of the data in that table and you want to delete a set of partitions then you want to delete at the partition level right now compare that to deleting every individual column of every row if you had like a million rows i mean other than that being just a little nuts you would actually be creating a delete marker for every single one of those columns instead of one delete marker for the partition huge difference there right so my whole point is this in my my little tangent here is when you're deleting delete the largest set of data that you can at a time if you know you need to delete the partition deleted the partition the only time you should delete an individual column is when you really truly need to delete just an individual column right you keep that in mind you'll be totally good okay so moving on if i want to delete something i just issue the delete from command so i'm going to say delete from again my table name comments by video again notice i'm providing both the values that are in my primary key so this case my partition key of video id and my clustering column a common id because i want to ensure in this case that i'm deleting this row i'm deleting a specific row if i by the way just did this and i did not do by command id i would delete the whole partition right you see how that works so i can choose so what i'm going to do is i'm going to delete just the individual row most likely the one we're working with and look boom that one that oh my god that guy patrick is on fleek you'll see that that is now gone because we've selected it back out as we're done so i have effectively deleted that row okay that's awesome thank you so much for joining me through this crash course and going through the exercises i hope this is just the start of your journey with cassandra there's so much you can do with this database it is just so capable and can perform at scale like no other database out there today and finally if you want to learn more if you want to dig deeper don't forget to go to the data sex for developers link here that'll bring you to datasex.comdev there are all sorts of things to learn free learnings and everything that are there on that page and help you get a little bit deeper into your cassandra knowledge and then don't forget we do have one last video and i'm going to bring you into some resources that you get to check out and thank you so much",
