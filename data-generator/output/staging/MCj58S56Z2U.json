    "text": "[Music] astra streaming is the data stacks apache pulsar as a service offering pulsar is a cloud native streaming and messaging platform that is globally scalable the pulsar platform is organized into tenants namespaces and topics a tenant is like an instance of pulsar a tenant can contain many namespaces and namespaces can contain many topics topics are like name containers or pipelines of messages with pulsar you can create producers that publish messages to topics you can also create consumers that will consume messages from topics a third entity known as readers can read and re-read messages from topics without consuming them in this video we'll show you how to create these pulsar clients and connect them up we'll also show you how to use a sync to store messages from pulsar into an astra db table enough talk let's get started let's create a tenant we'll log into astra and click on the create streaming button we enter a tenant name here it's up to you what you want to call it we'll select a service provider a region and click the create tenant button that's it next let's create a topic within the tenant we click on the topics tab and then click on the add topic button we enter topic name again whatever you want to call it and click save now we are going to create some poster clients let's set up some environment variables for our clients let's create a variable for the tenant name and one for the topic name next let's store the tenant's service url in a variable this url is where our clients can attach to the tenant we can copy the service url to our clipboard by clicking the connect tab and then clicking here we'll paste the url as the value for the variable finally let's create a variable for the tenant access token back in the connect tab we can copy the token value here then paste the token value for the variable like this that's all the setup we need to do for our pulsar clients next let's look at the client code we'll start with the producer you see that the producer program starts by creating a pulser client instance then we use that client to create the producer instance by the way in this example we are going to simulate several household appliances generating temperature measurement messages here's what the measurement class looks like with just a sensor a time stamp and a measurement value back in the producer code you see a loop producing messages our producer will produce 40 messages but we'll run three different instances for a total of 120 messages the code ends by closing the producer and client nothing too complicated here now let's look at the code for a consumer you can see the consumer code looks a lot like the producer code where we start by creating a pulsar client and use the client to create a consumer here's the loop for consuming messages we see that we plan to consume 60 messages but we'll run two consumer instances so we consume all 120 messages from the three producers notice again that the code ends by closing the consumer and client the third pulsar client is a reader like a consumer a reader gets messages from pulsar but unlike the consumer a reader can go back and re-read the same messages you see that this code looks a lot like the consumer code but we are going to read all 120 messages these are the same 120 messages read by the consumers but the tenant stores these for a while so our reader can read them we see the code closes the resources just like the two previous clients in addition to the three clients we have just reviewed let's create a sync that will write the messages to a table in astrodb we'll use the astrodb rest api to create the table that we'll use for storing messages set up some additional environment variables to help access the rest api using curl in the astra ui click on the database name and then click the connect tab click on rest api and then click on the copy icon now back in the terminal paste the clipboard contents you see that we need to add a database access token to the end of the last export command it's easiest to create the token in a different tab copy it and paste it on the end of the export command then execute the command we'll create a table named temperatures by timestamp which has columns just like the fields in our measurement class this makes the mapping from our class to the table easy here's the curl command to create the table a little hard to read because there's no indentation but here's what the json looks like you see that it describes a table with three columns named sensor timestamp and value and that the timestamp is the primary key here's a curl command that tries to retrieve all of the columns of course it returns no results yet now let's create the sync back in the astral ui we'll start by clicking on the sync tab then click on the create sync button we'll fill out the form as i'm showing you here we'll use default as the namespace name and astrodb is the sync type but we'll just make up a name for our sink in the next section we'll fill out a topic name of our own making in the third section we'll specify our astra db's database name key space name and table name we need to get a database access token which we can create if we need to we'll copy that token and paste it here since we already created the table and named our measurement fields with the same name as the columns as soon as we enter the token aster will fill in the mapping for us we're all set so we'll click create with all the clients ready and the sync in place it's time to start moving messages around we'll start the consumers first each in a separate terminal similarly we'll start the producers in separate terminals we see that the consumers consume the messages that were enqueued and then they block waiting for additional messages and yet another terminal let's start the reader the reader looks just like a consumer except if we look carefully we see that the reader is reading the same messages the consumers already read eventually the producers will finish sending messages and the consumers will consume them all the reader also reads all the messages but we can rerun the reader and see the messages again on the other hand re-running in the consumer causes the consumer to block as no unconsumed messages exist let's check out the contents of the database table to see what the sync's been doing here's the same command that we used previously which queries all the records in the table we see that the aster streaming sync wrote all the messages to the table so now you've seen how to use aster streaming producers consumers readers and sinks",
