    "text": "hello everybody Welcome today to our live stream our level up your gen chatbot with graph Rag and Lane Shan I Am David Jones gelardi developer relations engineer and I'm joined today once again by the awesome charna Parky hi Chara hello good to be back right I know this would we we did this what like a month ago I believe yeah and did a month you know a month ago we we kind of introduced like folks graph rag honestly for those of you who are new to us uh or or if you've come back before and you're regular hello how are you doing um you know if you watch the previous episode of this um you know charna was essentially teaching myself and all of you about Graff Rag and how all the stuff works and everything like that right um so today we're GNA do something similar but we're gonna we're gonna move along a lot has happened in the last month right um you know there's been new movement in the uh the graph rag libraries and Lang chain um the work that obviously Char's been doing and such like that um so we're gonna we're going to explore all sorts of fun things um and and with that um I see I see devb Dev hello and Alan John's hello there um Everybody where are you from let us know put something there in the chat um and while you're doing that so we can get an idea of kind of you know who's joining us today um just a couple housekeeping things right uh so we do intend for these to be interactive right uh and interactive in the way that um we encourage you absolutely ask questions right you know like matter of fact the harder question you can throw at charna the better my life is right so thank you right so we get to put Chara on the spot no but really so um oh I see Arizona I see UK great from Colorado France oh hi Dev de from France oh Conrad hello there Conrad Taylor hey Conrad um hi Michelle right so um so just a couple housekeeping items um um if you do have a question that want to ask right uh you should notice somewhere in the crowdcast uh whether it's on it depends on if you're on a mobile or whatever sometimes on the bottom sometimes on the right hand side there's a little toolbar there and there is a spot with a little Q&A right so what we ask for for all of you is um if you do have a question asked please put it in the Q&A right um if you ask a question in the general chat it's not like anyone's going to come and reprimand you or something I'll probably make a comment hey put that in the Q&A um because that way gives other people a chance to score those up and it allows us to kind of like set them up um while we're while we're trying to answer and things like that so again put those in the Q&A um and down at the bottom you'll see um matter of fact you'll see a link right there it says a guide to graph rag you'll see as we talk and as we're going through content links will appear we'll put them in the regular chat as well these are resources for you these are all like free resources things that you can use as reference um all right that's enough of me talking why don't we go ahead and by the way I see prab there from Chicago I'm originally from Chicago so so hello South web suburbs so always glad to see another Chicago and on there our food is the best by let's just be very clear about [Laughter] that last time I was in Chicago actually what I found most impressive was I like the food but um there was a lot of independent fashion designers out there oh really yeah and it's been a while since I've been I need to go back but I got some of my favorite pieces that I just can't let go of because they're just so unique and I I love it I love it that's very cool I I'm I'm very um I I kind of enjoy the the fall winter weather clothes there oh yeah because you know you're you're in like winter like you know like cold times like six months out of the year so you got to have some style right you know yeah it feels like you and I have swapped right because I grew up in Florida so there was no Seasons you like not even the t-shirts and polos that they made were of a lower weight cotton because it gets so hot and then uh I moved to Seattle where it's cold rainy all the time it's currently still raining um hasn't stopped for the last couple of days so uh now I get to do all of that you know fall weather um well see now you're trapped inside doing all the graph rag stuff so that allows you to come and do these types of things so someone taught me as long as you're wearing the right outfit you're never trapped inside now I like that I like that so so with that so what is it you know we we we mentioned a moment ago that we're gonna we're going to not only kind of intro folks again to graph rag but then also kind of bring everybody up to date on what's the latest so Chara yeah Chara what do you have for us today yeah oh a lot has happened in the last month um I think last time we briefly talked about uh sort of a benchmark comparison that we had made between um traditional knowledge graphs and that are entity Centric knowledge graphs and uh content Centric knowledge graphs um so that that post is out there the repo is available if you if you read the post the repo is available that one is currently built on the uh implementation we made on the Cassandra graph Vector store the open source version um I've adapted that to the new astrab graph Vector store um that works with our Cloud version um and we've done a number of sort of features editions so that we can build this in Lang flow that you can extract links in different ways um so it's it's sort of a lot of engineering work has happened and we've had a number of customers who have been actually using real data to um actually get apps ready for production so I've got a number of different uh ways to explain how things work as I've had to explain this to a number of different people with different technical backgrounds so I think you know it's it maybe we start with something like the the demo we did last time and then we can dive deeper into all the pieces of it I think that's a great idea because for our audience right and for those you matter of fact for those of you who are with us today let us know give us a thumbs up or a thumbs down actually do you know what graph rag is are you familiar with graph rag because I think you know a lot of us now I think you know after what two something years of this whole gener generative AI explosion you know retrieval augmented generation definitely you know a term that's been around a lot and everything I think more and more people are getting a good idea of what that is but then what is this graph Rag and I do see some oh hi Matt um I see some folks that are saying yes and everything like that oh I love it I love AO yeah that's great okay okay pad does know so like you know so there's some folks here I think it would be good if just give a basic primer on the graph rag stuff and I sets up what you were just talking about and we can kind of demonstrate that with the uh the app absolutely okay so I have a couple of slides actually that maybe would be helpful to visualize some of this for folks yeah that sounds great um then let me there we go and Conrad saying not familiar with graph Rag and why do we need it so I think yeah I think we're gonna we're gonna tea that up right now all right let's so I don't know if folks have uh used a lot of rag techniques before but one of the things that rag helps you you do is to bring your data or data stored in a database into the context of an llm um so it could be for a chat-based conversation where you need context to be able to answer these questions could be for an agent-based system where the the llm is gathering context to take action uh or to do even offline planning so rag is super helpful in all of these different contexts but when when we say rag it doesn't need to be one thing or another it doesn't have to be um a vector uh database it doesn't have to be a SQL database it it could be you're calling an API it could be you're calling you're doing a search on the internet any information that you're retrieving retrieve data that you can put into the context of the LM it doesn't have to be a data or whatever exactly okay and we as humans have different sort of mental models of the world um so as you start to think about like how did you learn as you grew up you know how does the social norms work how do I you know there are 100 different ways to load the dishwasher I'm laughing because this is I like that actually that's a good um but some of them might be more efficient some of them might get things cleaner some of them might cause fights in your household who knows um but they're just things that you learn that are not always directly connected that the the the line from point A to point B just isn't it just doesn't make sense until you know and then it's connected in your brain sort of forever and we have this idea like even when we go to college and I I'll show the slides in a second but even when we go to college you know as we progress and we learn topics we end up with this sort of syndrome where we don't remember what we don't know and then you go to teach someone that and you're you start like at such a high level that they can't get to where you're at because you you have to kind of walk this path for them so I think of uh let's see slideshow there we go I think of graph rag as a way to relate information that is seemingly unrelated right um there are two different kinds of graphs a lot of folks who know about graph rag think about these fine grained entity Centric knowledge graphs on the left where you know you've got a document and you extract you know the names of people or the names of countries or or the names of let's say my mom is my is the name at the top and then she's related to me because she's my mother and then maybe you know she's related to her brother on the right but when we're talking about the world of llms the thing that they're uniquely good at is is using lots and lots of words to produce lots and lots of other words and understand right this is sort of all about the words all about the language that's why we call it a large language model um and so on the right what we see is we're not extracting anything from this document we are using the ch FKS of the document as if you were using a vector store so you know if you ingested an article or all of Wikipedia for example you can't just dump it all in there right you there's there are things about um retrieval with Vector search that means we have to chunk it maybe at the sentence level maybe at the paragraph level maybe a certain number of characters but once you chunk a document there you've lost context maybe you could use overlapping windows or or something but you lost the structured information that somehow this came from the same article or in the case of movies maybe this um was a review related to this movie um or it when you're looking at the database you're looking at the chunk I should say then if you on its own without that relationship it's just okay this is this is a chunk of text with it own internal context if you will and this is another chunk with its own internal context but you're missing the linkage is what I'm hearing yeah exactly okay and so when you miss that linkage then it you are going to get sort of suboptimal results when you retrieve the information you'll you'll do a semantic search and you'll get back chunk one but not two or three and you can relate all of these pieces of information together there are many kinds more information that we can leverage and that we do leverage in something like graph maybe you want to put product names in there maybe you want to have hyperlinks maybe you want to use the curated Knowledge Graph information that you made in the traditional Knowledge Graph to link the chunks together and do some sort of hybrid situation all of this information that you have you can link together and when you do you can start to retrieve information that you couldn't before okay so when you when you ask a question it'll do a vector search get the semantically similar question but also retrieve chunks that are related you know it this question links to this manual which has this diagram and now your llm can give you a more holistic result okay so I'm gonna pause there and see if that kind of gives a definition of graph Rag and then we'll we'll kind of wait on how to build it yeah and I almost wonder too you know this is going back to Conrad's uh comment here not familiar with graph Rag and why do we need it right so from what I understand what you just what you just explained a moment ago where like a traditional Vector search or traditional methods to rag right to augment the context of nlm at times maybe missing some context when after you've chunked information and such like that right so then we need some mechanism to increase essentially we're trying to increase the accuracy and the relevancy of our rag results right we are yeah and part of the I would say difference between typical rag or using a traditional Knowledge Graph and using a Content Centric Knowledge Graph is here you now have a process to handle sort of those situations where your chatbot gets into a situation where it's like I don't have the context for that right right this is an actually it's an iterative process right if you already knew and and I get this question a lot like if you already knew what questions your users were going to ask then you would just chunk your data and make a data model that could exactly serve all of those questions and you wouldn't need a way to link information together or to evolve over time to retrieve the right kinds of context but you don't know that right and there are two things that happen right sometimes your underlying data is changing and and definitely your users's expectations are changing like when I I I think a great example is the one we showed last time with the the movies database 10 years ago what I expected out of Netflix was vastly different than what I expect from them today right and and now especially with J like I would like to be able to ask any question that maybe the transcript of the movie would be able to answer for me so that I could get to the right thing we're not there yet obviously like that future isn't available but I've changed and so those two you don't want DVDs being sent to your house anymore I guess it was longer than 10 years ago though I don't know what I would do with them like I don't know make CD curtain on the wall like um so yeah so so it is essentially a rag chat bot but it is not just a traditional Knowledge Graph it is linking chunks of of vector text together with structured data or other information okay you know and you just mentioned something pretty interesting there um mentioned last time you know we showed that that kind of that demo app right that demonstrates the difference between a regular similarity search or a regular rag kind of similarity search and then one using um a noge graph right graph rag yeah would it be worth kind of bringing that up I think that's kind of good to set up because I I love the example that you gave last time because that example to me like for me personally is I you know so for everybody here right you know the last time CH and I talked I hadn't actually worked on graph rag yet and since that time I've done some work in it and you know I've gone through some of my own development and everything and and there's some things that I've kind of learned but this example that she's showing right now was really like really kind of gamechanging for me internally to understand better what was actually going on right so um so I see charna you're already doing an example can you kind of break this down a little bit yeah so my first search this one should be easy for uh Vector similarity to answer because this is often in the description of movies is movies with a strong female lead that's part of the categories like if you go to any movie database that this is kind of how they categorize things this is sometimes how I find the next movie I'm going to watch so the similarity search searches for 10 chunks and retrieves them based upon this question so strong female lead and it gets these three answers Wonder Woman damsel and red Sparrow that's that's relatively easy we get similar results on the right hand side and maybe there are a few more of them but we both are reasonable answers right so so totally toally fine but what's the difference is on the right we're we're returning the first 10 results and we are walking the graph to get to uh additional related information and in this instance maybe it doesn't need to walk that graph but if I ask a more complex question something that isn't contained in the chunks that I had put in there maybe movies with a strong female lead um not about love it's going to have to find more information this isn't typically something that you put in the description of a movie right oh right because okay this is a great point right here right going back to what you're talking about with those chunks that in this case the tra the traditional traversal the the the similarity search here is based off of the chunks of text that it has available in the database so when it looks it grabs a chunk or it tries to but to your point it doesn't have any about strong F leads and love right then it comes up empty in that particular case okay but I can see here on the right hand side I'm seeing something different going on on the graph frag side yeah so here we see that furiosa the Mad Max Saga is a movie with strong female Lee that is not primarily about love and then it tells us what it focuses on about her struggle for survival in an apocalyptic world and you'll notice that Hein says primarily right there there are always going to be relationships in movies but is the focus of the movie this topic are we following a journey of you know the only thing the woman can do is fall in love with somebody somebody and or not and then her story's over or hidden figures this is a great one right there's definitely relationships in that one as well but the point of the movie is the brilliant African-American women at Nasa and it highlights their contributions to science and history and it focuses on their professional achievements although there are romantic story lines in it as well but that is not the purpose of the movie so we we get different chunks to be related to one another now the data itself maybe it was a long review or an article that a reporter wrote or or maybe someone like me who wrote A Blog about this that we chunked up and related to the movie that allowed us to get this information we'd have to know exactly what was in that data but there's something in there I believe in this data set it was that there was plot data as well as description data and that's how it could get to the plot um but you could build this in any number of ways if you wanted to index reviews and articles and podcasts and oh by the way H have that connected to your movie database got you okay so like I see a couple things here we have one question from Renee um yeah Rene art that I think is is related to this because I think it gets into like the structural differences and then there's what we're seeing on the screen when I'm looking at the screen here on the graph rag side I see more than just num results I see a depth I see diversity in this relevant slider and things like that and what I want to do is I'm gon I'm gonna ask you a multifaceted question answer it however you will but Rene's question is how do these relations differ from those in a traditional relational database when would when would one use one over the other right um so there's actually kind of three concepts go around here right you've got traditional relational database then you have like unstructured data and then this whole graph thing um can you maybe read those together a little bit sure let me share another screen essentially in my mind these two things are connected together um so maybe I'll start with maybe I'll start with this one so on the left is our unstructured data it's our paragraphs it's our documents that we have chunked up and where we would typically ingest into a vector database on the right could be data that is in a traditional relational database you just you know often times you'll store like pointers to pictures or links like whatever is used to serve the Wikipedia website is probably although I know they have a Knowledge Graph too but I it is s it is stored in a relational database like this article is related to this thing Etc but the uniqueness here is that you get the ability to do three or four different kinds of searches in a single database not having to build three or four different ones to get a keyword search to get a vector search to get a traversal search to get an MMR search okay right okay so it it is essentially combining together your unstructured data and your structured data into the same place and it gives me another piece of information this document on the left I Define how it links what direction can I walk this graph so in this highlighted Arrow this is a an outgoing link from document one to document two document two cannot go back to document one using this URL but document one is connected bidirectionally to this keyword Galaxy s24 so any other document that also has that keyword can get back and forth to each other so oftentimes like I want to know something about my phone well I need sort of all of the documents about that phone to figure out what what's wrong with it right um so I could get from let's see is there a way here I think the only way that these two are currently connected as the URL but if we had for some reason document two pointed to Galaxy you could get from document two back to document one so that link and that idea of directionality is something that's added so that's kind of the first part okay the second part let me see if I can here so like we said before when you do a vector search you retrieve that first set of documents and then we look and see if there are edges and we check our depth so if the depth is two then I'll go get that first set of edges and retrieve um the next layer of chunks and then I'll look at those edges and I'll retrieve the next set of chunks this MMR search the maximum marginal relevance search adds a step there's a ranker that once I get all of those chunks back I will now look at them in context of the original question and rerank those results because as we know ah llms need the sort of most relevant most contextual results at the top and that step can give us better results than using just a structured database alone or an unstructured database alone and and it gives us more controls over like you mentioned before diversity versus is relevant so if if I looked at that slider again I can control this ranker because do I want it to be super literal or do I want it to have diverse information in it and so if we were to go back maybe if I stop sharing this one and go back to that demo and play with the slider we can see what that can do so Dash that's what that tab is so if I drag this over here and I search again hopefully I get different results they were the same ones it could be dependent on your data set too it yeah it's definitely dependent on your data set if it's available to have more diverse versus more relevant yeah it looks like these are the only two that are able to come back in in that particular search or whatever yeah yeah oh here's here's another one so gravity is another movie that's a Thriller now ah yeah cuz that one really doesn't have much about love but you're saying Hey I want you to really go down on the diversity end right give me more diverse results less relevance and once you got past a certain threshold now that one came that one came up okay like the somewhere there was something specific about gender barriers or romance Etc right that that pulled back more in the similarity and this one is you know different okay yeah so so let me go back to did I answer the question so let me look back at um okay so so yeah if if you're in a different I wouldn't say like throw away the data that you have right how do you know when to use one or the other um it's it's based upon your use case and there are trade-offs to be had right so you if you had a traditional Knowledge Graph and you already spent the money to build that like $70,000 often to build like a single Knowledge Graph um you should use it now should you use that information on its own maybe not right you you may want to use it to connect your unstructured documents maybe you want to use it with your vector database or with your structure database um you also have considerations like latency so if you have an application that has a strict end user experience requirement of certain milliseconds you may not be able to Traverse a large graph so you can still get some of the benefits but maybe you can only walk one hop away or maybe you can't use the MMR maybe you can only Traverse and you have to use an LM Etc so you have to take some of these considerations into account and sometimes you you just need to take a structure database call and an unstructured maybe a vector search and then throw all of that data at an llm um I've seen that be Rel relatively expensive when you're dumping all that context and a little iffy on if llm can interpret all of that in the right way okay okay yeah I got you so you know um all right so we we've talked a bit about you know obviously you know what graph rag is a little demo there and that kind of deal I guess what I'm curious and I'm I'm looking at some of the questions and and such like how do we then take the you know the explanations you just give you just given right we talked about how you mentioned the Wikipedia stuff where we're talking about this movie example um where you know we see there's a difference between the TR traversal search and what is going on in the graph rag side but then as developers right because I know some of the folks on here right that I recognize these names like how do they then take that and do something with it like how do you create that graph and work with graph Rag and all that absolutely so I and and you have some experience with this now because you've played with it yeah um I think that there are places to start and that to get an understanding and a intuitive feel for what do all of these traversals do what do all these quer types do and then there's sort of this iteration where you end up in a place where you're you're going to choose what works for your use case so if I were to look at say this so there's a bunch of extractors out there in the L chain Community there's link extractors and keyword extractors and hierarchy extractors these can be used for any kind of like NLP task for um uh the The Entity Centric knowledge crafts but also for the content cented knowledge graphs okay so it's really great to get started with these type of extractors because you don't really know what is important in your data yet what's possible to get out of your data and so you can use these to get a set of links that you can start with and then um in if you've ever used a vector store in Lang chain you're going to substitute out an astrab graph Vector store or a conand or at graph Vector store depending on which one you're using and it uses the same uh con sort of like document concept that you're using in all of the other places that you're using in linkchain and it gives you the different kinds of traversals so what I would say is like get a data set maybe pick one that's publicly available I'll show you one here in a second for the Wikipedia data set and then start doing some extraction see what what's possible build a graph now because it's relatively cheap to build a graph of this kind um you're GNA probably do this three or four different times because what you'll find is initially oh I I got a lot of noise from just Auto extracting and throwing everything in there and I can't really answer my question because the graph is so hyperconnected I'm getting too many results back I need to actually reduce the number of connections or I need to add metadata so that I can do a filter on my data set while I'm doing these different kinds of queries and so I don't know I guess maybe I'll throw the question back to you was that sort of your experience as well when you were playing with it yeah so um my oh can you put that back actually oh sure yeah yeah put that back up there I was you know funny enough I was in the middle of I'm trying to get that I was pulling the graph rag that demo app repo for do there's a couple people have asked about where that code is um so I was I was actually looking for that yeah so as far as like this like and you know being able to get the results and and thing like what you're showing here is largely similar to what I ended up doing um I think the difference in you know I would love if you're if this is something you're going to talk about here today is um I think difference was generating the graph right like getting the point where you know like in the and correct me if I'm wrong by the way oh here we go yes yes yes that's it right there um so like um I don't know if this is changing any of the newest kind of iterations of what's happened in the uh the various graph rag repositories or anything um but as you guys can all see here as everyone can see like you'll see that like that hierarchy link extractor the keyboard link extractor the gliner link extractor and there's all these like automated extractors right and so when I started I started with those and they do a really nice job of like automatically going and pulling all of this information into the graph but what I found it it was a bit noisy right so like the link extractor is a really good example um um the uh the app that demo app there that graph regag one actually pulls it pulls information from a website and so you have lots of um hyperlinks that are in all sorts of documents and it's going to go through and without some kind of filtering or something like that it's going to pull all the hyper links regardless if they're really relevant right and if there are ads on that page and it's going to pull an ad that's completely unrelated you don't want that right right so so for like from what you were talking about before like from like the ease of being able to use the libraries to actually search and perform the you know the various traversals of the MMR search or something whatever that was actually relatively easy I think the more challenging part was putting the graph together but what I learned though is that the way I was doing it which was essentially just grabbing everything and throwing it in there is not quite the right way to go about it yeah yeah so let me share this tab instead and I'll I I mentioned briefly that the the repo for the okay I'm G to go back and let me let me introduce this uh article and then we'll go into the notebook so in this article linked here at the bottom there's a hackernoon article it's also on our blog now Ben Chambers um wanted to compare the difference in results between just using an entity Centric Knowledge Graph and using a Content Centric Knowledge Graph both in cost and in its ability to answer questions so it's a great read I Love It uh there is a repo in that article um that you can go go use it it's it's using the kander graph Vector store um I didn't want to set that up locally on my machine so I readapt that into this notebook that I'll show you in a second that uses the Astro DB graph Vector store and I'm I'm happy to go um uh make that available in the repo as well so what you'll notice is uh the cost it cost $60,000 to load all of Wikipedia uh into the uh entity Centric knowledge dra because it had to go and extract all of those entities and we used an llm uh graph Transformer to get all of those entities and links out of it okay and and that cost of the llms is very high so you know it's it's $ 59,2 just on the extraction not even talking about uh the full loading and and all of that but in the graph Vector store like and and an hours and hours and hours of time in the graph Vector store it's near zero like I would say it cost me for all of the embeddings probably $50 to load all of Wikipedia into astb and so when I show this notebook I want to show you a way instead of using those Auto Link extractors that we wrote sort of a manual link extractor so in this function here this parse document when you need the data that's available in this this publicly available data set I believe it's licensed under sorry yeah let me see if I can there we go here and by the way just so you know um I think um yeah Dino Dino asked a question um do you use an llm to help create the queries and discover build the graph structure um and right right here what chna is showing you right no you don't need an LM right you can actually use these other methods and this is one of those methods that you're seeing right now yeah especially if that data exists if it doesn't you you may decide to use an llm or you could use like traditional like NLP techniques Etc um llms are are great when you need to somehow transform what's actually in the document to something else so what you'll notice in the llm transformer for the traditional knowledge craft is that there's an entity being talked about but using a different word like think about people using NYC versus New York City right you you need it to be the same entity when you're trying to link them together in a traditional knowledge shaft we don't need that here you just have chunks of texts and you need the link to be the same ID or the same URL or the same keyword um but we don't have to extract it by transforming the concept of a document we can extract it by a transforming the metadata of a document right and the good news is is that and let me actually maybe there's I put it here so this data set um there's this data there's a project called the wiki multihop that they've already broken apart this the sentences and structure of Wikipedia such that it is difficult to do complex reasoning so that you must do multi hops so I started from there so I didn't have to do all of the chunking myself um but we've started from here for both the traditional and the content Centric um and so if you're going to use this particular data set site this original paper but it is freely available for you to use for any type of research that you want to do um and then inside of this parsing document you'll notice that I'm doing outgoing links oh okay for for the r for the links that are inside of paragraphs and ah okay and that's important because when you know if I if I open Wikipedia and I actually actually try ads and you don't want all the other junk essentially right essentially yeah so so let's share this tab like I'm on Wikipedia I've got you know the actual Pages here but I've always got like this donate now somewhere um I I get popups places um and so maybe I want to talk search for Afghanistan and inside of these paragraphs I've got Central Asia link south Asia link Pakistan link except ET Etc but that information what is south Asia is not contained in this article it is linked up right so I'm walking the links in this paragraph and I'm actually linking them as outgoing links as they are on Wikipedia got you so now we're making we're we're putting in the connective tissue right because if I were to that document that you just showed and chunk through it and then you know put that into my Vector store or whatever from my rag application and then go to search on yeah I may get a hit on something about Afghanistan or whatever but then any of that supporting information I would not have right but now we're pulling what I'm seeing is you're adding the link with this outgoing link to the metadata of that document chunk so then if I were using like graph rag or whatever now I can start to tease out those types of relationships yep and I'm by the way I'm also adding that link that incoming link uh as well well to yeah yeah okay so if I if I actually go down to an example of testing this query so I've set up a bunch of retrievers here so the graph Vector store like I think I showed it in this slide it has just a similarity retriever if you set the depth to zero you can do Vector similarity just fine if you add a depth to it then you're doing traversal if you do an MMR traversal type that's where you get that ranker and so you get a bunch more parameters that you can do in an MMR ranker like uh what's the diversity Etc oh I see so so there's another function in there that is not MMR like can okay I got you I got you and by the way you can do all of these with a metadata filter as well so if you need to take that large set and limit it down to only keywords of this you can do a metadata filter and you can do an MMR traversal at the same time oh okay VCH at the same time yeah okay so here I set up a basic retriever give me 10 chunks in the similarity search and here I set up an MMR traversal give me 10 similarity chunks and then walk the graph so this could be as you saw in Wikipedia like if there were 10 links for every paragraph that I get returned I would get 10times 10 right so it's it's a large data set which is why we have our our timeout up here a little bit larger I see I see and then I did a you know I pulled in um just the basic rag prompt from Lane chain I didn't change it at all and I did Ed my basic retriever I formatted the dock prompt LM parser same here this is the MMR retriever for graph prompt LM output parser so everything after this is the same and I asked this question what are the regions of Afghanistan and oh this is the wrong tab this one is not run share this tab instead what are the region I have a playground and then I've got the clean one that I'm going to share with you guys later so uh what are the regions of Afghanistan and I did the graph chain first the regions of Afghanistan and for those that don't know before I get into this this is an area that is constantly changing right and so it is not an easy question to answer right you've got the definitions from the United Nations you've got the definitions from the cricket tournaments you've got it's then then there are regions and then there are sub regions it's it's a complex question and so if your data set has changing data like we talked about before or has multiple instances of data sometimes you cannot answer the question with a basic similarity search so regions of Afghanistan as defined for this particular tournament include these six regions 1 two 3 four five six and if if I actually go look that up on the Internet this was the schedule and results you know somewhere on the internet for these different ones I'll show you down here those were the six regions defined for that tournament in 2018 by the way this year there are only five regions determined for the tournament but it was able to give me an answer the basic chain cannot it says like the UN defined seven sub regions for assistance planning grouped into three major regions but I don't know what they are they're not provided in the context because it couldn't follow the links in that paragraph got you okay and so this I I put a little bit of messy stuff in here if you want to take this out of a chain and you want to just see what that retrieval looks like I did it as you know down here in this retrieval it's a little messy oh are you back on your collab by the way because I'm still seeing your the ESPN there we go um so so okay so let's go back so this is grouped into three main regions specific name not provided so if we look at like the actual retriever we can break it out of the chain and we can look exactly what documents are being retrieved it looks messy because there are so many links but I want you to see a little bit of what's in here you have a document type you have metad dat and you have links so there's this link it's going out to to this tag now the tag can be anything right it can be a number it can be a word what we care about is what it's linked to and so even though we don't see that here this is how it's walking so I do recommend if you can make these tags very small because you are taking up space in a database it doesn't you're gonna repeat them a lot aren't you right yeah you're gonna repeat them a lot got you got you and they often need to be unique so in in a travel use case for example we thought oh we'll just use the the neighborhood keyword and and that'll be fine well no there's a Fremont in California there's a Fremont in you can't do that you need a unique identifier to actually link it together otherwise it's you know telling you oh the Empire State Building is in Seattle and you're like it's not so in this way you've got this metadata and you've got the page content and because we can get multiple documents we have 10 doents here we can start to piece all of this together into the context the same is true by the way you get the same sort of formatted output from a normal traversal um or if you wanted to do this with a a similarity search it's the same kind of output here right the links are still there when you do a vector similarity search but it doesn't walk them and so you don't get the linked information got it got it and by the way just something to point out like um I I believe it looks like the uh The Notebook has been shared there you should see that Google collab Wikipedia um link that's at the uh bottom of the CRC um so for those who are watching and stuff you're like well great she's showing this stuff I would love to actually be able to like get access to this but you know she's talking about like how how messy all that looks like with the links and everything obviously in your code you're not you're building up that that that metadata right but that's not something that you actually acely have to like worry about when you're saying hey give me a depth of two do this MMR Travers that is all that is traversing essentially those edges and such like that yeah exactly now there's a question here from Marcus I think is totally relevant um to what you were just showing I know the answer but I'm I'm gonna let you uh because it's more fun when you answer things um let me know if I give the right answer right right yeah is it possible to manipulate these links right um and and I and I see your your response already I can tell what it is that was actually a big learning for me Marcus when I had done my initial like Research into this like when Char and team were doing their thing and I'm like all right I'm gonna go build an app because my job is to build these things and then go give them feedback right and be like hey like what what is what is going on here but one of the first things I ran into as well is well a lot of the times I've already got my metadata I've Got My Graph created I don't want to have to go recreate the thing every time I need to make a little modification can I just go modify a particular like you know item or an entity or something like that and the answer to is as far as I understood and what I've done is yes and I see SP is yes as well yes so you can absolutely um modify those um after and manipulate them after the fact and that's part of that process I was talking about in the beginning like you're if you have any form of and I highly encourage you if you have any kind of geni app uh out there you should be logging a bunch of things you should be logging whether or not the user was happy whether or not the result was good Etc and so what you can do is go back and say oh I hit a guard rail and and my llm said I cannot answer that question or I didn't have the right context anytime you get that you can review it and say hold on I know my database has that information in it Why didn't it happen and so yes you can go say oh this manager is related to this project and this person is related to this project and then you can say give me everything that this person has done or give me all the work that this manager's team has produced this quarter if you have information in there about the dates Etc right you can start to get multi hopped things and if you if you want to add a new document type you can do that in the same graph I've had some folks say well I'm gonna make a graph about you know slack and I'm going to make a graph about the files in Google Drive and then I'm going to make a graph about this other thing if you do that it's a little complicated to try and get the graphs connected together you have to do multiple queries Etc you you can put all of those chunks in the same graph and then relate them you can give them a type you just you have control of metadata it doesn't need to be only your links alone and in fact I encourage you to add metadata that you want to filter on so if you want to put a type in there of document or a type of conversation then when you retrieve you can say sure use all of that graph to walk to the right chunks but then filter at the end and just give me the documents oh you can do that I like that okay yeah like why why use more tokens than you need to yeah yeah and by the way I mean that that the Soap Box I won't get on right now is the one I hear all the time I'm gonna slightly do it but is like you know I I get well hey you know context windows and token limits and stuff with the LMS have gotten absolutely huge does it even matter it totally does the llms are super super good at what they do when you give them relevant information if you just like throw everything at them they you muddy the waters right and not only that you're paying for all those tokens and it's slower processing right so the the more relevant and accurate information you can give them out of the gate the better your answers are going to be by far we'll take the Afghanistan example if I let the retriever give me a hundred different chunks I might end up with the UN definition the 2018 definition the 2020 definition and then you throw all of that and it's like sometimes the llm will say oh it's been a progression over time and here's what it actually was if you're using the expensive call maybe but oftentimes it's like well I don't know because it's changed and I don't actually know what you're looking for give me more information something like that you want make you want to ensure that you're getting the latest information that you're accurate and stuff yeah yeah I can totally see that now I see um you know so I see a question here from Dominic um and it's actually gonna lead into another question so the question it's very simple on this one because I already answered it is how do we get the code for whatever chatbot CH is using um I did drop it there I'll go ahead and say chatbot I'm gonna drop this in the chat now something I want to preface with this um is that the code for that chatbot is now like it it's still fully functional and all that but it now is a little old right because it was using a different method but here's the thing I really want to point out and this goes back to some of the code you were showing charna when when I originally was working um on that you know if you take a look at that code you'll find that when I'm doing the day loading I'm extracting all the things I'm using the automated extractors and what I've learned since is you know we talked about this a little earlier that's not really the best approach not for your production thing not for the thing you're actually going to use for starting for learning for building My Graph quickly they were awesome yeah but then once I understood what it was doing like the link extractor is a really good one right I thought by the way beautiful soup I thought did uh if you're familiar with that beautiful soup does a really nice job yeah actually of pulling out really relevant stuff it takes a lot more processing to do um but like putting separate from the like the link extractor it'll extract all the links all of them right yeah uh even things in like your navigation and things that you really may not want right and once I learned that I was like ah what and this was what then I kind of learned from from folks on the graph rag team and then what you were showing earlier it's actually better as I understand to build out your own intelly like if you know that like to your example like you're only wanting say like the links in the paragraphs or maybe you have very specific cases like in the um the movie data set that I was working with um there were very specific links that I actually wanted so it would have been better for me to just add those links yeah with their metadata instead of just using the automatic extractor but again the the extractors were really good to get off the ground kind of yeah is that still true today still true um and I would say um in most of the cases when I'm working on a production application we we don't start with extractors at all because they have some amount of structure that they already know is important and so it we we start with their structure and we say all right you already have in your relational database these different types of things that you're using to serve your customer how do we want to link that to your unstructured data and how do we get it into AST because again latency is a concern so you don't want to have to go do like a big query query and then not know if you've got the latest data in there like it it's just the time constraints of how long these queries are going to take in a different system for a chat application may not be great and so we we try to pull the relevant information into Astra uh into the links that they need and I I went through this with a customer the other day where we she was like well let's just bu directional link everything and I was like ah you know it's it won't be very expensive to learn this lesson so let's do that and then see why we don't do that she's like okay and we go through the process and she's like huh so let's not do that I was like yep there we go what what where what direction do we want to go when we're walking things what what are the questions your users are asking to right there right there I'm actually I'm gonna put you on the spot a little bit do you you know in the nosql world right we live mostly in the nosql world and it's not like there isn't structure there's absolutely structure in the nosql world but the no sequel World kind of like started this whole unstructured like schemes kind of thing right and so I think you look at The Mangos of the world or if you look at like anything that has a document model like like Astra does as well in parts and you're like oh okay there's like schema Lis thing I just throw my stuff in there I chunk my data I just put it in there and go right but then in the relational world this goes back to a question from earlier right by its default you you start with things like normalized forms you're starting with you have to really think about the structure of my data how am I going to store it what kind of connections and uh you know and you know foreign key relationships am I going to have that kind of deal and um um so like do you find now that with something like graph rag especially what you were just talking about that yeah great we have all this unstructured data that we can do things with the llms are actually pretty pretty amazing at being able to process and do useful things with it but now it feels like like the lesson I learned was actually know you got to sit down and think about that structure a little bit it may not be the structure of the core data in your system but it is the structure of the ontology of your graph like what are what's the directionality what's the data you want to pull out things like that well I would I I would say that it's now we're in a hybrid world where if you if you start your graph Factor store and you just you don't even want to make links right you just throw all your documents in there you can do that it's not going to Traverse anything it's going to give you your vector similarity and that's fine like you may not need to create those links I you you probably will by the way as you start to get users but you can then say Oh I couldn't answer that one question and you can sort of defer that thinking until you get a cleaner understanding of what structure is necessary you can add a link at a time if you want to or and you can see what it does yeah yeah a category of Links at a time and then test and sort of like do an AB often our customers are doing an AB test side by side get you know satisfaction results on these answers get satisfaction and maybe they do five% of their traffic and then they move it to 50% of their traffic when they see that it's successful and then they go full swap on over to the other you know um backing database um but but yeah you can evolve that so it's right in a relational world you're kind of screwed if you built the wrong structure and you got to tear it down and put it back and in a document world you you didn't have to do that thinking you don't have the the links there at all to use and and so you're kind of stuck because you can't relate it in this hybrid World throw it all in there and build it up or throw it all in there and tear some of it down you can delete links right you can say nope that didn't work or oh make it you know outward link or an inward link and that's perfectly fine can you can you can update that on the Fly too like you can do it with your data that's already in there at rest you can just modify you don't have to like redo the whole thing yeah and I should mention we are working on a partnership with unstructured they are building their Enterprise platform okay uh that's GNA be in GA I think in December uh but if you have access to the preview right now there are asrb connectors in there and you can hydrate using unstructured any kind of extraction into Astra and then you can convert that to a graph database and actually leverage all of those links so we're we're gonna make this even more seamless over time all of that is to say like use whatever breakdown you need in the beginning to get the the structure out and start to sort of progress because your data will change your graph will change um and and sort of you can iteratively build this for relatively cheap got you and you know one last thing I know we have we're we're at time actually right now um I did see a question um from uh dino uh who is trying to better understand the hybrid approach pattern of using both a vector and graph DB in a rag app we're kind of talking about that right now and the one thing I wanted to like leave everyone with right and then CH I'll give you a moment as well is like in in in with graph rag you're not talking about a separate graph database you were actually talking about you're you're essentially storing the graph the the intelly the graph everything in in your actual ual metadata of your of your vector store in our case right it's just part of the the chunks themselves if you will it's part of the chunks themselves and because that's the case you don't actually have to build a graph a traditional graph database when you insert something I have this visual thing of like these blobs like elbowing each other out of the way and like adding their links it takes time to insert in a in a traditional graph World in this hybrid world you just add a piece of metadata and it traverses at query time no one's shoving each other around right it's like you you insert a row that's it yeah and then and then you're like oh now I need to go use that and it it's very fast um knows the keyword to use to walk the link okay so um my last question then for you uh to leave everybody with is you know we have a lot of resources that we put into uh the chat there there's all sorts of links is there one putting on the spot again is there one in particular that you're like hey if you're going to get started with the stuff right you want to start coding right um I could tell from some of the comments we definitely have some coders in here um they want to get doing things and like explore what would be the thing that you would give them totally putting CH on the spot right now I marus yeah go ahead because I just converted this last last night from the Cassandra graph Vector store to the astb graph Vector store I I know the versions work together so I would start with the Wikipedia one um just to get something where you can start to query and understand what's possible um so I I would drop that uh Link in there but it is a big data set and so it it it might be difficult to really fully do a 101 level for that one so I would say there's a probably a toy example that Brian gsy wrote and I don't know exactly where it's at but let me let me get his profile if we post uh a lot on towards data science and then we cross poost those to our blog and so Brian does a lot of our towards data science his medium right here five um right here at the bottom this I just put it in the chat for everybody there we go yeah so so go there he's got a lot of smaller examples that as you're trying to you know get the concepts and everything like that and and learn how to do the trade-offs I think his most recent article that he wrote or maybe it was the next the Quest for production easy to start hard to finish talks about the different challenges you're going to hit along the way to move it out of just an experiment and into production so I really liked that one um and it has some good examples in it so so kind of take a look at those examples they're usually like code Snippets uh inside of them and and that's where I would go but if you want a big data set because that's kind of how I like to do I like to like dive into the deep end and kind of drown a little I I would go with the Wikipedia the full Wikipedia set okay um let's see all right I try this there we go for some reason when Marcus tried the Discord link he said was invalid I did it it worked for me uh so hopefully that works better for you um I don't know why why it was invalid for you there Marcus click on it let me see if it works for me yeah I launched my Discord just fine yeah okay it worked for me you know in in a worst case Marcus if you ever need to um just like I told um let's see here we go just like I said to Dominic earlier I'm going to drop my my LinkedIn feel free to reach out I can't see new chats all right yeah if anybody you know if you need any follow-up information or anything for those who joined us today just reach out to me reach out to you know to Cha either one of us uh whether it's LinkedIn to Discord or something I just dropped some links there um and feel free to follow up I'd be more than happy to get you uh whatever information you need and with that I know we're five over so we'll wrap it up thank you everybody for joining us today hopefully you learned a little something more about graph Rag and uh like to see you bu let us know what you want the next one to be about do you want a specific use case do you want a specific data set I'm happy to build something for you yeah no I I like that as M matter of fact I think while people are putting things in the chat you can keep typing in that chat if you have an idea something you want to see um put it there and we'll grab it all right thank you everybody everybody Take Care thank you cha and we'll see you all next time right bye bye",
