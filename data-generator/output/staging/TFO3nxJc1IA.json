    "text": "hey everyone this is Rebecca Mills from data stacks today I'll be taking you through the example of the week you can find this example and plenty of other really helpful examples in the data stacks examples org on github so this is the featured example of the week today we're going to be looking at this Java driver code examples so basically this repository it contains several standalone classes or code samples that illustrate a dedicated feature of the data stacks driver but the cool thing is that these are implemented for both the Java jive R 3 and also the Java driver 4 because if you didn't know the latest version of the Java driver being version 4 there was a major redesign of the architecture so there was API changes and new features there is a great blog post that goes into more details on these changes I'll leave this in the description below the video for you to take a look at but for now we're just going to get into the example itself so basically I think this is a really great example if you just want to speed up your development you know you want to just copy and paste your code to get started really quickly or maybe you're looking to upgrade from version 3 2 version for the driver and you kind of want to understand some of the changes a bit better so let's just have a look at our prerequisites here we're going to need Java 11 plus I actually have Java 13 so we should be good there you're going to need Cassandra installed and running locally or also there is actually a dr. option with this example it comes with a docker compose dot yeah mol file if you want to go that direction it's probably going to be quicker to set up also you're going to need maven to compile and run this example I'm going to be using IntelliJ OEE so that's going to cover that aspect for me ok so I'm just going to grab the example now and we'll get started alright so I'm just going to grab the link here so I can clone down this repo it get cloned to get that okay it looks like we got it let's take a look at the repo itself as you can see there's a folder that includes three X examples and also a folder for for dot X examples and we have that docker compose Gamal in case we want to try a docker version of this later so yeah let's open this up and IntelliJ and see if we can get it going okay so I'm just going to create a new project and IntelliJ job of course and I'm going to point to the job of 13 SDK which it looks like it's already pointing to that so we'll click Next we won't be using a template for this project name we'll just use something simple like Java samples and we're going to point to that repo that we just cloned and we'll hit finish this is where the two have a driver 3 X examples left and here is the folder for the for not X examples you can see they both have their own pom file since we plan on using maven to compile and run all of our examples plus make sure that this is at it as a maven project and the same for the other folder okay so let's give a couple of these a try just look for one of the classes here that we might be interested in running ok so here's one sample that will show the cluster metadata using the 3x driver so let's just try that one okay we see it creates a cluster instance and then it gets the metadata I'm gonna call the listing address data center rack also the key spaces okay so let's just run this look I call in the output we get the IP address of the instance data center rack and the list of the system key spaces we only have system key spaces right now because we haven't haven't created a schema or inserted any data yet so let's try the same class over in the folder that has the data stack Stryver for auto examples show cluster metadata so this is similar but we can see that instead of creating a cluster instance we are actually creating a situation instance instead so that is one of the differences between the two drivers but other than that looks pretty similar so I suspect when we run this we're going to get something that's very similar to these three dot X version yeah this looks virtually the same it's just you can see when you look at the class itself that it isn't using the cluster instance that uses c12 session instead okay so that's pretty cool by the way there's actually a listing of all the different classes you can run over in the Reid meet it might be easier to see so let's try a couple others now okay we have one here called getting started let's see what that does this is the three onyx driver by the way it looks like it inserts a user different variations on simple statements you have a query builder example and prepared statements okay so let's use this to get some schema set up and also insert some data into our standard database okay looks like we have performed a handful of insert statements there they also created a killer video keyspace so that's pretty cool I see you're using a cluster and session as well so let's have a look at the 4x version of that see if we can find it no no there it is getting started yeah this one uses cql session Oh looks like this uses a simple statement builder I don't believe that that is in three docks so yeah that's something different there okay so let's run this you it looks like we have a handful of inserts again so let's just go have a look and see what's going on in CTL Sh describe these faces yeah we see that killer video keyspace has been added to use that what kind of tables we have in there now so we have a users table in there from users oh wow looks like we have six or seven different doppelgangers of ceedric in here thanks for joining me today for this example if you have any feedback or other ideas please let us know hope to see you again next time",
