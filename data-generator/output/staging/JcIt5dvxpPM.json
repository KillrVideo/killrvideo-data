    "text": "yeah yep and and in addition to um you know datax Enterprise we also have kind of this kind of this new hyperon converged database and platform that we'll be be talking about as well so yeah you get to learn what the hyperon converge actually means so that's good yeah but why don't we get moving here um everyone's on a schedule including us so you know of course Patrick and I you know when we talk to to folks out there who are using um Cassandra or using data sax Enterprise and maybe are on maybe haven't quite started their gen Journey we got a lot of questions like this like hey we want gen but we want it in our data center you know what's what's our path forward how can we how can we you know have our on premise feel more Cloud native you know how can we how can we do this yeah that's the thing I mean it's because I think with Gen it's all been pretty cloudy it's not been a ton of on Prem but there's just requirements and when you know when you when you have those requirements you're stuck usually because there's somebody else making that decision for you so we're gonna help yep that's the plan all right so this is kind of what we're going to talk about today um we're going to talk about data saxs Enterprise 6.9 we're going to talk about hcdp um as well as two great features that you get with both of those ds69 and hcdp you get the data API and Vector search um and then of course you know kind of a kind of a uh a plea we make to our our current dsse customers and Community is hey why should you upgrade so that's going to be our plan let's do it all right so I guess we start with Patrick hey um if you don't know who I am I've been working on the Cassandra project for about 12 years now I'm a committer on the project um I'm also involved in a lot of distributed computing infrastructure stuff wrote a little book Cloud native data on kubernetes with Jeff Carpenter who also wrote the Cassandra book um recently I've been working on Lang chain and L index on a cassander database tooling for agents it's uh it's kind of a fun thing to get into to enable that so yeah all right my LinkedIn follow me on LinkedIn or feel free to connect or follow me on LinkedIn you know I I I was thinking about the uh the opening slide where it shows you know kind of the title and then it shows both you and me and it says Patrick mcin VP developer relations and then Aaron plz developer relations it's like here's our VP and the guy who gets his coffee is kind of how that that looks to me but you know and I'm empty kidding I'll get your copy I'll be right back oh that'd be awesome Al just anyway um so so I'm a in plz I'm I work in developer relations uh at data STS as well um I've also written written a few books um mostly in like the nosql space but this last time I I actually did write one on on Java which was a lot of fun by the way um I also do the latest Java latest Java well technically I think 22 is out now but you know 21's the latest LTS version yeah um hey I also host the Apache Cassandra Corner podcast if you have any great you know use case stories or anything hey reach out to me I'm I'm happy to uh talk to you and uh build out a new episode for you um and hey as far as like ni stuff um I actually did work on that uh Swifty GPT project that we um we put out back in December um I think we released it on on Taylor Swift's birthday but um you know I kind of put together the initial model and and back end that that talk to co here and all that and uh and did a lot of scraping of Taylor Swift web pages um yeah yeah so that was uh that was that but it work works good people still use dig in then let's because now we are the most experienced geni people out there now because we've done than 10 minutes right yeah all right all right so hey starting out datax Enterprise 6.9 um it's the most recent version of of dsse we have um the most advanced dsse ever released um which is saying something because you know I remember um I I actually did Granger's first install of data Stacks Enterprise I think it was version 3.2 and this was like 12 years ago or so um so it's really come a long way since then um you get the improved indexing storage attach indexing uh that we've had in Astra for for quite a while uh the cool thing about SEI index is it really does kind of make Vector search possible and Vector search is again something else you get with uh dc69 dsse 69 also will finally get you past Java 8 um it has support for Java 11 which is a huge step forward um you know I talk with folks in the Java Community all the time and it's always like oh we got to get people off at Java 8 and and really it's it's a lot of the it's a lot of the Legacy Enterprise apps and things that are kind of stuck on it well not anymore for us so that's pretty cool um and of course we also have the data API we're going to talk a lot about that later but uh basically it's uh it's kind of an easier more intuitive way of um you know accessing data and and building data structures so I mentioned this hey dc69 runs on new Java you know you get improved jvm profiling access to the newer garbage collectors that everyone's talking about like Shen andoa and zgc um and hey you get um you know transport layer security 1.3 certificates um again for a while we've been stuck on 1.2 you know it's like hey 2008 called and wants its um a s certificate Cipher back please this is why people compl about Java because they're using the one the version from like 10 years ago right right yeah if you're using like the later versions of java it's pretty amazing absolutely it's a it's a huge upgrade just in it of itself I mean performance- wise yeah yeah all right and of course improved indexing you know um again we're going to talk about this quite a bit um it significantly improves dis usage and by significantly improve I mean uses a whole lot less um allows for the use of like text analyzers so you can do like um like case insensitive searching and you know there there are some other options that you can do along with that as well um and it also gives you the or operator you know how many times have people in dsse and Cassandra and the community have have come to me and said H you know you know how great it would be if we had an ore operator um and now we finally have one so so yeah that's that's pretty cool um and then hey s it's the uh we're going to get into this more but it's the backbone of vector search it really does make Vector search possible um so so yeah this is this is one of the bigger things that you're going to see in the new dsse well you know and I think it just kind of cap off the dsse thing here it upgrades your whole entire cassander experience too um yeah and get you on things that are have been there's just thousands of improvements that have been in the project for a long time so it gets you update dat on a lot of things these are just the highlights right right exactly all right Patrick I think we go to you now the old hyperon converge data platform section all right so what is the difference so we have DC 6.9 and really this I'll just start this by saying DC 6.9 is your inplace upgrade it works with OP Center it works with your current existing systems with dsse that's you know that that's an easy upgrade for you if you're currently on dsse um let's but this hyperconverged database uh track that we've started is really is really the new version of where we're going with an Enterprise version of Cassandra because it's more than just an Enterprise version of Cassandra but this hyoc Verge part of it is putting together all the things that you need for building applications and this is based on our experience by building Astra so if you're familiar with Astra Astra is a Cassandra of service that we offer but it it doesn't just it's not just Cassandra there's a lot of little things that are connected to it which make your overall application stuff better so your life is better using um a a group of things instead of just one thing right and so like this uh part of the database like vector search which is available in Astra right now the data API which is available on Astra but this is things you can run in your own data center the real difference with this hyperon converge part next slide is where the road map is going that's right and why this is very different and so if you need if you're looking at like the future of on-prem data platforms this is where we're going so DSE 6.9 will be the end of that and you'll eventually need to start moving over to hcdp which is is the next is jumping tracks over to the fast track into the future and there's an upgrade path we'll help you do that that's not a problem but if you're just being conservative about your upgrades we get it DFC 6.9 but what are you going to get if you get on that road map and that is the key right in it's you want to be on this road map eventually because yeah it's big right um we have uh just recently announced our partnership with the open search Foundation at AWS and we we're going to be doing a lot of work with them for integration so open search will be added into that platform also the streaming portion with Pulsar uh which gives you a Kafka topic so you can work with that inside your data center but the thing is it's like it works with Cassandra directly so if you think about like uh CDC as when it gets the most useful you know the change data capture so when you insert data into your cassander database it emits the change well there's two places that are really useful we found and that is dumping it into a search index like open search or putting it into a topic that can be picked up from other services like microservices or if you need to stream it into some data warehouse or whatever you you come up with your your use case but the integration is the key so you don't have to go out there with your screwdriver and your wrench and everything and build all the stuff yourself I know you can I know you want to but this is a timesaver it's just meant so you can plug and play and go and that I that's really what this all this platform dat platform is about now what does that mean like why is it different or what what's the big thing for you to know about this next slide is how we deploy it and because this is a pretty complicated deployment meaning that there's a lot of services that interact that have to have Services connected with IPS and everything else kubernetes is the way to go that's right if you don't believe me I got a whole book I wrote about it but um yeah so hcd like hdp will only be deployed on kubernetes um so mission control is the thing we're going to and Aeron has a lot of great content about Mission Control mission control is the newer version of what we're we've stopped uh op Center at DSE mission control is hcd Mission Control is a kubernetes based control plane for running your data plane and that includes pulsar and open search so you'll be able to deploy some really cool things for your developers and um in one very easy way to go and if you're not using kubernetes I know I know and I know who you are I know who you're screaming at right now but it is something you should consider um because it really is the future and if that's just that's all I can say about it but it does full life cycle management repairs uh backups that sort of thing um it manages across clouds across on Prem across both the encryption stuff is all automated I mean it in and of itself the encryption part oh my God that was always a big pain in a large cluster but yeah anyway yeah I mean node to node communication is all encrypted and it's managed automatically um y okay so that those are our products but let's I think Erin we should probably dig into like some of the really cool things I think the uh I think the data AP yep here we go data API yep yep so you know we we've talked about this quite a bit but um those of you who have um who have used Astra um have probably used this before um it's it's different way we have of allowing access into um you know into Data that's usually inside of inside of DSE you know in DSE you're used to the whole you know um you know like keyspace table row um way of getting at your data well this is a little bit different this gives you a like Json based API interface um you can you can update it with um you know like Postman or curl commands or you know what whatever whatever you like um but we actually do have some um API clients that are available for um you know a lot of the major languages that that we support and uh and actually I'll show you a little bit one in the uh in the demo coming up Erin is yeah like oh is this a completely new thing no no no but it's new for dsse it's new for DSE but if you're already using this is compatible with M that's right that's right so this is a you could take a  application point it at this database and it'll work yep that that is a good call out yeah yeah that a lot of work's gone into you know kind of appreciating that ease of access that that Mongo's had so yep yeah and I mean it's of course you know that trying to be lock step with is going to be very different but we know that a variet a majority of developers prefer that and it's just easy to work with so if you are sick of data modeling don't do it yep yep um so kind of like I said you know the um the the nomenclature changes a little when you're uh when you're working with the the data API you know the um you know like the a key space kind of kind of equals a name space a collection kind of equals a table a document kind of kind of equals a row um so just that yeah when when you start working with the um you know at the data level in the uh through the API that's kind of the new that's kind of the new naming structure that uh that you're going to see and again it's just to be more consistent with um with what's out there but the the idea too is that it kind of gets you away from having to care about um you know bucketing and partitioning and a lot of the things that have that have really just made made life difficult for you know cassander developers in the past all right well I think the next thing on here is to show you some of this so let me go ahead and get that kicked off and we're not going to do a live demo we talked about this it's like everyone that has been intact you know that live demos are doomed so Aon recorded it so we can just play back that demo and be so much more relaxed and you'll get better okay so I'm going to have to oh it's not letting me just jump to a different tab okay well you have to share a different tab yeah I have to share a different tab okay and also share tab audio that's that's important I'm glad we practice this yeah we I know I know okay here we go going to demonstrate the data API here with an install of hcd and I'm going to use Mission Control to uh start some things out here all right so as you can see I have a cluster here called Rush 201112 uh with a data center named megadon um and that is data API enabled all right so we are going to go and connect this thing and use the data API um with Postman that is going to be our way our way in here so let me try and increase the uh the font size a little bit there for youall um just starting out first of all we need a name space or a key space defined um so I'm going to go ahead and use this uh create namespace end point now I want my keyspace to be properly replicated so I'm going to make sure I'm picking Network topology strategy and then specify my data center of Megadon with a replication factor of three now if I run this okay we should be good to go um now if I want to actually put data into it I need to create a collection um you know a collection is really just kind of a kind of a fancy document API name for table um so I'm going to use this create collection command and I'm just going to name it Library so here I'll send that okay so now we have a collection named Library so what if I go into this collection and I want to insert a document right so I'm going to um we're going to have this um this Library be full of data about books so in this case I'm going to insert data for the book code with Java 21 um which admittedly does does happen to be one of mine all right okay I will go ahead and just do an insert one and then I'll specify my document like title author image publisher um and then we'll run that all right and I get this um uyu ID as a return value this is the ID that inserted um now you can also update in place so if I go to um update one here what I can do is say update one and then in my filter I'm going to specify the of the document I want to update and I'm going to add the fields of ISBN as well as a link to um you know this this book's page on on Amazon all right there we go um so now I should also be able to do a get one um yeah there we go do find one and let me paste that ID in there and when I run this there we go we have our code with Java 21 book outstanding now instead of just inserting one I can also insert many um and here you can see I have plenty of books that have been um written by other folks here at data Stacks um so I'm just going to run this whole thing and look at that we inserted five new records and uh received those IDs back as well um so hey now in addition to doing a a get one um I can also just do a plain old get with an with an empty filter um and I can send that through and sure enough that pulls back every uh document inside the collection all right so with all of that data available um I can actually jump over to this uh this application I wrote called um DS books and um here you can see I've just uh built a simple front end for um going through going through our data uh connecting on out to hcd um with our Cassandra token and our our hcd Cassandra endpoint um and that's really all it takes it's very similar to how it works with Astro which is why I kind of mix in my words there so if I run this okay now I can say 1271 8080 okay and as you can see we have our uh our GS books application and um you know we've built our menu here by just doing a straight out get um and I can say practitioners guide to graph data um you can see this is by Denise gnell and Matias brusher um you can see Cassandra the definitive guide by Evan hwit and Jeff Carpenter um you can see managing Cloud native data on kubernetes with Jeff Carpenter and Patrick mcfaden so yeah so these are these are all out here and this is the data that we've just inserted and managed using the data API all right let me um reshare things again here it was weird man I was like Inception I see two erands yeah I was in two places at once right yeah so uh why don't we why don't we talk about Vector search yeah Vector search okay I don't expect a lot of you to know what that actually is you probably heard plenty of talk about it but and if you know everything about Vector search just you know do something else for a minute um but Vector search is is just that it's a search Paradigm so we have plenty of search paradigms you can you can do very um we have this very clear thing like oh you can look up by partition key and get the exact answer you can use indexing on a field so you can look up extra Fields you can do range searches but then we get into things like text search like is there text in this document bm25 which does ranking but now with Vector search it's a completely different like we're way over here we're we're starting to move into the fuzziness of it and that's the semantics like um how is this thing similar to that thing and that's a that's a tougher problem but thankfully for you um plenty of nerds before you have figured out how to make this a lot easier and so Vector search does this thing where it finds um objects that have similar and objects being uh text it can be video audio whatever but it understands the meaning and then it it says oh I I'm looking for a red shirt okay that's up here so and here's a bunch of things that look like a red shirt next slide please and the key to this and this is what's really interesting is that a vector when we store it in the database is just an array of a lot of numbers and uh so it could be when I say a lot of numbers um very typically a vector array can be 300 terms or uh maybe 700 and so um the apple or the not the Apple open AI they're almost interchangeable at this point open AI Ada is like 1532 and it can be like 2048 you know so that's 248 terms in an array that's a lot of numbers but what that does is it gives you some resolution and so when you say here's an image and here's 248 um different uh coefficients that could describe it that gives you a lot of of resolution so when you're looking for something exactly the key though is that when you store Val vector and it's indexed in the system you have to present it with another Vector to compare against and that's probably the biggest difference is this isn't like a an indexing scheme like whenever you create an index in a regular database where you say here create index and then I'll give you a word and you tell me if that word is similar to an index no the the embedding is is a critical part of this now in asra we we create the embedding for you and I expect that'll probably happen sometime in DSC but this is well you have to create the vector present the vector to the system and then that Vector it'll start doing the similarity search on Vector versus everything that's in the index so that's how this works so next slide please and what these embeddings do is they take things like much bigger things like uh a chunk of text a paragraph to text and it derives as semantics for instance like so if you say um was what was this about it wasn't like a keyword search you're looking for the word token in every document you know that' be something you do with like um Lucine any Lucine based indexing like you know elastic search open search that sort of thing um this is more the semantics like I want to hear about the ways to manage my security okay there's meaning in that and these embeddings are really cool because they can derive meaning from text and then they create the embedding and that's what you're you're searching around so think of all those use cases that you could do with that and if you haven't here let me provide some for you so next Slide the common use cases that we've seen so far are you just regular enhanced search like think about like what that looks like H what that would look like for you as as a search Paradigm um it adds to your toolkit of search um nothing that you've had access to before um and if you have had access to it you probably had to build it yourself um enhanced matching that personalization and personalization has always been a thing in e-commerce but how about fraud detection like oh this looks very this looks stinky similar you know like that fraud detection is actually a really cool use case for Vector search um some analytics like classification I've done this before like does is this thing similar to this thing great put them together um and the conversational interfaces you've used chat GPT everyone's used it probably used Gemini as well um all the chat interfaces use Vector search to like you upload a PDF and then and then you can ask questions about it there you go you just use Vector search um so that's that's the use cases so what is like next slide what most people are building right now and this is what you see is the the rag application and that rag is retrieval augmented generation and you know because nerds like to put a lot of words into a name but they like abbreviations too oh yeah three three their acronyms are amazing tlaa um so uh rag is probably what you've been thinking hearing about with when it comes to like using a vector enabled database um and Vector is not a it's not a differentiated feature anymore every database in the world does this now so FYI but what rag does is it takes like a question from a user and instead of using a large language model large language models are like like gp4 or you know llama 3 instead of just relying on the llm to give you information back that may be embedded somewhere in that thing and then what would you get these wild hallucinations you know um like putting glue on a pizza um if you haven't heard about that look it up um it holds a cheese on instead it uses it uses that Vector enabled database um in this case your dsse or HD database to pull in semantically interesting information so think about personalization if I want to know about all the things that I've done at say like your e-commerce site that my data can be looked at and that could be augmenting the response so like hey what did I buy last week well here's all the stuff that from the shopping cart data from last week and then feed it into an llm why feed it into an llm because it does really nice textual responses it creates a language like human language so it would say hey based on your spending habits last week you were out of control um I don't know if LM get judgy but it could but that's the point is we use the llms for language and interface and we use the the vector and Bing for the actual information that so we minimize or reduce or even remove any hallucination so this is the thing you probably want to build or your developers want to build um next slide and then finally why this is super awesome inside of what you're getting with DSC and HD because you lucky dog you get to use J Vector 3 J Vector 3 is the most advanced Vector indexing engine out there right now and I'm saying that with almost zero marketing eyeball because I've been watching it work um you'll notice that the the the GitHub repos um Jonathan Ellis who those of you in Canta world may recognize that name well guess what he yeah a couple times yeah guess what he spends like 28 hours a day on yeah building a vector indexing scheme um you can go look at the code it's all there now J Vector one is in considerer five but uh dude is moving fast and he's trying to stay way ahead of the curve on on the research around Vector indexing because there's a lot of research on it and so we're already up to J Vector 3 and I'm sure it'll be J Vector 4 by next week but we're constantly updating we're putting that in line with dsse and HDD so you can have the most recent version of this Vector indexing engine why is this important because Vector indexing is a heavy operation and we are trying to make it as lightweight and cheap as possible for you and so and make it fast for your users it's it's not an easy thing to do but we made it easy for you okay and so oh by the way this is a comparison against pine cone I didn't put the who who does this getting compared to I think this is pineco yeah quite the throughput difference there for sure for sure whatever just put up a graph that makes it look amazing you know what don't at all go try yourself yeah you could do it all right next slide all right well I think we're back to um me stepping into the Multiverse again and yeah it's cool I mean doing another this one this one's much shorter though um are we gonna break the universe can I break the Universe I don't know um so so for this demo I'm actually GNA do a much smaller example um the uh the vector Dimensions we're going to work with are only like it's only like two dimensional vectors so be it it'll be pretty short but the idea is that they're meaningful and then they can they can still drive results um so let me go kick that off actually let me share my uh my tab first oh there it is okay all right and here we go oh wait a minute why does that look like the wrong one ah okay ha there we go you didn't share the audio it's not doing audio nope but it looks great yep that's why we're doing it live folks you can see us do these things okay okay okay even this is what's funny I said we recorded So we missed the live demo like we didn't upset the live demo Gods yeah now they're getting back at us yeah okay so I have yeah data API Vector demo yep and also share tab audio okay you don't hear it yeah I don't hear it I don't know if anyone out there maybe I'm wrong NOP can't hear it ah okay so you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to get rid of the other one because I think that was getting in our way you know have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again yeah I haven't gotten to that point just yet but I'm getting close yeah yeah okay share screen all right Chrome tab yep there we go also share tab audio that's on it's on all right Patrick you gotta let me know if you can hear it all right so now it's not running at all that's great okay okay okay okay um um let me try Okay yep there's that and I'm going to drop that where did that go so Patrick now hear you now I'm off mute well I muted because I didn't want to like overstep your thing so let's talk about one thing while you're you know rebooting your computer um a lot of people asked me like what's going on with these uh updates and in open source Cassandra so we are donating Upstream um all of these things actually somewhat exists the data API exists in Stargate um and uh J Vector is indeed in Cassandra 5 except it is J Vector 1 so it will be upgraded over time but the pace of the project is a little bit slower so that's that's part of the thing and the other thing is we do all the integration all the integration is for there for you and we give you all the bells and whistles around the Enterprise stuff like support and that sort of thing excellent all right let's try this again no this time but really I'm just going to show um how do a lot of the same things that we did with the data API with vector and how how Vector is exposed through the data API if you want to work in a pure Vector solution um so we're for going with our DS books example um maybe I want to add a vector search component to it so in that case what I need to do is add a vector enabled collection so I can do create collection um and I want to I'm just going to call Library Vector um but my options I'm going to set Vector I'm going to set for two dimensions and I want this thing to be indexed with a ukian mechanism so I'm going to send that okay so we've got our collection out there um now if I take a look I have this insert many Vector um method inside of uh inside of Postman here um and you can see here I have insert many and I have the documents kind of filled out but I have this Vector component on here actually I can bring that down a little bit so we can see the see the whole each whole document here but basically it's the same data but each one has been given a vector on the bottom um and if I just go ahead and run that you can see that I get my IDs back here so um we have a successful insert um now if I want to try get by Vector um you'll see that my my find is a little different where I don't really have a filter mechanism anymore I just have a sort mechanism I'm going to do an insert or an include similarity true here because I want to see the similarity scores so I'm going to say hey do a find we're going to sort um on the vector column and I'm going to use that first Vector position of one which means uh published by O'Reilly and then a number three um which equals subject of no Sequel and I'm going to do a limit five actually maybe we'll do we'll do a limit three on that how about that and then I'll go ahead and do we'll send that and what do we get here okay so the first one that comes back on no sequel from O'Reilly is Cassandra the definitive guide um so hey that that worked um and you can see that that has a similarity score of um n 0.96 which is really really good um next we have the practitioner guide to graph data um hey that actually did hit because we did search by no SQL um and this is an O'Reilly book for sure um oh and then we have seven no SQL databases in a week um that's one of mine um it's not no riy book but the um but the nosql subject is a is a direct hit um and now oh that came in at 50% similarity but yeah you know anyway so yeah so there's there's a quick uh demonstration of how we can use uh Vector through the data API yes all right yes all right home stretch home stretch yeah let's uh let's get the last of the slides here now this doesn't have anything comp complicated like audio so this ought to be uh pretty simple but uh here we are Patrick why should you upgrade that's yeah that's always a question yes I don't want to because the thing that I got works great right so of course Patrick had never seen this meme but I can hear this I can hear this upgrade upgrade actually that's Jim Foy being asked about the playoffs in a press conference after just getting beat but that that's okay um but yeah why why would we upgrade well um going to uh dc69 or hcd hcd hcdp gets you obviously best-in-class Enterprise databases support with Gen for Vector search I mean this is this is probably the big thing you know it it really lets you get into that that next level get into that um that you know Cutting Edge of current Tech that um you know everyone's kind of jumping on the the Gen bandwagon and um you know if you want to start going going ahead and innovating in that area um dsse and hcd will let you do that um simplify access with the data API and simplified Ops with Mission Control you know you know Patrick I'm hearing that I'm hearing that word there that's common simple simplify that's the upgrade yeah that the only reason you should upgrade is if it makes your life better right and that's right um you know it's so I this is a famous quote that I I love which is progress in technology is when we have the ability to be more lazy and yep so the the thing that's going to happen is that your users your Vel opers are going to ask for these features and you're going to have to figure it out this is the easy path because you already have something that works at World Class levels that you just need to upgrade and do instead of rebuilding an architecture or finding new products or vetting new vendors blah blah blah blah blah all that stuff you don't have to do any of that um and why do I know this because I've been talking to you I've heard this over and over again it's like oh we want all this stuff no one wants to do cql anymore they only want to use or you know something like that well great we got the data API that's probably worth the upgrade right there is never having to teach somebody how to do cql anymore um yeah no kidding but you know but the new use cases like with Vector search also compelling and you really got to think like do you want to go down this path because you're gonna get asked if you haven't been asked you will be how far do you want to go and you're just GNA make it easier on yourself in the long run and then finally my final pitch for kubernetes really I mean it is the future future and if you think that kubernetes is going to destroy your job like you're never going to have a job anymore when is an upgrading technology ever made less work right because you know it's gonna happen they're just gonna want more so yeah and and that actually sounds sounds a lot more challenging that than it is um you know one of the videos we actually have in our our mission control playlist is um you know kind of goes over it shows um you know Alexander janovski um doing like two different install paths and one is you know kubernetes is already there the other is our path of bring your own kubernetes and he kind of show us how to do all that and it's it's really not as complicated as you might think no and you could do live migration too Erin I think you should make that a live migration video yeah oh that's a great idea yeah yeah yeah yeah all right yep I'll add one okay there we go all right of course you know check out um data sac.com we have all kinds of cool stuff out there um this a blog post that um NY one of our our product managers had put out there on you know introducing Vector search for um you know self-manage modern architecture um really talks about the introduction of um you know dsse and hcd um and then if you you're interested at all the um the code I had for the for the the DS books demo that I I showed there um it's a Java code and it's using the uh the Java client API as opposed to the Java driver um that that's an important distinction there because that client API is what allows you to use the data API which is all htgp by the way it's not a binary driver right right all right and Patrick I think that's about it that's it I don't see any questions out there but you all know how to find us uh we're we're not hidden uh feel free to reach out with questions inmail um you know tweet whatever you're G to do yeah Linkin yeah in yeah just just hit us up you know where to find us and we' be happy to talk to you if you want to get on a call that's great too I mean we're we know that this is a thing uh 6.9 is going to be out July 11th so couple weeks and there's already a pre-release out there you can grab it there's an image um yeah yeah so July 11th and that's that's the release date but you can get it today um that that is available out there and it's uh it's in like a Beta release candidate type form right now so this is pretty much what you're going to get and it's a container um so or we have a tball too right I think so yeah there's a tarball there's a tarball yeah tball I'm running too I I have the tarball locally you such a nerd use the right but yeah you uh you can go get it now and um HD same they're they're both gonna be at the same time so yeah yep just in time for [Laughter] summer oh uh yeah we'll put it in can we can we put a link up to where where to get 6.9 or maybe we put it in the LinkedIn are you're watching on crowd crowdcast yeah I'm watching on on crowdcast so I did see that I'm you know I had because you asked Martin we're gonna do it for you live right now I had the link somewhere and now I have to now I have to find now I'm like why didn't we have the link in the slide I know we should have thought about that are people going to ask for the link no part of the fun is finding it it's kind of like an Easter egg hunt hold [Laughter] on yeah that's and then um and then our producer Michelle who's listening to this we make sure and get it on all the platforms that because this this video will be on um YouTube live or on YouTube our dat Stacks developers the YouTube so um you know if you want to share it and that sort of thing you know because you want to tell all your friends right oh we're gonna go do this and if you don't kind a nerd are you did you find it Aaron no I didn't find it yet H okay Michelle gotcha all right we're gonna share this in an email because Aaron is failing isn't it download dat stacks.com it's it's it's get it's getting us back for um the demo gods are getting us back for cheating them by by posting that video right so yeah I thought it was in if that is in D yeah hang on yeah here it is if you go to I got it you just go to downloads downloads. data.com everybody yeah that's it that's it and here's a short link cool nice.com you can get HDD you can get dsse 6.9 the uh the release all the releases are in there pre-release um so go get it bandwidth Chargers apply maintain cure [Laughter] all right thanks a lot everyone we're going to check out you go check it out be in contact with us we'd love to hear from you and think hear what you think so all right thanks everyone have a great day",
