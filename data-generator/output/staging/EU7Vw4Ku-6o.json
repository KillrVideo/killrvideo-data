    "text": "[Music] hello my name is Simon Ambridge and I'm a solutions engineer with data stacks and today I'm going to show you how to use the azure marketplace to deploy a brand new data stacks cluster the first thing I'm going to do is flip over to my web browser and I have my browser open at Azure dot microsoft comm forward slash marketplace and you can get here by just running a search for as your marketplace so if I search for data stacks here you can see one comes up data stacks Enterprise and this is a solution template and a solution template is a little different than some of the other offers on the marketplace some other offers are virtual machines and those are VM images already baked with the product installed data stacks instead of offering a virtual machine offers a collection of virtual machines and these will deploy on the fly so we start when you hit deploy with Canonical's VM image installs Java installs data stacks and configures the whole thing to be a cluster so let's get started with that we click on that we get a description of what Cassandra is so let's hit deploy and go for it so when I hit deploy it redirects me to my login for Asia now in my case my login is through data stacks and we use a third-party single sign-on facility called octa but I'll click on my opto single sign-on data stacks account it redirects me to octo single sign-on I sign in it redirects me a couple more times the new portal interface it can deploy into something called a resource manager and you can see that down here so this is redirected me to the azure marketplace page for data stacks specifically the the login login page which comes after connecting through that single sign-on if you go directly to portal dot azure calm you can also get here so let me open up a new tab and show you how to do that so it logs me in here and from the porting dot as your dot-com page if I click the marketplace tile and just as we did before search for data stacks in here this time you can see it comes back with two entries that one labeled staged is something that we're moving through QA work right now and you wouldn't be able to see that with your account so this is the offer so we're back to the same place so to actually deploy this I click the Create button and it pulls up a new blade as you call this so I need to enter in some details the what the username and password will be for the virtual machines that will be provisioned and this is the UNIX level username and password there's a black list of user names that you can't use so user name such as admin or administrator are all banned so I usually call my user simply data stacks and then you have to enter in a password and the password policy requires at least an uppercase letter a lowercase letter a number and a special character like an exclamation point so I enter my password in enter again you may have a subscription if your organization has an EA and enterprise agreement with Microsoft if not you can sign up for an account yourself and you'll just need a credit card number so next up I need to make a resource group name the resource group is kind of the container that holds all the different virtual machines and the IP addresses and the networking defaces and so on all the details that constitute our cluster we usually recommend deploying a data stacks cluster in its own resource group and that way it can be managed independently of anything else you might have for instance you might deploy the data stacks cluster in one resource group and you might deploy the web tier this sits in front of that database in another resource group so I'm going to call mine been MP one for marketplace you can then deploy you can choose which region you're going to deploy your cluster into and this subscription I think has 13 different regions available depending on which region you choose there are going to be different machine types available for instance I know that West US has some g-series machines so I click OK here and now a couple of things I need to choose how many nodes I want how about 10 let's create a 10 node cluster you can have between 1 and 40 nodes the reason you can't have more than 40 in the marketplace offer is down to a limitation on the i/o for something called a storage account in Azure we have a workaround for that limitation if you choose to deploy outside of the marketplace using command-line tools you can deploy arbitrarily large clusters so you're not limited to 40 nodes maximum next up I need to choose what sort of virtual machines I want to use these three are our recommended virtual machine types these ones are recommended because amongst other things they take up the entire physical box so there's no chance of any resource contention whether there are any other applications or services and they're just a very good size for the vast majority probably 80% or close of the use cases so if I click view all here you can see a number of other machines that aren't recommended the D one in particular is they're basically just for running deployments and seeing how they work you can't really run any queries or workloads against it it's too small and we don't even recommend it for development purposes the other machine types are a bit more marginal and may be possible but I typically always recommend the d14 v2 as opposed to the standard D 14 the D 14 v2 is a newer processor that's marginally faster so I'm going to pick that so I click OK here and now it shows what the whole template we've configured looks like I'm just going to click OK to continue through we now redirects you to some legal information including the Terms of Use that you agree to both the data stacks and with Microsoft Azure just for the high level this offer is bring your own license so that license can either be no fee non production or development license alternatively if you have an existing license with data stacks then you can use that so I'm going to hit create now and it's going away to build my cluster and you can see that from the icon there one neat thing you can do while this is running we'll just see how long this one takes it's 4:07 p.m. right now so I'm going to go over here to resources Dozier comm and if I drill down a bit I can see my resource groups and these are various things we have running at the moment but here we have the resource group we just made been mp1 and you can see within that three deployments ops center nodes and the main deployment this is the marketplace wrapper around that and you can click on those and read about what's going on this doesn't refresh a bit so in the cord while the deployments in progress you have to do that yourself but you can do this as the deployment runs to see additional things as they as they come up under compute here all I have currently is an availability set it hasn't got around to making the virtual machines yet but if I hit refresh again that's if we got anything else oh yes here's some virtual machines now so this is going to build out 10 virtual machines plus an eleventh virtual machine that's a very small one a standard a1 virtual machine and that's going to run op Center as you can see it's just using the standard canonical boot OS image not a state another data stack specific one so I'm going to flip back here to the portal as you can see this is still deploying at this point I'm going to pause the recording and we'll come back once this is completed as I mentioned we started the deployment at 407 so let's keep that in mind and see how long this thing takes hello again so it's now 4:30 23 minutes have elapsed and I got a message saying that my deployment had completed so this been MP one panel popped up and it shows all the resources in here and I can even see more if I click on the the dot dot to get more details displayed all the things that deployed from our marketplace offer so the various virtual machines there the NICS for each one the IP addresses for each I'm going to click on the OP Center machine you know I actually want the OP Center IP address so let me go back down here load some more click on the OP Center IP address click what that is click this icon to to copy it click the copy copy that to the clipboard and we can go and look at that another way to get this is to refresh resources as you're calm and we can also drill down into the IP addresses ops center again and you can see the ops center IP address here as well grab the IP address again open up in a new tab in the browser so it's the IP address : 8 8 8 8 the four eights and that gives us the landing page for 4 op Center and look at that we have a cluster running it's running data stacks for 8.5 we have 10 nodes about 7 terabytes of storage available and if I click over here on this icon we get a view of the the complete cluster and we can move around and see the various nodes and see some details and we can double click and drill down into any one of those nodes and see more detail this one for example I'm just going to grab its IP address so we can SSH into it have a look and see what's in see what it's doing but we have a running cluster it's all healthy and it's just waiting to do some productive work so if I go over here now and open up a terminal window I can SSH to the data stacks user on the IP address the dead stacks user I created earlier and type in the password that I defined earlier and it successfully logs me in so from here I can run for example the node tool status command and that gives me a description of the cluster that we've created and something else I can do is type cql SH and start up a cql shell and have a look in the database and see what key spaces we have and so forth so that's a working cluster in 20-some odd minutes stay tuned for our next videos on how to deploy from a command line and what to do once you have running cluster you [Music]",
