can hear us well sean you're here with us already yeah you too cedric i mean i hope you can see me okay we're all good there we go i saw i saw a thumbs up from jack wonderful all right sean can't hear sean well that's interesting oh um please hold can't hear sean all right i see let me take a look here can you you guys can hear me and you can hear cedric too all right all right crap i did it again i think it's my i think it's my problem i think i have made a mistake here in i am sharing all right everyone just please hold yeah seriously please hold this figure do you do you all hear music yeah i like that sean yeah just so you all know we are super smooth and professional so you can hear the music but you can't hear us very interesting and uh yes that's what i'm doing alex no music okay and what's interesting is for some reason okay that's really weird and we'll do it this way um go ahead and talk guys okay well for some interesting reason um your audi oh wait i i think i know what it is i will have this fixed in a moment everybody just please bear with me try that how about now guys can you talk for me i don't think they do okay i swear we're almost there i think i see what's going on here now yeah how about this aha now talk for me can you guys hear cedric yay all right all right sorry sorry that's what happens when we're configured for a workshop and then we do something different and i needed to make a change let's see so i can hear you nope that says nope only music what is going on with this oh what just happened there okay my zoom everything just muted completely yes all right well we're having we're having some technical difficulties right now at the moment and yes i am double appeared even though all of that should be turned off uh which is very interesting yeah i'm gonna change all right here alex is coming on to help hey alex let's see i am sharing the screen but let me um do it in here all right we appreciate you all just bearing with us as we fix this particular issue all right let me yep i'm working on it i'm working on it you need my other screen yes that's you don't see those because the second i share you're gonna those go away you can't see those settings but i can share my obs with you here we go so all you're seeing the fourth wall now as we uh share inside what's going on here okay uh where in zoom itself i am okay can you see my screen you see what i'm doing you don't see that i'm streaming in slido but i'm sharing the screen to you guys and you're not seeing it oddly enough oh because it's not okay it's not showing that to you that's all um honestly alex if i share in zoom it you don't see it it seems like when i share my screen you're not seeing my zoom settings yeah sharing that screen is not going to help [Music] um no i cannot share the display alex it doesn't have the option to share display i can share applications or i can yes that's yep that's what i was sharing originally i don't know why you're not seeing it um yep right here and no i i yep that's i i had that one zoom the zoom audio one that was there a second ago this one right here i have no idea all right just bear with us everybody as we get through this we really appreciate you sticking with us here i cannot oh here you want this okay uh so uh zoom sounds so sound from me uh must be going to obs now so if you can i do see the levels in obs do you can you let us know if you hear him do you hear alex talking if you hear me please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat oh me i can hear you alex all right yeah and i see that i see the levels kicking in obs yeah and others will be fine as well sure all right i think i think that was it let's go ahead and okay i'm jumping out have fun oh you can stay why don't you stay alex all right do you guys hear alex do we hear cedric cedric talk for me alex clap clap all righty geez wow we are so appreciative of all of you sticking around while we struggled through that apparently my settings were off so thank you so much for doing that all right let's get to it let's get to it if you guys can all hear everybody let's get to it now sean you're muted bud you're muted in zoom yeah i didn't do it this time second attempt how about now it sounds okay so just in case anybody was wondering we uh we went the old-school microsoft group we re rebooted right that solved all that yeah right um what is going on here okay hold on sorry sean it all got muted something keeps muting zoom and i don't know why yeah it just totally flattened out i have no idea what's going on with this all right uh let's see what is going on with zoom today the first time it was my fault we are definitely having some technical difficulties with this and yes i don't know what has changed or why yep it's the same i've got it set to the system sound nothing changed uh cedric and sean can you talk one two three four okay okay yeah there we go we're back again keep checking yep it's all good i don't know what happened all right all right go on yes they did try they did okay attempt number three hopefully alex's back we're back online all right so good morning good afternoon or good evening wherever you are in the world uh welcome we're glad you stuck around during our uh 11 minute uh royal rumble with technology you know always sets the tone for a positive experience but what we're here to do today is to have an ama for all the participants in the hackathon so we came up with a holiday hackathon to really try to give back to the developer community and give you guys the chance to earn some money whether you are male female or non-binary we don't care if you can build something cool we want you to be part of our group that's what we're here to do now we also have a lot of experts in the cassandra world in the developer world that are here to help everybody answer all the questions that we have jack actually shared a link to sligo or slidoo sorry it is the best way to ask questions you can also look at the current questions and upvote them if you would like to give them higher priority and we will be going through all of these questions as they come up we're going to try to help everybody give you as much advice and information as possible but if you have any follow-up questions for us we also have a discord channel which i would recommend you join we're always on there because we are globally distributed so there's always somebody from data stacks available at some point of the day all right so that being said i'd like to introduce our uh fellow developer advocates the gentlemen who are below me on the screen they're the ones who usually run our workshops and all of our really cool stuff where we can learn right our learning series but we want to make sure that you guys have access we also have some other people in the chat jack alex patrick um and if i've forgotten anybody else david chung sorry um we have all of them there as well and we'll all be here to help everybody all right david g would you like to introduce yourself to the group hello yes i'm david jones gilardi and as sean just mentioned i'm one of the developer advocates on the team so for those of you who have ever attended one of our workshops there's a good chance that you've probably seen me or cedric or alex or someone on there so we are the folks that are usually behind creating the content for the workshops trying to get as much knowledge out there about cassandra astron stargate and such as possible um so uh so yeah hello everybody and i'll stop there cool and i'm leading the advocate team as david you probably have seen me a lot on workshop or any content we are providing to the channel so happy to be here and answer the question we can over here excellent all right so the first question that we have been asked a lot and you can see it it's got three votes on our screen what is astra so a lot of people who are brand new to the cassandra world they're they're often asking so what's the point of astra is that is that like a datastax thing um i'm gonna answer that with a yes no situation um datastax astra is cassandra as a service okay so that's what we've created it's meant to help alleviate the high stepping that cassandra used to have where you have to do all this configuration and you have to work so hard to get it set up now using datastax astra aka cassandra as a service you can literally start your deployment within five minutes probably less if you have a fast connection but within five minutes you can actually have a cluster up and running um and you can start using it immediately so david g or cedric do you guys have anything to add to that yeah i'll just add a couple things there um you know especially astra was really kind of developed not only but with the developer in mind so you know as kind of sean was just talking about a moment ago the ability to be able to spin up a database and not just any database cassandra we're talking apache cassandra right this is a database that is known for its scalability and robustness and everything um and to be able to spin one of these up as a developer in just a couple minutes and get going whether you're talking like something you're going to experiment with on the free tier which is free forever or something that is a real production database right that you're using for your real actual production loads to be able to do that and have a database like this that is completely managed for you is huge right because i can spin it up as a dev i can just hook it up and go right um so so that's pretty big especially uh in whether you're an organization or a single developer someone who maybe doesn't have an i.t staff or doesn't have the expertise to run cassandra or whatever it really kind of sets you up so you can get moving real fast yes and on top of this cassandra database as a managed service you do have two set of apis rest api graphql api and the purpose of the icon is really to make those apis shines so it used to be only drivers to connect to kasamhara with multiple languages java node c but now uh you know it's easier to just interact with the database using a rest api and more more recent technology and and something they even add right um you know for those of you who are already familiar with the patrick is sandra and how it works and how to use it right you're used to having to require you know to have a schema create your data model your tables and everything but with astra there is the ability with the document api to just create schemas documents just boom and go right i mean it's an extremely simple api and what's really neat matter of fact i guess we could show it just for a moment because i happen to have asked her up haha we saw some of the questions coming in but if you go to if you have a database and you go to the connect tab you'll see that there are all these different apis and language variants that you can take a look at what's really cool is this is set up in such a way so here's the document api where you just follow the instructions you can just copy the stuff right out here i could just do this right in my terminal and within a couple of commands i can now start interacting with it you know right over um http and such i don't need to actually use the drivers and stuff if i don't want to it's the same thing if you're talking graphql if you're talking rest um so it makes it extremely easy to kind of get up and going even if you don't are or if you're not familiar with how to code with drivers or whatever there are other options there for you yeah i think it makes the screen bigger i should make it bigger make it smaller yeah he doesn't care if we are just smaller alright okay all right okay so let's go on to the next question it's another very common question that we have and that is going to be can we postpone the deadline the short and sweet answer is going to be no unfortunately we cannot the main reason why is because we've been running this for 25 days uh already and we also need time to actually evaluate all the submissions and choose the winners because we need to give you guys your money right the people who are going to win need to get their prizes and we need to be able to get that to you in a reasonable time we don't want to wait until next christmas to give you your prize money right so unfortunately we cannot extend this current deadline but there will be future events where you will get a chance to join us again i can't guarantee that the prize money is going to be the same size as we are doing now but um we're going to make sure that you have a good time you learn something valuable and that you know you can actually jump on the train to make yourself famous that's what we're gonna do we're here to make you famous okay so unfortunately the short answer is no we cannot postpone the deadline but if there's something you want to work on a project you want to work on if you want to just continue working on something that you've submitted um you have the owner rights we do not take any of your stuff and own it we're here to promote it and make sure you guys get the proper attention so that's the short answer or the long winded answer for um can i extend no and you know another thing to kind of point out for the future for if we you know we go to do these hackathons again in the future right great place to find out is our youtube channel right if you go and subscribe and you ring the bell on there you'll get notifications anytime something like this shows up you'll see him there also our eventbrite maybe jack can uh pop in the eventbrite link as well into the chats because the eventbrite that's going to be like the one-stop shop for all of the events coming up so then in the future if we have another hackathon like this you should see it pop right up exactly all right so actually excellent so for those of you who are participating in the event um keeping track of the developer advocate team is always a good situation and as uh david was just explaining they always do some really cool stuff they're always trying to find new ways to interact with astra and apis and and teaching people how to use kubernetes or kate sandra and stuff like that so there's really a lot of fun topics um to to learn from so i definitely would recommend keeping an eye on that and just subscribing it's all free oh all right so we have a question saying we are facing a particularly difficult indexing in some fields we're using the graphql api for all tasks can you put some focus in that area so go ahead now you know just for this question uh we really need to reach out to the engineering team so the team putting in place the graphql api is uh available on a discord so the stargate the stargate discord those guys implement the api and it should be the best way to to interact with them so i will drop through the link i think we cannot discuss in long form exactly what the indexing you might have but provide you the link in the chat for this stargate discord and you can reach out to the developers okay great answer all right so the next question is what is an efficient way to scale up an extra cassandra node um the comment afterwards says i couldn't see there's a proper solution yet in cassandra community when you ask that question um do you mean a an extra cassandra node in datastax astra or just adding a cassandra node to your deployment regardless of which variant of app or cassandra that you're using and i actually read that too like vertically scale an existing node like scale up well it does say an extra cassandra node yeah are you adding one in or what yeah so yeah so that was just a question you know because for astro when we're using cassandra as a service it's not very easy to scale up an extra node compared to an on-prem or even a cloud deployment that you have configured yourself so that's why it might be good to just give us a little bit of extra information as to what exactly that you want here and we'll circle back to that question because it's a great question we just want to make sure we answer it correctly yep okay just as a matter of fact you tend to scale out somehow right you know you need more capacity or throughput and not really scale up because you need all the cassandra nodes to have the same cpu ram on disk and because you want to have balance in your nodes this is maybe what you see most of the time scale out and now it's get up that's actually great cedric you are completely correct all right so we'll circle back to that if the person or persons who voted on this could uh put some extra information in the chat we'll circle back to make sure that we answer correctly all right so the next one can we submit any kind of web app for this hackathon that i am interested to build um the short and curly answer is yes absolutely build whatever you want however you want it the only rule that we have for the hackathon is you must feature data stacks astra as the foundational piece of your project okay so if you build anything that you want but you leverage the power of datasacks astra to enhance whatever it is that you're building double thumbs up and that's exactly what we want there is no one type of project it's open innovation that's why whether you're a front-end developer a back-end developer full stack doesn't matter whatever you want as long as you astra we're all good okay okay does a deployed web app get extra points compared to one running on localhost um that's a difficult question so the the way that we're trying to look at every submission is we have four criteria that are going to be part of the evaluation process one the best usage of astra right the second one is innovation if you're going to be building stuff that everybody else is building that's not being innovative right if you're just copy pasting something that somebody else has already done that's not innovation so we're trying to see like hey just build whatever it is that you want your idea build it out the other one is the quality of your submission and your code right somebody who submits just a title but doesn't submit any github code or presentation or video or anything to explain anything not so much but somebody who does take the time to give us like a five sentences what is the application a little 10 slide presentation as to how it works and maybe even a little video as to showcase how it works those would get a higher consideration because it's part of our judging criteria and that's why we want to make sure that everybody is aware of that and the fourth and final piece is what is going to be the community impact so does that mean that your idea um has to be community impactful no it does not but we're trying to make sure that we give you a chance to build something that people will want to use expand on build on to give you the chance to build your network out the way you want it right so that's that's the reason why we say community impact and by community we don't mean society we mean the developer community right if you make a big splash in developer community that's going to give you mega points so hopefully that gives everybody a an answer that your hosting location does not give you any extra points all right um is one of the oh social impact so that's why i was saying we say community impact not social impact that's specifically why i brought that up right because it's about the developer community um we're not talking about the world we can't save the world right we're individual people we don't have the power to save the world but what we can do is make an impact to our peers and that's what we're trying to achieve right we want to see like hey when you submit something really awesome during the uh event right during the the awards event we're gonna actually allow people in the audience to vote on what they think is the coolest what they think is the most awesome thing the most innovative that you know you guys get to be involved in that process now the prize is one through 250 they're going to be judged by data stacks experts but all the other interactive prize categories are up to you guys the community to choose that's what we mean by community impact this developer community okay all right all righty so now i'm going to allow or not allow go to uh ask one of our colleagues in the call what is the what is the advantage of cassandra over other nosql databases because that is a controversial topic that our developer advocates probably could answer better than i can yeah let's see your time david and i will take over as you wish oh really you want to do it that way you want to do it that way i thought i was gonna let you go first in that one i know you're so opinionated here cedric [Laughter] i am i am so this is why i want to go first yeah go for it go for it okay now so um first there is a a lot of no sequence database flavors so you might have heard about document database graph database key value um even new sql database or column oriented database and each time it's not about what is better but it's not better is first they all they are all distributed system and in a distributed system you cannot ensure consistency availability and network partitioning this is the cap theorem and any single of this distributed database shows two over the three because you cannot have the three and so you can choose consistence and past decent tolerance or you can choose availability so first based on the use case you would rather have consistency or availability then you need to change a first range of database then what do you want to store storing in cassandra is table oriented strength already ice route put high capacity it's scale linearly so this is why you find some use cases like iot because you're writing a lot a lot of data at the super high grades and you want to store petabyte of data and also cassandra have replication that are available in multiple nodes across the world you save the data once and cassandra replicated all over the place and this is why big a web giant like april uh use like thousands and thousands of cassandra nodes to store every data starting with the i on the cassandra but casanova is a colon iot database so it's cool for the use case i told you but for the scale for other use cases they're not really fit you know key value database may be fastest for just using cache storing schema-less stuff may be more appealing for some usage it's just each database has its own data storage is on trends and weakness but it's not fair to compare one noise squared against another it's all about the usefulness yeah and i would i would rather talk about the things that cassandra does really well uh to cedric's point there um you know for one the scale-out piece of it i mean you can essentially scale a cassandra database indefinitely right and and you see examples real world real world production examples of this is you know uh cedric was alluding to some of these if you look at some of the big players um you know apple's one sony playstation is another one netflix is is huge um there are plenty of others like that i mean there are some huge cassandra clusters out there and the reason why is because azure as your data grows and as you want you know if you have particular slas in your throat put you want to be able to stay to those we're talking like you know tight millisecond you know double digit or single digit millisecond response times and stuff you can continue to scale out cassandra indefinitely to meet that and there really aren't many others that can right but as cedric alluded to it's not it's not just saying well cassandra's just better because but it's different it's meant for a different thing right also the robustness piece cassandra is seriously robust it was built to handle failures um so you can lose in certain configurations up to two-thirds of your of your database still be available still facilitate requests you can lose whole data centers and stuff and the thing still still works right it's pretty darn bulletproof um so that's another piece that again it's really more focusing on what cassandra does really well as compared to saying well this other nosql database doesn't do it or something um but yeah i definitely when it comes to scalability and robustness and and that all of that ties into what cedric was talking about with the replication the inherent replication that ease of being able to replicate data globally across your data centers is really slick so um i i think there's just so many advantages on its own merits it's not so much of a comparison to the others exactly i think that's a great way to put it you guys um because we never want to put down other technology right other technologies they have the use cases where they'll beat anybody you know things happen all right um let me just answer rohan's specific question real quick because i've i've saw it uh pop up a couple of times so the answer is no you will never be scored negatively regardless of what you do there is no negative score so there's no minuses to anything okay now that being said whatever way you want to connect to your astra database doesn't matter whether you want to use a driver whether you want to use an api it's up to you there is no limitation it's all just about use data stacks astra aka cassandra as a service in your submission and that's all we want how you connect to it that's up to you guys that's why it's open innovation be confident that however you connect that's okay as long as you do something cool with that connection we are all good to go all right so that scale up the cassandra node actually has the follow-up right we can see there regarding the scaling let's say here it is there we go it's the it's the four node situation so um we have some good news bad news about that follow-up here is the good news bad news situation um three terabytes on your nodes is too much it's it's way beyond what we recommend what any cassandra expert recommends right if you look at the generalized advisory we say get a four terabyte disk and what is the unwritten rule for all cassandra deployments never exceed more than 50 disk space right and the reason for that is due to the anti-entropy operations and some of the other headroom operations that we need to do to keep everything working so we're already exceeding what the recommendations are now the second part is you wanted to add a fifth note to your cluster and it's been in a state of join for the past seven days now that indicates that there are possibly a couple of different things going on one um during the joining has it gotten stuck in the um transitioning data over to that node number two is it stuck in the contacting the seed node phase there's a lot of things that are going on right there but this is a great question to take offline well not offline but take out of this ama and into our discord channel so if you um if you want to get some help and really really just talk to us about it you know let's do that on discord we're always there for you okay so we're not going to leave you uh hanging in the lurch but this is a situation that doesn't really apply to the hackathon so we're going to move that to a different platform but i do like these questions they're excellent keep them going because we would love to help you be successful moving forward matter of fact for that person sean is there someone is that you is there someone they should kind of reach out to to have a further discussion or community itself maybe community would be a good one yeah if you uh if you can ask me or ask me specifically on discord then i will make sure to follow up and to get it going properly i want to make sure that this gets answered properly because we want to make sure that everybody using cassandra is set up for success all right so the next question can we build a common use case using astra to demonstrate how easy it is to build it using astra and will it be effective um if you're going to be using a common use case uh or one of our examples yeah you could have it up and running you can actually have an application up within i believe it is an hour our develop advocate group has a couple of really cool workshops where within one hour you'll have your astro up your your application up you actually run queries and everything so can you do it really easily yes now in terms of the hackathon will common use cases or just regurgitating our examples give you a leg up no innovation is key right that's what we want to be the more innovation innovation you show in your submission the better it is for your case does that make sense i hope to everybody he does yeah i was looking online to see if anyone responded to it but yeah that's why i just want to give them the chance you know uh both discord and in youtube all right the next question can you guys explain cassandra in layman's terms uh i'm going to defer to our developer advocates because i'm sure you guys get asked this almost every single day yeah you know funny enough uh god how long ago was it now cedric there was somebody out there i'm trying to remember what the site was and like one of the developer sites that said explain cassandra to me like you're talking to a five-year-old right i don't think we ever got to that particular challenge but um cassandra is a database like any other database right it's a place where you're gonna put you're gonna store your data the key thing about cassandra is speed at scale performance at scale and robustness so if you are going to compare against like a relational database like an oracle or a mysql or something like that um i would say the biggest difference there because they're both required schema unless you're talking about the document api but generally it's both required schema it's both a tabular format that's going to look very familiar the way that you store things in rows and such but the big difference is the ability for cassandra to horizontally scale out indefinitely and to be extremely robust right um so i think that's those are kind of differentiators there um that went a little past layman's terms because i said more that i meant to um but yeah i would i would say the big things there are it's a database that is extremely robust that can continue to keep very very tight um you know sla slas response times regardless of the scale yeah i would simply say if you do have a very small data to manipulate and you familiar with mysql or any relational database at a point if time the server is too small you know you cannot make fit everything on the single machine you need to have multiple machines and now you need another kind of database that could add machine as much as you need and keep going with scaling exactly i like that cool all right the next oh um rohan does it matter if my schema is sub optimal or even horrible in my defense i'm new to cassandra um i would say how horrible are you talking uh you know like are you just saying like ski i'm not going to provide a weird clothes you know you know if you take if you take a 200 column table out of your relational databases [Laughter] in the project exactly exactly so you um let's put it this way i'm not going to penalize you for not having it perfect right but your quality of code and your quality of submission is one of the criteria so if it's like truly horrendous it might not get you any points but it won't get you any negative points if that helps sean is the document api okay to use for the hackathon yes there you go stargate is fully available so so one way rohan you might want to approach this right is to just use the document api now depending on the use case it might not actually fit but the document api will allow you to just store schemas documents right like a json blobber you can just store it you can just go here's my here's my data right now again that may not fit for what your application's actually doing it might actually be more proper to use a proper data model just like you would in a relational database but the option's there and sean did just say that you could totally do that so something to take a look at exactly thank you for promoting that so in case you guys are looking for our apis or you know the the things that we're looking we're talking about stargate stargate.io it's in the help links for the hackathon but stargate.io is basically the project that we've been mentioning right what the different kinds of apis that we're bringing to cassandra and it is absolutely a must stop if you're interested in using rest api graphql document api right this is where you want to go because otherwise you are going to have to go to the drivers right and the drivers itself bring you back to the old school way of doing things so we're really trying to make it easy for you that you can use your api use your preferred method and be successful that's what we're trying to achieve and and to be clear stargate is actually its own open source project right it's actually separate from cassandra it's separate from astra it just so happens that we have is as part of data sets like kind of pushing like getting stargate out there and opening that up to the world that that has been implemented along with astra that's why you have the document api the graphql api and the rest api here in astra so we're essentially kind of giving you the keys to stargate right off an asteroid off the bat um now i believe though stargate does i mean that works with open source cassandra right i don't think that everything has made it into the open source cassandra build just yet but it's coming right that's the goal is to get that there so um so if you want to if you want to be able to quickly the quickest path to get to the apis that sean was just talking about in surrogate is to go through astra because they're already being implemented for you exactly it's excellent i love that edition cool um could you switch back to the questions yeah you say thank you yes so when we say best use of cassandra what strengths do you want us to highlight in our solutions so we're trying to showcase the best usage of astra specifically right cassandra as a service so not just you know not an on-prem or a cloud deployment or a hybrid deployment it it is specifically for the best usage of astra now we've kind of hinted on some of the um strengths of astra right our usage of um different apis that you can run um cassandra itself is strong right we've touched on what cassandra can bring to the table so what we really want you to do is when you're thinking about your project is try to think about what you would need to make the biggest impact right and for this day and age we are a reward now type of society yeah waiting is not an option downtime is not an option right you have to be able to scale out immediately and if people are waiting more than two seconds on your dedicated application for the data show up they're going to go to the competitor they're going to be like yeah forget this i'm out it's not for me so when we say best usage of astra we say try to use astra as a tool to make your app special and then leverage the strengths of what astra brings to the table to really enhance your application so that's kind of the symbiotic relationship that we're looking for okay all right by what date will the results be announced char dual good to see you um i recognize the name you're one of our very active participants glad that you're here so as soon as the submissions are in depending on the sheer volume of submissions uh it could be pretty pretty quickly but what we're trying to do is um this weekend is going to be the final submission weekend and on monday i'm going to send out an email to all the people who have registered and uh submitted their projects on our timeline because we're going to set up a live um award show where we are going to hand out the awards that we choose but we're also going to let the participants and the people who are going to be a part of that be um voting on the winners themselves to make sure everything goes well and a lot of people have asked when is the deadline it's january the 18th that is the deadline january the 18th 2 55 a.m e d t it states at the top of the um the hackathon web page exactly when that is going to happen so i'll put that in here again um just in case you want to know you know i'm looking at the time and i think maybe we are chatty and we do have a lot of questions so let's go through the question and you know stay sharp on answer just to cover as much as we can you know just the three of us maybe we can make the session long uh last longer of course but you know it would be there if we cover more and more people will be happy exactly cool all right guys what is cloud native okay especially for this one uh you can go to datastax.com cloud native but simply put tndr this is really building an application in a way that will leverage on what makes the cloud so cool so scalability flexibility resilience and so containerization kubernetes are keywords we find is those is in in those world but this is not the only way to be clouded if you want your app to be resilient no with no single of product failure have some observability so monitoring stuff like that so the more keyword you can implement the better exactly and i drop the link to this if you want to take a look at all the stuff and it kind of explains it all um so the link is there in the youtube and discord chats excellent thank you guys all right questions again all right so that's cloud noted click so what am i supposed to create for the events um we've tried to give you guys some guideline and and try to help um make this clear for you basically it's open innovation what we're trying to get you to do is build something that motivates you something that you find important something that you find interesting something you think the world could use and make sure that you use data stacks astra as the foundation for that that's what you're supposed to create everything else is completely open innovation because we are trying to motivate you to be creative we're trying to motivate you to build new stuff and not regurgitate old stuff it's not about can i build something it's about what can i build right and there is no limitation on what you can use cassandra for so that's why we're trying to say like hey go nuts do something cool and we'll help promote everything that you do next question is where to oh sorry it changed uh if you clear cookies can you upload a question that's what made me laugh that's why i was laughing you know you could test that out by clearing cookies and trying up the boat the question like 20 times or something but i don't i don't know honestly [Laughter] we always have actors over here yeah right exactly all right so chardoul um the question that you have if two or more teams are working on a similar idea will be scored negatively no there is no negative scoring in the event you will never get any negative scoring on you now if you have two teams that are inadvertently creating a similar project of course there is a chance that you might get compared to see which one is best but there's also the situation that hey both projects or multiple projects might all be viable and they might all fall into the category of potential prize winners so we're not looking for everybody has to make their own thing and if somebody claimed oh oh i got cloud native that only one team can do cloud native right so don't feel like you're limited by anything in that terms and there is no negative scoring in any way shape or form all right okay two or more team or sorry is starting useful for deploying did i i'm sorry did i kill the question that you were trying to answer i thought you did that's right okay okay so you guys would you the developer advocate group would you guys say stargate is useful for deploying a web app stargate is a stargate is what we call a data gateway is kind of a proxy on top of cassandra so it's just providing you a new way to interact with customers or database to be honest so it's not a runtime for you to host your web app so it's easy to develop the the app not to deploy it yeah i would say that yeah exactly stargate's giving you extra apis really right it's giving you different interfaces into cassandra so i don't think it matters on the kind of app or or or not right i think that's totally a side of what stargate's doing for you it really is um just giving you more ways to store and retrieve your data yeah i think that's the best explanation cool so what is cassandra let's see this one is yeah it's pretty open right so yeah we do have a lot of content regarding cassandra so cassandra is a nosql distributed database we store that as tables now if you want to make that sharp and we cover already multiple questions on castle in the beginning of this session agreed um so a couple people are asking some uh some questions that can all be answered with a simple uh display david i just sent you the link to the actual hackathon um could you pull up the hackathon just so we can show people how to navigate because there's a couple of different sections that will actually answer a whole bunch of information or a whole bunch of questions in one quick swoop yes the answer is yes i can totally load that because you asked only if cedric would ask me i wouldn't have done it emmanuel that is allowed no problem all right so the hackathon on you know event page is datastaxastra.hackerearth.com from there you will land on this landing page and here's where you get like the little overview of what it is that we're trying to achieve but on the left you guys can see uh sorry everybody not guys everybody can see a list of navigation options you can see an overview what the theme is what the prizes are the rules the teams faq submission guidelines starter kit everything is in there for you you can even ask direct questions i am monitoring that in the discussion area as well but you can also be on discord or here on youtube with us and we'd be more than happy to help you here as well however um the whole point of everything is we want to keep everything together but if anything is not clear on the web page please please reach to us in terms of uh rules uh the the the theme the prizing all of that you can find all of that information on the actual website so just in case you forgot it please go there and you can find anything that you need cool okay all right now the next question was actually really interesting and i have no way how to answer how can i connect astra to django back-end framework um could you guys help this person out so yes the answer is yes because on uh datastax.com dev there are some resource to implement some some some scenario how to build x y and z and there is actually a scenario how to build a jungle back end on top of cassandra it's written it's there do you remember where it is cedric uh try uh try it out let's say on top on top on the very top ah yeah very part of this page there's something called try it out yes and i think over there below just below not this guy but just below because somehow language here you go yeah and see the the last okay creates a python driver and i think if you go to start coding python driver after that you do have a you do have a jungle but you know what keep going with another question i will give you the link to the okay yeah and then we'll we'll drop it in directly okay excellent so we got you covered sir or okay i didn't know who answered i thought it was part anyway it doesn't matter the weird developer love the name by the way let's just be be upfront about that that's probably the coolest hacker name i've seen so far so that's awesome um are there any open positions at data stacks absolutely we are hiring um please contact us outside of this event because it has nothing to do with the hackathon therefore it is not relevant for us right now please just contact us but yes we are definitely hiring 100 yeah if you go to the explorer roles i just drop these links the careers page um into both chats if you go to explore roles you will see what's there and we are mostly a remote company right that's not like that 100 of the cases but it will list if it's remote or not right so yeah take a look see what's available exactly and if you have any questions you can always reach out to us we are open for chats anytime so the list of prizes um as i mentioned we just showed that it's on the actual page of the hackathon the link is in the chat um cedric had a funny little um conversation like what is a key space just because cedric is the only one who said it and there was no upvoting i'm going to ignore that okay i mean it just didn't mean between us exactly and um so the next question is like can you give me some examples of cloud native so on the actual hackathon website right you have the astra starter kit section and in the astra starter kit thank you the third one from the bottom on the left there's actually two links in there one is directly to our examples and one is to our sample apps documentation in there you could find some really good and proper examples of what is cloud native and how can you use it to your advantage the other aspect or the other option that you can do is our developer advocates they do these workshops all the time like almost one a week or two a week sometimes and they provide github code and they provide you with potential options to play with and they guide you through the steps of how to use cloud native deployments so if you want to look at anything specifically i recommend going through our examples and to the developer advocate github right there the datastax academy github it's excellent definitely the place you want to be yeah i'm dropping those links as well and if you take a look here in the data sects academy org you'll see a whole set of these workshops that we've created in the past i think some good examples are probably what you're looking for and cedric you can obviously jump in here like the crud with python and node the spring data cassandra spring reactive right you'll see all these examples of cloud native apps and if you haven't been to one of our workshops before all of these are designed to be self-service right so if you were to click on one of these and and take a look at it um you'll see that all the instructions you need to run and go and stuff are here most of them use gitpod if you're not familiar with that it is a cloud-based online ide that will just spawn right out of the github repository and just launch everything you need to get going and such um so sean said yeah totally totally take a look oh spring boot to do is another one right um so there's a whole set of items that are in there but i i would say start with the examples first honestly um the ones that sean was talking about that's a really good place to start um quick uh quick answer to the question necessary to develop a mobile-based app could it be a cloud web-based application not necessary to be mobile it could be anything you want just make sure you use astra like i know we we keep beating that dead horse but that's literally the only requirement everything else completely open innovation how do you get in touch with datastax engineers i.e who the people who are building the platform um so we've mentioned discord a couple of times that is the best place to get in touch with our developer advocates but if you actually want to get in touch with our engineers they don't really have a way to directly connect to them the best way is to go through the data staff community so community.datastax.com and ask your question there and that's where basically our our engineers our developers our advocates just everybody who has anything to do with with data stacks they kind of all alert there and everybody will be able to help you out so community.datasax.com is the best location yeah definitely try to use the tags when you go to community you'll find like let's say that you're you're doing something with a graph database or let's say you're doing something specifically with like schema and cassandra or whatever you'll find that there are tags there tag tag what you're posting the reason why is because there are various engineers from the various teams that are watching some of those specific tags right so if you if you kick off something that is relevant to what you're looking for then they'll probably get it real quickly um but on top of that too community it's not just data sex folks it is folks from outside of the community as well or as part of the cassandra community it's kind of like stack overflow for um for cassandra if you will so definitely the place to go is community yes cool can you help explain how datasets astra connects to the front end like a react type app yeah totally i'll i'll grab this one i think cedric will have something to say about it as well um the document api is perfect for this right or the rest api or graphql right in all those cases you don't really you know from a front-end dev standpoint where you aren't usually working with the back-end apis to interact with your database right you may not be working with the database drivers or whatever but in those cases you could absolutely use something like react and such with the document api um and rest api or any of those really because you don't need the driver you can just hook right into the apis and again if you're in astra itself that's what i was showing before when you go to this connect tab for your database you'll have these here now something i want to plug is in a couple weeks we're actually doing one of our workshops on the repo the battle stacks uh repo which um you have battle stacks one this is a react redux app that was built specifically to use the document api in astra and it really explores it's actually it goes one further it's a jam stack app that you can deploy with netlify and has full um you know testing and everything like that and cicd pipeline built into github actions it's really cool actually um so so to answer the question um you know it's i would suggest for you if you're doing front end work to use graphql rest or document api that is going to be a direct line right into the database probably the easiest one for you is the document api just start there and go right but yeah take a look at battlestacks and go if you're interested take a look at the workshop we're gonna do in a couple weeks we're gonna do that very thing all right so let me um answer two things really quickly so we can knock those off since we're running out of time rohan um that's fine society impactful is just fine we appreciate that it is not going to affect you in any way shape or form to be negatively evaluated and you don't have to switch if you already have um all your stuff that you're working on really don't have to do any of that so done luigi would you recommend ashes for low latency application absolutely yeah it's cassandra it's cassandra we're you know we're again talking um single digitally 10 you know tens of millies response times and reads and stuff and the same thing you'd come to expect from cassandra totally yeah and then um so rob um quickly even if you're using localhost to connect um that's okay because we're not asking you to show us a live deployment we're asking you to show us what did you build how does it work and how does it use astra right so if you regardless of where you connect from it's perfectly fine as long as you can showcase how you leveraged astra in your submission um one one that i just want to answer real quick here uh this where to copy the secure connect bundle for java project so when you are in astra and again go to the connect tab you'll find everything you need to connect to the database will be in that connect tab if i go to i'm using java boom here's your bundle right so that that's it right there you can just go ahead and pull that down and include that as part of your java project and you follow the instructions it's really simple to use the driver is already aware of the secure connect bundle you just point it to it pass in your username and password and you're good to go with a secure connection uh and that means you do not have to implement ssl and stuff on your own in java which is terrible exactly to have to do on your own we do it for you exactly all right ladies and gentlemen we have surpassed our time for today um we'd like to thank you for being here today and we'd also like to just reiterate that we are not going to leave you alone just because our time is up for this q a does not mean that you guys can't keep asking us stuff please join our discord if you want to be in direct connection to us look at community.datastax.com if you want to ask us questions um that you know are not pressing for time and um you can continue using the discussion section of the astra hackathon for any and all questions and we will respond as soon as possible so thank you everybody thank you david thank you cedric for your time we really appreciate it thank you for everybody who was in the chat helping us out there and alex our savior with the sound um thank you especially yeah thank you alex helping us resolve this issue um jack could you please share the discord link once more with our group in the chat there we go and we're going to say thank you good evening good afternoon and good night and we'll speak to you all soon excellent thanks sean bye see you and as always don't forget to click that
