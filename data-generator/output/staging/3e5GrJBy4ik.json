  "description": "Jeff and Tim talk about the most common questions developers have about Kafka and three great ways to combine Kafka with Cassandra in your applications.\n\nJoin us at DataStax Accelerate learn how Apache Cassandra and DataStax can help you succeed to building large scale applications. For tickets go to datastax.com/accelerate and use discount code ADVOCATE20. \n\n0:30 - debating the great innovations of human history\n1:38 - questions developers ask Tim about Kafka: there are lots of specific questions about tuning producer/consumer throughput, but also further up the stack in terms of stream processing APIs and bridging synchronous and asynchronous interactions\n4:17 - Jeff's first fail with Kafka - publishing just a value to a topic configured as a key-value topic.\n5:50 - Best practices for working with microservices - having services communicate through durable logs of immutable events is a great pattern. When these services also expose synchronous APIs, they often need to query for other data. Logs like Kafka don't do well with complex queries like full text search, geospatial, etc, and that's where incorporating Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise makes sense..\n8:31 - Pattern 1 for combining Kafka and Cassandra: a service consumes events from a stream, performs computation, and produces new events. Service may provide API and need to grab data from Cassandra.\n9:33 - Pattern 2: Cassandra-centric view - use Kafka as a pipe for data ingest into Cassandra. This is great when you want to leveraging Cassandra's multi-DC replication \n10:29 - Pattern 3: Cassandra into Kafka. Possible to do change data capture (CDC) from Cassandra and other databases via connectors plugged into Kafka connect\n11:32 - Wrapping up - the challenges of finding time to code when leading DevRel teams, having outside interests and hobbies.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and de",

day yes in writing it's clear spoken nobody knows from day snack this is the distributed data show distributed data days right right yeah data stream con there's a stream it all kind of runs together but you actually you are talking with Patrick today I am about Kafka let's go standard which actually it's not your t-shirt does not have the talk outline on it is not because I hope you're right Weil Kafka like the three primary enabling innovations in behind human industry I should there should be Cassander on there a fair point fair point DFC or something yeah where I was I was making a pitch for Java but you were buying it's more implied by fire right yeah so I've been trying to get you on for you know a long time thank you for returning the favor I came on your dumb robot radio yes yeah last year is so you owed me I did essentially yeah yeah now and I we're paying back into action I'll get you on streaming audio to that's the popular podcast but anyway we can do this there's possibilities absolutely so but actually what the the subject at hand here we're in the middle of a series on application development yes so we get a lot of questions from developers how do you use this technology like it's great to play around with but okay let's get real I'm gonna use this to build my real actual application yeah if you write a computer program and it's funny because we you come up events like this and people kind of pull you aside yeah I have a problem right so these things tend to happen right so you like have a big history obviously with Cassandra in your past but your we're gonna copy these days confluent so what are what are some of those questions can you share a little bit like what are some of the questions that people ask you about Kafka and AB dub with cocktail yeah so that gets into there's sort of two levels right you can build things with Kafka with the the primitive producer/consumer epi yep you know I want to put things in and I want to get things out and people who are building systems at that level usually have very specific questions like you know hey I'm trying to tune my producing crew put and there's this setting yeah this buffer pool and I'm like yeah there is and I mean that's I'm not one who has that stuff that kind of stuff on the top of my head but okay if you're coding at that level and building an app at that level you're thinking very specific very low-level things and those are usually the questions and also I'll say you are probably operating at the wrong level of abstraction for most things it's not like it's wrong to use those api's but for most application development you probably want to go up the stack a little bit and not think so much about a message goes in and the message comes out but you want to think about stream processing and higher level api is like kafka streams or k sequel or things like that where you're dealing with streams as abstractions okay and then the questions become things like okay I've kind of gotten on board the Kafka train and I'm thinking of this asynchronous reactive world of micro services and micro service gets an input and produces a message to a topic and other micro services consumed messages in that topic and like everybody gets that but the questions there tend to come along the lines of find a sink is great and I'm on board but there's still this synchronous world out there right people ask questions and expect answers and how do i bridge way yeah yeah like where does this impedance mismatch right so apart from specific details of API questions the I think the biggest one people who are you know quote-unquote doing it right yeah are thinking about how to bridge the a sink and sink worlds okay cool yeah yeah so like I haven't graduated that next level yet I've kind of bump it up to that next little abstraction working with the streams I met the I've been actually integrating cop getting into the killer video reference app accidentally look lovely some killer video I've made it is publishing events when things happen like a video is added to the system something so like one fun thing that I had are my first error my first fail with Kafka is I just remember any first mistake you make okay so I'm publishing and I'm looking in the log and I see that I'm getting corrupted message exception that's the message okay what I figured out was I thought you're gonna ask me why I was gonna say this is exactly the kind of do you know that's why I'm gonna tell me no this is like the conference question I hate because like Google that I would like here you to tell me my problem I can and its interpretation exactly yeah from just the name of the exception but what what was it okay so what it turned out to be is that I had borrowed some code that Cedric another advocate my advocate in France had sent to me about hey I've already started playing around with this here's the there's a very nice little docker container that was set up very nice parameters when you crank up the docker container you can tell it to create topics just in the syntax of what you send in so we were creating it we created the topic as a key value style and I was sending just a blob of just a value object and it was like I don't want to do with this because there's no key corrupt object exception corrupt Wow okay you should add that to the FAQ there you go yes that's a tad Julius the larger FAQ known as Google yeah Wow I mean come on cutting and pasting from Stack Overflow that's what we do so what are the so we talked about some of the things that you encounter that comes from the questions G is are there some best practices that you find yourself giving again and again like this is just the recipe of how to do things right yeah yeah and that is that second case I referred to the person who's on board with the reactive micro services on top of Copco world yeah that's kind of the architectural world view that we put forth ok so that's yeah that's kind of given microservices and that's a big given because yes sometimes that's the wrong thing to do but if that's what you're doing then having those communicate through durable logs of the mutable events right is the right thing to do which so that's not as a basic pattern is a thing I advocate a lot right then you get in those services you have to start to think like ok how am i accessing data really you know because the service can consume validated orders or shipped orders or you know whatever however it's making up things these would be events that a service could consume and that service could do whatever kind of computation it needs and produce other events and bla bla bla but often those services have to expose api's to the world right yeah like there's some webpage that needs to do search or needs product recommendations there ok so like a restful api so what if that service you see here whatever I yeah where you have to go so you know it's also consuming streams it's consuming streams that's what the service does yeah consumes messages does computation produces new streams and so all of these these services are living yeah on top of topics but they have to they have to expose api's - yeah and those api's often require lookups of things and logs are famously unpleasant to query i got yes so you end up putting basically like databases into those services yep that's which is where the synergy and patrick we're not going to be talking about this as i see this energy you need to do interesting things like full-text search graph analysis key look ups at scale and that's where you want to put a cassandra into a service and often people think of Cassandras as as bigger than a service and that's that's totally cool but yeah when you're exposing an API that requires that kind of analysis Kafka does not do it right there isn't that sophisticated stuff like you see a DSC like like search a graph and say right so you need the combination of the two okay if those are things your triangle okay so this is you actually anticipated the next question that I kind of wanted to dive into you which is fine by the way it's fine though there's obviously some different patterns of how you see popke and Cassandra being used together yeah yeah so that's one in a micro service where we're kind of is that when you call that a joint or like you're pulling data from a stream and querying into Cassandra and then producing results so the way I look at it is you've got this that's one pattern this stream of events yeah this so this will kind of be this is my mind my horse so as the pattern I've got yeah service you're gonna ride it right okay service consuming events from the stream okay doing computation producing new events okay and that service you know produces events doesn't care who reads them other services are gonna grow up around that whatever you know just let people consume that but for that service to expose and and and many services aren't just streaming stream out right there streaming stream out and API yes so in that case you know you need things like the Sandra in there to do that right that's okay okay got it although I guess one other pattern yeah if you take a Cassandra centric view right like it's the system of record and services are querying tables and creating events and tables or rows and tables right and integrating through Cassandra then a pattern would be ingest into Cassandra so kind of Kafka as pipe that's right yeah so that was one of the one of the ones that came to mind first you went right from probably the most interesting and maybe the most complex one first yes I've also heard kind of these arguments about okay I just wanna and maybe they're more simplistic there's definitely a use case for them but I want to put Kafka in front of Cassandra like I'm ingesting I have lots of stuff streaming in through Kafka and then I would just want to I want to persist in datastore behind it I'm gonna throw it into Cassandra and like multi DC is important Cassandra is amazing at that so right Cassandra's kind of the center of life in the system and so Kafka is piped into Cassandra's totally totally legit and what about the other way Cassandra into Kafka yes yeah so do you hear I wonder how the self often this comes up and practice the like I want to use copy as change data capture or something like that or like with Cassandra so like I will do this let's do I'm so doable so I mean you could use Kafka for change d to capture on any database okay I might have to write the connector you know the usual suspects exist right and I'm referring to Kafka connect as the basic platform yeah a ecosystem of connectors so yeah you get one percent do that you might have to write something but okay that's very doable so that would begin be like I have this Cassandra centric system and I've got this reason to have data in Kafka as a system of record and integrating those systems is CDC from Cassandra into Kaufman Toby Kafka Kafka after Cassandra there's Kafka before Cassandra cough that come after curse net Cassandra and then Cassandra powering interesting queries on top of the reactive microserver yes yeah okay I wonder how much of the second builds in my own application possibilities are in killer video and kind of yeah I should do them all given infinite time I think oh yeah that's the fun the fun part right awesome pizza beach blue jeans calls and email either right cool that's right actually yet so yeah when do you code like if you I know that you're on the road a lot you travel right after you a terribly embarrassing question so these days not a whole lot yeah on the road as much as I can be you know running the the dev rel team at confluent that doesn't leave a lot of time there's a lot of meetings in there and when I get to get out I get out I was hoping to get a little bit of a strategy from you for that yeah actually I we were traveling most of the last fall and really didn't do hardly any coding and then I was I had a solid month where I didn't travel at all December mid-december to mid-january yeah I wrote more code in that month it's great so last five years not doing anything in my other hobbies yes the key and yet making that your hobby then you can do it we don't have any other hobbies or any other that's right as in life that you contribute to and you probably put a lot yeah yeah probably and probably if I had any other side podcast or whatever or flying drones around then I probably wouldn't have been able to code there is that's my that's my problem but you know it more power to Ebro thanks man all right thanks for coming on you bet thanks everybody",
