hours workshop full of enzyme where we will explain you how to build the spring pet clinic sample application using well spring and apache casona so before even starting can you put on that if you hear us properly please oh a word just to see if you sound good on the chat sure hello everybody welcome welcome this is my first workshop at datastax with the datastax developers and so amazing to be with cedric so thank you and i'm excited so yeah okay all right so a good check is okay let's move on we do have a lot of stuff to cover so i'm cedric linven and i'm leading the developer advocacy team at data stacks i'm doing mostly cassandra java in spring what a coincidence pretty good for today you've saw me a lot of time on this channel but you know today with me for the very first time mary's with us so can you introduce sure so uh my name is mary griglovsky i am as you can see over here i'm primarily a java person but i also do other languages too so i'm also the java champion and also chicago java users group president and i do pulsar right now streaming at the data stacks so really excited to be joining data stacks and the team and it's just the energy it's just what really i love it love it here so really an honor for me to be here thank you again um so this is a very quick intro about myself so yeah this is great speaking of the team you know as always it's not only two people on screen two moving ads we do have a full team helping building the content uh testing all the end zone for you to succeed so here is a team on screens distributed ask us across the world and today in the chat you will find uh stefano helping okay but we will also keep an eye on the chat uh to help you if you get any trouble speaking of which a little bit of our youtube and twitch we monitor the chat on youtube mostly inspiring the question live you can also ask your question on discord on the channel workshop chat and it's pretty convenient because when the stream which is recorded on youtube and will be available at same link when this stream ends you can still ask us questions in discord using workshop chat so please go there uh subscribe also we do have some micro in the youtube chat using something called nightbot so by using a clanmation mark and the code you will like you will get access to a link so first two links for you to know exclamation mark discord to get the discord registration link and exclamation mark mentee to go to mentee.com and play games with us it will be an interactive session just not a webinar you will do the exercise we will ask you question we will play a game and if you want for fast you will get some swag in the end full of hands on you will have to work but you don't have to install anything you know for the experience to be as most as possible everything is web-based uh the database will be software as a service the id development environment will be gitbod which is vs code in the cloud with all the plugin you need everything will be installed for you those tools are free so even if the workshop is ending or you are watching a recording right recording right now you can still use it if you cannot use the the macro all the links are also in the description on the video all right if you complete the end zone do the exercises with us even if it's after the session and probably will be after the session because we will need to move fast to stay in the two hours uh you can upload the working app uh on a form answering a few questions and you will get redeem this nice badge so we are doing a workshop for two years multiple hundreds of workshops happening now uh and covering a wide range of topics so here is a subset i think now we do have 23 different badges and today it will be a reactive spring workshop so working with java spring and we will build the schedule apartment application which is pet clinic okay i told you we will play some games and we will ask you questions so you know what without uh waiting more time we can you know start immediately and see if these things working and i will ask you a few a super easy question not tricky just to know you a little bit so now open a new tab in your browser go to mentee.com enter the screen that you can see uh on screen you can also see the code that is now shown on the youtube chat challenge just to know you a bit more and at any time i mean see if you miss the code that i'm showing right now or my head is just in front of the code that go to mnt.com and use the code here is a code okay i can even you know copy that code in the youtube chat for everybody to copy paste it because why not here is a code so i see almost 100 people in the youtube live and only 30 uh putting some hearts in uh mentee so i could wait uh just one more minute but because there is no challenge i will keep moving we need to keep this live uh with full of energy that's right look at that so i see 50 people now so yeah yeah people keep coming keep cooking soon we will have the co-om the majority so we can proceed keep keep moving keep moving okay anyway you can you can catch up as as as i told you really no uh no stress you know the question are really uh just to know you a little bit more so welcome to this spring pet clinic workshop and my first question for you is simply where are you from so pick your location in the in the pictures i show you just to see where are you coming from uh who are on youtube late who wake up early in the morning to be with us we try to spot a time frame where you can have as many people as possible and look at look at this map you know we do have people from america up to asia look at how we are distributed isn't that cool that is so amazing so amazing i love it yeah and as you can see india is uh always super active uh super involved with our ascension conversations so thank you for that i know it might be a bit late so uh yeah we will try to stay in the two hours just a little bit more eventually but yeah i know it's late for you so again thank you for joining all right my second question for you is how much experience do you have with spring framework because it will be a spring session you don't need to be an expert but if you never never heard about it we should say a word about it so spring framework is uh i would say the most in use java framework out there right now and you can use you can use it for a lot of things um we will show you but today we will use it as the runtime and also the the multiple components that work together yeah not too much spoiler you will you will get it so another concept already using using regularly even if you use it regularly i hope you will learn something today so the second part will be uh apache cassandra so how much experience do you have with apache the application we develop or we will show you is an existing application for ages in the spring world but it was designed for a relational database like oracle postgre my sequel and we change it to reflect the cassandra okay so uh not a lot know about cassandra okay you in the good place okay this youtube channel is all dedicated to share our love on the cassandra no secret databases so of course i do have a couple of slides to explain you why you should consider to use it okay right keep moving uh this is my last question so i told you uh in two years with workshop every single weeks sometimes multiple uh time a week uh so yeah we we could have some returning people if it if it's the first time welcome welcome welcome hope you will enjoy the experience the renter the interactivity my stupid accent and the energy and keep coming back every weeks all right okay so a lot of newcomers so yeah take a seat relax enjoy and uh yeah you will learn a lot that's my promise for you today okay keep this tab open we will reuse this tab later when we will play a game all together this is where you can win some swag box if you wants were fast but for now go back to the slide and keep moving we are in for 10 minutes perfect timing to start working right all right so that's the agenda for today a little some word about the pet clinic application itself then how to build the application layer after layer starting by the database up to the user interface okay so databases connect to the databases how to implement a service on top of the data service using some reactive technology spring mic flux with the reactive apis if you wish creating some aps as reactive and then the game all right let's get rolling okay so the pet clinic is the reference applica sample application in the spring world its reference has this name stated a pet clinic so you will have veteran veterinarian owners of pets pets and you will take some appointments for the pets so here you got the link of the official project yeah there for 15 years but was only working with sequel to to make this community bigger uh some people created the pet clinic community and now you have multiple implementation of the same application pet clinic some angular some react and multiple back ends so back end using the the the standard spring air rest or using spring reactive like today using a relational database using others form of database it's like hey i want to show you my technology with always the same sample but of course you want to know what it look like so i will show you a demo you can also go to the demo it's available it's a live demo you got the live demo link in the youtube description i think i put that as the first link but here i will use my uh i will use my home over here so that's uh the the home page so what you can see here is a list of uh veterinarian over here you can edit you can deal it here you can define the type of of pets so here i don't know if you want to adopt a giraffe you can add here a giraffe it will show up and you can also see the different owners and get the information regarding the owners you can add a new pet it's you know create read update delete application and uh of course this app will run in your laptop before the end of these two hours that's my promise for you my second one first you will learn a lot second you will have that running on your machine in two hours okay so this is exactly what what we will do i think just uh you can play by yourself and see how it works okay all right so this is what we want to do how do we do well if you ask someone uh what your application look like the architecture diagram could be this one we where you show multiple layers the data layer database application to your layer or backend where you expose the backend services when you do a full stack application in the javascript or frontend world you think about two modules the back end and the front end so as of today the front end will be angular and the back end will be spring spring boot and everything that i show okay nothing to install so the database will be cassandra in the cloud using a service called astradb and both the backend then the front-end will run in your cloud-based ide which is called gitpod and my demo i just saw you was running in gitpod okay i told you we will start with the data and move one layer after the others to be able to build that application or run that application so first apache cassandra in a nutshell so apache cassandra has been created in 208 by 2 a facebook engineer it's a no sequel distributed database you can install that product on a single machine on the single uh no a single machine single server this is what we call a node and you can expect about two to four terabytes per installation and thousands of transactions per second okay and per thread but it's distributed database so you want to install cassandra on multiple machines multiple nodes in this architecture there is no master or not communicate to each other using a peer-to-peer algorithm which is called the gossipping those nodes are grouped logically in something called a data center or a ring so sometimes i will talk about the ring sometimes i will talk about the data center okay so if the both are exactly the same i prefer use the term ring sometimes if you talk too much about data centers people can get confused and think about the infrastructures uh building okay so let's talk about the ring so multiple nodes organizer the ring no master created by facebook and using by the biggest company in the world so uh here you go the link cassandra netflix i mean this video you should have a look there that's the tech lead from netflix coming here on this channel explaining like 98 of the streaming data at netflix our store in cassandra isn't that cool and they gave you a an idea of the size of their rings look at that they do have so 160 000 installation 160 000 nodes at april and apple is not even the biggest user of cassandra they are even biggest user in asia but you know you can think about the big names but you know they do not want really us to disclose the size okay uh millions of operations per second so very very performant okay so you you you can really scale as much as you want the scalability is linear if you need more capacity more throughput simply add new nodes and here some big cool terms so big data ready read and write super fast linear scalability high availability self-feeling and vendor and deponent okay so quickly it's an apache project so there is no risk for the license to change you know lately some databases decided to change the license to protect themselves again the cloud providers you know uh i can understand that the castle will not change and uh so it's apache and will stay apache you know pretty cool vendor independent um each cassandra node is uh is performant and in is the same as the others because there is no master you can lose any of the node it's not a big deal the data is distributed across all the nodes but is also replicated the same data is available on multiple node so if one node goes down another big deal the data is still somewhere else you can have your cassandra cluster so this time i talk about cluster with multiple rings isn't that cool so you have installed multiple server as a ring on a in a region and you can install multiple rings across the world and when you read or write from from somewhere the data will be replicated on the other rings by cassandra itself there is nothing to uh to build no batch it's uh done by the the by cassandra itself you need to have uh the network open okay but it's not master slave again all the here called dc data center or rings are active so you can read and write from from from everywhere and it's working it's self-feeling i can move uh quickly just uh appreciate all together the the the diff uh you know all my childhood so now you know i'm old um yeah but so you can lose any of the big any of the node any of the machine and because the data is replicated um you will still get access to your data and if the node goes back online uh the remaining node will stream the guy what he can have missed has data for him to capture so he's self-healing okay van der looking is also platform as new aznostic you can install that uh wherever you like okay it's it's open source right and you could have one ring in each cloud provider if you wish just i mean just open the the network and you can have the same data layer across multiple platforms right technically it's completely possible okay uh so hope you uh enjoy or get this first grasp of what is uh cassandra why it's cool and now it will be your turn to start a three node rig uh i told you i do not want you to install anything so we will use the software as a service okay so the the tool is called astra astra db for the database part of astra and as you can see it's free to use no credit card and you can go up to multiple million read and write per month and you will not get charged anything so it will be free for you today it could be free for you as long as you do not reach a threshold and then you become a paid customer and of course to pay for the capacity you get charged but it could be used for super right of huge case if you are a student if you want to test stuff if you want these for a test environment integration environment that's pretty cool to use okay okay and i saw that namtram already used the micro exclamation mark astra to get uh the link to go to astra uh or here you you see also exclamation mark github okay so what it's cool with this uh framework of workshop to be honest let me close that and delete these i don't need anymore it was my demo close close or close so here is the git github in github you find all the source code needed okay here you got all the source code front and back end and you get a readme over here where all the instructions are written step by step i will be lazy in front of you i will follow those steps and you can do the same at home on your own pace if eventually i'm moving too fast and here it is so what you what we want the objective frequent at frequent ask question material for the session the slide i'm using is also there as a pdf the session is recorded will be available for you afterward exactly at the same link you can right away bookmark what you are looking right now it will be the same tomorrow okay you just tomorrow you will be able to move faster to my dad jokes okay so here is the discord chat question and so so uh first how to create an account to astra okay so you click the button and you will go you will be rooted here astra login page and there you sign up you authenticate with your uh what you like github account google account i will use my google account and i will connect to this solution if you want to have a look at the documentation here please go how to create a strikeout here you will see uh uh you know if you do like me uh it's cool as well to to put it small here you do have all the step by step including some uh pictures screenshot and where to click each time so if you get lost the documentation it's pretty helpful with a lot of illustration for you not to get stuck so i login and now i want to create a database look i already have two databases i would like to create a new one okay so here we go and so the database name we want you to choose would be workshops okay and the key space names spring pet clinic okay for the database name to be honest uh you can use whatever you like but it's better to use those settings because later we have some scripts running and they expect those settings i already have a database called workshops so maybe i will call it workshops too okay but because i already have one called workshop so then ask a region so the idea would be to pick a region which is the closest to you to reduce the latencies but there is no difference okay it's it's all free they all are free so you know pick the one you like and when you're done just click create the database so the database will take a few minutes to start so here you can see that the status is pending okay and why because this software as a service solution will create you a ring of three cassandra nodes not not just an installation to get the benefits of the distributed cassandra thing right so it's pending and i will letting pending okay that's totally cool and during the time it's pending i can move to step number five uh and do it at the same time so when we will do the end zone here we need to use user and password to connect your database right so no surprise uh so to have your users and password you need to create something called a token so to create a token here you do have the documentation you can click and i also put here a nice gif with the walkthrough so what you want to do here is going to organization settings token management let's make it a little bit bigger then pick a roll um it's a demo but you know pick database administrator you won't get any trouble because this guy will have all the the permission quite a lot of permissions but you know if you use it later in production or anything pick a role that does have the privilege only to do what you want you to do so like only using the apis or only using the data eventually so here i put database administrator and i click generate token so in the token you will find three fields client id is kind of your username client secret your password and token is something that we can use could use a little bit everywhere as uh api keys and also could use as a password so this one is quite important to save so here i will download my token details uh somewhere where i can find it so here it is and uh i will keep it here because i i really need it later okay this token is not at the database level it's at uh your organization you know the the tenant where you live in astra so with the same token you can connect to multiple databases okay so what i can do is uh moving back to the home screen and you know i keep this guy open just a tab there eventually when i need it okay and here i'm going back to the home screen by clicking on the data stacks astra logo okay and here look i'm coming back and now my database is active and i can use it as i like you can use it as you like and you know i could wait for you a bit when you are set up please give me a thumb up in the youtube chat and we know we can move on and show you a bit more slide now the database is running we need to create some table is there in there i've also i see in the youtube chat a question regarding the the region so when you create a database let's say you do have 10 regions uh available to you for free uh but as high is available in i don't know multiple dozens of region so if really you want a region that's close to you it's out of the free plan so and this is why you get the update button but you know today pick one of the ten available to you okay michelle kennedy congratulations yeah you keep it up good work you wrote guys so guys and ladies and look at that it's half an hour 30 minutes in and we already have a database cassandra running so let's discuss what we want to put there okay right shalia as well okay the token step yeah sure uh for sure so it's a step five in the instruction and what you need to do is go to organization settings over here you will be rooted to dedicate things dedicated screen for organization settings there you will be you will pick token management because we want to create a token select the role database administrator see this is the one provided to you here in in the readme a token and now i do have a new token so here it is please download the token details you really need this token especially okay if you want to copy in the clipboard right away you can do it you know click it now it will be useful uh in the next step okay and when you're done you come back to the home page by clicking the astrology okay i think i can keep moving with my slides and in the meantime you can you know wait for the database to switch to active mode or you know create a token at your own pace or even start navigating and clicking everywhere if you like me the kind of people that like to touch things to learn how to use it okay uh so let's talk about the the the tables okay if you have used relational database before you know that what you tend to do is start with the data you define your entities and then you define some relationships one too many many too many creating some integrity constraints the idea is to have the same data available only once at single place and let the application build the proper queries sql queries using some joints if they want if they need to have joints yeah this is how it works so dbas are king and now you as a application developer you have to figure it out how to build the proper sql queries to make things works well in cassandra you will see it's different now is important in cassandra you will find some tables okay it's no sequel but it's not like mongodb which is document oriented it's not like radius which is key value it's like a little bit like dynamodb if you want or hatchbase it's a family of nosql database as a whole where you will find tables in these tables you will find a primary key you should be familiar with the primary key this is the way to ensure the unicity of a record but there is something else something maybe even more important in the casanova world it's called the partition key the partition key could be the wall primary key or just could be a part of the primary key so because it's a part of the primary key it's not enough to ensure unicity so why would you use that well here you do have a table with let's say 10 records if i ask cassandra to save that this is what will happen the record will be saved on the node based on the value in red a single node is not in charge of a single value in red okay for instance here on the bottom left-hand corner cinder sydney and mumbai are in the same node that mean this node is both in charge of a u and i n how does it work well when you create a table the primary key will get hashed so we you will have a function that will transform the value and get you an integer and you can imagine that every node is in charge of the value of integer like that the values are evenly distributed among nodes so that's pretty good right but and this is a but and you know even if you have never seen cassandra before you can realize that if now i do select star from my table retrieve everything it will work but will it take so much time because i need to ask every single note to get a part of my response so you want to avoid that you want to execute a query where in the where clause in the filter you always provide the value in red if you do that all the data you will retrieve are on the same node so there is no communication it will be as fast as possible long story short with cassandra you will create tables based on your request based on your queries you need to know what will be your requests and queries to build the proper data model and not the other way around this is here right what we put on the reverse order you need to know what the application is doing to get the model and see which other request or query is needed and late and at the end you get your data model it seems tricky you know it's it's it's not it's really not really just a different way of of thinking and let's apply this to our pet clinic let's see how it works because you know what pet clinic or existing existed before we decided to move it to cassandra and it was a relational database model with some many too many and one too many entities and i just told you in cassandra well you do not want to do joints i mean you cannot do joints it will be slow you need to find another ways what is the other way well i will show you an example try to explain but also on this youtube channel you you can find courses called ds220 or academy.datasex.com find a full courses explaining you step by step or the other the methodology to build a proper customer data model and how to do it well there is a workflow with some simple rules when you know this workflow you can be quite uh you know it can be quite basic just apply the rules and get something that works okay so let's use this modalization the methodology on pet clinic okay we need the we need to look at the application so the first thing we do when you connect to the pet clinic is to list the owners okay so that's the query you want to execute so if i look at my rational data model if i isolate what i need it would be the owner i only need the honor table to show you owners okay no no rocket science here uh look at the primary key the primary key is an integer and it's uh fairly common in the relational world because with integer you can find something called oracle sequence or auto increment stuff that will keep updating and creating a new id for you and the database can can be sure that this id is unique but in cassandra each node is independent you do not want to rely on other nodes to get a unique identifier and if you would have used a sequence you would have to stop the world ask every node oh what is your last id to be able to get the new one and doing maximum is tricky you can run into race conditions to avoid that we are using called uuid unique identifier id so it's not only to cassandra you find that in in java of course and all the languages it's based on eurondom it's a low level function on your on your laptop and it will give you a random use uh uuid and i think there is more uuid that atoms in the universe or something like that so it's a way to get a unique id without uh introducing any dependencies between the nodes okay so the table for owner will be pet clinic owner this uuid is enough to ensure unicity so it's it's the primary key and it's good because it's unsure unicity so one done okay keep moving second would be get me all the pets for a user okay if i click a username i will get to this page on this page you see the owner information so get the owner information by the owner id we can do it with the previous table we design okay because we do have the id we can retrieve all the values for the owner the id for this one we are okay what about this one find all the pets for owner it's a one too many one owner multiple pets if i show you the rational diagram this is what it would like one pet multi one owner multiple pets one too many okay now is the time oh wow what do we do with cassandra because you don't have choice and here it is you save together what you want to retrieve together instead of doing the joints when you read you do the joints when you write it's called denormalization you may have encountered that before in uh business intelligence you know the the database that we use at the end of the day to create some analytics and some dashboards those are using data model called a snowflake or a data mart they are using the same logic de normalization having all the pets for owners in a single table okay and the if look at the name it's called pet by owner give me all the tap the pets for single owner so owner id is the partition key why do we do that we want to have all the pets for a single owner on the same node otherwise you know it will be slow so owner id will be our partition key and then to ensure the unicity we need a second row here pet id and the primary key will have both the owner id and the pet id the pet id is called a clustering column and it will be used to sort but cannot really sort a uuid right it will here be used only for unicity okay so with this you have a way to do some one too many but now you you may ask the question hey if i need the pets on multiple queries what do we do well you will duplicate the data and then something you're probably not familiar with in cassandra world we consider that the storage is cheap and you want to store multiple time the same data if it's needed in multiple queries that's the trade-off to be super fast even with petabytes of data okay that's the the kind of new things from the nosql we duplicate the data okay keep moving so owner we have seen that we do have an owner table with a uuid that you can imagine the same i have a vet table with the uuid one too many we do have uh here the owner one too many is here the owner of pet you also have one too many between pet and visit a pet can have multiple visits and so you will have the same if you if i show you the three first table pet honor pet by owner visit by pet exactly the same logic right now the big daddy many too many how do you do many too many now you're stuck right well what you do with many too many the the general convention let's say you do have a user table and group table so a user can be part of multiple group and of course a group will have multiple users many too many in that case you will have two tables the first table will be called user by group when you in when you query by group you get the list of user and the second will be a group by user you will query by user and you get the list of group and the same data is in both table even if the column are exactly the same and the data is exactly the same it's just that in one table the partition key is the user in one table the partition key is the group and that's the job of the application it's time to write in both table it seems a bit weird but you know it's quite it's not difficult you know you need to keep track each time i work with users this is the three table i need to update and you know that's really not not a big deal but then you can have super super fast queries here it seems to be many too many but when you look closer you realize that a vet could have multiple specialty but here specialty it just used to get uh the name you know here you got the id identifier and here you got the name so it's one two one and there is ways to under that faster and this is what it look like so you retrieve the entity vet here you got kind of one too many with vet by specialty but instead of using specialty by vet what you can do at cassandra level is have some attributes some colon be list set or maps and because specialty just a string look at that we decided not to create a new table but just have the specialty as a set of text so one too many can be done like that one too many could also be done with this this trick okay all right it was a a lot of uh a lot of theory i must confess i know but it's good to see the logic behind uh the transformation from a rationale to no sequel now guess what you will create those table in your database ready let's go for some enzo and now we will use the su tool that i told you in the beginning the cloud-based development environment called git pod i want to stay login okay all right so how to work with git pod so we are step number six that's so french right number six and so you will click six opening git board all right i recommend you to right click or second right click click just to open this guy in a new tab okay just to keep that open so when you first launch github is building the image yeah it seems like this is what it's doing right now so i will let this guy start okay so as you can see it's uh it's it's starting you will see it's vs code in the cloud so if you have used vs code before you will not get lost uh it's exactly the same so it's opening a few stuff there is a little bit of magic under the hood we have set up the environment to open just what you see the readme okay some terminal at the bottom and the explorer here where you can see the files so notice that here you have three terminals one terminal will be for the front end one terminal will be for the back end and in the bottom for the database you know the same layers as i presented to you before and look at that so here uh maybe i could make it a little bit bigger the terminal is asking you for your database token if when you will provide this token this is the way to make this environment connect to database to the database and be aware of the database you created in astra so let me copy a token on another screen and i will copy here okay so copies ctrl c ctrl v okay the first time you paste something in github you can have this window asking hey do you allow some pasting uh so please hello and as you can see here my token has been has been paced and now uh like you can use enter so can you use vs code well um to have this running on your laptop you need to have java maven and node because git board expecting you to have those so uh as long as you do have you have them it should work but it's not out of the box okay so it i would rather advise you to use a git pod for now and uh you know later try uh local installation and ask us if you find any issue we will told you what you need okay so i provided my token and the script was able to connect to my database he gave me back my database id i didn't told told it which database it was my region and my token and if i go to astra look find the database called workshops database called workshops id is 3ed blah blah blah and if you go here pet clinic is one of the key space and so this is what i asked as parameter please connect to the database called workshops and the key space called uh spring backlink here now you you have a terminal with cqlsh sql cql cassandra query language sh shell so all the command that you enter here will be directly applied in astra pretty cool right pretty cool okay so um [Music] we have initialized cqsh and uh what we can do here is describe key space so here to copy paste using github you see you do have an icon here so i click here and i paste and here i do have the list of key space living in my database i do have multiple key spaces because i've done multiple workshops uh but the one i want to use today is called spring pet clinic so i will use spring bed clinic okay and here it is i could clear and uh here now i'm using secret sh on pet clinic okay i can quit okay i can quit with the semicolon and come back using secure sh but you know i don't need to quit to get back immediately so i will i will stay here but you know i can quit and then go back using secure here i miss the semicolon maybe i should refresh it should be there right quit quit quit uh i know it's not there okay my bad you here you miss a semicolon okay so now if i go back to the second terminal code the back end you will see while i told you it's better to use gitpod there is a lot set up for you you do have java okay java 11 is there you do have maven even it's there you do have node okay even if it's here written 14 it has been updated now it's 16. and uh you also have the node package manager npm and here you got the 8.1.0 so a lot of things are available for you in this git porting i will we love to use it everything is there and not only you do have it but you also have python you have docker you have a lot of stuff ready to go in in git pod uh and you know to open a git pod is always gitbod.io slash hashtag and the url of your github repository pretty cool give it a try anyway for today it's super useful so here then we ask you to show the remote explorer so this is the the icon over here as of now not much to see right everything is down soon we will start the back end soon we will start the front end and you will have both green but for now that just has just our uh black um you know i will probably come back here and start the webpage from here instead of using some command line it's it's so convenient so you know even before starting it was good to show you that it's there and it's called remote explorer then okay six e validate your setup i will copy paste so you know the script in the beginning where you asked where you were asked to provide the token this script creating a file code dot off and in dot off you will find all the environment variables that you need to start to work with the application the token your client id your client secret your database id your database region and your key space oh database region it's true i have not told you about the database region in astra a database can have multiple regions so here for instance my database are true region each region is a different ring okay so the the pictures with a cluster and multiple rings i i had before this is the setup i do have right now on my database okay so i will inject those variable in my environment each time so this is why here you see set a source is to load all these uh variable as environment variables okay so here if i want to see if java can connect to if java can connect to the database i will copy that which is load all the environment variables in the environment load all these settings in environment variables and run java and i will show you a bit later how java load those values but let's see if it's working okay so the guy is trying to connect doing some logs it's starting a spring boot application will explain you soon what it is was able to find my database with the id and yeah was they able to connect so my key space is spent clinic thank you very much i was able to list the content of the table okay and uh doing uh this so cool okay all right so let's go back here we need those table you need those table okay those tables may not be created you need them how to do so here you do have the script call a ddl so domain definition language to create all the table i've shown you before okay so let me copy that block and paste here you see some drop so if the database existed before it will be deleted and recreated some can lead to timeout it could happen you know in between git board and astro sometimes but most of the times everything is okay and when the script is okay like me right now you can execute 7d describe the keys the tables and look at that my sixth table have been created cool how to insert some data use inserting two as you can see the cassandra query language is pretty close to sequel it's not exactly the same the types are not exactly the same here we were able to insert a list up front but for somebody who is familiar with rationale and sql it's not too difficult to get into into cassandra language right it's quite the same right okay and uh oh we created two stuff and if i want it if i want to see what's we created i can select from it work remember it's not the greatest to do select start from a table without the workflows because you need to use all the node to get the request but my database is empty right so it was so fast even doing what we call a full scan cluster okay it has been an hour now and we do have the uh the schema created believe me it was a big chunk of the app in cassandra as soon as you do have the data model right the rest is just music okay just just deliver because if you created your uh data model that means you already know all the queries you need to have and so your design is mostly done now it's just boilerplate and code building which is still my favorite part all right okay okay now we will start explaining why we are both java folks explaining new stuff today let's uh go back a bit to slides uh to discuss now the the back end okay we are done with the database uh maybe i could have some thumb up in the chat if you are still with me and uh if you uh were able to create your tables and if you yeah if everything was successful yeah tell me tell me we are good on time hey hey i have you know like the the sweat oops no response okay yeah yeah um you know you will have time to to to catch up and you know if if if uh you got some issues with the script at the beginning if that happened for some reason what's happening is there is a script called install securely sh that you could re-execute if something goes wrong okay um but you know beside this you should have one terminal with the database one terminal ready to execute back end one terminal ready to execute front end and with that moving back to you at the slide once you created the database we created a token and as soon as we add the token we open git pod and we execute the instruction step 6 and 7 to create the tables everything is in github and you can really do step by step copy pasting all the commands okay and uh yeah i think i will let stefano get this question and i keep moving so let's pretend your database is now created with the tables and a little bit of data you want to connect to database the way to connect to the database is always the same you need a driver if you are using a rational database you will use something called gdbc in java or odbc drivers okay um and here there is no difference you will use something called uh you will use something called uh drivers uh cassandra driver okay data stacks is famous to cre who have created those cassandra drivers that allow to do connectivity queries and passing the result for everything we do with cassandra okay to use the drivers to connect to astra db now instead of providing the ip of the nodes because it is a cassandra running in the cloud and only available for http through http you need some certificates keys and certificates to open a two-way tls connection and to get these all these certificates uh trustor search store uh you will download the zip from the astra user interface but guess what with the settings we have for you today and gitbod you don't have to do it but you know you to be aware when you are using astra go to astra go to the workshops and uh yes the script is explicitly picking workshops and creating it if not available so you can rerun the script and it will work there you do have a page called connect if you want to use java you will be invited to download the secure connect bundle as a zip fortunately for today the java code will do it for us so long story short astra is quite secure you will have a two-way tls collection open between you and astra but it's super and strongly secure with a certificate okay now if i put my if i put back my three layers frontend backend and data and in the backend i put both the apis which is the endpoint and the drivers which is how to connect the first things you need to know is to connect to cassandra you need is the you need uh you need an object called sql session okay so sql session is uh is a singleton so should be a single sql session in your application and it's stateful this guy will maintain the connection append to the database so make sure to close sql station when you close the application but as soon as the application is connected you do have access to security session okay now with sql section you will execute queries against the database or so called statements each time you execute a statement cassandra need to validate the syntax is it is the grammar is okay does the table exist do the colon exist and it could take sometimes all this preparation at startup of your application you can prepare your statement so you can make this validation once for good and each time you will invoke your uh queries you will not use simple statement you will always reuse prepare statement all the validation is done and you gain 20 percent of performance okay so now let's pretend my request is prepared i do have a prepare statement what do i do in the user interface i use the parameter that has been provided by the front end took my prepare statement took my parameters mixed them together this is called bind operation you get a bound statement you send about statement to the database and you get your result woohoo results you got a result you're happy right when you happy the what we could find annoying is all those operations are blocking during all the binding and executing and getting the result the thread was blocked just for that and it's so it's a back end but it's a rest api it's an http server with some limited thread allocated for you so it will be a constraint if you want to do multiple thousands of operation per second which is annoying because castandra can do thousands and thousands of operations per second if your api is a blocker because you do have the thread thread lock no good right so can we do better let's see so synchronous is good this is what we all use on day to day it's uh good enough for eighty percent of the use case okay it's simple to use easy to maintain okay so don't try to go something else if uh synchronous is enough for all your use cases right yeah keep it simple stupid still it's blocking and because it's blocking the scalability is not the greatest so you can think and you will think about asynchronous and you should think about asynchronous now so of course the drivers support asynchronous queries you will send the parameter bind send the bound statement band is pretty quick okay bine is ready uh take parameter one take paragraph two mix together and uh request something to kassara so maybe the the diagram should should be which is long is really focused on how to execute the query in that process in a synchronous instead of giving back the result it will immediately response a complicated stage a future okay so you in java you do have a future and so you will work with the callback when the operation will be ready you will get on complete and you will implement the own complete method and you will get this time a synchronous result set and from that you will get the result now it's not blocking anymore you need to realize is these notification this callback will be done for each page in cassandra all the requests are paged um you don't want to do select star from cassandra and get all the results in one go okay best case scenario you blow up your application because you get billions of record worst case scenario the cassandra nodes has less memory than you and this is cassandra notes that blow up out of memory because cassandra is also in java jvm so no all the cassandra queries are page 5000 is the threshold by default and you get a notification by paged so now with asynchronous you are happy because the calls are not blocking anymore and you can get some scalability and make the threads work split the thread for getting the http request from the thread that will execute queries on customers so yeah two thread pulls and you you can execute better still it's not a silver bullet now if you have multiple nested call one inside the others if the one that's the most nested call if something goes wrong what do we do with the previous code it's you know you have to think about some exception management in asynchronous this is believe me it's super tricky to do and uh this is not me inventing this term it's called the callback hell and you know for something i trust you what about the maintenance you will start to put some uh you know blocking point toggle point on your id but nothing is blocked because it's a synchronous so you still stuck yeah it's not easy to maintain so can we do better yes we can then uh it is why the uh this is why this workshop is called reactive in the first place so but you know before going into reactive and you know not too soon i will show you a little bit of these connectivity uh what about this sql session what about this execute statement okay all right so go back here go back here go to my back end make it maybe bigger for you to see what i'm doing showing the code okay so the first thing i can show you is how the parameters i've moved from the environment variables up to the the cassandra world so we are using the strength framework i told you a little bit about it in the beginning we will come back to it very soon so this spring framework have multiple component one component is called spring boot and spring boots expect all the variables to be in a single file called application.tml okay so spring will be there and you define some keys dedicated okay so here this is the port http port you want to listen and this is some spring data custom aesthetics okay we use a dedicated spring component that work with astra called a spring boot starter so something that will tell you uh spring that we tell spring how to connect west hot and you only need three parameters the token the database id and the region oh surprise this is exactly the environment variables that we do have and this is why the unit test was able to execute because we can load those parameters and make that available in java okay so now let's see oops i want to paste here i can also uh okay okay that's my dao maybe i want to show the test before test01 that we did in the first place okay what we did we ask the application give me a sequel session the one that has been created by the astra component give me the key space and execute select values from reference list where list is pet specialty and we got the result okay so our unit test will inject reuse the singleton sql session everywhere to execute queries statements against cassandra okay so it was test 01 connectivity and you know nothing special here what just give me the key space and execute the first query just to see if i can really connect to your database okay second will be creating your own service on top of this connection so here look at that i do have again my sql session inject from the spring context okay and then i will create prepare statement remember this is what i show you as environment as a seconds diagram so here at initialization i will prepare statement insert into select into that way it's initialized once and when i need to use it i just have to execute so how to execute here it is session secret session dot execute okay this guy doing execute reactive and uh in a minute mary will tell you what is reactive but everything is reactive in the absolutely it was the only way for me to show you sequential.execute okay so first prepare statement at load and then execute when you need it maybe last point why this card is executing is executed at initialize initialization of the application it's uh a spring trick you ask your uh bin to implement initialize oops initialize bin and uh yeah notifications are off initialize bin and you have to implement after set properties and this code is initial is executed as initialization okay and now if i want to execute this test i can copy that and test so to execute some tests in uh git pod we are using maven test uh i find it easier than right click try to test it as a g unit as you would do in the id on local environment the reason is you will have more settings to do and here no no big settings you can do maven testing so test run 1 error 0 and i was able to retrieve the list of the veterinary type dentist radiology surgery ok right cool cool as you can see here i'm using directly and directly the sql session but maybe this is not what you want to do you want to work with objects and you want to let something else work with save the data in your objects so here let me open that reactive clinic here inside the core java driver there is a way it's called the mapper there is a way to define an object as an entity define a dao which is an interface with no implementation no cql we don't tell the guy really how to execute which request to execute but it will be able to find out what it is okay and you don't need the third party tools to do it you just need the core drivers okay so you could execute test three if you wish but that's really a way to use still only the drivers to do mapping from the object to the database okay and now i think uh we can uh show you a bit slide and talk more about spring because mapping from object to casana is also what spring is doing for you using something called spring data okay so go back to slide and now i leave the floor to mary thank you thank you cedric thank you that's a lot of materials yeah in the uh just the data itself i think yeah so now we get into the reactive part and as such i've worked with some reactive systems so we'll be very happy to talk about it um so if you're new to reactive um there's actually difference too just to point out there's difference of reactive programming and versus reactive systems so the programming part is more with the program itself and then utilizing kind of a functional style in java right the functional style of programming to implement the reactive but when we get get to like reactive systems we're dealing with systems as a whole and essentially to this reactive manifesto is what defines what the system uh is you know if it is reactive um there are four tenants uh as you can see in here this is actually an enhanced diagram because otherwise too is normally you see the four tenants uh responsive uh elastic resilient and then message driven but this is actually a great diagram to further kind of explain it a little in in which you know it kind of divides up into the value uh kind of top part responsive and then the form and then the means right so value is what we're expecting your systems have become really really responsive it helps with the real time kind of processing of all your data that that it enables right in a very efficient manner um and in the form it takes is really elasticity and also resiliency so elastic it means that systems can very elastic it's very scalable so if there are more requests coming in your system will automatically or processors will will get in in number of processes to handle all of your requests will increase but if it is you know if you if you don't need anything it will kind of scale back down so it kind of explains that elasticity elasticity and essentially increase the throughput of your system and then there's also resiliency which means if your system fails um anytime then there will be components especially in a cloud-native environment that you know your node goes down something right that is running and you have another one that comes step right in to take over so then your overall your throughput should not um suffer and then that's the idea of resiliency the recovery aspect so these are like forms and then the means of it how can you achieve it it's really like through message driven kind of approach um as well it's also there's also like event driven too which is slightly different but the message driven part is indicating your request is in response there's a sender and receiver they kind of know each other the address is known to um but otherwise event driven is more a pops up kind of a approach in which messages get admitted and you don't really worry about who it goes to you go through a broker a broker will take care of things and then you label your messages uh as topics right so that's kind of in a high level but as you can see to the very top to the value the responsive is essentially um the uh very making it very maintainable and also very uh extend extensible too so so that's what that's what this reactive manifesto in a nutshell but if you want to go into more details there's plenty of information and light band is the company that actually drives this initiative too that there are a couple other companies and now there's reactive foundation that's kind of backing the reactive manifesto so that's it's a bit in a nutshell so we can go to the next slide yeah in the interest of time too i won't go talking i'm not doing a full-blown presentation i mean i've done that but it's not here so we wanted this one up running yeah indeed yeah that's right so um but yeah we can discuss further on the discord channel if you're interested okay so here it is right so there's also in reactive systems in the reactive world there's a specification as such is dictated or kind of i shouldn't say dictated governed by the reactive foundation which is part of the linux foundation now and so they come up there's a one specification that's actually called reactive streams reactive stream api um as such too if you can kind of take a look into the api there are no implementations than just uh interfaces essentially um the publisher uh subscribe and then the subscription and also processor these are the four kind of interface right and and then it's up to the vendors to implement this um that is something too i would suggest that it's not for the application developers to implement it because it it gets very complicated even though you think okay there are only four you know kind of methods specified in the interface but go ahead and do it but guess what when it deals with concurrent programming it's it's not no joke yeah so rely on your uh providers like service providers such as over here we see that there's rx java um spring right this is what we're working on spring reactor the web flux um it makes use of flux and mono and uh flux um kind of a mono and what is it there i kind of get confused because vertex right vertex also is another uh library too it's come it's an eclipse foundation so these are all open source project and then there's akka which is from light band and it makes use of actor model actor model is actually a concept that's borrowed from uh erlang the language right erlang back in when telecommunications needed the asynchronous style of communication so i could borrow the actor um kind of model of the sender and receiver the request response um so very uh efficient too so so yeah these are like the uh kind of a defective standard if you want to go for any kind of reactive libraries i would think yeah these are good ones to go after and of course today we are going to talk more about the spring side how it supports it but as you can see right there's publisher subscriber and mixtures of the event driven model that um as you can see so quickly kind of go over right reactive streams and then it makes yourself subscribe so if any time you know you want to subscribe to messages from the publisher you do a subscribe and then unsubscribe basically then um data comes you know from the publisher it emits some data then the uh broker essentially will be sending the data over to the subscriber and then you know basically there's subscription subscription the request and then um there's also the on next and on complete all these things are kind of all kind of within the uh this this uh definition of the interface too so as such right and uh this is the uh reactive stream so in a nutshell so all right it's great it's great so how the driver use these magic that's right yeah so exactly so now this is example that of this uh kind of state kind of transition right kind of a thing so ui you you have your parameters sent to the api and then from you know now then put putting them in within the database kind of context cassandra um astra right and and so now the api they're prepared statements and uh parameters and basically then yeah the the driver then will bind the parameters and then essentially this is what it is and then it comes back to with the reactive the bound statement will come back with the reactive result set and then sending it over to the flux back to the ui and then basically in this case then you will execute the query and then uh goes to the cassandra now at this point and then it fetches all the rows and then comes back and then again you know back to the driver then it will be reactive uh row kind of result set and then comes back to the ui and essentially two like on next and same thing then then the subscriber will kind of on next is essentially the the next available road that did process so and then when it's done then cassandra there's on complete then it will kind of go back to the ui and basically indicate the completing of this query um so yeah so that's like a you know kind of a quick kind of explaining of this uh reactive uh kind of processing and again it's it's very asynchronous in nature as well this this call yeah i mean what we're showing it seems like it's kind of one step like that but it can be happening at any time kind of depending on the threat right behavior of the threat and then all these complexity with concurrent concurrency through the threats um so yeah okay yeah it's yeah and yeah it's uh you got this notification for everything grows and not anymore just a notification for each page and uh it could be a lot of notification right so if you get one every single rule maybe you cannot keep up so look at that the driver does have a back pressure mechanism just to say hey please stop i cannot keep up that that's correct yeah i totally actually forgot about the back pressure part when i talk about reactive streams and that's the the the the primary thing right besides it being uh non-blocking uh support is basically back pressure if you get too many you know requests coming in then you need to have a way of balancing so then you don't overload your your broker your processor to be processing these messages so that's like back pressure um so as you can see yes it's the driver in there that actually actually the client going to cassandra and the driver will be there the reactive driver is managing uh stu the use of the implementing the reactive streams to is to kind of control the flow essentially it's a flow control mechanism that's kind of built into this back pressure during a read um but then over at the right side then then there's no actually no back pressure support too based on this now it's just a note too to also notice right even in um in this case doing reactive too like if you are sending a request right to the uh to cassandra and and you want to get the data so the request you know at the time you issue your request and it will essentially capture the state of that data set at that point in time and return you that set of data now during the time in which you send your requests and then it comes back there could be actually more data happening too so what to do right so in other words you're not having this you know you don't want to rely all the time on eventual consistency principle right meaning that while you're getting things that aren't quite exactly accurate but then um the thing is too the solution that we have in here is basically using a new concept well not new concept but the new feature that we support this concept is called change data capture cdc right so not not like disease control here but it's ctc for change data capture so so that one is actually that feature is available in um in extra um yeah now we just announced it and then it's basically um capturing change as such right state changes in your data is being captured and also being reported right back so as you can see it provides this real-time data very very well so yeah so i think uh if you can go to the next slide for me please of course yeah here we go yeah so okay so here too we still have to have a proper kind of flow diagram but just wanted to kind of give you a heads up there there's actually we have extra streaming that we have already announced the availability of cds of availability of cdc and again it captures data on the fly right and but underneath the hood i just want to point out to you is the pattern is called capture data change right it's it's within cassandra and astra streaming we implement that but in order to do that we actually also leverage on the apache pulsar capability too and so here at data stack stu we have the extra streaming lunar streaming that's essentially and making use of the pulsar uh the pops up capability to help with capturing these change of data so basically it's coming soon to a data source near you so please stay tuned um we we will have more materials that we'll be talking about it in the cdc esther streaming uh that will be launching uh i think it's next week as something yeah coming yes i cannot remember the dates but in two weeks right in the 21st yeah yeah yeah and you know you know you can you can go to the astra user interface and already set up some some uh beginning of a streaming so i think it's even yeah that's right exactly so yeah you can go to the same yeah exactly the extra streaming and pardon me because i just joined data stack so some things i'm still like you know kind of like looking around feeling my way but anyway yes the esther streaming actually over there if you want to play around with this feature you can actually go to create streaming and then you can follow that too we will be having more materials to share with you too so yeah so essentially yeah use this feature and yeah exactly i think we do have a workshop exactly on that april 20th yeah that's right yes yeah into this three weeks for now it will be dedicated uh uh workshop on that's easy yeah so pretty thank you all right so moving from reactive to spring data so is spring data reactive what spring data yeah that's right so yes so for spring data right this is such a spring framework it's also very extensive and as you can see there are different uh kind of a sub component so to speak right the different uh features that it has so as you can see there's a spring uh reactive uh so it's kind of through the project reactor and also the spring reflux which is more for the web kind of side of reactive support too that forms this reactive backbone for the spring uh kind of a whole framework itself um but as such a spring is uh you know very opinionated uh sys very efficient right and and it's being widely used by the java community because it is opinionated but it's also very efficient you you actually it takes away a lot of the complexity of what java used to be right in the java early days of j2ee so basically it it kind of make it a lot simpler to use and now actually the java itself also has caught up after spring comes out too and which is jakarta ee just to mention about it too so yeah so as you can see right all of these are spring micro services among other things right microservices reactive cloud web web apps uh serverless event driven spring batch for example and these are like kind of major features that comes out of this spring framework and if you want to use reactive yeah use the reactor so yeah yeah and then there also then uh spring projects too that that are many more to with that right then these are kind of more uh you know actual uh you know projects that you can actually use to develop your application so spring boot spring data and that's what we're kind of looking into this uh the the uh consistent uh approach to data access uh relational non-relational mapreduce and beyond so that's the spring data that's working with our cassandra um i guess cedric you can extend kind of expand on this part too with spring data yeah you know yeah i think yeah um it's a galaxy of framework you know you can spend your life on spring but for today yeah we will use spring boot which is the run time and spring data which is data yeah but there are many many that's right exactly then see over here spring security too is also a big thing and if you want to do batch processing and leverage on the spring batch and then there's also spring cloud and spring rest um as well so these are kind of the maybe a rock but i think next week we will have the spring security yeah talks because we need to authenticate in the applicant e-commerce application of course yeah great yeah there's tons of things happening yes oh yeah everyone's a new workshop and so with spring you can have layers like a hair yeah that's correct i love this slide actually because it's getting to be lunch time and for me in chicago so yeah so as you can see i mean spring boot itself is very much a layered takes a layered approach and separation of concern right you have databases that are that supports sql database uh relational and nosql um and then there's persistence layer that's actually the spring the repository layer to help with the um you know persisting data like kind of back and forth between the business and to the database and then you know fetching data to the business layer and then if you go up business layer there that's where you write all of the services that actually interacts with your persistence layer and then of course then very top will be presentation layer that uh makes use of the mvc controller kind of uh kind of a mechanism to do uh uh presentation too so yeah so this is kind of like a typical spring boot application and of course if you want to initialize one they have spring boot initializer that you can quickly set up an app too um yeah so exactly and it's yeah super super and we do have that in the app if you navigate the code you see so the new sql database is obviously cassandra then the drivers repository you can find a couple of repositories services and controllers it's written exactly like like that in the app today now oh multiple practices spring yeah the reactive stack right we can talk about let me be a little bit faster now so spring boot two so this has the reactor as i mentioned the reactive stack as you can see if you use a reactive stack how does it kind of compare with this the old traditional surface stack so as you can see it's actually the it's making use of neti and servlet uh 3.1 plus kind of containers and it has the reactive streams adapters that it supports reactive streams um and then there's a spring uh security reactive that we're talking about it's actually adds in the reactive flavor to it and then spring webflux is basically spring mpc kind of on steroids it's basically for reactive right kind of reactive steroids anyway then there's also then spring data reactive repositories that we were talking about cassandra right namely uh this of course is the best of the bunch and over here then all these other solutions you that you can use to actually r2dbc also has the reactive uh driver well actually i worked a little bit with that earlier so yeah and then of course then there's spring otherwise you use the traditional spring data repositories with jdbc jpa and nosql but yeah but as you can see reactive site has all of the reactive tool tooling for you to be ready to get onto the reactive um way of doing things so yeah yeah cassandra is the most important of course yes of course yeah yeah wonderful and this is the spring reactive stack and as you as you recall too i think cedric already brought up a slide with that but over here with uh with a similar one right that this one has the reactive flavor to it so as you can see over there the right side the databases we still have cassandra the data layer um and then in the middle here the application tier with the back end you see there's data stacks we have drivers that do still make use of the cql session and it interacts then with the spring data cassandra in the repository and then it goes up to the spring web flux then it's essentially the spring boot application that has the reactive side of things and interacting with uh cassandra through the cql session so um and then of course then it's all like through inversion of control um the injecting of uh resources as they need to and and um yeah dependency injection kind of way of doing things so yeah um yes and then they were serving data then to the front end the presentation the front end of angular node or any anything in fact so yeah okay yeah and i think this is what i will show you uh very soon in the code right i think uh maybe yeah maybe the last piece is uh you set up a spring boot app using some some starters uh something that will set up all the the component needed there is one for rasta and this guy will help you connect to all the magic of astra it's not only cassandra there you have others product like pizza and all those way to interact with the data using some apis and we cover those api on multiple workshop before but you know today let's stick into cql but you know be aware these applications that you have today could be reused to also interact with the others api if you want to yeah all right okay we'll move quickly to this one i think for sake of code and you know i think now we could probably just go in the code i will go into code and uh do it all right the spring data the api and the app full fledge uh yeah just to be able to play a game on time yeah okay okay so okay so uh let's see what we do have here working with spring data so remember these uh remember these uh code i show you just before that you could map an object to a table using the drivers spring data does exactly the same it's just using a different set of annotation and it's working with normal stack if you wish synchronous stack and reactive stack and if you go in the code over here you will see a package called spring data come on git pod open me please my spring data package if git bodies happy with me come on people okay okay okay okay i could go to plan b okay finally so here you do have entity so remember we do have a a table called vet okay and here i'm using some id first name last name specialty like you want to do in in java object object programming and i put some annotation to do the mapping from class to table right and then i also create an interface so no nothing there it's empty and i just say it's a cassandra reactive repository nothing more and if you look at the test so here i inject reactive customer repository and look at that i'm able to invoke some method insert saved update delete are available part of the interface those are being generated by bytecode manipulation in the runtime and i don't have to use to to insert the secret statement myself it's done by spring itself so pretty cool right uh don't have to write the code by yourself by the way it's a reactive code so if i just invoke that and do nothing else nothing will happen because in the reactive app everything is lazy if you do not introduce something like we call a terminal endpoint terminal call like block nothing will or subscribe nothing will happen so to cope with that and be able to do unit tests in the reactive world spring provide a step verifier and you just execute what you want so you will retrieve either a list so multivalued or single valued when something is retrieved and is single value this is what we call a mono and those terms are a part of the eric's java model i don't think they are everywhere mono mono and flux so model is for uh one object and if you get the list you will get a flux okay so that's uh yeah that's the two two objects you need to to be aware in the reactive stack mono and flux so here i will retrieve a mono so expect one expect complete verify just verify that the mono is complete and i insert something and then i can find it by id get the mono again and expect that is complete and with that you can execute number test number four using the same trick load all environment variable execute test number four which is this guy and i should save anything retrieve anything that is the dro layer okay so let's say we have six table and six they hour exactly the same way as you have seen on screen if you remember the slide there is a layer on top of the dao that's called the service layer and the service is useful when you need to chain or compose multiple call to the da and in this application it could happen on the screen remember when you invoke everything ready to owner you will list all the pets and then for every single pet you release the visit as well this pattern is called n plus one select i will list every pet and for every single pet i will again do another invoke well when you are synchronous those are super slow right because you need to wait for everything to happen with reactive that's pretty convenient because you can work with the flux and doing some mapping flat mapping which is another method to do so so if i go to visit and now i you the the reactive services here you can so here i retrieve stuff from the diy and just map so maybe the owner will be better to show you that but if if i show you the owner full screen uh here you can see so i retrieve all the owner owner.find all this is bring the spring data give me find all which is could be pretty dangerous why because if you do have a lot of stuff in in the air you will get a lot of data but then i able to flat map and for each item retrieve i can populate this object to add more stuff and all these flat maps are done you know side by side asynchronously in parallel to have my service super super fast i don't need to wait for four first entities to have been mapped to be to be able to to invoke the second it will all work uh asynchronously and you will speed up this and plus one select pattern okay so there our layer service layer so in a service layer you will probably inject multiple deo because you need to invoke multiple tables right at the service level in a spring application you expect to find more or less exactly the service that will be exposed through your apis but still in spring you like to split things right you like to uh you know leverage as much as you want on inversion of control you know just not rely on the implementation but you know keep injecting and splitting layer after layer also something to to notice the package organization uh if you were with owners you like to have all the controller service and there are layers inside the same package you know in the old spring we used to have a package for domains a package for dao package for services it's not as it has been designed now it's recommended to put all the same function in the same package so here i do have reactive services and now if i go to the controller on top of the services this is where we start using spring web flux we do have the service here inject in the controller and so we will expose apis with directly reactive object in the signatures here i retrieve a flux of owner so the api will act as a reactive api give me a flux and eat them one after the other getting the notification for every single owner not having to wait for the full list to have been processed before getting the first items so i can start processing even before everything has been retrieved from the database and that's kind of the magic of the reactive so here this is the service call here this is the signature nothing special and here this is how to expose a method as a rest api this is nothing different from spring web spring does have its own sets of api okay uh annotation it's not g2e so g2e would have used the specification called g-a-g-a-x-rs jax rs 2.0 here it's a spring delegated signature but here request mapping so that the path in jackson rs just to say hey if somebody use that url this is the controller you need to access then get mapping so if you invoke the get method and you provide the last name as parameter provide the last mail the last name as a parameter for the service so exposures api with the documentation here and i will show you what the documentation look like get some reactive object in the signature use reactive services invocative reactive deo and that's reactive from top to bottom and nobody wait and you know by the way if you um by the way if you uh from if you introduce some blocking code spring will not even start you will say ah there is a blocking curl somewhere i don't want to start and some sometimes it's just uh yeah it's just you know it upset me you know yeah you'd have a blocking call hiding in a in a library and you cannot start your app at all because it's not fully reactive so it could be super useful but also sometimes if you're not be careful enough you can get stuck okay so enough talking uh you have seen the multiple layers so i can show you uh so this is what i call you with flux and the services so now maybe what you want to see so i've showed the controller when you want to see the application moving so i will again so set all the environment variables and run the app with spring boot run okay so it's starting and this is where if i go to my explorer i should see the back end going to live 996 66 it will i think open a new tab directly for me if not i will create one so is it coming maybe maybe not if not i would just do it myself so to open a new page remember click the click here so as you can see i'm invoking 9966 and i'm going to swagger ui okay so it's coming remember when i told you about documentation in the controller this guy api responses because in my code i use this set of annotation when the app starts using a third-party library called swagger or open api or i mean go to go to the pump.xml is i think it's called springfox yeah springfoxbootstarter with the annotation and boom why this is cool well you don't need a user interface you can say hey i want to get the list of the pet so this is all the rest resources exposed by the api i want to list the pet type i go here i try it out i execute and look at that hey i can use my api and i can give my api to my my in the front end and they can start learn how to use it why they are building the webpage okay but hey this is not what you want to see you want to see the full-fledged app right so i will stay these uh back-end running okay and i will go to the pet clinic angular okay so here pet clinic angular so this time it's a node application i won't go too much in the detail of of node the purpose of the workshop are really focusing on the back end but in the spring pet clinic community organization on github you find the angular application and you find the react application so what you want to do here is go to the proper folder and npm run start because i think npm run build has already been done for us so it will build and eventually look at that because i have npn run start that 4200 is now open i will open a new tab and then you know how javascript works right it works right you download alph of internet and it's starting so what what my browser is doing now it's downloading i don't know angular or alpha okay it will take a few seconds to load but fortunately uh it will end up by showing my app come on and this app invoke the api here that invoked the database that we created all together and you will have the three layers working yeah it's downloading half of the internet you know the first alph when you build node install and the second uh the second alph when you run the app okay so uh so many javascript has been downloaded it should work now so here if i go to owners uh oh that's empty okay so here i got my pet type so what if i like to add a graph can i can i add a graph save yeah okay i do have a giraffe so now if i go to list the bed type and i want to try it out which are the pet type and execute where is my giraffe here it is and if i want to go to astra and login to to astra come on and i will be done because it's my database okay it's it's loading oh i can also use the sql console that we have still open here so pet type if i execute pet type i do here are my giraffe oh and seems like some inserts at the user interface love and just get me a space okay so we have a bug to fix uh but yeah you got the id so you do have the uh front page so with the owner add honor maybe uh yeah i don't want to see my everything blah blah blah okay my address my city my phone okay okay that's my me add a new pet let's say let's pretend i have a dog called shadow uh born last year yeah you got the idea but hey i can play a little bit it has been two hours so here and it's a dog yeah and i do have another dog study bomb the same day okay okay it's also a dog and uh okay now if i want to add a visit to shadow and say next week to get this vaccine this is how i do it and you know i can go back to my database and you know start looking for owners but here you have the ui invoking the api in front okay but clinique what is the name oh no no s blah blah blah blah city does not exist okay and here i am and yeah i can also select uh of course uh pet by owner to get my salient shadow here they are shadow and study and uh yeah you know you have the full credit application from bottom to top all working everything for free and you have the code for each layer so you could still ask questions in this card if something is not clear but guess what it's time for the game because we are at the top of the two hours so hopefully you learned something and you were able to go up to the end and have the stuff working if not you know do it at your own pace and keep asking on discord i would be so happy to help you all but you know now okay thank you francisco so yeah now i will i will fix that uh okay so uh enough talking let's play a game so uh everyone um i will ask you seven questions regarding the content we have covered today uh if you're on first answer fast you get more points and the fast the three fastest among you will get the swipe box shipped for free at their location to participate to the game please open a new tab uh go to mendy.com and use the code shown on screen at the top and uh good luck everyone also maybe a little bit of housekeeping uh do not look at the question on youtube there is two second delay and if you want to be as fast as possible make sure to look i don't know either your phone or the new tab i mean where you do have mentee open okay and with that i will soon start the quiz the first question is is not a speed question it's a question because sometimes we have cheat we have cheaters we have people using bots so the first question is kind of a captcha to avoid any bots so don't be super surprised is the first question is super easy okay that's by design okay all right i do have 48 people and 65 watching so i think we have almost everybody so good luck everyone and enjoy the game so all question give maximum put which form do you see on screen hey i want you is it a rectangle a triangle a circle or a beer yeah i know what you think mary but hey hey look at that we had one boat so we tricked the boat okay we can keep moving okay so now let's get serious all right question number two let's do it what is spring webflux is it a reactive application generator is the reactive stack for web spring framework it did the streaming framework for spring or the spring web tv yeah most of you got it correctly it was indeed the reactive stack the one we have seen on the left part of the screen good job so let's see who was the fastest among you all and uh whoa i recognize some names i see people asking questions in the chat uh yeah that's great to see so arturo was the fastest this time but raul and francisco are pretty close bruce only three point behind you know and everything nothing is done i think we still have five questions to go all right okay ready question number two what are the interfaces used by reactor and reflux complexion stage and filter are sick and sick mono and flux or uranium-235 plutonium you know reactor yeah indeed so the interface used by reactor was mono and flux okay the the two uh instance insisted odd at the end not all those questions are tricky uh but yeah mono and flux i think uh nsync is not relative to drivers at all all right this time oh okay arturo again does tristan but jesus was the fastest and uh yeah nothing is done yet all right question number four how would you describe git pod git in kubernetes a complete id platform in the cloud a distribution of eclipse a pod for the git family to leave okay this this one was too easy right it's indeed an id in the cloud okay right okay whoa again wow okay crystal does i think we do have a three on the podium oh wow kyrie is pretty close come on come on nothing is done yet question five so three more questions to go right let's go what is astradb a new sql database a new sequel database apache cassandra is a service with extra tools a movie with just clooney yeah indeed it was castandra and cassandra as a service and not a movie with josh clooney because first of all adastra is the title of the movie and it's not josh clene it's brad pitt all right okay two more questions to go oh tristan yeah okay actually it does jazz francisco wow wow the competition at this is two questions okay okay okay let's see how could be the what could be the weak point of in-synchronous apis provide back pressure call back and blocking calls eventually they never call you back yeah it was my joke yeah yeah why a synchronous api cannot really be your friend because eventually they will never call you back now indeed the callback else while the good answer you know that nice red cloud that i add in my slide yeah it's not easy wow pretty spread answer this time and uh last question oh wow this time yeah maybe it was a tricky one yeah i don't know oh wow everything changed now accidentally wow gary get up francisco gropo r and uh keeping wow okay okay uh yeah that's nice for for those who just got a mistake but it's also kind of uh quite a suspense now you know it's not like everything is done after three questions all right this one is serious last question stay focused what is our recommended approach to build an application with customer start with the code data model and if you stack indexes query data model code code code hello filtering code deploy fix yeah thank you most of you i did correctly indeed start with your queries know what your app is doing then get your data model create the table in cassandra and only then code all right so final letterboard who is our winner for today our winners for today okay let's see all right okay so uh congratulations to the three winners kerry francisco and r make sure to do a screenshot right now of your screen um you will send an email to jetfire sucks dot com i will show you the email in a minute um and you can watch the recording but now make sure to do a screenshot now because you need it to claim your price but congratulations to all the winners it's not the easy some questions are tricky and you went fast so congratulations i will let the mentee open um just for the feedback okay we are now at the end of the session i will let the feedback from running and give you a few slides to wrap up but we are done for today two more minutes and we are done so first i told you if you are winners this is the email to send your screenshot and uh you know probably put the date and the title of the workshop we are doing so many of those i'm just thinking of jack who does have his inbox probably filled and uh yeah we will make sure to get you some swag so yeah you're welcome so gold is as of now we are running an accountant so even more uh even more money to to to to get so uh three months each month see the dedicated competition competition with uh with some routing what you ask you to do is uh the app you like with the the theme we propose okay using astra the idea is really for you to get your hands dirty on and uh do what you like it's just a theme nothing imposed and every month we we as a judge we just you know just the better application submitted and uh yeah so take your chance here is the link and uh yeah go for it discord so we had the question just before uh how to get support after the session discord is the way to go we are there uh every day of the week and if you ask a question please ask okay and the recording the session is recorded and the recordings is will be available in 15 minutes in the same at the same link same link nothing to to change so if you enjoy and maybe we should have asked that before but you know now that we are with us up to the end and uh you are pretty engaged why not subscribing to the channel and you know giving a like to the video and uh you know make sure to come back next week i think next week will be an e-commerce application uh and yeah i'm happy to have you up to the end i hope you enjoy uh what we did and uh see you next time all right so yeah thank you very much everyone and have a great thank you bye and as always don't forget to click that
