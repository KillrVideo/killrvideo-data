    "text": "hello and welcome to our intro to cassandra for developers learning series this is video one of seven cassandra fundamentals in this video you'll get a high-level tour of what cassandra is and why so many leading companies and disruptive technologies have adopted it over the last decade so let's start with what cassandra is it is a no sql distributed database we'll focus on the distributed part here in a moment each instance of cassandra is called a node and this contains a full cassandra database each node can handle roughly two to four terabytes of data and many thousands of operations a second per core you might notice that we haven't given an exact number because this really depends on the resources allocated to a single node in general though we're talking thousands of operations a second per core now i mentioned a moment ago that cassandra is a distributed database while you could technically run it on a single node it would kind of defeat the purpose of what it's meant to do it is also a leaderless peer-to-peer system meaning any node can do what any other node can we'll explore more what this means a little bit later nodes communicate through a protocol called gossip and they use this transfer information to one another an example being the status of a node then finally nodes are organized into groups called data centers notice the ring connecting all the nodes so in this case we could say all of these nodes belong to the same data center and later on i'll show you how data centers can really increase the flexibility of what you can do with cassandra okay so that was just a high level overview of some cluster basics there are some other things you should know about cassandra one this is a petabyte level database just think about how much data that is that is a one followed by 15 zeros it's one thing to be able to store that amount of data but it's another entirely to do so while maintaining performance at scale something the cassandra excels at it is also called the always-on database because it is purpose-built to maintain 100 uptime even in cases of node failure it does this through its distributed nature automatic replication and leaderless topology remember the data centers i talked about earlier geographical distribution is one way you can use them to create a global database put your data centers where you need them around the world and cassandra will handle communication and replicating your data automatically one of the best known features of cassandra is its performance at scale generally speaking writes happen at the speed of wire from micro to tight milliseconds while reads are usually within milliseconds this holds true whether your database has three nodes or thousands of nodes cassandra scales linearly and can scale indefinitely if you need more performance add more nodes and finally it's completely vendor agnostic you can install it anywhere no vendor lock-in one of the questions i get asked a lot is if cassandra is a distributed database and i have some set of data how does it know where to put data or how to get it later if i want to read it so data on cassandra is divided up into what are called partitions and we'll talk about this a little bit more later in video three of seven tables partitions and examples but for now take a look at the example table to the right notice we have three columns country city and population country is our partition key in this case what we are saying is that we are dividing up our rows based on the country value notice there are multiple rows with the country usa france canada and germany since these have the same partition key they will be stored together within a node and data will automatically be distributed around the nodes in the cluster let's take a look at an example here we've taken the data from our table and distribute it around our cluster based on the partition key notice how the rows with the same country value are grouped together these are literally stored within the same physical partition on disk this means later on if i wanted to know the population for every city in the united states i could read a single partition and get my results with very low i o cost again you choose the partition key for your table a cassandra will handle all the rest it does all of the data distribution for you now looking at this picture some of you might be thinking what happens if i lose the node that contains the usa partition up top do i lose my data let's see how replication works to answer that question the first thing i'd like you to notice is that each node has a number assigned to it the numbers listed here are arbitrary to keep things simple but the idea still applies these are called partition tokens and every node is assigned a set of tokens they own so starting at the top node labeled 0 that node owns tokens 84 through 0. then the next node owns 1 through 17 and so on around the ring if you remember recently we spoke about partition keys well when you add a partition key to a table that value is automatically hashed out to a token value that is how cassandra knows where to store and retrieve your data the partition key think of the partition key as the address of your data now how does this apply to what happens if we lose a node like in the previous example of the usa partition cassandra wouldn't be a very robust database if it only had stored one copy of a partition in one place if that were the case it wouldn't take much before a single failure could mean missing data or a failed operation and this is where replication factor comes into play in the example you see now notice there is a single ring we are denoting a replication factor of one which in our usa partition example means one copy of that partition on one node however i can increase to a replication factor of two notice what happened now i have two rings and two nodes will now contain the usa partition if i increase one more time to a replication factor of three now i add another ring and i have three copies of the usa partition on three different nodes a replication factor of three is the standard in cassandra as it gives a solid balance between availability performance and consistency okay so i said we would come back to explaining how data is stored and retrieved in cassandra starting with a replication factor of 3 imagine we'd like to write some data maybe our usa partition from earlier as the request comes in any node is chosen to handle the request this is what we call the coordinator node to be clear any node can be a coordinator it is simply the name given to the node that handles the request and to repeat in cassandra any node can do it any other node can which means that all of the nodes in the ring can handle this operation let's move on so the 59 you see there is just the partition token that was hashed out of the partition key for the data we are writing again this is just an arbitrary number for illustration we can imagine this is the token value for our usa partition now in the case of a replication factor of 3 there are three nodes that own the token range that contains 59 in this case the nodes labeled 67 83 and 0 in the diagram so what happens is the coordinator forwards the right to all three nodes and each node stores a copy so what happens if a node is down during this process cassandra stores what is called a hint once it comes back up the right is automatically played back to heal the node and this is one of the many robustness features that's built into the core of cassandra alright so let's take a look at consistency level again i'm not going to go over all the possible scenarios here just the standard way to do things based off the best balance for performance availability and consistency there are plenty of other options that you can sink your teeth into if you want but those are more advanced topics look at the picture you see now there are a couple things going on here so let's explain what you are seeing first thing we are using our default of a replication factor of three meaning any write will be stored on three nodes in this case we are also using a consistency level of quorum which translates into a majority of nodes so in the case of a replication vector of three a majority is two nodes this means that with a replication factor of three using quorum cassandra will wait for an acknowledgement from two nodes before saying the right is okay and sending the result back to the client if consistency level cannot be reached for an operation the operation will fail moving on to a read operation again using a consistency level of quorum we see the client makes a request the coordinator reads from two nodes and the result is sent back to the client now you may be asking wait does it matter which two nodes or what happens if one of the nodes has stale data for some reason this is where some of the really awesome capability of cassandra comes into play no it doesn't matter if i set my consistency level to read a quorum it can choose any two of the three nodes that might have data this means i could even have onenote offline and still be able to handle this request also if onenote is still for some reason cassandra will automatically repair the data and send the correct result back to the client by the way using this combination of ryticorn and read a quorum is what we call immediate consistency immediate here means i can immediately read what i just wrote anywhere in my cluster this is the standard and balances performance availability and consistency as i mentioned before and this is where you should start by the way anything else is something you should really look into and understand before doing so now starting to bring this all together remember way back at the beginning of this video i mentioned how data centers can increase the flexibility of what you can do with your cassandra database here are some examples in the example on the left we have a single global database that is spread across three data centers in different regions of the world if i were to write some data to any node in the data center located in the americas that data would automatically get replicated over the data centers in the emea and apac regions all at the speed of wire no etl or manual file copy is needed i could then read that data say in australia right away if you think about the implications of this it means i can put data where my users are with the lowest amount of response time and use the inherent replication and cassandra to move data where it needs to go when it comes down to it no system can currently beat the speed of light if you want your users to have acceptable response times and come back to your app you need to put their data as close to them as possible because sandra makes this second nature now moving on to the right we see that cassandra works with any of the major cloud providers along with on-premise installations and really we're talking all cloud providers not just the major ones cassandra is completely vendor agnostic there is no vendor lock-in you can install it anywhere and again going back to the flexibility of data centers you can operate a single cassandra database in hybrid cloud or multi-cloud configurations so whether you are talking from on premise along with a cloud provider or any combination of all of the above it does this right out of the box and finally cassandra fits a pretty wide range of use cases whether that's scalability where high thorough put and high volume applications are needed mission critical cases where you need to ensure the database will be available in case of outages globally distributed to get data close to users and handle different security requirements around the globe or able to deploy across any cloud platform or on-prem if any of these apply cassandra is probably a solid fit okay so you just absorbed a lot of information and if you want to dig a little deeper then check out our cassandra fundamentals course up on catacota this is all free and will give you a hands-on experience all up in the cloud so even if you have a lower resource machine or bandwidth you can still experience cassandra directly and get your hands dirty the link is in the video details well i hope you enjoyed this video and i really appreciate your attention next move on to video two of seven in this series and we'll see you again here real soon hello once again and welcome to video two of seven in our intro to cassandra for developers crash course create your astra instance so what we're gonna do in this particular case is um matter of fact there is a link in the video description that will bring you here to github.com slash data stack academy slash intro to cassandra for developers and if you follow it down we're going to do section number one here create your astra instance now on the right hand side i've already brought up the astra ui for signing up now i already have an account right this should only take just a moment to do where you fill in your email uh your password you create account or you could use github or your google credentials whatever the instructions are in the in the readme itself now since i've already got an account i'm just going to go ahead and sign in don't copy my stuff and hopefully you can't tell what password i'm putting in all right so i'm going to go ahead and log in and that's what this is talking about now i should be clear that astra is in fact free you do not have to um you don't have to put in a credit card or anything like that the first thing i want to point out and you're going to see this credits remaining thing um when you when you create your first database and everything it's going to ask you pick the pay-as-you-go plan that's what you want pay as you go now i just said it's free you will get a 25 credit every month that automatically rolls over that is enough to actually run small production workloads on it you could have millions of operations there you're not going to go past that when you're just experimenting and such like we're doing now um and matter of fact you can see i actually i have a ton of databases that i've created i've been doing things in them and matter of fact the month just flipped but i i used maybe three bucks or something of it and the total the total thing so again point being you will not be charged anything you do not need to put a credit card in the sign up and everything is free okay so with that um what i'm going to do is you go to step 1b it says create a pay-as-you-go plan now there is a guide here if you open that up that'll actually give you all of the instructions if you need them but what i'm going to do is say create database and notice we stated here the database name so what we're asking you to do is you could really pick whatever names you want but for the purposes of this workshop we are asking you to use the values that we have reason being is later on when you go through the exercises it's going to use these values and it'll be that much easier to follow along okay so i put in my database name and my key space name now i want to pick a provider you can choose either google cloud or amazon web services it will automatically determine which of the regions depending on which one you pick is by you so i'm just going to go with google cloud you can take a look you'll see that the um the cost for read and write request storage and stuff are slightly different between the two the main difference there is i should probably pick one there we go it fills it out um again these are just letting you know what the price would be if you were paying but since we're using the free 25 every month you don't have to worry about that and then i will say create database now from there you'll see your new database start up here and you'll see it go into a pending state eventually it'll say things like initializing and it will go to a green active like you see with the other ones at that point you can then move on i would say for now just let this be and go to the next video in the series learn a little bit about data modeling come back and this will be ready to go welcome back to video three of seven in our intro to cassandra for developers crash course tables partitions and examples so in this section we're just gonna go over the basic components what creates cells rows tables and such and then get into a little bit more discussion on data modeling in cassandra so the first thing here is a cell a cell is essentially just the intersection of a row and a column anyone who's ever worked with an excel spreadsheet or a tabular format you might see in a relational database we'll be really familiar with what this is then if we step back a level and we look at a row right this is going to be a single structured data item in a table and rows are comprised usually of multiple related cells right so we see in this case i have four cells with values one john doe and wizardry and these all related together in a single row in cassandra partitions are the base physical unit of access so this is how the data is stored physically on disk so let's take a look at the example here and notice to the very right we have the department column and all the values are wizardry now in this example we have set department as our partition key which means we're just partitioning by department well even though i have three rows here given that each one of the rows has the same partition key same wizardry partition key these are actually all stored in the same physical partition so these are actually stored together and they are also retrieved together so if i were to then say select star from this table where department equals wizardry i would get back all these values now if we go ahead and step back even further and look at a table now that has multiple partitions so again in this case i have three rows that hasn't changed but look at our department notice it's wizardry dark magic and devrel again since i'm partitioning by department i would actually have three separate physical partitions here wizardry dark magic and devrel even though i have three rows so in my single logical table if i were to select star from this table i would get back all three rows that i see but i would actually be accessing three separate physical partitions in my cluster okay so let's step back even further right and now you can see a key space so a key space is just a container of tables it's where you set replication it contains the tables it's similar to a database or a schema from a relational database and then within the key space i have any of my tables and again just like we were talking about i have my rows and columns there and and those tables are separated into our physical partitions based off of our partition key so let's go ahead and look at a concrete example because i really like concrete examples as a way to really illustrate things so in this example here you see we have a killer video key space so it contains my tables and in this case we have a table called users by city now i want you to notice the convention here i want users partitioned by city so that's how we do that we say the buy and then whatever that is is what i'm partitioning by so in this example we're partitioning by city so notice i have two two different values for city phoenix and seattle these are my physical partitions now again logically if i were to select star from this table i would see everything that you see here underneath the hood physically i would actually be storing my data in two physical partitions phoenix and seattle now notice how both phoenix and seattle have multiple rows of data and what we've done here is we set what's called a clustering column so you can use clustering columns for order or uniqueness because it's important that your primary key uniquely identifies a row right with ordering in a clustering column take a look at last name notice how last name in phoenix is helsin last fall and smith while clustering columns by their nature what they'll do is this data is being written into the database the data is going to be naturally ordered for those types that fit this kind of thing in a case of a text field it's alphanumeric so h comes before l it comes before s and so on so again that's automatically happening it's actually stored that way on disk anything that's not a partition key or a clustering column are what we call data columns this is essentially the payload of your data right so most the time i'll be selecting by some values uh they're in my partition key and my where clause and my clustering columns and then i will be getting whatever data i have in the table and then if you look at then how do we create a table this should look very familiar to you if you've come from the relational world with sql it matter of fact cql is a subset of sql so and that's on purpose it's there to really kind of help folks who've been doing things with sql kind of come back to natural home if you will it's a language that everyone knows and it's been very well indoctrinated over decades so we're using that here so if we look at the syntax we have create table i'm going to use my key space dot whatever the table name is i'll set up a set of column definitions city last name first name whatever they happen to be in their types and then really at the bottom that's the key thing we're getting at is the primary key so take a look at what's happening here in all tables in cassandra by the way you must include at least one partition key that's city so we're saying we're going to partition by city anything else that comes after that are clustering columns now notice the parens that are around city that's also denoting a partition key now the reason why we're using parens it's just a good mechanism to use to denote what the partition key is also if you're using a composite partition key you have to include the parens to tell cql these columns belong to my partition key so it's just a good idea to always include the parens that way if you just have one column in your partition key well it's very clear which one's your partition key and if you happen to be using a composite you also very clearly know that is the partition key so the real thing that you want to keep in mind with a primary key is that it must ensure uniqueness its real primary purpose is to ensure a row is unique and it may also define sorting with what we call clustering columns the key thing to take away here is that primary keys really are to define a unique row then if you take a look at the partition key itself that is used to partition our rows so again when i was talking about the convention we use where i have like users by city i want some some data i want my users i'm going to partition by city okay so let's take a look at clustering columns clustering columns are really there to either sort define sorting or uniqueness now in the first example that we have let's take a look at the uniqueness example notice how the first example says city last name and first name but it's got that big red x that says not unique why is this imagine what might happen if i had say two jane does or john does in the same city so city orlando last name doe first name jane well in cassandra last right wins right so what would happen is if i inserted some data using that first example for jane doe in orlando and then later on i had another jane dona orlando a different jane doe then the last run would effectively just overwrite the first one last right wins so again since the primary purpose of the primary key is to ensure uniqueness of a row look at what we've done there in the good example where we've added email so i have i'm partitioning by city then clustering by last name first name then email why because email is what we call a natural key you generally are not going to have two of those that are shared between two different people so if i then had two jane does in orlando well guess what they're going to have different emails now i can ensure that that row is unique now if you take a look at the bottom example here this is one of the examples of sorting so in the first example i am partitioning by video id but then i'm clustering by comment id now if i have a case in my ui or my app where for every video i want to be able to show all the comments that's wonderful and this will work however comments usually make more sense when they are in time order right if i have a set of comments on a video uh and then later on i view them if they're all just shown to me in a random order they're not going to make much sense as far as a conversation goes so in the bottom example there notice that we added created at as a clustering column so what's going to happen now is cassandra is going to naturally sort that so remember clustering columns can be used for either sorting or uniqueness so in this case what we're doing is we're partitioning by video id we're ordering by created at and then we're using comment id for uniqueness so not only do i have a unique row for each video and comment combination but at the same time because of created at those comments will be automatically and naturally sorted in time that way when they're returned to me they'll be sorted in the way that i would expect a conversation to happen okay so some rules of a good partition first thing is you want to store together what you retrieve together really what it comes down to is you want to be able to whatever you store together when you go to retrieve it later you want to retrieve it in one read or the fewest amount of reads as possible so going back to the example i was using a moment ago let let's say i'm looking at a youtube app when i look at the video i also want to retrieve those comments so the first example does exactly that for any given video i'm going to retrieve all the comments for that video in one read the second example there though notice it's partitioned by common id and then i have you know i'm clustering but created out that's great i'm gonna have these ordered comments but i will have a separate partition for every single comment that means if i had a video that had a thousand comments i would then have to iterate through all thousands of those comments in queries to be able to get those back right so i'm not storing together what i retrieved together the first example is in one read i can retrieve all the data on the second example i have to do a lot of subsequent queries to get all my data put together so another thing you want to avoid are big partitions right so cassandra has some pretty nice limits as as far as you know it's technically unbounded however there are practical limits on how big your partitions can get and how many rows you should really store in them and this all really comes down to maintaining your performance at scale right because cassandra is all about being able to maintain your very tight slas and your read and write performance at scale so what this really comes down to is once you start to get around 100 000 rows per partition you really need to break it up it's the same thing if you get to about 100 megabytes per partition the key thing you don't want is to cause what we call unbounded partition growth or have particularly large partitions so let's take a look at our examples here notice the first example we're partitioning by video id we have our created at in our common id so in this particular case yeah you know if i have a particularly popular video i may end up with a hundred thousand comments per video but probably not right and for the particular payload i'm i'm probably going to be within my hundred megabyte size limit as well now the example on the bottom though the one with the red x i'm partitioning by country and then i'm clustering by user id what might happen if i hit a country like india and i'm storing a role for every single person in india how many billion people are in india right now so i'm completely going to go past the 100 000 row practical limit here um and and that would actually grow you know pretty large so again the top one is keeping me within my limits where the bottom one there has a very good chance to grow pretty big now another thing you want to avoid are unbounded partitions so take a look at this iot example the first example here we give notice we have we're partitioning by our sensor id and then reported at right so reported is going to be the time that some data comes in or something like that now what might happen though if for a particular sensor we're reporting data every five seconds or every 10 seconds right i could end up with significant growth in a very short period of time how much data might this turn out to be say in a month a year right and it's totally unbounded there is nothing to limit the size of this partition for one particular sensor so what i want to do is what we call bucketing notice now what happened in my partition key instead of just sensor id it's sensor id and month year so now we're bucketing this by the month and a year so for each month what's going to happen i'm going to be capped i'll be capped at the amount of data i get for any particular sensor in a month right so this way i can now properly size and kind of anticipate what the size of my data is going to be and the top example it's completely unbounded and that partition would just continue to grow and then the last one here is you want to avoid hot partitions now there is a relationship or can be a relationship to big partitions a hot partition really just means a case where one partition is really getting hit compared to all the other ones like all the read requests are going there and what it does it ends up in an unbalanced cluster right where i have just a subset of nodes that are taking on the brunt of all of my operations and requests so going back to our country example that we used before in india imagine the difference i might have in the reads the amount of reads that i have to partition if i have some kind of app that has lots of users logging in and using it and i have a country like india compared to a country like iceland india has a lot more orders of magnitude more people in it than iceland does and for this particular app we're just going to assume that that means i also have a lot more folks that are constantly hitting that india partition right so this is a case where i very well may have a hot partition where i have one partition that's really taking all the line share of my operations and unbalancing my clusters alrighty so that wraps it up here for video three of seven partitions tables and examples join me for video for next as we do an exercise [Music] already i hope you liked that previous video giving you a little bit of primer on tables and partitions and some examples and uh we're gonna get in now creating a table in our intro to cassandra fort developers crash course this is video four of seven uh again there is a link in the video details all we're really doing notice that hash to create a table we're just leading you to the anchor right um but if you didn't see that all you need to do if you remember we were over here before we're just going to section two create a table now this point our killer video cluster should be nice and active right our database should be active it should be ready to go um so here's what we're going to do first thing is you want to go to your database so we're just going to click on it i'm clicking on kill the video cluster and we're going to the detail page for that particular database now i want to go to cql console right i'm going to click on that that's what we're talking about right here it's going to automatically log you in boom now you're ready to go okay so the first command that we want to issue here and by the way you can just copy these where it says command execute you can just pop it right off the page i'm going to put that in here we're describing our key spaces that's what that means we want to look at all the key spaces that we have in our database now remember we created one called killer video so it's right there ready to go now if i were to start just issuing commands it wouldn't probably do me much good at this point what i want to do if i scroll down and go to the next one here is use i'm going to tell the console i want to use the killer video key space i want to put the console in the context of the killer video key space now i can just start issuing cql commands against it i could have technically done that without the use command and fully qualified all of my cql commands but we're not going to really worry about that i just wanted you to be aware of the use keyword and what it does okay so let's go ahead and go down to create or step 2c create the users by city table now this should look a little bit familiar because if you've been following along in the crash course you would have already come across this particular example so what we're going to do now is we're going to grab this and we're going to create our table so again remember using cql this is create table so we're going to say okay i want to create a table if it doesn't exist called users by city here are my fields here are the types right so these all happen to be text and then i'm going to set my primary key set my city as the partition key last name first name and email are clustering columns now if i describe tables right because before i didn't have any oh look now i have a users by city table because we just created it and that's it i mean the exercise is pretty simple from that standpoint right i just wanted to get you a feel of using a little bit of the cql and what that does so now you've gone you've described your key spaces you've used the killer video key space you created a table and you use described tables to show you any of the tables that you have that is the end of this particular exercise so go ahead go on into the next video and then we will see you back here to execute some crowd operations [Music] hello and welcome back to our intro to cassandra from developers crash course this is video 5 of seven the art of data modeling so in the previous sections we got into some of the basics of data modeling things like what's a table what's a key space you know what's a primary key so on and so forth and that's great for building up that base set of knowledge but then what happens when you actually want to start data modeling in cassandra what does that look like so that's what we're going to do in this section so the first thing we just want to do is kind of review some terms so we're all on the same page right the first one we see here is normalization so if you've done any work with a relational database before a normalization is probably going to feel somewhat familiar this really came from a time where disk space was not cheap and disks were not fast so normalization is really the process of reducing the amount of redundancy setting up data integrity and such like that and so you go through this process of normalization with your data and then you come up with something like kind of what you see here on the right hand side so we've got a very simple example where i've got two tables i have the employees table and the departments table and in the employees table i'm going to find out okay who are my employees and what information do i have with them but let's say that they work in various of departments now in a normalization method most likely i'm going to separate the departments out into a separate table and why do i do this right well this comes down to the data redundancy piece i don't want to have a bunch of redundant data i want to have a single instance for everything that exists every type or whatever so i'm only going to have one engineering department one math department and then i'll use these relationships so use what's called a foreign key to then make a relationship between one table and another so if you notice up in the employees table not only do i have a user id per user but i also have a department id so i'm making that connection back to the departments table but again i only have one instance of each type if you will so another thing to kind of point out here is that for normalization um you know there's some pros and cons right um the rights are pretty darn simple right if i want to add a new department i just add it right to the department table done right no big deal um data integrity is also a definite pro of the normalization methods and the way we do things with relational databases the cons though really from a scalability standpoint imagine now if you're 20 tables deep right where you have all of these joins between all these tables at runtime right so you have to read and do all these cartesian joins and everything the queries can become very complex as well again as you have all of these different joins and you have to bring all these different pieces of data together so another technique though is called denormalization this is essentially the opposite of normalization right so denormalization is a strategy that is used to increase read performance now this is something that in the relation world is generally not used unless you're talking like data warehousing or if you have a particular need for read performance where you need to flatten out the data in this case this is something where if you notice look at the table now i have a single employees table and i have the same edgar cod engineering you know so on and so forth but notice that the department column is actually part of the table and i'm repeating data right so one of the the strategies here is to you know we're not worrying about redundant data right we're actually saying yes data i can have redundant data and why because in databases like cassandra and more in the nosql world technology was different so cassandra is making it's making a trade-off it's saying i'm going to optimize for read performance at scale and i'm going to use up more disk space to do so and the good thing is that today compared to other commodities other things like memory cpu so on and so forth disc is actually the cheapest and you know with solid state drives things have gotten significantly faster from the time that when relational databases were first created so we make this trade-off and this trade-off actually works in this case so yes we're going to go ahead and repeat data here the key difference is this notice there's no joins you don't have joins in cassandra i make one read from one row if i want to get say edgar codd and i read from that partition i have all of my data in one shot right again it is an optimization for read performance at scale now again some of the pros i just mentioned the quick read performance also your queries are much much simpler without having say 20 nested joins or something like that your queries are very simple compared to a lot of the relational counterpart queries now there are some cons though now if you imagine i have multiple writes potentially right depending on where say that department data needs to go i may need to write to multiple tables where in the normalized relational sense i wouldn't i would just write to a single department table and anybody who had a relationship to that would then get that update in the case of a denormalized data model i now may have potential rights to multiple places and then from the integrity standpoint you don't have the same type of integrity constraints that you do in a relational database here so you do have to keep up on that on your own uh again though the big the big reason for this though is read performance and cassandra is completely built to be able to maintain its performance at scale that's a key key thing and if you couldn't tell already yes denormalization is the data model pattern that we use in cassandra so let's look at this from the flow of how i apply my normalization techniques my data modeling and then where developers come into play so in relational data model i'm going to start off with my data i'm going to analyze that raw data i'm going to identify all of their relationships their properties and the entities i'm going to use that to generate my data model using my normalization data model patterns my normalization patterns then after that point from the application standpoint from the developer standpoint then we would do what we would take a look at whatever um you know the uh the the er diagram or whatever was you know designed whether that's through your dba your data architect or whatever and you would use that as like the source of truth and you would then determine well what queries do i need for my application and then use that to determine well okay how do i build those up what tables do i need to join that kind of thing in cassandra we're going to flip this on its head watch what happens so in this case we're going to start with our application workflows we're going to start there with the application we're going to use that to generate our data model and our queries and everything and then apply our data now the question some of you might be thinking is does that mean i need to come up with my queries ahead of time yes actually and i'm going to go through a process right now we're going to go through that so before you think i'm crazy we're going to go through that process and show you how this works okay take a look at this diagram this is the flow right so i mentioned a moment ago we're going to start with our application workflow and our entities and relationships this conceptual data model and our application workflow matter of fact for most of us who have been doing relational work or any kind of application development you're going to recognize a conceptual data model in a heartbeat the application workflows this is really just the workflow that your users go through right as they are working through your app i mean you could literally start drawing out a ui and a napkin and you've already started to determine like some of the application workflow now we're going to take these two things and then we're going to use that to start generating our conceptual you know mapping our conceptual to our logical data model we'll then kind of refine our logical data model a little bit then go through any optimizations if we need to and finally end with our physical data model this will be the data model we actually implement in the database so let's take a look so here is our conceptual diagram so notice in this particular case i have users and videos so imagine that this is for an application that's like youtube right where i have videos and when i go to those videos i have comments on those videos and users can also have comments as well so we see this relationship if you look at users and videos you can see i have this relation between users commenting on videos and video videos being commented on by users not only that notice that both users and videos have a set of attributes right users have an email they have an id videos have a title a description so on and so forth so by using my entity relationship diagram i can then start to map out what those relationships are going to look like now let's move into the application workflow so again i have these these two pieces users and videos again it's like a youtube like application so in one case use case one there a user opens a video page right so they're gonna go to some video page and i probably wanna see all the comments for that video so if you look at the workflow one here it says find comments related to target video using its identifier most recent first so all i'm saying is i want to go ahead and get the comments for a target video right so some video i click on i want to see its comments using its identifier meaning probably some key and then most recent first what am i saying there i'm essentially just saying i want the comments in time order because in an application like that for comments if i have comments in a random order they're probably not going to make much sense right so i want to go ahead and see those at most recent first now if we take a look at the second use case a user opens a profile pretty much in any retail ecommerce app whatever the vast majority of us have built and use applications that require us to log in we have some profile that goes with us same deal here so here the user logs in opens their profile and now we want to see all of their comments right across their videos and stuff so in this case you see workflow 2 i want to find comments related to the target user using its identifier again probably some user id or something again get most reason first right again i want to see those in time order so right now those two simple application workflows we're starting to map out what our data model is going to look like so the next thing i want to do is now generate some pseudo queries based off of that so query 1 here find comments posted for a user with a known id right so by some id i want the comments now if you look in the right hand side you're going to see this little kind of pseudo table comments by user so in cassandra the convention we use for a table name is whatever whatever the payload is by whatever i'm partitioning by so i want comments partitioned by user that's what we're saying comments partitioned by user and query2 there again i want to find comments for a video with a known id same deal comments by video i want comments partitioned by video and both of them if you know to say show most recent first going back to that kind of thing where i want them in time order that's what that means now i can take this and i can start generating my queries check this out so i'm essentially saying get all the columns so select star get all the columns from comments by user where the user id is some id that's it that's uber simple that query alone once you start to see that the the tables we're going to use that will get me all of the comments per a particular user now if you look at the second one there again i want to select all the common all the columns that's what that star is from my comments by video so i want all the comments by video or video id is again some id this is going to be the id of the video that will give me all of the comments for a video so you notice we haven't even applied any data yet we literally just started with our application workflows in our entity relationship diagram and we're just starting to map this out and we can already generate some of the queries that we're going to use okay so let's take a look at what this looks like when you start bringing in to the logical data model so if you notice here i have our two tables again now let's start on the left with comments by user and see that we have user id so user id that k that k means it's a partition key so if you remember from the previous section we talked about some of the components of the primary key are the partition key and or clustering columns k means partition key the c there you see with the arrow means clustering column the arrow means the order so what we're saying here is with user id i want to again this is the comments by user table so i'm partitioning by user so i am partitioning by user id and then i'm ordering uncreation date and comment id there you see that notice the arrow for creation date is down i'm saying it's descending right what's that going to do for me well that means it's going to show them in descending order so i'm going to see the most recent first right so if i just select star from this table with no other constraint i'm immediately going to get the very latest comments in descending order and then the rest of the information is just my payload so video id and comment if you take a look on the right hand side comments by video is essentially the same thing the only difference is i'm now partitioning by the video id and in my payload i have the user id and comment instead of the video id and comment now you might notice here i'm repeating some data yes right it's denormalized and again like we said before in cassandra we use a denormalized data model that's why you know we do that again for read with optimize read performance so what this means is in each one of these cases i can then do a single read to get all the data back for the question that i have okay so now this is starting to map out our logical data model let's move over to the physical data model so i want you to see something that just happened here i'm gonna go back notice creation date and common id i want you to watch what happens oh i lost a column what happened well now as i start to map out my types and everything as part of the physical data model so you see that user id has a uuid i'll talk about that in a moment what i want you to notice is comment id then got collapsed down to a time uuid what happened there well i used to have two columns creation date and comment id and as part of going into my physical data model there's an optimization that we performed i just encapsulated those down into a single type a single field common id a time uuid is a combination of a timestamp and a uuid that you can put in a single field it's a nice optimized type of field for cassandra now to be sure if i implement my data model like this would there be any problem no right i'm going to use a little bit more space and such but you know it's it's not that big of a deal so it's just an optimization you don't have to do it but i just want to give you a feel for the types of things you might optimize when you're moving from your logical data model into your physical data model so now i've got my user id is a uuid my common id is a time stamp and a uuid so you know combining both created at and common id into one field my video id is also ui id and then comment here being text now the next step is to map this to tables i mean it goes that quick actually once you get used to this pattern it's it's actually pretty it's pretty straightforward so notice here um if you're familiar with sql this should look familiar this is cql cql is a subset of sql um it looks very familiar to it uh but you'll notice my create table i have create table if not exists my table name comments by user i have a set of my fields their types and then notice my primary key if you remember we designated a partition key with k so my primary key that first field with the parens again i have user id comma and then my common id is going to be my clustering column and notice that with clustering order my clustering order by common id descending we're saying i want it descending order that way later on when i read this data out i do not need to do an order by i do not need to pay the cost of an ordering an order at read it is actually being saved in order on disk so when i go to retrieve it later not only do i get everything in one partition by that one user id but it's already in time ordered format so this is all optimized for your read performance at scale right and again this is whether it's three nodes or thousands of nodes to ensure that you can maintain your tight slas at any scale with cassandra okay so that's the that's the overall process that's it you can start with your application workflows you work those out you use those to generate your pseudo queries your pseudo tables you start to then just refine and notice because in a denormalized data model we don't have all the joins and everything the queries are actually extremely simple and so you can take that to just generate your queries matter of fact the general idea is query per table right one query per one table and you'll be off to a good start okay so thanks so much let's go ahead and get into an exercise and kind of reinforce some of what you learned [Music] and welcome again this time we're in our final exercise in our intro to cassandra for developers crash course video 607 this is the execute crud operation um so the last link here again we're going back to our repo notice the hash three execute crud operations again the link is in the video details all right so we were we left off at the end of two we created our table wonderful so what we're gonna do is go down to execute crud operations now this exercise is probably the it is the longest of um the ones we've been doing so far you know originally we just kind of created our database and created a table kind of going along with the videos you watch hopefully you watch the art of data modeling and now we're here where we're going to create some more tables we're going to see more about our crud operations our create read update and delete type operations and these are the type of operations that you're going to use in any kind of interaction from an application to a database right you're always going to have a case where you need to create things where you need to read things we need to update things and you need to delete things so now we're going to go over what those commands look like okay so the first couple things we want to do if you remember we talked a lot about comments by user and comments by video so we're going to go ahead and create those tables just like we talked about in the video let's go ahead and create those again now i am continuing on from what we did previously so i'm already using the killer video key space if for some reason you left and like came back or something make sure to do that otherwise you're probably going to get some errors okay so we've created our tables let's go ahead and describe them again you can just copy the commands out of the command execute and we see we have our three tables comments by video comments by user and users by city we created earlier now the first operation we want to look at is the c the create right so when you create things in cassandra you're going to use an insert statement now by the way if you've come from the sql and relational world and you're checking out cassandra for the first time insert should look very familiar that's because it's the same thing um sql or i'm sorry sql is a subset of sql it looks and feels just like it right so yes there may be some differences under the hood like you don't join between tables or anything but the syntax is largely the same except for some commands that are specific to cassandra but for what we're doing now this should all look and feel very familiar okay so the first thing we want to do is insert some data we have our tables right so we want to insert some data into our comments by user table now something i want to point out here um is that for those of you who are familiar with something like a uuid you might be asking why are we using these hard-coded uuids would i ever do this in the real world um the reason why we're doing this is for our when when we do our workshops and our crash courses and everything um we usually have lots of people who are doing them all at the same time so it is much easier for us to use these hard-coded values so if somebody runs in some trouble we know exactly how to help them if everybody was generating their own uuid it would be very hard to track down so my point of this is you're going to see a lot of cases where we're using these hard coded values however in the real world i would actually be using something like this where i would use uuid with these parens if you're interested in that right you can just go to the docs there it'll explain all about it they're extremely easy to use like i like you see where i'm using now with the prince i would literally just put uuid with the parents to generate that on the fly right i'm not really getting into a lot of detail about what uuids are for and how to use them essentially they are a way in a distributed system to ensure that you have unique keys which is very important if you're coming from the relational world and you're like well if i'm going to have a user id i'll just use an integer and then i will just increment that integer and for a relational database that's fine but for a distributed database where i have multiple machines multiple nodes if you remember from the very beginning of this course then what happens is if i have say two users that are being created at the same exact time and there's say a network partition and two nodes can't talk well if i'm using integers and both users get creative with an integer of one what's going to happen is when that network partition recovers and those two nodes can talk to each other last right wins right so one of those is just going to disappear and that's a collision we don't want that in cassandra we don't want that in any distributed system so we use uuids instead for ids that way i know from a distributed sense my ids are safe i don't have to worry about those collisions okay enough of that so what we're going to do is we're going to grab all these insert statements i'm just going to go ahead and put those in we're just populating our data right you see this insert into comments by user we're specifying the fields now i purposely kind of like spelled them out this way to make it very clear what each one was for um in the real world like i would probably more do something like what you see here where i'm just listing out the columns and then for whatever values or whatever columns i have i'm now saying okay the values so if you were to take a look at this i'm saying the user id value is this first one a comment id value is the now right so on and so forth so they have a one-to-one relationship and you can see that we're using now to generate our timestamp and we've just inserted some data okay let's scroll down a little bit let's go ahead and put some data into our comments by video table as well and again the idea here is just to give you a feel for how the insert statements work right we look over on the side you can see i have my insert into whatever table the column names and then values with the actual data okay that's inserting right that's that's pretty simple you can use it insert you can also use update i'll get there in a moment but for now create is insert okay so moving on to read well now we've put some data in the system so how do we read it so that's where you see this command the select star from comments by user i'll go ahead and do that and look at that oh i can read back all the data we just inserted now something i want to point out and this is very important so if you were falling asleep at all wake up at this moment because what i'm just about to say is really key the way the only reason why i'm even doing something like a select star from comments by user when using cassandra without specifying a partition key in my where clause like i am here is because i know that we only have you know four rows of data and a couple partitions and that's it if you were to do this on a real cassandra cluster with a real production data set and i'm talking if you had a case of you know like thousands or millions of partitions in rows if you issue this you would have just caused a full scan on your whole cluster that's this little blurb i'm talking about right here this is never something to do for real in your app especially in a production system again we are using a very small data set here so i just happen you know we just happen to be able to do this i just want to point that out i'm not going to belabor it anymore and if this goes back to what we talked about in the very beginning of this crash course with the way that cassandra works and again it is you always want to use that partition key right and that's what we're doing here so in this example we're doing the same thing but we're saying okay well i'm going to put the partition key because user id is my partition key in the comments by user table but i'm going to put that in my where clause and now i'm pulling back just that partition notice the difference right i get that single partition back compared to multiple again i have a couple in this case but if i was working with production data i could have millions or billions and you do not want to cause a full scan across your cluster okay so we've just read some data pretty simple right let's go on to some others we're going to read all of the comments all the data from the comments by user and comments by videos table okay you can see that those came out this is again based off the data we inserted earlier so this is us reading with a select statement all right scrolling down a little bit more now let's go ahead and update by the way before we do that i do want to point one thing out um we talked about the time uid field back in the data modeling portions of the series here time uid is actually a really cool field it essentially combines both a uuid and a time stamp into a single type a single object it's really nice and convenient actually so if you do have a case to use it i suggest go ahead and use it okay so now moving on to step 3d this is where we're going to update some data now if you take a look at what we had done previously right and we created some data using this insert statement we said oh my god that oh my god that guy patrick is such a geek right and in the data here it is right you can see we've got that data right here and if we take a look at the comments by video table here that we created earlier right this is the same one you don't need to copy these we've already done this in order to update some record we need to know what the primary key was to create the record right so if you take a look at the primary key here you'll see it's video id so our partition key is video id and then we're clustering by command id and this forms my primary key so i need those two values because if i'm going to update a column in that particular row remember the primary keys they do what they they determine you know a unique row so if i'm going to update some column in a row i need to give it the exact address to where those things are so i need both video id and comment id so what we're going to do here is notice in our statement i have both in my where clause so i'm going to say update the table name comments by video i'm going to set comment i'm going to change the comment so it's existing right now it is oh my god that guy patrick is such a geek and we're gonna update it to oh my god that guy patrick is on fleek right but notice what i'm doing in the where clause here where video id is that id and the comment id remember a primary key is a combination here a video id and comment id so i'm passing both of those into my where clause so i'm essentially saying hey update the comment column specifically for this row with video id and comment id okay let's go ahead and do it okay and notice i did a select statement right there after it so it does select it and now you see that that has been changed oh my god that guy patrick is on fleek so we've updated the data from one value to another value all right so then moving on to delete the d in crud so we're going to delete some data i'm going to scroll down um now one thing i want to point about point out about deletes real quick right and i kind of talk about this right here so in cassandra when you delete you're actually inserting now if you want to you can look up what are called tombstones as a matter of fact if you go and i'll talk about this here in a minute if you go to any of our free online courses where you really get into the deep fundamentals of cassandra you'll definitely find out about tombstones um so cassandra is built to perform at scale and it's also built in such a way to ensure that when you do insert and i'm talking this is a petabyte level database you could have thousands of nodes and when you perform a delete operation it's actually creating what's called a delete marker tombstone and that is an insert on its own now why am i telling you about this well because how you delete matters right so if let's say that you had a table that had a million rows in it right would you want to delete and let's say you want to get rid of the whole table right now if you knew you wanted to get rid of the whole table the way to do it is to use truncate right if you're like okay i just want to drop everything from this table use truncate that is the most efficient operation from that standpoint however if you just wanted to say delete a subset of the data in that table and you want to delete a set of partitions then you want to delete at the partition level right now compare that to deleting every individual column of every row if you had like a million rows i mean other than that being just little nuts you would actually be creating a delete marker for every single one of those columns instead of one delete marker for the partition huge difference there right so my whole point is this in my my little tangent here is when you're deleting delete the largest set of data that you can at a time if you know you need to delete the partition deleted the partition the only time you should delete an individual column is when you really truly need to delete just an individual column right you keep that in mind you'll be totally good okay so moving on if i want to delete something i just issue the delete from command so i'm going to say delete from again my table name comments by video again notice i'm providing both the values that are in my primary key so this case my partition key of video id and my clustering column a common id because i want to ensure in this case that i'm deleting this row i'm deleting a specific row if i by the way just did this and i did not do by command id i would delete the whole partition right you see how that works so i can choose so what i'm going to do is i'm going to delete just the individual row most likely the one we're working with and look boom that one that oh my god that guy patrick is on fleek you'll see that that is now gone because we selected it back out as we're done so i have effectively deleted that row okay that's awesome thank you so much for joining me through this crash course and going through the exercises i hope this is just the start of your journey with cassandra there is so much you can do with this database it is just so capable and can perform at scale like no other database out there today and finally if you want to learn more if you want to dig deeper don't forget to go to the datasets for developers link here that'll bring you to datasacks.comdev there are all sorts of things to learn free learnings and everything that are there on that page and help you get a little bit deeper into your cassandra knowledge and then don't forget we do have one last video and i'm going to bring you into some resources that you get to check out and thank you so much well hello again and welcome to what's next in video seven seven of our intro to cassandra for developers crash course so here all i wanna do is very briefly give you a whole set of resources that you can use to continue your learning your interaction with the community everything that you might need to know to get deeper into cassandra first thing here is going to be academy.datastax.com academy is really a great place to go if you really want to dig more into the fundamentals more into data modeling essentially because we only scratch the surface with the topics that we touched here today in this crash course so you can go there and get a lot more knowledge there's also datasacks.com dev as a matter of fact i'm going to provide some links in the video description that will bring you directly to some of the cassandra fundamentals and data modeling courses there and what's really cool about slash dev is you can run cassandra right there it's an it's an embedded experience it'll run right in your browser it'll spin up a cassandra instance for you and everything and you can go through all of the examples and tutorials another one here is community.datastax.com think of this like stack overflow for cassandra so anything here dealing with the magic cassandra if you have technical questions you know if you're running your own clusters and you run into you know some snag or something or if you're working through a data modeling exercise whatever community.datasets.com is a really good great place to go to get experts from all around the world who can help answer your queries and then finally here we have our data stacks developers youtube channel where we are always putting out new content including a crash course just like this we have workshops that we do all sorts of materials that are showing up there and if you subscribe then you'll be notified every time something new happens so you can help level up your game in cassandra and all the other things we talk about there um we do weekly workshops so every week we have some workshop going on both in latin america uh north america and on wednesdays usually and then we have our emea and apac regions on thursday uh where we do the same workshop we usually have at least one new topic that's coming out each month but we have workshops every week so definitely something to come take a look at we get into the application world how do you build applications with the cassandra cassandra fundamentals itself data modeling kubernetes doing things with cassandra and kubernetes all sorts of things so definitely come take a look at our workshops where we get to interact with you and you get to ask your questions live and then finally our discord channel our fellowship of the rings discord channel this is really a great place to come and if if you're actively working on stuff maybe you're in one of our workshops or maybe you have your own cluster or whatever and you want to just be able to chat
