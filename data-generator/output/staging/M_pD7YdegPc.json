[Music] hey everybody my name is uh raul singh uh and i'm a platform architect at the anat corporation today i'll be talking uh to you about the cassandra toolkit which is my list of tools for center titans this is a tool kit that i wish i had been given when i first started off with cassandra about eight years eight years ago i work for a company that creates and manages global data platforms with cassandra spark and kafka if you would like to work with us we're hiring uh please check us out on the internet at www www.not.us and i would love to talk and have you uh show us something that we don't know we architect things meaning we create and manage design or make in computing global platforms i don't know if you can see my t-shirt but that's my t-shirt i'm an architect what do we love we love scalable fast data and how to do it uh we use open source technologies and our cloud neutral but we also use commercial technologies because they make our lives a lot easier and we support open source and commercial source and cloud what are those well that's what we're going to actually talk about today are to help you identify some of these icons if you don't know what they are a lot of these tools you may be familiar with but you may not be familiar with how to use them with cassandra and today i hope to give you the the master list of tools that if you learn them all you will be a master of cassandra a titan so you're a day-to-day engineer or an operator an architect what should you get started with well you know my list includes these three tools to start with mobax term is on windows at least it's probably the best tool for uh working with cassandra and i'll show you why d beaver probably uh the most widely at least i've seen in my profession most widely used with cassandra in a lot of different places to kind of have a gooey interface to corey cassandra and and make modifications to schemas and things like that uh but uh the one that i i don't see too many people use but i wish they did uh it's a tool called accolade and hacklade is a general nosql data modeling tool but it's it's it has specialization on cassandra the main takeaways is um if you use mobx term you can manage many many sets of servers um sometimes you need a a like a quick go-to to look at all your servers and quickly jump in and do a query that's where dbeaver helps and uh tools like accolade aren't just good for designing a schema they can also produce good documents this is mobex term in action just imagine if you have to get into 10 servers and run the same exact command or like a tail command right you'll see later on that if you're using the right automation tools you don't need to do this but every now and then you need to run the same command on all the machines well mobx term is the tool for you dbeaver as i mentioned has a driver for cassandra it lets you see not only query data but also tracing information and as you can imagine you can have connections to all the different cassandra clusters and key spaces and tables that you might want and then finally accolade accolade as i mentioned has a way to design cassandra tables and key spaces but the cool thing is that it can also help you design apis like rest apis or average schemas so i would highly recommend you take it out take a look at it if you're an architect data operations this is when we have to get data in get data out move it around take it to a party uh data operations is a big part of platform uh data platform management how do you get data in how do you get that out well you know for a longest time ds vault uh was not openly available to people uh now it's available it works with cassandra datastax and it helps you get data in and out of cassandra using csv or the json format and i'll show you a little trick on how to take data out do some transformation and get data in all using ds bulk and a few unix commands there's another tool called spark migrate or scale migrator it's by the guys that make skilla but it totally works for cassandra to cassandra moving data from one cassandra cluster to the other casino cluster um like if you want to move a table from one center cluster to another center cluster or if you want to move one table from uh one schema to another schema it's really cool and has it's all configurable right and then finally spark shell at some point if you're a cassandra dba center developer architect you probably want to have spark and spark shell at your disposal because in lieu of not being able to do you know update all of these records where xyz filtration criteria meets uh xyz uh you know where clause um spark allows you to do that it's the closest thing that you're gonna have in cassandra here's an example of using ds bulk to get data out and then to use said and awk to make some transformations on the data and then use ds vault to load it into another cluster isn't that cool i think it's pretty cool airflow and jenkins uh airflow i think a lot of people have heard about at this point um jenkins i'm sure you have come across jenkins into your job if you have not um i don't know why uh because jing has been around for a long time uh normally people think about jenkins for devops in the sense of source code continuous integration continuous delivery of source code application artifacts although these days it has so many plugins and because it's just a scheduling tool it runs things and it has dependencies on what runs after another you can actually use it to do large-scale data operations like extract this make sure it's valid transform this make sure it's valid load it here right but airflow is even better airflow is specially built for managing data and moving data it's not really for moving data it's for running the jobs that move the data running the job to transform the data airflow has a simple language which is built on top of python to describe what to do and uh there's a there's an article that you can find but basically you can use airflow to run a smart job to get that data into cassandra you can then use another operator in airflow to check some information in cassandra and then if it's valid or not depending on that you can run another spark job or a python task um normally when people go from cron jobs to airflow it's because they have a complex data pipeline and uh look at it if you're in the data world you should really know how to use airflow all right well what if you're an operator you gotta back up restore repair yeah it's not always easy to back up uh and restore with cassandra it's it's available as part of the tool but you really need to have your stuff together uh and if you don't have the right tools uh you could be in a bag of hurt as steve jobs used to say well thanks to the wonderful people at the last pickle or now at papestax and uh spotify there are two tools that can help you tremendously cassandra reaper it's a graphical user interface for managing backups and and restorations uh to and from the cloud uh sorry uh cassandra reaper is a gui for managing um repairs i'm sorry about that repairs and consider medusa is for managing backup and restores um from the cloud why because you know running cron jobs for your repairs or running cron jobs for your backups it's just not sustainable especially have lots and lots and lots of servers it's it's it's eventually you're going to make mistake right and you have to keep track of which cron task is running on which server if you use something like reaper it'll do it for you it'll keep track of all the ranges um and uh if you're using medusa it can save data from one cluster topology and then uh and use that uh backup to then restore it to another cluster topology magically reaper it's got a great interface you can even get a snapshot of how the cluster is doing there's different ways to install cassandra reaper but you can do it with a embedded database but if you want to be managing multiple clusters which you can in multiple schedules of repair recommend that you run it on top of cassandra or a database like postgres as i mentioned medusa can be used to to take a cluster back up and then restore it you can also take data back it up to the local machine and then restore it a lot a lot of cool options for free right everything i'm showing you here by the way in this presentation is open source and uh and free and if it's not open source it's free understand let's always try to understand what's going on a lot of times things don't work and people complain cassandra's not working something's wrong with cassandra and my answer is there's nothing wrong with cassandra there's something wrong with your code there's something wrong with your data model and 99.99 of the time i'm right and that's because when i dig deeper i find little things and i show that hey there's something off with your data model or hey looks like your code is doing a really weird anti-pattern here how do we figure that out later on we'll talk about using log analyzers that are constantly ingesting your logs but many times when i go into a situation they don't have elk they don't have splunk they don't have data dog there's just stuff hitting the fan right so what do i do well i use a variety of ways to grab all the logs and all of the configs thankfully these days data stacks has open source their diagnostic collection tool you run it against your cluster it grabs everything for you brings it into one you know par plot r file and my team and i have come up with a few tools to basically parse that offline and put it into elk uh other otherwise if you don't do it properly all the data comes in the same day because you're you know you get the files that want one big tarpon and the other tool that that we've just developed is called table analyzer and you'll see um what that's for but basically it's to help us understand what's happening to the data by studying this table stats in a different way you can get all the table stats metrics on a time series and you'll see something but if you look at it in a different way you'll see something else so ingesting all the data into elk right you can see things like what's happening at this time there was no log entries but all of a sudden we got a bunch of log entries what happened here right so you can zoom in and look at the warning messages info messages etc across all the servers and then you can do things like show me all of the logs um organized by the the level of the law warning info debug error right how many errors are happening how many debug statements are happening across the cluster or you could even say show me across this the cluster all of the log entries by nodes right so you can see if one node is creating a lot more traffic in the logs than another one is and then in this case we're looking at the the different java classes essentially that make up um cassandra or data stacks in this case it's data stacks um to show us what's happening how frequent are these tasks happening across these threads why is this useful well if something isn't behaving properly it's because these things are not in balance in a distributed system things should be in balance the errors happen they should be across the cluster if the warnings are happening they should be happening across the cluster then we know something is wrong systemically but if they're only happening on a few servers we know that it's not the whole cluster because nothing's wrong with cassandra there's maybe something wrong with that node right so log analysis is a powerful thing and many times you don't have access to log analysis using this tool to grab it diagnostic collection toolkit and using center analyzer you can get it up and running on your local machine then table analyzer can take the same output from diagnostics collection and show everything to you in one excel file with conditional formatting well how and why do we use this well the way we use it is we take the table stats uh which is a key value output from node tool we make it into a csv and then we pivot it and we make it into an excel it's not it's really not that complicated and then we apply conditional formatting and when we apply conditional formatting we can see patterns so for example uh and you can sort right so i sorted everything with compacted uh partition maximum bytes uh or sorry uh mean bytes and i noticed that there's one table uh on one node where the partitions are a little bit larger than basically the rest of the cluster the rest of the nodes what's happening here right another thing that we can notice here is when i filtered by just one table one key space is that in this cluster of six servers only three servers have data and it's all in one key one partition and the rest of them don't have any data what's happening there well that's a data skew and i'm not going to get too much into it but these type of insights it's really hard to get even with something like elk or even if you have op center really can't figure this stuff out now in an ideal world in an ideal world you would have something like up center and a good log analyzer and if you don't actually these days with prometheus and grafana i would say it's a little bit better actually to use for me this and grafana so there's a tool called metrics collector for patrick cassandra which actually has everything in one package for you the collector for cassandra to get it into prometheus and the grafana dashboards for you to make it so you don't have to recreate the dashboards basically right i i would say that that's a no-brainer right it's open source you can just grab it now if you are going beyond and you're going to start hosting hundreds of thousands of nodes and you want to keep those metrics somewhere to visualize them and and you know with the world of uh containers which we'll talk about a little a little later in today's session you may have a lot of cassandra nodes creating a lot of data for prometheus prometheus itself is not a highly distributed highly available data system so cortex is a project which basically runs on top of cassandra to provide a prometheus at scale it's pretty cool there's about four other systems that provide prometheus at scale i picked this one because it runs on cassandra the rest of them whatever don't worry about it and of course prometheus and grafana i mean these tools um they're indispensable in the cloud world today cloud native and cloud world today um because every major system already creates already has a collector for prometheus right so why reinvent the wheel just put everything in prometheus and then look at it on grifon because you can then correlate different events together wow isn't that beautiful that's the metrics collector for apache cassandra set up getting data from cassandra and uh into prometheus and then grafana is showing it to you and the cortex has been has been reportedly said to have done one trillion samples a day running on top of cassandra now i i i'm very objective about this splunk is probably one of the best log analytics tools out there but it's also very expensive and other tools try to come close to it but what i figure is if you don't have splunk just just use filebeat elastic and kibana it's free and if you really don't like the licensing from from found the company that makes all the stuff maybe they're called elastic i don't know what they call themselves now um amazon has something called open distro which is open source in a different they forked it and and they maintain it right um but filebeat or lockstash helps you get data into elasticsearch and then kibana helps you visualize what's in elasticsearch remember here you can use tail on there right to see what's happening right now on the cluster um for maybe six maybe eight computers depending on how big your screen is but eventually you're gonna have more and more nodes that's not gonna work right you wanna see in real time as the logs are coming in well this setup will help you do that and i didn't make new screenshots for um for this set of tools because ideally if you do have this coming in real time then you can see these trends in real time as opposed to seeing them offline now let's talk about the big leagues right infrastructure these days is code and i have a favorite tool and tool for that software configuration across or let's say in our case cassandra across 100 nodes without the right tools is i i don't know what word to describe it it's just not what you do if somebody's telling you to maintain a cluster of 60 nodes by hand uh i would go work somewhere else i would come work for a knot i'm not kidding it's it's i have had to work in in scenarios where in the middle of an emergency we had to take uh measures across all the nodes and because there weren't any systems in place it was extremely hard so now i know better i try to recommend people how to use things like terraform which is infrastructure as code why because it's it's cloud neutral first of all there are providers for basically every cloud out there including vmware right including a company called packet which does bare metal you can be like packet provider make me a server and somebody will give you a server at packet right um but it does more than that terraform manages the dependencies of all of the things that make up the cloud now because your node isn't just a node in the cloud it's got disks attached it's got network interfaces it has security groups attached right so why wouldn't you just use cloudformation or arm on azure or whatever google's is because that's a different language for each system terraform is the same syntax across the systems now you cannot literally say make a computer unless you do some some work unless you make a module um you can't just say i want five computers on google and on amazon and on uh azure using the same resource um but with the same code base you could maintain all of those three clouds without having to learn three different languages uh atlantis is a tool to manage those terraform state management in the sense that um changes to the infrastructure applying it you'll if you haven't used terraform um it's it's similar to kubernetes in the sense that you have a state locally and you hit apply and it basically applies that to the cloud and it seeks the difference between and says what do i need to do and with atlantis you can just do that with merges to github it's pretty cool tara grunt is a tool to allow you to have the same code base and manage different environment variables in an innovative way in relationship to terraform it just you can do that without teragram but in then and then what you have to do is basically have three different directories with your different states with teragram you would just have one core directory one core code base and your environment variables would be managed with teragraph and one last thing about terraform is that they have providers for you to store the state on the cloud itself and so what that means is you could make modifications to your code locally and it applies it to your 100 node cluster and somebody could make a merge into atlantis and that gets applied but when that gets applied it will pull the freshest state being stored in the cloud for you it's amazing uh what does it have to do with cassandra well you need to stand up a six note cluster for testing tomorrow push a button it'll be done in about 15 minutes you need to scale that to 36 notes you go to the file you say i want six from the six nodes i want 36 nodes and it will sense that 36 nodes are not there on the cloud it will then create them for you and after you're done with 36 nodes you want to bring it back to six you go change a variable from 36 to six you hit apply boom all of a sudden it comes back and so i know you could go to the cloud console in these different clouds and do it but to be able to do it in an audit um in an auditable manner in code you kind of have to do that with big companies cool things about terraform you know it will output after everything is done it will destroy stuff for you when you're done with it there are third-party tools that you can see the dependencies across all of the different things i geek out with terraform sorry you can like build the whole world with terraform atlantis very simple you make changes to your code you do a pull request somebody merges it it runs terraform plan somebody else merges it or hits apply and it goes ahead and runs that against the cluster right all in get ansible oh my god i don't know what i would do without ansible ansible is by far the biggest pro tool in managing large-scale clusters and ansible isn't just for physical servers right terraform creates a vault excuse me there's nobody does physical service anymore ansible isn't just for virtual machines right terraform creates your virtual machines ansible then is used to install stuff on there configure it um you can also use ansible to run ad hoc commands against your whole cluster you can do things like rolling restart ad hoc or through a playbook and there's been a gui a good graphical user interface for ansible for a while called semaphore recently red hat has actually open sourced awx which was their commercial tool ansible tower but yes mobex term could be used you can ssh you can do parallel ssh all of that or you can manage your environments with variables and the same exact playbooks get executed consistently across your clusters regardless of what size they are isn't that neat these are some third-party tools to kind of show you your playbook and all the tasks that make up a playbook you can do things like install packages add users set directory permissions across many machines right sometimes cassandra permissions go off fix permissions boom it'll go through each node and it'll fix the permissions on it ansible semaphore's got a really cool interface so if you don't like the command line you can use some before awx recently out there has a pretty good user management it also has a concept of workflows which is like a pipeline of tasks and then finally the bleeding edge containers i don't know if there's a bleeding edge anymore but um at least for cassandra it's it's bleeding edge not a lot of people are doing cassandra on containers or kubernetes um but here are some tools to pick up for what's coming and what's happening and if you want to be on the latest and greatest um so docker is useful for people that don't use docker in production because you can have a docker composition with cassandra and kafka and spark and the code that is your company's code come up in a person's virtual machine or their laptop self-contained developers can work with the whole environment in one computer now with kubernetes as part of docker for for a toolbox for windows or photographer windows you you can also have a full kubernetes application running on your computer well if you want to run something on kubernetes you have to have an image for it an oci compliant image for it docker is the easiest one and there's a cassandra container it's not really the official apache one but it's pretty good um or you can make your own right but customizing a docker container is not that hard you can just say take this one from cassandra and add to it these configurations or mount this configuration file and use that in your application in docker compose or in kubernetes now if we're going to be doing cassandra on kubernetes and cassandra has been one of the use cases on kubernetes for a long time you know if you go to kubernetes.io and you look up cassandra there's a great article on how to use stateful sets to make cassandra work on kubernetes but i shouldn't say but i should say and there's a better way to do it with kate sandra so i'm involved with the cassandra kubernetes special interest group um i've written a few articles on the patchy cassandra blog that you can check out about the progress of this group there were five different ways to run cassandra on kubernetes and two of the main players danstax and iran telecom came together and have started to work on the cassandra operator and then data stacks took that operator added to it metrics collector for apache cassandra added to it things like prometheus and grafana which you're a part of mcac and have made it easy to run cassandra the right way using the upright operator out of the box it's actually a helm chart if you know what helm is um helm chart is a way to package different parts of a kubernetes deployment and wow oh and it has reaper and it has medusa right all of that's there so why would you you know go brew your own beer when you can just go around the corner to the bar right um it's it's it's fairly new but if you want to play with cassandra on kubernetes you should check it out and my favorite not just because i like the movie stargate and i've watched the series i've always sought an easy way to get developers started on cassandra i've always sought that and there were several tools that have come and gone things like apache user grid uh there's another one called rest base um you know as a way to like give you a uh rest interface to cassandra even the dyno emulators that are out there on top of cassandra those kind of do it but but stargate is more than that stargate is an ecosystem of apis uh that are basically api extensions to access cassandra and it's i'm not going to get into its deep architecture but stargate can also run on on kubernetes so if you run stargate and kate's on on kate sandra you basically have a scalable data platform that can infinitely grow because cassandra scales kubernetes scales and the way that stargate is built it will also scale right um so containers of the future start playing with stuff now right and it's it's just easier for people to test out stuff than uh than virtual machines because they take a while to kind of comp and get installed and all that kid sandra uh just imagine you push a button and you got all the cool but not all but you get a lot of the cool stuff that we've already talked about right creeper medusa for me this graphana it's all running on whatever cloud you want because it's kubernetes and kubernetes runs everywhere basically stargate the api layer from cassandra right runs on top of cassandra and currently supports rest json graphql and cql you can talk to these nodes using cql and what's coming and actually it's already out there but i've seen the commits and issues being resolved on the github um grpc which is a general or generic rpc also commonly misnamed uh google rpc you know using protobuf amazing technology and then this this one i'm also looking forward to i don't think it's there yet which is events being able to send data via events to cassandra and get events out so now you know what are those terraform atlantis terra grunt ansible semaphore awx this layer right here basically large scale operations grafana prometheus cortex kind of your vision into uh excuse me uh the metrics d beaver hackly and novak's term your day-to-day beats elastic kibana and open distro elasticsearch for your alc stack it's called elk but nobody uses logstash anymore jenkins and airflow for data operations and then for the next generation of of cassandra docker kubernetes kate center and stargate and of course spark i mean spark i should say spark is something you should just use it works really well with cassandra uh and then the ones i didn't have actual icons for i just kind of copied and pasted the github uh avatar that it creates uh but ds bulk cassandra medusa cassandra vision cassandra reaper and the diagnostics collection tool that that's not even all the tools available but those are the ones that if you're using these you're definitely a type of cassander well we won't have time for questions today because it's pre-recorded and i apologize but thank you so much thank you so much for hearing me speak about something that i'm just i love cassandra but what i love more than cassandra are people like you using the right tools to get the job done so that you're smarter faster and better that's why uh i put this together i want all of you to have a better experience becoming sweet and great at cassandra then i because it took me a while to get all the stuff together right thanks everybody have a wonderful rest of the day and thank you datastax for bringing us all together have a good day bye [Music]

you can so can you hear me i'm seeing myself on the screen i hope the sound is good is this sound good okay okay yeah very good you can hear me so hi hi everybody again welcome um this is the see yeah i understand there's been a bit of a mess up with the naming of the rooms but i assure you this is the room for the this is the room for the talks indeed there has been right now rahul's talk um about the cassandra toolkit now i'm here to present you uh the talk about the cassandra certification which is going to be one hour more or less and it will feature a bit of explanations and a live demo of some some questions typical some questions as you would find in the cassandra certification exam so it's an excuse to study a bit and exercise a bit your knowledge of cassandra and it will be interactive so let me start let me start here first thing i would like to let me get the link i would like to draw your attention to this here this guitar prepo i will paste the link i will paste the link here on the youtube chat this is the repository containing slides slides about what i'm talking about today it will also contain some more instructions uh practical hit hints and tips to go to prepare and go to the exam and it will contain also practice questions a bit more practice questions than those we will see today because that comes from a longer talk and so you will find even more questions there to exercise okay so who am i i'm stefano i'm a developer advocate at the data stacks and these are my contacts you are welcome to to reach me out on youtube on linkedin or twitter if you want okay so let's speak about cassandra certifications um we will see we which are the available certifications for to get a certified apache cassandra what are the resources available to prepare for getting the certification and then we will see how you get the certification in practice and the rest of the talk more or less half an hour will be an interactive session with questions similar to those of the exam and you will be able to participate okay so which certification and what resources first thing i have to say is that the cassandra the apache cassandra certification is recognized as well recognized in the in on the job market and it is a verifiable certification coming from an exam done with the checks so it's something taken seriously and it is very well a very good way to make your resume stand out and to prove with a piece of paper that you are an expert on a topic that is uh in more demand than offer still that's a good point so um at the moment there is much demand for uh qualified people able to operate and work with cassandra that's a good that's an important point and by the way uh in the in the landscape of nosql database uh development and administration [Music] it is uh because cassandra working with cassandra usually there are some statistics i will show you some websites working with cassandra helps you landing a well-paid job there are numbers back in my my claim here okay so which certification should you get well let's see uh there are various certifications concerning cassandra and today i'll concentrate on the two most important if you want most important ones the entry entry point ones which are the one about the one for administrators and the one for developers so this is a small flowchart that explains how are the two study learning paths organized so there are two curriculum made by several courses and most of them are shared by the two certifications and then you will you will have to choose a specialization so there is a course an introductory course to cassandra followed by a course on the foundations which more or less covers and obviously goes much more in deep detail covers what has been what is being described by alex in the other room so the fundamentals of cassandra at this point you will be you will have to choose between two different paths you will have you can choose of course focus on operations which will lead you to the administrator certification the one you see here on the on the left and it is designed for database administrators devops engineers site reliability engineers and it is concerned about you know operation setup configuration management and so on the other choice is to go for the developer direction so if you are more an application developer or a data architect if you design database and so on you might go you won't want to go for the other course which is data modeling which is then which will then open the way to get in the certification by by passing the exam um so um which one should you choose well that depends on your career obviously but nothing prevents you from thinking of trying both and getting certification on both so you'll be you know the guy who knows cassandra head to tale and this is not a bad thing especially in a small company where you might end up having to you know know all of it and maybe teach to your company how cassandra works okay so what are the resources available for preparing for the certification well um sorry first there is a website datastax.com dev certifications which is your entry point to actually go and take the exam i will show you that uh very soon very briefly then uh you might you you want to start from the github repository i written already in the in the chat and i will put it there again just as a reference because from that point you can go to all other links so it's very important you if you want to bookmark bookmark it so this repository contains slides practice questions and other uh important tips and then there is the actual uh learning material so there is a a good deal of training on academydatastax.com that is the the academy because all of these courses are provided for free to you by data stacks so the courses and the teaching material is about apache cassandra the open source product but um the content is sponsored by datastax who obviously it is in datastax interest that as many developers as possible know and use apache apache cassandra so it is uh our interest and your interest match because it is we we want you to be good at cassandra so that's why data sponsor uh all of these materials so there is on the academydatastacks.com you find the courses there are lessons exercises and so on i will show them to you quickly later then other other very important resources are the forum so communitydatastocks.com is where you can ask questions concerning cassandra it is a bit like stuck overflow right but it's focused on cassandra and uh well many many fine and knowledgeable people from data stocks and not only from data stocks are patrol the website and answer and answer all of your questions so it's a very useful resource actually especially when you start getting your hands dirty with the database and you want to you start banging your head against the problem or you have a doubt go there there are the best uh the best uh cassandra experts in the world probably are there to to answer you so don't forget we also have a discord channel if you want to keep in contact with us on the long term if you want to keep to to carry on a discussion that's a long term kind of chat probably much better than the youtube chat because when this stream is over the youtube chat is disappeared while the discord uh will be there so you are invited to reach us there's a huge community and we are always there for you don't forget another very important thing is the is that besides the academy we also have on our website a lot of hands-on exercises so they are practice scenarios with some uh lecture lesson and scenarios you can go there you do all in the browser you work on on a real cassandra installation and you do exercises guided by by the interface and it is a very good way to learn by doing okay so let's see how do you what do you do in practice to get your certification what do you do first you go to the website i told you before so datasucks.com dev certifications and there you will see there are a bit of information about how do you how the exam is is done there are some statistics some yeah information about how and why is the the certification is important but most important take note of uh how the exam is done because the exams are done online in your browser but they are proctored which means that there will be somebody looking at you on your webcam and making sure you do the exam you follow the rules you don't cheat so you can't have a piece of paper here with your notes you can't have a phone you can't leave the desk the desk has to build clean so so there are a few rules you you probably you are required to carry to have your own id document and show it to the webcam so they can check your identity so there are a few things uh don't forget to go to the bathroom before starting the exam as you will not be able obviously to leave the desk nobody can enter and speak to you and there are a few rules uh i have to say the exam is well done is very strictly checked but it is not as patrolled as aws i mean there is a an important difference the exam does not need to be booked in advance so let's say it's saturday night and you feel like wow i'm ready i want to do the certification exam you go there you click and in a few minutes you are in contact with a proctor you will communicate through an online chat in the in your browser and in a few minutes you start doing the exam now the exam is one hour and a half so 90 minutes and it is 60 questions whatever the exam so whether it's administrator or developer it's uh 60 questions 90 minutes that does not mean that you have one minute and a half per question because you can go back and forth you can leave a question for later you can do another question very quick because there are many questions that if you are prepared are quick to answer some other might require you some thinking so you can mark questions as to review later and go back and forth and take your time and i have to say if you are prepared 90 minutes are more than enough to do it comfortably so it's not a it's not a race a time race let's say okay so um this is it for how the exam is is done let's say you have may you have made your mind and you know okay i want to take the developer certification exam okay so you have chosen your path then you go to the academy you go to data stacks academy that is academydatastax.com you sign up and all the courses will be available to you for free so you enroll with in a course or more more precisely you enroll to a learning path which is a group of courses as you see as you saw in the in the flow chart before and you do step by step all lessons and you follow through the course until completion and by the way the website keeps track of your progress so it helps you you know keeping a bookmar on on where you are in the course and the the courses are a mixture of video lessons small uh small quizzes and exercises so it's a it's a good mixture that is well done to keep you engaged and help you you know commit to memory what you are learning so let's say you finished your material you finished your courses on the academy at this point you're ready to take the exam so what do you do to take the exam now i'm going to say something that might scare you off but please don't the exam has a cost because we rely on an independent uh company to do the proctoring of the exam so it has a cost and the cost is 145 dollars but there are many ways to do it for free indeed it is our interest that as many people as possible work and know and love apache cassandra so there are various ways to get a free voucher to to take the certification exam for example you can complete if you complete the the your your learning path all three courses on the academy you can contact academydatasets.com and you will get your free voucher that's one way the other way is you can you can follow one of our many workshops that we do on this youtube channel and we do many per week there is a link here um i can paste the link here on okay so we do several workshops every week sometimes two or three sometimes even more on various topics so not only strictly databases and cassandra but sometimes also development front-end development we cover various topics of interest you can you can follow one of our workshops you can do the exercises which are there and they usually make you create a nice an instance a database on our astra db platform which is free and it is a very handy way of working with a database without having to you know set up everything on your machine after the workshop we will give instruction you can contact us and you will get your free voucher there is another way today for the cassandra day india everybody who attends the event and is registered to to the to the cassandra india they can you can go to this uh to this link the tsx dot io cd india voucher there is a feedback form that you fill and at the end you will be able to get your voucher so you see there are various ways to to to gain your voucher and go taking your exam for free sponsored by data stacks uh mind that the voucher has a limited validity of uh one month or so so before redeeming it make sure you are more or less prepared another thing is that the voucher is not issued automatically so even if you today even if you fill the form today please give us a few days say a week most top a week and you will get your voucher so don't worry okay so this is for getting the voucher [Music] last point you go and take your exam so as i said you don't have to book ahead you just go there and redeem the voucher when you when it's time to pay for the exam and you will be able to to do your exam so let's assume you will be passing the exam you can celebrate and again uh all everything i say the no links you will find in the in the github repository i mentioned uh another thing so um some usually how long does it take to get prepared for the exam well now this is a point if you follow the courses on the academy that's strictly speaking that's enough to that's enough knowledge to uh go and take the exam successfully and that might take uh i don't know two weeks or so a couple of weeks something like that if you want to get a more in-depth knowledge which is probably your goal besides the certification itself you might want to do additional exercises uh the interactive scenarios as i mentioned before you might want to start reading the documentation experimenting on your own you can go probably will come to our community datasex.com and start asking uh hairy questions and have them answered whatever so if you want to be to become a bit more knowledgeable uh more than just the bare minimum that will probably take you one month and a half or something like that so six weeks let's say anyway at some point you feel ready and you go taking your exam very good now i would like to do a very short demo on the various parts of the of the websites that i mentioned the various parts of the exam process so let me show you first this is what the academy looks like you see at the bottom you see some cards each one corresponds to a course there are actually many more than i mentioned so there are specially specialized courses on datastax enterprise products there are there is a course on kafka connector and so on in particular the first two here are the learning paths so you see admin learning path and developer learning path so you can this is in the academy so once you log once you register in the academy you will have access to those courses let's open let's open the developer learning path and you see it's made by three courses i hope you can see i make it a bit bigger it you see it's made by three courses you can enroll to them and you can look at what is in the courses this is the third one in developer path which is data modeling a very important part of developing and building the database for an application and it is you see the course is made by various modules which you see there are exercises there is a quiz there is another video lesson and so on so this is a very mixed kind of content okay so this is it now this one certificate datastax.com dev certification is the page with uh where you go to take the exam you see first okay here you see some statistics about why and how is the certification might be useful for your career at the end not don't forget to have a look at the exam rules and process which is what i was telling you before so it's a closed book exam a live proctor will watch you the extra mario should be clear of paper devices and everything and so on so the rules that they that they already touched okay so let's say if he's ready and you want to take the exam very good you click here take an exam and you will get to a registration page so okay let's say you register i am already registered so i can show you directly this part here don't forget so here you see this is now the platform that handles the exam and the proctoring so this is uh this is not on data stacks website anymore this is on metal platform so you logged in to take the exam and here you are and you're ready to um to take your exam you see there are various uh options available let's say you want to do the administrator okay so before hopping to the exam which is as all other 60 questions 90 minutes oh sorry before hoping to to actually take the exam you see there is a very important button here that makes you uh that makes a system requirement check on your machine because you need a machine a compatible machine which means most browsers but you can't have a second monitor you need a webcam and so on so this button brings you to um a page where you can do some where so a page that tests for your system so it asks to share the screen and stuff so now i'm closing because i actually do have a second monitor so the check would fail but let's say do this check after that you can take the exam you see there you see here a make payment uh tooltip don't be scared because you have your voucher ready you click make payment ah are you sure you want to take the exam yes make payment now here would be the time to pay but you see there is i hope you can see here it says have a coupon code yes i do so you enter your coupon code and that is now paid for you so there's no actual paying as long as you have a voucher but you have seen there are various ways to get one okay so this is more or less it for the demo part i can go back to i can go back to the slides and now for the live for the interactive question so okay practice questions so for this part for this part of of the talk i will ask you to connect to mendy.com with your phone and i will also do that so i can track the progress i will ask you to connect to mandy.com and enter the code 8209 6024 and when you're ready please oh i have to start this before sorry okay now you should start you should be able to connect okay please give me give me a thumbs up as you come in okay i see people joining so keep joining so we will see uh we will see 10 questions taken similar to those one might see in the exam we will take one minute and a half per question and we will discuss shortly the answers so this is not a competition indeed there is no timing take your time to answer you have one minute and a half for question this is not the same in the exam in the exam you can manage your your 90 minutes as you want but now here we want to you know we have to proceed so people are coming very good um i have to switch back and forth between the slides and the and the mentee but don't worry we will make it because the questions are more complicated and they would not fit the menti screen but still i have to collect the data okay can i paste the code sure go to mentee.com and enter code 8209 602 okay okay so let's give another minute for people to join uh so you will you will be able to give answers to to have requests and then at the end you will be able to assess whether you're you are ready to take the exam already whether you are prepared or not or you will go to academy and study more okay i think we can start now let's start ready so these are not timed questions so question one question one question one i'll enter i'll we will start and then we will go to the question itself okay so question one see consider this statement there's a create table followed by a series of insert statements now how many rows will the roller coaster table have after executing all the sql statements it will have no rows two rows three rows or four rows so does it work yes should be working [Music] are you able to give answers no indeed that's what i thought yes yes okay you're able to give answers very good very good okay so it's my mentee that is somehow went strange so think a bit about uh the table how the table is made yeah yeah sorry i will stay on the question screen as long as uh as long as we can sorry yes so have a look at the table the structure and look at the values inserted into the insert and think carefully what so how many rows will there be okay we have the answer many of you answered c and the answer is correct let's see why so you see stable has a single column in the primary key name and this column is also the partition key by the way but what's important is that only name is part of the primary key so the first insert millennium force is different than from the second formularossa is different from the third steel dragon so we have three different rows at this point but the fourth insert is again millennium force so this is an ac this is actually an absurd an override and we end up with three rows okay so only three rows are created now let me go to question number two okay okay so question number two again there's a cql statement create table something followed by four insert statements you see the values you see the table how it is structured but this time the question is what is the result of executing all the statements a table with one partition a table with two partitions a table with three partitions or a table with four partitions so think of the table structure again look at the values that are inserted try to imagine in your mind how the table is stored and partitioned i have to quickly go and having a look we have 30 seconds more to go please don't give the answer in in the youtube chat because you might spoil the reasoning for other players whether it is right or wrong okay let's have a look we have 10 seconds more to go and the result is three two one times up okay so somebody answer three a b c and i mean and many of you answer 12 so 12 of you answer d sorry what is d d is the right answer so this table has actually ends up with having four partitions let's see why because you see this table has a primary key that is made by artist and title which are both in the partition key so this is a table where every column in the primary key is also the partition key as is denoted by this double bracket is the table where every partition is by definition made by a single row so if i have four rows i have four partitions and this is the case because every different pair of artist title makes for a different partition and here we have the beatles yesterday the beatles let it be which is different because even even just the title different means two different rows and also two different partitions then there is abba fernando which is absolutely different and frank sinatra yesterday also is different so what counts is the full tuple artist title and there are four different values here so it's for different partitions so congratulations to those who answer correctly let's go forward question three question three now you see there is a sql statement that creates a table and then there are four possible queries that i might want to run on this table which one will run so look at the table structure and try to think what is a query that might actually run properly on such a table so select from cars where make equal forward select from cars where ear and color select from cars were make model and ear or select from cars where make model and color so i can tell you that only one of those will run with such a table by the way the exam is all closed choice questions so that there is a set of answers to choose from and in case there are multiple choice it is explicitly said in the question and it is also said how many correct answers are there we don't want you to you know guess try to guess with a doubt so there are 25 seconds to go think of the table of the structure think of the various constraints you have on the where close and let's see and time's up the answer as many of you correctly said is c yes very good so let's see why well let's look at this table this table has a primary key that is made by four fields two of them are in the primary key in the partition key sorry so we sure have to specify those two fields so a where clause has to specify with equal sign both make and model because they are in the partition key so uh answers a and b will not work for sure now what is the difference between answer c and answer d well the point is that besides specifying the partition key a where clause might legally specify clustering columns values but it has to give them in the order so if it specifies a clustering column it also has to put a workload condition on the previous ones in the in the list so you see we have here followed by color that means that you we can specify here equals something or ear and color equal equal but we can't specify simply color skipping here that is not correct that is not working because if you think of the underlying storage model that would involve a hopping way of retrieving data within the partition which is what cassandra does not want to do so that's why the correct answer is c you see make equal for model equal mustang and year equal 1969. okay but congratulations many of you thought of this and got it right let me go forward question number four okay so here we have a bunch of statements some create table followed by a batch containing two inserts and the question is what is a valid statement about this batch so what can be said of this it is a single partition and can be applied it is a single partition batch but it cannot be applied it is a multi-partition batch that can be applied or it is a multi-partition batch but it cannot be applied so this question is about patches and think a bit how how is how are the tables made and what kind of statements of insert statements are in the batch so the questions that we are seeing today come from the common part of the two study programs so they are questions that you might encounter both in the administrator and the developer examinations while there are also questions obviously specific there will be today no time to go into them but you can find them on the github repository so please go ahead and have a look there are 10 seconds left so what can be said of this batch let's see three two one time's up okay so the right answer as many of you guessed is c this is a multi-partition batch and it can be applied so let's see why it is a multi-partition batch for a very simple reason the inserts act on two different tables so if it's two different tables you see employees and employees by department if it's two different tables it's for sure two different partitions so no no question there so it is a multi-purchasing batch and it cannot it can be applied there's no problem they don't they don't uh walk on each other's feet ah somebody asked where to give the answer joinmenty.com and paste the code i have to copy the code here i don't know if you can join at this point probably you can but in doubt i will put it here but anyway don't worry if you don't join mendy i mean this is this is an exercise for you to you know to gauge your knowledge of cassandra so don't worry you can also follow along no problem there are no prices in this quiz there is no timing there are no prices if you want to do a quiz on cassandra with prices please after my talk at in the other room there will be a half an hour quiz with questions on cassandra and prices to the winners so there we will have to be fast in answering okay so back to this question uh it can be applied because it's two simple inserts they work on different partitions on different tables no problem uh what kind of what kind of a condition would make a batch non non-applicable well first if you mix if you mix counter columns and non-counter columns in the same batch then this is an illegal batch because you know counters work in a different way on architecture-wise and they cannot be mixed in a single batch so that could not be applied another way is if you have running fast another way is that if you have a lightweight transactions in a logged batch in particular so a batch that works on multi-partition that is not allowed as well okay well this is not a problem this batch is absolutely fine okay so let's move to question number five question number five get ready to answer let's go to the question so again there is a table there is a create table statement with you see the primary key part is left to you there are three dots you know that restaurant reviews are identified by name city and reviewer you know that they are queried from the table with name and city and you know that the table has multi-row partitions and the question is what is the primary key sorry okay the primary key is name reviewer city name city reviewer name reviewer city or reviewer name city so think a bit about the hints that you are given think of what the table has to accomplish and try to come up with the right answer for the primary key so the answer might look very similar but if you know cassandra you know that there is a very big difference in such a detail as a parenthesis put here or there and this is the subject of this question so let's see let's see we are almost there i'm sorry to i have to hop between screens but that's the only way i can track the timing i don't want to give to leave you hanging okay there we go many of you answered the correct answer very good congratulations let's see why the answer is b why is it b well first let's look at the first hint restaurant reviews are identified by name city and reviewer well that means to me that all three fields have to be in the primary key i cannot leave anything out and that's perfectly fine all answers actually include all three columns so that's not that's not a problem now look at the second end restaurant reviews are retrieved from the table using name and city what does that mean think of how how you arrange acquiring cassandra since we are we are setting an equal sign in the where to name and city so we will query something like select from blah blah where name equal something and ct equals something to me that sounds like i cannot have reviewer before name or before city in the primary key because otherwise i would be forced to give also a condition on reviewer so as long as reviewer is not the last column in the list in the primary key that's not a correct choice which rules out a because reviewer is in the middle c because the reviewer is in the middle regardless of the parenthesis and also d where reviewer is the first so that the second hint already leaves us with the answer which is b primary key name ct partition and reviewer clustering column now please note that the third hint is not even used in this answer that's fine uh now my point is that and i i draw your attention to these yes b is the right answer it works it has name and city as partition key fine because my query is compatible but that's not the only possible choice in general that's the only possible choice among a b c d but if i you see here on the left if i had a primary key named c3viewer with only name in the partition key that would have been fine as an answer then again it might lead to to partition that are too big that's another problem and that's maybe true depends on the data but still it would be a right answer if it were there so let's see how are we doing so far we are in the middle and we are more or less on time very good so i see three pairs three people managed to get everything right many other people got four out of five questions right very good go on go on like that you're good to go and let's go on question number six question number six let me bring you to the question okay so here we have a table definition so a create table statement and a select the question is which materialized view definition can be used to support the query because you see if you look at the create table statement where the primary key is name it's clear that the select as it is will not work because it it imposes aware conditions on wins and that's not primary key so it will sure not work now i want to create a materialized view to support such a query and what is the right syntax to make my query work so think of what you want to do what kind of query you want to do and think of what is the right syntax to create the proper materialized view so let's see 35 seconds to go and 20 seconds so materialized views are can be a a very good help as was also mentioned this morning this afternoon for you sorry during vinay's talk uh but they are to be used with knowing what you do so here we go let's see and the answer is d very good that was a bit harder i see and indeed it's not so maybe materialized views are not used daily still the answer is d well one point is that since my query has to be i want to query on wins then in when i arrange the new partition key the new sorry primary key in the materialize view i have to put wins first as primary key so i can query on that and that's a point so for sure a and c would not work now between b and d the difference is that when i create a materialized view i am effectively taking at most one new column and making it into the primary key so to to help me out cql requires me to explicitly filter rows filter out rows which are which have nulls in those columns because i cannot have nulls in the in the primary key so i have to explicitly add where wins is not null and name is not null so the right answer is d and not b okay so now the query would work let's go on question number seven secondary index let's see again now there is a table defined by create table statement and there is a select select uh from restaurant by city where seat equals sydney and cuisine equals sushi the point is that this work this query as it is would not work because cuisine is not in the primary key at least so i want to create a secondary index so i have my create index statement that will make the query work now what is the right way to create the index i need you might remember that a big difference between materialized views and secondary indices is that materialized views are effectively a new table that is distributed according to its new partition key while the secondary index is local and it follows the the distribution given by the base table that's one of the differences then there are various constraints on using either one so 30 seconds scarcely 30 seconds to go you see the difference between these statements lies in what is what are the column what is the column or the columns in the in the statement in in the index creation statement and let's see what is the answer 3 2 1 times up well that is a very spread distribution the right answer is a for one reason uh you cannot create indices on more than a single column so all other choices are not not working because of the of how cassandra creates secondary indices mind that the query still works because you see that that's a very nice example of a query that is properly supported by a secondary index because the query not only specifies cuisine which is what the index is there for but also also specifies city and city is the partition key of the original table so this query will work not only that but it will work efficiently because it it will still have to look at a single partition at a single node in terms of the original table and that's good because one of the pitfalls in using secondary indices might be to create an index in a way so that your query will then have to speak with many nodes and that might scale very badly if you have a large cluster okay so question number eight question number eight so the where clause in a query it has to reference all the fields in the partition key it tends to reference all the fields in the clustering key it has to reference all the fields in the primary key or it has to reference all the fields of both partition key and clustering key so this is a this is a question that will not require you to think so long if you if you know what are the terms in the in the question so this is an example of the question that will make you save time to devote to more complicated questions and those that make you think of values and inserts and stuff let's see if the answer coming in so when you put a where closing do you have to specify the partition key do you have to specify the clustering key or the whole primary key or both the partition key and the clustering key somebody probably knows that there's a trick in these answers a nice trick let's see 10 seconds to go five seconds to go three two one and time's up the answers are in and the right answer yeah very good well done is a well that's simple uh the where clause must contain the fields of the partition key and that's it because that's already enough to specify that the the the query will go to a single partition which is what makes cassandra happy if you want you can specify more in the clustering key yes with the constraints we already saw so they have to be given in order without skipping fields and by the way answers c and d which are not right are the same because primary key is partition key and clustering key so the right answer is only the partition key okay let's move forward question number nine question number nine here there is a cql statement made of two parts a create type and then a create table where one of the columns is of the type name and the question is what is the right syntax to insert a row on this table you see the difference is in how the literal value of name is inserted there is a json-like syntax in the first answer there is a name column and then some curly brackets in the second case there are just two values playing there in the third case and the fourth answer uses round brackets so what is the right way to spell out a custom a user-defined type in cassandra that's the question 30 seconds to go i'm sure many of you have used user-defined types maybe sometimes the syntax was hidden by your client drivers because usually there are ways to you know hide the c the underlying cql syntax uh in in layers that you then use by the way you remember that when you create a custom a user-defined type it will it will live within a key space so it is key space specific if you ever need a custom user defined type in two different key spaces you have to create it twice so let's see time's up and the answer is a very good many of you know the answer so let's see the point is that when you specify a literal user defined types you use a json syntax that's it so the second case is a strange because it is name colon something and if there weren't for this name column that would be a good the syntax for a set of text by the way the answer c is wrong because that is right for two simply two columns two single text columns and answer d is wrong but it would work if we had a column that is a tuple of text text but we have a user defined type so answer is a okay now dulce sinfundo last answer the last question sorry what is the result what does it mean here look we have um we have a create table statement okay i'm desired on the other side we let's finish this question we have we have a create table statement and we have two inserts and then an update look at the values and try to imagine what will the select at the end find after executing everything so you have one minute to figure out in your mind you have to use the cassandra storage engine and think of how the two inserts and the updates will work on your partition okay 20 seconds 10 seconds and there we go time's up the answer is b ah this was tricky right many of you answer c i would have said many of you would have answered also a now the point is that the primary key is username email so we have two rows we have two rows because we have the same username dc1234 but we have two different emails in the game so for sure we will end up with two different rows now the point is that after the trick sorry the trick is that after the first two inserts there is an update the update would like to one so one is tempted to think okay the update is going to alter the values of the row containing gmail address but the trick is that the nickname column is a static column what does it you see in the create table you see it's a static column what does it mean that means that it there is a single value for the whole partition so that single update will change the nickname for the whole partition so that's why we end up having davey and devi in both rows here okay so that was a bit tricky now i'm a bit a few minutes out of time so we have to rush to the end but we made it we saw all questions now uh very good we have a well i'm not saying a winner but we have somebody who would be would ace the exam very well any of you if you did 7 000 or more which is 70 of the answers you would have passed the exam because the exam is passed if you answer correctly to at least 70 percent of the question so congratulations to all and to other study more i hope this today has been useful to refresh or study a bit or to have a bit of fun i have to close now i thank you all for the attention and yes look in the repository you will find your references and you can go on with your preparation so okay you this is all repeated you will

hello everyone this is pile and i just need a confirmation give me a second i hope you all can see me okay hi everyone this is file and i'm going to talk about tom stones tomstown simply explained and when i say simply explained i really mean it so before uh digging into the tom stones uh a little bit about myself my name is kyle i'm working with cassandra from past five years as a cassandra data administrator i have worked upon so many performance issues migrations and administrative tasks so without further due let's dig in so this is the agenda for my talk today i am going to show you how cassandra create tomstones while deleting data and what are the issues created by those terms shown how we can find the presence of our tongue strands and how many tomstones types are there and in the end we will be discussing how we can get rid of the existing functions and there are some compaction settings to tune the terms on we will be discussing that as well and in the last how we can avoid the tombstone issues so let's get started first thing first how cassandra delete data and create the tomstones casing.treat delete as a write in cassandra everything is right so deletes are also right so whenever delete happens on the cassandra it's going to write a special value known as the terms to indicate that data has been deleted in cassandra deletes deleted data is not immediately going to be disappeared the data will be purged but after a certain amount of time and by the time the data is going to line all lying on your desk so that's it it was easy to understand how cassandra creates the functions right if that's it then what is so tricky about the thomson and why we are discussing the terms from here if constraints are that simple terms are not that simple to understand because uh now we know delete create the transforms in cassandra but there are some more reason which by which tombstones gets created in the casino first thing is setting the ttl so we can define the ttl we can define time to live while creating the key stage table or while inserting the data so for example while inserting the data i have defined the ttl of my 20 minutes it means i am giving cassandra instruction that after the 20 minutes you make my data as it turns on so in that way i am inserting the constraint into the case other reasons are inserting data into parts of collection inserting null values and metallized view how inserting data into parts of collection creates the transform we have to do first of all we have to be very careful while dealing with the collection data type in the casino see in the left hand side you will see this in my table and on my local column i have defined the collection data type which is map so uh whenever you update or insert value in the collection data types they are going to create the terms because uh the internal structure is something like this whenever we are inserting and updating the value in the cassandra column it asks cassandra to do read before write and kasundra doesn't support read before right so in order to gain the performance cassandra is going to mark the previous data as a tom stone so we have to be very careful with the collection uh data types uh here you can see as in the left side i have location column their data type collection map is defined on on right side you can see i am just entering one value though i have already defined two values but i just entered one value so it is going to create the transforms third reason behind creating the terms is inserting null values so whenever we insert a null values to any column it is going to create cell tom stones so here in my table movement am trying to insert null value for my username column and in right hand side you can see the deletion input so it means when i try to inserted that data cassandra has already inserted a function for my username column because its value is help by the way by the way the right hand side a thing is as a stable dump output as a stable dump a tool is available in cassandra to show what is the internal content of an assess table we will be discussing about it more uh down the line in this presentation but that was a third reason how we insert the constraints into the cassandra fourth reason is metallized glue materialized view is uh if i say simply a metallized view is a kind of table on a base table if we uh metallized view allow us to query the data uh with the help of column which are not part of the primary key so they uh so if we take the example in left hand side i have created a table cc transaction and if you see at my primary key user id and month is part of my primary key user id is my partition key and on right hand side there's a metallized view created on the cc transaction by the way metallized uh views are automatically handled by cassandra they were introduced in cassandra 3.0 uh i guess so and uh right hand side the metallized view is created on cc transaction table and if you look at the last trendy key user id and year is my partition key here and month is my primary year so let's think about a scenario where i need to update the year column in my cc transaction table simple right i can go ahead and update my year column there will be no issues but while updating the that here column what impact it is going to create on the metallized view since ear is a part of materialized rule i'm so sorry since uh since uh ear is a part of oh my goodness i'm so sorry again since here is a part of partition key here on my metallized view it is cassandra has to rewrite the partition again it has to delete the previous partition it has to redirect the partition again so it means uh whenever deletes are going to happen we'll be inserting the tomstones so that's how we enter the turnstone uh using the metallized view so these are the ways we uh these are the reason behind the metal reason behind the terms in the cassandra so now you must be thinking uh why we use function and why this kind of concept is there if this creates a lot of issue actually transforms are needed in cassandra they are not an issue and that's how distribute deletes work in the cassandra and they'll be the issue for you when you start seeing a lot of error warning and performance issue and you have already started seeing those of that or error warning and performance issue then you need to do something about it so uh then what are the issues comes from create consider scenario you are running a query you are running a query which is going to scan lot of functions because you have got a lot of functions so throughout the process when that query has to scan lot of terms on it might create the heat pressure and it will be adding some read latencies and if number of the terms on goes higher there will be some time out an exception you will be seen and in addition of that since we have got the term stones they are sitting on the disc it means they are consuming a disk space also so those are the issues those are the most frequent issues seen with the tomstones now uh how we can say that we have got the terms runs in our system first thing first we need to check our logs uh you might need to check your system.log you might need to check your debug.log so these these are the parameters we have defined in cassandra tml comes from warm tissue is it okay let me do it again uh can you see it now okay just a second hi uh let me share my screen [Music] so you have not seen even a single slide okay [Music] can you see it now yeah actually it was fine i'm sharing my entire screen uh but it is why it is not sharing i can just use it okay okay uh just last try can you see it now okay okay okay last time yes yes i did [Music] okay i'm again try it i'm again going to restart it and i'll call you in a second okay okay no break i've restarted it but you can see it now can you see it now just just a second [Music] can you see it now i didn't get you what do you mean by that uh yes i do have but i need to transfer it to that laptop it might take a minute or so okay okay i'm transferring it and i will follow you soon okay sorry everyone uh we have a little issue on the speaker's side with screen sharing so we have a little one minute pause and we get back to you after that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so uh hello everyone and welcome back looks like we are good now and we finally can start so please once again greet payal kumari from bifean database consultant he explains a very important thing dumb stones a lot of people misunderstand them and that's a big mistake to underestimate or misunderstand tom stones so welcome payal we are happy what you are with us uh thank you alex and first of all sorry technical glitches uh so okay i'm going here and i'll be going a little faster because and i i want to try to complete all the content in the given time so without the further due uh this is spiel and i'm going to talk about tom stone simply explained and when i say simply i really mean it so before the tom stones little bit about me i am pile working with cassandra database over the five years i am working as a database administrative administrator and i've worked upon so many performance issues migration and administrative tasks so uh this is my agenda i'm going to talk about i will be talking about how the tombstones are created issues and how we can verify their presence types of tombstone and uh in the last we'll be seeing some tuning and how we can get rid of existing stones first thing first how cassandra delete and how drunk streams are created in casandra everything is right even deletes are also right so whenever delete happens cassandra writes a special value known as storm stock to indicate that data has been deleted in cassandra deletes are not immediately purged so when you read the data it is going to stay there it is not like it is going to disappear the data will be staying for certain amount of time and after that certain amount of time it will be purged and that's it that was all about concern right if that's it then what is so tricky about it why i am giving this presentation explain about tom stone and why thompson creates so many issues because now we know that delete creates the thomson what are the other reasons youngster tom stones we also insert thomson into the casino cluster so these are the other reasons setting ttls inserting data into parts of a collection inserting null values and metallized view so how setting details creator comes from when we create key spaces or table or when we are inserting the data into the table uh we define it we can define the ttl that is time to live for example while inserting the data into a table i have defined my tpl is going to be 20 minutes so i'm giving cassandra instruction that okay after 20 minutes mark my data as a tomshaw this is the way i'm introducing tomstone into the casino and how we insert uh like while inserting data into parts of collection how it creates the dom strings so uh we have to be very careful while dealing with the casino or data types in the casino in casino data sorry collection data types because uh in the internal structure of cassandra whenever we insert and update the collection data types it won't kessinger to do read before write and because of the performance issue cassandra doesn't do read before right so whenever we try to update a collection uh casino is going to mark the previous data as it toms from so collection always whenever always we insert and update a collection it going to create the terms here on left hand side you can see i have created a key space where my location column has map collection data types and on right side you can see i am trying to enter the single values though i have already defined that i will be entering two values but while entering the single values it is going to create the function so be careful while using the collection in the casino you might be unknowingly inserting tomstown into the casino third reason behind uh inserting thomson into the cassandra is null values you can see here on sorry you can see here on the live left hand side my i have a table movements and for the username column i am trying to insert null value so on right hand side you will see that for null values cassandra has entered a tomstock so on the right hand side by the way this is the output from the assesstable down a sustainable dump tool is provided uh by the casino and uh it helps us to know the internal content of an open access table we'll discuss more about as a stable during this presentation and the last thing is metallized view so in the simple words metallized view is a kind of table on the base table so it allows you to define uh other column which are not part of partition key into the base column but you can define those columns as a part of partition key or the primary key in the metallized view materialized view are automatically handled by the cassandra and they were introduced i guess in kasundra 3.0 so let's see how metallized view creates the top storm in left hand side you can see i have a table cc transaction and if you see in the last my partition key is user id and my clustering is month and uh on right hand side this is my metallized view on the table cc transaction so if you see the last thing user id and here are my partition key i have defined here as a partition key over here so uh think about a scenario where i want to update the year column in cc transaction table simple right i can go ahead and update the year column but what that update is going to impact on metallized view because here is a part of partition key in materialized view if we update the ear column casendra has to rewrite the entire partition for that and it has to delete the previous partition and when it has to delete the previous partition there will be tomstones because of it so those were the reasons behind the tom stones and how we create the term shown into the cassandra now we must be thinking that tombstones are that bad and thompson create issue while we have thompson in the case actually thompsons are needed into the case intro that's how distributed delete works in the question they are not an issue they are not an issue until you start seeing lot of error warning in performance issue and you have if you have already started seeing those issues then you might have to do something about it so let's see what are the issues created by the tomstones uh there are i think you have a read query and you are running that read query and that read query is scanning lot of functions if that read query has to scan lot of terms from it means it is going to create the heat pressure and it is going to create latency it is going to create read latencies and if that number of the terms goes higher it will trigger some time out and exceptions and if your tomstones are lying on your disk it means they are consuming your disk space also see these are the issues uh these are the most frequent issue created by the toms trans now how can how we can verify the presence of the tombstones first thing first we need to check the logs in the logs you can see some warnings error related with the tomstones uh so for that we have two parameters in casino root ml first is thomson one threshold the default value is thousand so whenever a query is scanning more than thousand comes from it is going to log of one so if you go into the casino dot log in case you have the term zone you can see actually you can see how many number of the thomson words can like maybe it has a scan fifteen hundred terms wrong so that uh logging is going to say that query has scanned fifteen hundred tom stone so you can see the warning over there and in case uh the query crosses hundred thousand thomson the query is going to abort the cassandra will abort the query and it is going to log a warning message in your logs these are the cassandra tml parameter these numbers can be tweaked but it doesn't advise that because there are some plus and minus for that second how we can find the presence of the transforms we can use access table to json and as stable jump earlier uh to cassandra 3.0 as a stable to json was available now in the latest version of the center we have a stable dump tool available you can run that tool on the full part of the access table file it will help you to show what is the internal content of that asset another uh i'll show you how as a stable dump output look likes if you remember we have seen in the previous slides also another thing is as a stable metadata we can run as a stable metadata on full path of assesstable and if you are running that one single accessible it is going to show you the droppable terms from ratio and the delete timestamp and the delete timestamp will be epoch times and you can convert that and get to know when the data was actually deleted third is tracing in case our query is getting failed and we have no clue about it what is happening in the background if in the doubt then uh tracing on is a solution we have to connect to the sql sh turn the tracing on and then we can run our query to know what is happening so here in my example i am running a very unefficient query which is select star from rating by movies that is my table name but just for the showing purpose and you can see in the last my query is reading 15 libraries and three tom stone cells it and if your query is uh scanning lot of terms on you can get to know and the number of toms one is high then you can blame the tomstown for your query uh least performance last one no tool table stat so in earlier case under version it was not too cf set now we call it martin table set it gives you lot lot a lot of information but in the matter of time zone if you see in the last if you see the stem snippet and the last two lines average storms on per slice and maximum terms from per slice you can get to know what has happened in last five minute and how uh tomstown per partition keys were accessed in last five minutes so that's how we can verify the presence of the tomstones now uh let's think if we don't do anything about the thomson then when our tombstones are going to get a bit evicted automatically they'll be evicted after the gc great second which is default 10 days and if you think okay 10 days has crossed now 11th day my thomson will be evicted out no that is not the case once your gc grace second has passed once that 10 days default period has passed in the next compaction iteration where your shadow data and your tomstown data has to participate if they both are participating in single compaction iteration then your tomstones are going to remove and when we say gc second the default value 10 days is just for because uh before that dc grace elapse we need to make sure that tomstown should get distributed evenly across the north and that can be done by the repairs now let's see how many types of tomstowns we have got cell thompson uh we have seen earlier also whenever we try to insert a null value for a column or whenever we try to delete a column it creates it creates a cell thomson in my first example i am trying to insert null value and in my second example here which is delete replacement from item price table i am trying to delete a column and it is going to create cell tomstrum another type of tom stone is raw tomstown so when i try to delete entire row it creates the royal tomstown here you can see i'm trying to delete entire row from item price table and down is the access table dump output how rod uh tomstorms looks like you can see there the type is row and deletion input is there so whenever delete happened cassandra marked the time it has marked the time over there you can see and local delete time is also there so that's how uh raw thomson look like if we use the sustainable jump range thomson arranged options are created as their name suggests when a range is deleted in my query here delete from item price if you see price i have mentioned if price is more than two delete the entire range so it is going to create the uh range tomstown another thing remember we have discussed how we should be careful with the collection types in cassandra if uh collection type if you are inserting and updating collection data types that is going to create an arranged armstrongs this is how as the stable dump output of range tomstorm look like yes you see the type is range thomson bound partition downstreams as the name suggests those storm stones are created when we try to delete the entire partition as a stable dump output is a small here because we have deleted the entire partition but that's how a partition tomstown has a stable time output looks like and the last one ttl tomstown here if you see in my insert into query i am trying to insert data and uh at the same time i have defined using ttl20 so that 20 is in seconds means uh i'm giving cassandra instruction that delete my data after 20 seconds so after 20 seconds that entire row is going to uh going to become tomstown and this is how as a stable jump output would look like uh you see this ttl define 20 it it has expire at timestamp and since it is already expired so it has expired as uh it has marked that true now the interesting part how we can get rid of existing tom stone so first we need to make sure that tom stones are not getting into inserted we have uh seen how tombstone get inserted if we are taking care of that half of the problem is solved and then under most circumstances the best approach is to wait for the tonsils to compact up a normally but if it is taking a toll on your database performance or causing issues we can take some steps to the big time more efficiently so let's see what are those steps and how we can remove the tombstones first thing in case you have run incremental repair in the past or if you have run full repair in the past and not running them now not running them regularly then it might be possible that you have mix of repaired and unrepaired assesstable that will never be compacted together so consider a scenario uh your tomstone is in repair at uh as stable and your shadow data isn't unrepaired as a stable so since they'll not be getting compacted uh with each other your tomstones are not going to get elected so the first solution here is either you run incremental repair regularly that is not so efficient another thing is you should mark your repaired access table as unrepaired there is a tool called available repaired assesstable repaired set that can help you to mark those and repaired as a stable as unprepared user defined compaction user defined compaction allows us to manually select which file should be compacted this enables us to reclaim space and limit the size of compaction so it can fit into the remaining space ah in the earlier version of the cassandra running user defined compaction was not so easy you had to use jmx term then we had to little bit familiar with the java and it was a tedious process but in the latest version of the cassandra not two utilities there so you just have to run module compact and use the defined compaction and you have to give the path of ss table it is uh damn easy as compared to the prior version of the casino so but it is only suitable for size shared compaction size tired compaction strategy stcs and there's a one more blog post i have wrought about it which is user depend compaction if you want to replace it i have shown how it used to done in the earlier version and now how we are doing it in which cases user defined compaction can be useful and when you should use them third thing not tool garbage collect not tool garbage collect command is available from cassandra 3.10 onwards this command run a series of smaller compaction that also check for overlapping assistable so what not to garbage color actually does it rewrites all of your asus table with only needed data it will remove the shadow data from each access table but only in the situation if uh that has passed the gc second if the tomson has passed gc this second and they have expired then only neutral garbage collector is going to remove data otherwise it will not one thing to keep in mind before running normal garbage collect is it is very cpu intensive and it is time consuming modifying gc this second we need to be very careful while modifying gcps second because prematurely removing function can result in destruction of the related data ah consider a scenario i have a table uh and the table is complaining about the tombstones and i want to reduce these degrees seconds for it but i do not have any idea what days i should put it now if we are able to run a repair cycle in four days if the repair cycle gets complete without any error on the table in four days then we can reduce the gc seconds to five days of six days from the 10 days so that thompson can be evicted little bit earlier and at the same time we are repairing the table also efficiently so that thing we should keep in mind before modifying the dc grace second and the thomson will only be removed the dc great second half left since the thomson were created so that also we have to keep in mind last thing not not to compact i know what you might be thinking and not to come back is not recommended because it creates a giant as a stable that will be very influentially participating in the domestic but that was the case with the earlier version of the casino now cassandra in the latest version of the casino we have an option available split output not tool compact hyphen split output in case no other option is working for you you are in a scenario where running neutral compact is the only solution you can run not too compact with this option split output so uh it will gives you two benefit first it is going to compact all the as a stable together so it will be evicting now the tomstone will be releasing disk space second won't create the giant access table it will be splitting as a stable into different sizes of the ss table like suppose that this creating four as a stable so the sizes of all the four as a stable will be different and this option is available in the cassandra version uh greater than 2.1 that was all about how to get rid of the tomstone how we can tune the tomstone compaction remember i discussed uh how a giant as a stable can create the problem we know giant as a stable doesn't uh take part in the compaction very frequently so there might be some functional line there might be some shadow data lying or it is taking up the disk space so ah we need to have some option to run compaction on the giant assistable so that's when single as a stable compaction were introduced some single as a stable compaction were introduced in catsandra 1.0 and to one single as a stable compaction there are some parameter the first one is thomson threshold so so the default value for thomson threshold is 0.2 it means whenever your joint access table has 20 percent uh it can be uh with the smallest symbol also if your asus table is having 20 percent of the tom stone the single as the stable is going to get triggered on the term on that assess table now consider a scenario uh cassandra has found a asus table having 20 percent of the tomson and has run single assistable compaction but what if thomson didn't get evicted cassandra will run the compaction again again thompson are staying there they didn't go anywhere again cassandra has to run single as a stable compaction because we know as a stable needs other assistable also to get compact with each other so in that case uh this compaction stage will enter into infinite infinite infinite loop so to deal with that issue there's another parameter that is stompstorm compaction interval the default value for tomstone compaction interval is one day so it means uh the as stable cassandra has compacted recently it is not going to enter into the infinite loop uh rather than it will be compacting that as a stable after a day so that interval will be there that interval is treatable we can tweak that interval to one day to a two day or maybe one hour then it depends how frequent we want those compaction and how uh how frequently we want the terms from to go out there's one more parameter which is uns checked terms from compaction so before running single as a stable compaction cassandra has to do some pre-checks like checking for the overlapping as a stable checking checking for the uh droppable dom zone but in case we said this to true this can be set in the casino.tml file in case if we set it to true there will be no brick checks happening so the single as a stable compaction is going to get triggered if the uh thompson threshold is uh like droppable tomstones are more than 20 percent and uh the interval is whatever the interval is set and as a stable compaction will be triggering and running before setting it to true we need to keep in mind that since we are making cassandra to run frequent compaction this is very resource intensive this is taking going to take up lot of resources but if it is giving you benefits then why not now how we can afford the tom stones issues first if we are at the data modeling phase we need to make sure uh we are tweaking the data model we are creating the data model like and that it should not delete large amount of data and if that is the need we have to do it then we have we should use truncate and drop not the delete because delete creates the terms on if you have to create the uh entire data entry table you shrunk it and drop and alter your range queries to avoid querying deleted data or operate on a narrower range of data and all in all the last one avoid queries that will run on all partitions in the table that is not even true for question and not even true for thomson cases but that is true for cassandra if you want your case into run efficiently if you want your queries to run efficiently without so much latency and problems we should not run queries on all the partition we should limit the partition in the queries take a ways and so what we have learned the first thing is we should run our repairs and tables in the gc grade second while reaper reaper is a very good tool if you don't want to use reaper then run the sub range repair but make sure your data is getting repaired within the gc second second thing setup monitoring so you can be alerted before the before you can be alerted before the big issue arises and you can fix that beforehand third thing try to tune compaction according to the need we have discussed the compaction setting available for single asset stable compaction there are some more settings available you can tune for the compact the storm stones so to deal with the dumpster in a better way so you should tune them and the last thing and the very important thing is make sure you are not inserting the tomstones and that was me and i know it was fast sorry for that uh thank you so much for all of your time i hope i was able to help you a little about thomson thank you again thank you latest [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let me know once i'm in okay yeah hi everyone uh thanks for the opportunity thanks for joining uh this particular session so i would like to talk about performance tuning in cassandra so more specifically i'll be talking about secondary indexes in cassandra so so secondary indexes is uh one of the most mis misunderstood concepts of cassandra and it is very less known concepts of cassandra so what we do today is like you know we'll try to have a very much in detail uh uh technical implementation of you know secondary indexes in cassandra so this this talk is like a more of a practical approach uh i'll have a three note class uh cassandra should have been running on my aws so so we'll be using it and uh it will it will be like more of a practical way of doing things so yeah so that is the agenda so the agenda is like you know before we jumping into the secondary index uh what i do is like you know i'll try to give you some basics to understand our secondary indexes so that is how we start then we'll jump into secondary index and we'll see what are the best use cases of uh using secondary index and what are the you know various standard patterns you know uh these are the stuff we're gonna see and before we start learning a little bit about me my full name is anil mithana i'm a certified cassandra admin and certified uh cassandra developer i really love this subject like i'm very passionate about cassandra database technology and i also have a youtube channel running exclusively for cassandra dbs uh it is purely you know designed for uh cassandra dba so yeah let's start so the very first slide i'll be talking about very first approach in cassandra so if you are like you know in traditional rdbms systems right what we do we create a table first then we'll think about our queries right there is so much flexibility for you know how you want to query on a dbms system but in cassandra we do in opposite way so increase in cassandra you need to know your queries first before you gonna create your tables so you need to know your application workflow what are all the queries you you know do at the application level you need to uh you need to have a note of all of these things before you gonna create a table so let's say my client came and you know asked me hey anil you know can you okay this is not my requirement at any given time i'll give me rows for a particular movie so okay so to make it very simple uh i'll be dealing with the movie's data so that you know we can connect easily with the content what i'm gonna show it later so so this is what my requirement hey anil can you give me a rose for a particular movie so this is what i'll ask you at any given time so if that is what the requirement what i do is like you know i'm gonna create a table like this so this one so i'm gonna create a table something looks like that so where my partition key is my title and this is what my partition key right so email is my clustering column you know which gives me uniqueness for my primary key but you know the main focus would be the title so title is my partition key now so this is how you create a table but let's create a table and you know let's load some data i so i have it already handy for us so that you know we can quickly create a table and uh load some data so this is the table i'm gonna create and you know i'm inserting some rows then we're gonna query that uh table also so yeah so i have a three note cluster up and running so that is looking perfect so i'm connecting to my sql sh client from there i'll uh switch to my uh no key space so you have to use use command is the command you know if you want to jump into that particular d space so that is where i'm going to create a table now so i'm creating a table and i loaded some data and you know here we have a data now uh before going further what i do like you know i'm using a a tool called mobile i think you know previously one of our speaker already mentioned it about you know mobile this is a wonderful tool uh especially on windows if you want to manage your cassandra clusters this is a very good tool uh to connect anyone and use it now so i have a table and so what is what is my requirement so my client asked me hey anil can you give me all the rows for for author so so what i do is i know i'll run a query something like this right select start from table where what is more special about it like you know uh is there any special thing about getting this output yeah yes now what is that see to give you that output because cassandra is a distributed database what happens you know in the in in cassandra your table basically will get distributed by using your partition key so this is very important if you notice here your table will get distributed but in terms of partitions so if you ask me hey anil can you tell me what you what do you mean by cassandra table in the center table i'll tell you color the center table is a collection of partitions so that partitions will contain rows belongs to a single partition now see whoever is watching avatar movie that data will be in one single partition and that partition will be in a single node one single node so let's say you have a three nodes here right you are seeing three nodes maybe cassandra how cassandra will store is you know it it keeps the avatar data in one single node probably on node one it stores the interstellar movie probably on note 2. i know it shows the lucy movie data in note 3. so you got this how you know how it is story it is storing so beautifully right now what is the advantage you know by storing in that way see when you query this just now i i ran a select query now to give you this output it's a single discrete output that is the power of cassandra so when you run this query it just goes and grab it from one single note it's a single disc you know single disc read so you get it so quickly so yeah now that is one way of you know having advantage what but there are some because you are getting a advantage from from one one side uh you know there is a flexibility issue you know with your select queries and especially with the partition key see what i mean by that now see if client came today and you know if he asked me hey anil you know uh can you give me a rose enough for a particular user like i want to know all the movies watched by a particular user see if that is what your query you know i'm sorry i cannot give you that output because you remember it's a very first approach you need to know your queries much earlier before you create a table so we already discussed our application workflow our queries and today if you came and asked me some different query you know cassandra cannot give you that so that is where duplication comes into the picture denormalization comes into the picture so especially if you are from rdbms world right and if you are coming into the cassandra it looks similar a little uh different right it is because uh it is completely opposite in in cassandra duplication is completely allowed you know cassandra encourages you to do duplication and you know uh denormalization right now now if someone if you want to look up by email you have to create one more table with the same data you need to duplicate it so that is the uh best way of you know fetching the data for you if you want to look up by email right now so i uh i have already created this table and i'll show you how it works now if you notice uh what i just did is uh i created a ratings by email where the email is my partition if you and i loaded same insert queries i mean there is nothing change everything is same same insert queries right now when you store it if you see how it is storing now it is storing by keeping you know uh your user as a partition right everything watched by sharma everything was better you know it's keeping in a one single partition and that will go and sit in one single place so anytime if i want to fetch the rose uh washed by sharma i can get it so easily it's a single discrete anything you know from any any movies like you know watch by pile i'll get it so easily so quickly yeah now all good so duplication is there and denomination is there like all good know what is next now let's say you know there is one more requirement today all of a sudden client came in you know asking me hey can you give me rows where rating is equal to 8 so i want to know all the movie list where rating is equal to eight so can i get that can you give me that output you know a big sorry right i cannot give you you cannot uh change your queries you know day by day so if today if you come and ask me give me rose rating is equal to 18. i cannot give you that see it is giving you an error right uh cannot execute this query because there could be a unpredictable performance issues but if you still want to execute this query um cassandra is telling me to use hello filtering right let's say you know uh some developer a new developer from uh read this message and he ignored everything and he just focused on this particular piece i love filtering let's do that so what he did is he ran this query where okay we need to this is the query where rating is equal to eight it is throwing an error and cassandra is telling me to do use allow filtering it is not here use it is hello filtering oh my god the output now the developer is so happy you see you know uh it was like previously throwing an error and i used a lot of filtering i'm getting the results right now uh this is where the main drama comes into the picture although filtering is completely bad now you are not supposed i mean it is not advisable and there should be a big no if uh on a low filtering now what just happened why you shouldn't use all of filtering let's say you have two lakh records in your table okay and there were like 100 records where rating is equal to 8 out of 2 lakhs so what just happened is uh in when you ran this query what cassandra does is it it will scan all the 2 lakh reports and then it will apply the filters on it and it will give you the output for you so basically you know it you are doing a full cluster scan right which is completely bad it may bring down your node if you use a low filtering right so completely bad you know that is the recommendation especially if you're on a production try not to use all of filtry now what is the fix right there comes your index okay this is where we are jumping into the actual topic secondary indexes now what i do is i i'll create a index on rating column so i'll clear my screen what i'm doing is i'm creating a secondary index on my rating column now previously error right for this particular query uh so we ran out of filtering so now what i'm doing because i have a secondary index now i'll run that query and i got the output so if you have a secondary index i know you can get the output now here comes uh one more point so then if it is working fine if secondary index is giving output properly then why you told me to duplicate the data now when i want to look up by email why can't i why can't you go and create a secondary index why you told me to duplicate it and now you're telling uh you know create an index and uh get the output right so uh this is where you know we we we're gonna complicate uh our things so you know little bit more focus is needed now what i do is like to demonstrate now i have two options right if i want to get if i want to look up my ratings i have two options one option is duplicate the table with the same data or else create a secondary index and uh use secondary index to get the output right to this now we have one thing already there what i do is like i'll create a duplicate table by see by keeping rating as a partition key now what i'm doing i'm creating same data loading same data but i'm just changing my i'm duplicating it by keeping rating as my partition key now so select start from ratings by ratings where rating is equal to now so i got the output so here in this screen you are seeing uh you got the output by using secondary index in this screen you are seeing the output from our duplicate table right now if you can able to understand the difference between these two how they are getting stored i mean how secondary index is storing and how a duplicate table is storing the data you get a better idea about you know how to implement secondary indexes in the sangra now now when i query from my duplicate table right from the original table right from here it's a single disk grid we just uh you know we understood this already right because rating is my partition key remember uh partition key is what the primary index like all the time i'm talking about secondary index like you might be getting a doubt like what what i mean then what is a primary index right so primary index and partition key both are same so primary index is what you know here you are looking here now your primary index data basically will get distributed what i mean right see here every time someone gives a rating eight that will come and sit in us in this particular partition right and this partition will be in a single node right so probably this whole data might sit in node one every all the people who are giving rating seven that will be one single partition and that will be stored in a one single node remember your partition data will never get uh distributed between the two nodes so one single partition will belongs to one single node now when i ran this query it's a single display correct it only one single node involved in this particular output so to give you this output depends on your replication factor let's say you have a replication factor set to one now in that case it's like you know it's a single this query uh involved only one single node now what about secondary index then how many nodes are getting involved when you run using secondary index that is the whole you know concept of secondary indexes now to understand you need to understand you know uh how secondary index will will be stored inside uh cassandra when you create them now so when you create a secondary index we already know how to create an index now when you create an index on let's say in our case we created it on our rating column now what happens is cassandra will create a hidden table for you and it will manage everything you know in the background you don't need to worry about it now so cassandra creates a hidden table and if you notice uh your primary key rating is your partition key meaning in the secondary index uh rating is your partition key and you know you it will take entire primary key as a part of the rest of the primary key in the hidden table so this is how the table looks like now how table data i mean in this data will get stored right so this is the original table and this is the index table right now i'll show you our how it gets stored so this is very interesting we'll uh pay attention a little bit more here now this is your original table right where you are storing data by title and on this table you created a rating right now when you create a rating you have a one more table got created now here comes your index data so the main difference between your base data your base this is the base data right i mean original table data and the index data what is the main difference the main difference is your base data will get distributed meaning all our data will be in one place all industrial data will be in one place right but if you notice your index data index data basically co-locate uh on the same node with the source data so confused i mean you didn't get it uh what i just said so let's pay attention here now what happens is uh your index data will be co-located on the same node with the source data meaning it your index data only local so here like three people watched uh three people given rating eight three people will given nine and three people given seven right only that data will be stored on that node right now what is the disadvantage uh by keep by storing in that way let's say let's run this query select start from ratings i movie where rating is equal to 8 right this is what uh you're querying using secondary index right where rating is equal to now your cassandra cluster doesn't know where is this reading eight uh data see if you say where rating is equal to if you say where is equal to avatar see everyone knows about it now so every node knows where the data is because that's the primary index but if secondary data no one knows like your consent and doesn't know where is the data basically what happens now it has to hit every single node to get the data right see everywhere uh people given rating gate every for every movie and it has to go and the scan every single index data and from there it has to grab the primary index i mean it has to scan in the data from there it has to grab the your primary key of base data and it has to go here and to get the output for you so every time you read it has to look up your index data it has to look up your base data and it it will happen in every single let's say you have 100 nodes all 100 nodes will get involved when you look up by secondary index okay let's say you have a replication factor let's say three and you have 100 nodes even in that case also you have to hit at least 33 nodes i mean which is really bad right even even though it is 33 nodes still it is huge now so you might ask me hey what in that case why it is storing that way why cannot it just stores the way you know it is storing the primary index like why cannot uh it why it is not storing in the data also like this keep all the a data in one node keep all the seven data and mode keep all the nine day ten mode why it is not doing that so there are two issues you know if you store that way let's say imagine your secondary industry is storing this way right it is keeping all the rows where rating is equal to eight in one single place let's say you have you have like five lakh records out of five lakh records let's say 90 of the rows having rating is equal to eight so most of the people given rating eight for uh movies now what happens if you store uh uh the data of eight in one single node you will end up with a wide partition right you will end up that particular node will have a white partitions right uh additional load on that particular node which is bad again one more thing uh by storing by keeping in the data local it is easy for you to update index indexes so indeed there won't be any index uh latency issues when you are not doing mutations update deletes inserts when whatever you are doing on your base data uh it has to get updated in index right so when you when you have it local it is so easy for you to get updated but if you distributed it you know there can be a consistency issues right that is what you are getting from materials use isn't it so basically material is not distributed index so that is where you see all the latency issues so to avoid all of them so cassandra having uh these two reasons to store in this data along with the original data so we already discussed these two points now by this time i hope you already got to know what is distributed index and local index right local index is what your secondary index where every time there if there are 100 nodes all 100 nodes will get involved right distributed linux are like you know much better way of querying the data because let's say you have 100 nodes with 5 replication factors set to 5 maybe you know when you query a five nodes and you know one coordinate node hardly like six nodes will be involved in your query now we also see you know what is the right path and read part now you i hope you know we already discussed what is the read path right so every time you look up the index it has to scan in this data and uh you know your base data and you know get the data right what ha what happens you know with their with their rights so whenever you are writing whenever you are doing a mutation right mutation meaning like inserts update deletes on the base data so there is a hook there is some kind of uh you know notification will be sent to all the registered indices on that particular table and you know you will base base table data and you know your index mem table both will get first uh into the system you know into your disk and there is no guarantee both will get flushed at the same time and once it got flushed your index data and page data will have a different life cycle in terms of compactions and repairs so that is also you have to consider they don't have a same life cycle so your index data will be compacted differently and your base data will get compacted uh on a different way now so all the time we were like almost like it's a complain i know we were like trying to understand what is the complexity of using secondary indexes right now if the if this is so much complicated why we have secondary indexes in cassandra there should be some reason to have them in cassandra right yeah there are reasons actually there are some best use cases to use the secondary indexes now i'll put a one statement so secondary indexes in cassandra will not give you performance they are there to give you convenience for your queries so very important statement they are not there to give you uh performance okay they are there to give you convenience or for your queries what i mean by that now uh let's look into our so this is what expensive query right when i run where rating is equal to 8 on my secondary index it get all the nodes will get involved in that particular query now what would be the right way of asking when you have a secondary index now i'll tell you this now so instead of asking select start from ratings by movie by movie uh where so rating is equal to 8 i mean this is bad this is expensive query right now what was the right way now ask include your primary index also title is equal to avatar so this would be a proper way of using secondary index now don't ask me uh give me all the rows for uh where rating is equal to eight i mean bad query expensive query ask me this uh give me all the rows where rating is equal to eight for a particular movie so i want to know who and all given rating gate for avatar movie so that would be a right uh query to ask cassandra so when you ask that what happens it's a single discrete well the moment you include your primary index it becomes a single right so it it doesn't need to hit any other nodes right it has to go and hit only one single node so this is a more uh real-time transactional query you know than this this is more expensive and this is the less i mean uh actual query to use actual implementation of you know secondary indexes now the okay let's say there is one more way you can use secondary indexes now instead of asking all the rows let's limit it let's say limit to what i'm doing i'm asking hey i'm limiting my rows number of rows so two two let's say you have a you want to uh limit hundred rows okay like let's say you have 100 nodes and uh you are fetching only by 50 rows by saying limit 50. now what happens you know cassandra will have an internal mechanism internal algorithm uh so what it does is the moment it get gets the uh those 50 rows it will stop scanning other nodes so that that's how you can actually let's say you got 50 rows by scanning 5 nodes so it will skip remaining 95 knots and it will give you the output for you so that that happens internally now the basic idea is you know try to narrow down the number of nodes you query see by keeping primary index you reduce the uh you know query to one single node by keeping limits on your query so by keeping limits on your query you'll also narrow down your number of nodes to hit correct so these are some actual implementations of secondary indexes in cassandra so they are there to give you convenience right this is what the convenience they will give you for your queries they are not giving you performance right uh they are also good for uh analytics uh workloads especially you know on uh if you are using spark secondary indexes are very much helpful because there won't be uh you know sla that measured in milliseconds you know on spark side now this is very important especially if you are from traditional uh world traditional rdbms world you have to know what are the various charity patterns because i see most of the developers coming from rdbms they tend to uh create indexes right see that is what uh happens in traditional rdbms systems whenever there is a query performance issue a db or a developer tend to create a secondary index i mean it's a very common practice uh creating index and most of the cases you know it will resolve the issue right but in cassandra we already we already got to know it is not the right practice to create indexes whenever you want to create on whatever the columns you want to create right obviously you have to avoid creating index on very low coordinate column i'll say let's say gender so gender is having only two columns i mean two values right i mean okay so gender is having very uh low values like uh three so you will end up with the white partitions if you use gender i mean if you create a secondary index on a gender column so which is very bad and you should avoid creating indexes on very high quality columns also for example email so email is like a very much unique value every row will have a unique value and it is completely bad use because uh if you create a secondary index on email and you and you are looking for that particular email you might end up getting the output by hitting one single node or you might end up hitting every single node and getting a result zero so completely you should avoid it now you have to avoid creating index on a column where you will update very frequently right you shouldn't create it on a column where you update or a column values repeatedly right so these are some variety patterns which you have to avoid now there are problems and limitations we already got to know some kind of a problems and you know the limitations right uh you are not allowed to use uh no range queries on secondary index columns i mean you cannot say you can say rating is equal to 8 but you cannot say rating rating greater than eight or greater less than eight they are not possible on secondary indexes and also because this whenever they get uh in this data and uh base data will get flushed into ss table they follow a different life cycle and different compaction process and you know you there also you will end up having some issues if if the base data compacted quickly and your image data is not yet compacted you know there is a mismatch again so there are some limitations when you use secondary indexes and that is where comes you know that is where we talked about uh sassy storage you know it's a stable attached storage index so here you know when you i mean sas index also one type of a secondary index where it gives you more flexibility or when you query basically it allows you to use a range queries you can use like parameters on your uh you know on your index column so very much uh similar and what we do is like we'll try to create a sassy index also quickly so what i'm doing i'm creating a sassy index on user location uh on user location column so here on this user location column so and uh you have to pay attention to this warning sas indexes are experimental i mean they are not recommended for production use we'll try to understand you know why such warning was displayed now now once you have a sassy index you know you can use the like parameters uh so let me run this query so i can get the output where user location is you know like uh you uh anything like starting with you right and again it's an expensive car everything is all the entire implementation is same and it is expensive query it hits every single node as we discussed right now what is the much better way of querying always include your primary index also in your select query right so give me all the rows where user location is you know like uh you plus you know ampers you know percentage and uh where title is equal to that so that would be a much better query and it will hit only one single node all good now so that that is what uh sassy will do and one more thing sassy will have its uh sassy will have a physical representation what i mean by that is like you know the moment you flush so let's say let's flush it so your index will have isis table uh along with your basis stable so what i mean by that like let me clear my screen and uh let's jump into it the case and our table name is ratings by movie so here where we created sassy right and uh if you notice [Music] your indie data also will have your ss table right and uh this tables will get involved in your compactions and in your repairs so you have to be very much careful obviously you're putting additional pressure on your compactions and on your debates if you have a sassy index so uh you know that is where you need to pay attention uh when you are creating a sassy you obviously are putting additional uh pressure on your compactions and repaves so anyway as of now sas indexes are experimental so make sure uh you're not using them on protection if you're using them you know contact the support now so that's almost you know we are closing ending into the final topic so i would like to put some final thoughts obviously secondary indexes are there to give you convenience i mean this is i'm stretching from the beginning they are not there to give you performance okay do not try to create all the time secondary index you know on whatever the columns you wanted to create this is bad right you need to understand you know how cassandra is storing the data uh secondary in this data what would be the right way of querying if you have a secondary index always try to put primary index in it all otherwise you know try to limit the number of nodes you are hitting right and and you know the uh the the much better way you know the very generic recommendation is to have you know one secondary index per table or else and almost try to avoid creating them if if it is like uh if the requirement is like much suitable to have one more duplicate table always go ahead and create a duplicate table because uh putting on a primary index like on partition key is much much faster than trading on a secondary index so that's it so uh yeah stay home and uh stay safe um thank you for the opportunity thank you for the opportunity i'm very glad to be uh speaking on this particular platform yeah thank you so much [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are we on hello everybody so you can hear me well okay good morning to people from u.s side and good evening for people in india i'm i'm very happy to be here on the cassandra day india um and i'm very happy to talk to you about grafana dashboard for cassandra okay so let's let's get started so um when you have big clusters or small clusters it doesn't matter what kind of clusters you have what size it is we definitely want to see how your clusters are performing like the matrix and we want to definitely make sure that they're all healthy and you should be able to quickly identify if there are issues in your clusters so um when i started looking for grafana dashboard for cassandra so what happened was um i will show you live we'll go to the grafana website and find some dashboards the issues i found was all the existing ones were old at least two to three years old and they were all broken because of grafana itself released new versions so so basically when you have new versions of grafana you have to go back and make sure the uh the dashboard works and a lot of people who developed it earlier um i know they must have not keeping it up to date so old ones were old and broken and the second issue is all of them uh there are at least 10 grafana dashboards all of them use something called jmx and jar so everybody who uses cassandra definitely knows about jmx um we all were told that that's how all the metrics are published and that is completely not correct meaning there are other ways to get the metrics out um and then you know somebody builds this java code they write java code and they build a compiled jar and they tell you to plug it into your production cluster i personally i would not plug any unknown jar into my production cluster because i have no clue what that jar does does it only collect metrics or does it collect matrix and sends it to unknown inner targets so i have no clue now that was my issue so if you just want to quickly see um where these dashboards are basically i will just go to cassandra so let me just go here to grafana.com and you see these are the dashboards so if you click on this so anybody who is looking for dashboards they'll get here and then i'm going to just type cassandra just to see the filter and you can see all of these graphene dashboards they're mostly nine to ten of them and these are the dashboards i was referring to let's say randomly let me pick one of them let's say for example this one so this one was built five years ago and it was built for grafana 3.1 version so this is very old ah now that's what i meant when they all created this graphene dashboards these are old and they're not up to date so that was my first issue as i was explaining and the second issue is the jmx so how do we solve this issue right so basically i started learning uh prometheus grafana there is there is a lot of learning to create a new dashboard but if you're going to use this dashboard then you don't have to do all this learning now what i did was from my side um i was thinking about couple of options right one is i don't want like i told you jmx is complicated i don't understand jmx i'm not a java programmer at the same time i don't want to plug unknown jar which i explained earlier right somebody wrote some java code which i don't want to really plug into my production cluster right even if it is test cluster i don't want to experiment with somebody else's java file or java code so um what what if we don't want to use jmx and we still want to see this metrics right i started experimenting with cassandra itself and cassandra has a wonderful tool called matrix reporter in a second i'll show you what that is and then um i would like to use the latest version of prometheus grafana and make sure the dashboards are kept up to date and then keep it simple as my concept always like you know if at all you can do something with simple stuff you can do it and that also refers to uh the jmx part of it i don't understand dmx so i keep it simple with shell scripts right so let's let's talk about how we can get this metrics out from cassandra and let's see if cassandra already offers some um you know pre-canned way of getting this matrix out okay um one thing i want to mention and earlier two speakers talked about this i use moba xterm for all my ssh connections on windows connecting to my servers uh what we'll do is we'll just do a quick rundown i i'm running a um cassandra 4.0 uh so let me quickly check the version and you will see that i'm running uh cassandra 4.0 beta 4 and let me show you my cassandra cluster so i have a six node cluster let me just push this up a little bit okay i have a six node cluster and there are two data centers uh three nodes in each data center pretty basic setup but you can see all the nodes are up and running and all now most importantly we want to talk about the matrix collector we don't want to use jmx so what is the alternate for that right so if you look at cassandra documentation there is there is a metrics related information published in the documentation so i'll just go to cassandra.apache.org and go into documentation i'm going to look for something called metrics and let's see under monitoring you see this metrics come up right now what cassandra was built for is by default cassandra is built to publish metrics using something called drop wizard metrics library and also the same metrics are published via jmx so there are two ways cassandra already comes out of the box there are two ways to get this matrix out jmx is by default enabled on all the nodes what we are looking for is the alternate method and which is already available via cassandra is it's a very simple setting i'll show you how it is configured so first of all we we go to uh the configuration folder and there is a file called metrics reporter.yaml okay along with the original configuration files there is a sample file available for this and what you see here is i have provided okay so so one more thing to mention uh all this information is already available on github and we're just reading off through the github but i'm going to show you how this entire setup is done so what what it tells you basically this particular configuration file is telling cassandra to write all the all the output the metrics to a specific file and it tells at what intervals we want to write this matrix into the text file and then there are couple of other settings here but most importantly if you notice here you can exactly see what matrix will be dumped into the text file okay now if you went with the jmx configuration and that jar file i'm telling you somebody wrote this jar file i don't know what jar file collects right but if you are using this text file or the yaml file configuration you can exactly tell what matrix to capture and you can direct it to the specific file now what i have done here is i wrote this yaml file basically is telling cassandra every 15 minutes take all the metrics and dump them into this text file right i can quickly show you let me let me quickly say for example show you how the text file looks like let me do one thing tail minus 100 lines from this text file is much better so what we are doing here is we are looking at the text file which is generated by cassandra it is writing all its metrics into this text file and later we are going to see how we take this and pump it to prometheus and grafana hold on one second looks like my screen froze for some reason hold on one second okay i might have to stop sharing and start the sharing again give me one second ok now this is better so you should be able to see my screen okay so this is my guess right uh when i switch to mobile extern i think that's when you did not see the screen share i guess okay so what we'll do we'll go back one step i'm in the configuration folder for cassandra ignore my you know versions and all that what you see here is let me hide this okay in the configuration files there is a configuration file called matrix reporter.yaml okay in the original configuration files also you get a sample file uh which looks like this so this is what i was explaining earlier but you did not see it on screen it's a very simple yaml file basically it explains cassandra should write output to this text file and take all the metrics every 15 minutes it is going to write the matrix and the metric configuration looks simple like this so basically we are telling what kind of metrics we want to dump into this text file okay now the all this is in the documentation so basically you can go to the documentation and you will clearly see what matrix can be dumped and all these metrics are documented very well so once we have the matrix configuration done we have to still tell cassandra on um on how to i mean when cassandra is starting it has to know that it has to dump this matrix there is a cassandra configuration file called um cassandra n dot sh so that file is um cassandra and dot sh this file so if you look at the tail of this file i'm i have added one entry in this file and you can see here uh this where this file contains a lot of jvm options in this options i'm just adding one extra parameter here which tells that i would like to use the matrix reporter and the configuration file is this yaml file we created and the yaml file we created should be put in the configuration folder where cassandra has all the other configuration files when you start cassandra with this setting cassandra starts writing logs into the text file earlier i was showing you so i can i can show you the text file one more time this is how all the metrics will look like when you look at this text file it contains all the metrics dumped into a text file right so our goal was to avoid going through jmx and avoid going through plugging a jar which is unknown what i did here was a very basic cassandra already has this pre-built matrix writer which i'm telling okay take all the metrics every 15 minutes write them into this particular text file okay that was the step one to get the metrics out of cassandra right let's go back to the slide and so what i was telling is don't use jmx that is the first solution use latest prometheus graphene will get to it keep it simple right so the step one was to get the metrics out we performed that step now just to show you how the architecture of this this particular solution looks like if you look at this you i'm just showing you three node cassandra cluster here there is a shell script which we are going to use to get all the metrics prepared for prometheus format each cassandra node will run agent called node exporter which comes with prometheus basically and then that node exporter publishes all the cassandra metrics as a website or web page prometheus goes and brings those metrics from each server we'll configure prometheus to look at each server node exporter output and prometheus also has a component called alert manager we we can configure alert manager in case if we want to send alerts like a page to the dba team or the application team if at all something goes wrong in your cluster and prometheus is a time series database it keeps all the data in its its own format but we can take those prometheus data are the metrics which we collected from cassandra and display them as graphene dashboards so this is a basic architecture of how the how the grafana dashboard is built for cassandra now let's let's take a look at how the dashboard looks like before we jump into more details about how prometheus is configured and all okay so let me switch to this screen here so this is how the grafana dashboard looks like at the end of configuration like once we have everything configured properly this is how it looks like what i did was added few filters here basically you can filter by the cluster name let me zoom into this top first and then once we explain we'll go back to looking at the cluster so you see this is the cluster we are monitoring right now i have only one cluster but if you had multiple clusters you can look at the cluster configurations from one place so right now we have only one cluster and you can also do further filtering using data centers i have two data centers so it is listing both data centers here i can select one or the other or both of them um at the same time this will also show you which hosts are the server names available so you can filter based on the server names further you can filter based on key space and table names we'll we'll go there later on so what i'll do is i'll just reset this size and show you the system summary so the entire dashboard is divided into multiple sections here i'll go with the system summary first you can see here so basically this gives you a quick summary of what kind of operating system we are running we have six servers in this cluster it tells you what is the uptime what is the operating system as you can see here i'm running centos linux 8.4 a pretty latest version of operating system ram usage is little bit high you can see it's like almost 70 percent 70 plus percent on the ram uh there is only one server having cpu issue so you can see cpu is at 76 percent on one server and the color coding basically keeps it very simple and easy to understand okay that there is one server which is standing out there in red color you might have to check what's going on with the cpu over there we can expand the next section which shows the storage uh there are two things here like if you had multiple mount points it will show you all the mount points and their usage and the simple lcd gauge will show you like you know if it is reaching red color then obviously you have to make sure to add more space or expand space we can also monitor the inodes generally when you have multiple files and too many files your inodes quickly fill up if you don't have enough high notes that's one of the common issues with linux and we just have to make sure we monitor those high nodes and you know take care of them if at all they're ah they're consumed so there is uh next one shows the the first three sections show the system related information so here you can see the cpu usage over period of time here i'm looking at last three hours and you can look at the ram usage of the different systems now as i mentioned earlier right you can also filter let's say for example you can pick which servers you want to see and then you can look at the metrics only for that three servers i picked from the list now we keep going we can look at the summary of the cassandra nodes look like it tells me that there are uh total six nodes let me zoom a little bit so there are total six nodes and all six nodes are up and running if at all one node was down it will show in red color right now there are no nodes down so which is good i have total two data centers and each data center has three nodes that's a quick summary of the cluster we are looking at and then we can go further into like you know cassandra summary where it shows you uh what version of cassandra we are running on each node uh which data center we are looking at what is the rack information for that node how many tokens each node is handling up time and how much data is on each node there are two important stats here like say if you're running repairs regularly your repair should be at hundred percent usually near two hundred percent or above ninety percent if at all your repair rate is like less than thirty percent i would be concerned about it you should not be running any clusters without repairing them uh so just we have to take care of those repairs and the storage errors now i have not seen this metric ever populate which is good if at all we had storage errors it will show up here and again as i said all these metrics are collected from cassandra uh using that matrix reporter and they're published here to i mean it's coming from prometheus but what we are looking at is grafana right now so once i go through this list of grafana pages i will go back and show you how my prometheus looks like how prometheus gets the data from nodes so next thing is cassandra memory we all know that cassandra runs in jvm and jvm is heap and off-heap memories so you can see here pretty much if you look at one graph it pretty much starts with basic and then goes up as the time goes on that is the heap gets filled up and then garbage collector comes in cleans it out and then heap drops back to normal and then starts growing again so there is a very specific pattern here and also this will give you indication of how frequently your garbage collection is running and you can see heap allocated that is our jvm heap which is two gigs allocated and right now usage you can see different servers have different usage and as the usage goes up that percentage will will show up in a different color and we all know that cassandra also stores data off heap and here we are showing like you know how much is the off heap consumed so this is about the cassandra memory and the jvm memory used by cassandra basically so the next thing is cash um so we know that cassandra has three types of caches like the key cache row cache and counter cache and remember that the row cache is by default not configured so it is not enabled but whereas key cache you can see right now i have 90 percent hit rate which is pretty good near 9 to 11 percent misses but still if you look at the hits it is pretty pretty good so that's how the cache metrics look like let's look at the queries uh how is the sql queries running you can see how many are cached how many are executed and we definitely want our cassandra to perform really well uh when our application uses most of the query should be prepared queries um you can have now and then you'll your developers will run adobe queries and you will have unprepared queries now if we did not have this kind of visualization it is very difficult to gather this matrix using basic node tool commands so it is it is always better to have a grafana dashboard and we we try to put lot of information and easy to read here so any of these panels if they turn red let's say for example prepared stay a prepared percentage prepared sql statements percentage becomes red color that means you have to look at what what is your application is doing if at all they're not using prepared statements you have to help them you know come up with the queries and tune them if required so after query sql queries let's look at the commit logs so having some pending tasks on commit logs is not bad but you should not constantly see pending tasks in the commit logs and other information like how much size is occupied on each server for commit log that gives you indication of how large your commit logs are on the disk um going further we looked at the commit logs now i'm looking at the clients and you can see for example how many logins happen how many failures generally we don't want hints stored if at all hints are stored that means there is some server down and hints are being stored on the other servers where it has to do the hinted handoffs and if at all any hints are being transferred right now then you will see the sending count so this particular information here tells you like how many uh clients are logging in how many times if there are any failures if at all one client has a wrong password to log in then obviously that will show up in the failures and having too many failures is not good you might have to check with how application is configured let's look at few other things here um more you know this might be more important for tuning your application one is it it shows the latency and this is where i was talking about like you know if at all you have to filter you can actually use these filters up there and you can say for example i want to filter for sales key space and i want to pick only like say for example couple of tables right so you can actually do that filter and it gets applied to rest of the dashboards here so this one this metric here shows that there are table latencies and the latency type if you notice right now it is saying node write latency and there are coordinate read latencies coordinate right latencies there are a couple of different latencies here and we want to make sure why those things are happening if at all they're happening regularly this will help you to to reduce the latencies or you know get insight of which tables are having latencies let's go to the key space size so this particular metric is collected at the key space level we can figure out what are the key space sizes here we are looking at only one key space and it tells you how much data is stored on each node it is shown displayed both in a tabular format as well as the graphical format and you can see on one of the nodes there is lot of data compared to other one um but difference is not too much if you look at that's the megabytes difference so if at all data is properly balanced then you should not see big difference now this is the last panel here which is the table size so we are not showing any of the system tables but you can see here each table and how much size it is at the each node level and so that's how the dashboard looks like now let's uh let's go ahead and see one thing i want to show you is um where is this whole project published right so you can see this is the github where we published all the information on how to configure this this particular graphene dashboard and it also teaches us how to configure prometheus let's say for example it walks you through step by step on how to get prometheus how to install it how to configure it it shows all the configuration required for prometheus side of it now what i can do is i can quickly show you how my prometheus looks like so if you will wait for a second here to okay so here is the prometheus uh uh my prometheus looks like and basically you can look at the metrics published by one of the nodes let's say you know if you look at the earlier slide on the architecture so let's review this architecture for one more time so you see we have three cassandra nodes and each cassandra node has a node exporter and node exporter is is an agent which collects this matrix and publishes it to prometheus i have not talked about the shell script yet but that node exporter whatever it is publishing prometheus gets those metrics and stores them locally so what i was trying to show you here on this this piece here let me go back to the matrix here so these are the metrics published by our node exporter and prometheus is able to see this matrix it will collect all this metrics and store it in its own time series database so if you look at one of these metrics like let let me scroll down a little bit say for example we are looking at a mount point information okay so you see for example uh it tells you what is the mount point and this is the cluster and this is the data center where it came from this is the node it came from and what is the mount point here it is showing the root mount point and how much is the size of that mount point total allocated size in kilobytes similarly there are a lot of metrics which are like you know specific to cassandra like you're looking at the table size displayed in bytes now if you read a little bit right uh understanding these metrics is not very difficult because they're all written in plain text you can look through and understand how node exporter is publishing this metrics and how prometheus is able to consume them right now what prometheus does is it goes at a specified frequency it goes to each server and collects all those metrics and stores them locally on prometheus it has a time series database and then grafana goes and grabs those metrics and displays them in the nice dashboard here now what i can do is um let's see let's look at the presentation if at all i missed anything i talked about the architecture i talked about the dashboards we talked about the let me see that is my github page where we publish this project so look at the github page we have other projects published let me walk through a little bit on the on the prometheus configuration how it looks like in the background and also the shell script we talked about okay so we'll do a very quick uh walk down on on all the steps here so this is the folder where we have all the cassandra ml files right now this is the sample file which comes with cassandra software and you can read through that to understand how cassandra can publish the metrics without using jmx concept so we are not touching jmx in this now this is the matrix reporter we have configured for our cluster or each node by just looking at the top few lines what we are telling is cassandra every 900 seconds it picks up all these metrics which we configured and dumps them into this output file here this is just a plain text file which gets written every 15 minutes cassandra will dump matrix into this so let me just do 20 lines out of this file you can see one of the metrics published here uh if you see this is the system traces sessions table and we are talking about the right latency so good thing here is we don't have latency because if you look at that count is 0 and most likely we do not publish this to grafana because if there is no latency there is no point in publishing unwanted metric if somebody wrote java code and published a jar file that is where i have problem with like you know i don't know what they're publishing into prometheus and i just want to make sure i have full control of what i'm publishing so this clearly tells you this particular config file you can look at earlier tells you exactly which metrics we're publishing okay now on each node we also need to configure one shell script which runs frequently converting this text file into prometheus format so let's look at our cron job and figure out how we configured our prometheus metrics so this is the shell script which is publishing all this metrics into a prometheus format now what what do i mean by prometheus format is if you look at the temp folder there is one file published called prometheus format okay so let me just show you a few lines of that so this is how the prometheus formatted a metric looks like so it needs a metric name and it needs other parameters like say which cluster it is coming from uh what is the server name and what is this metric let's say for example cpu used percentage and you can see for example it is six percent used right is it six percent use yes and say for example here we have a ram available and it shows you available in bytes so things like this the metrics are published in prometheus format and how the text file we created with cassandra got converted to this prometheus format is using this shell script now because it is a shell script you can basically if you're good at shell scripting you can actually read through the shell script and understand how this shell script works so because we are not hiding anything everything is open sourced here so you can read through all of these configurations all of this files and understand how we are converting the metrics coming from cassandra into prometheus format and and also on github it is all documented on how to configure this whole setup right this is this is how the shell script looks like and we can we can quickly take a look at uh so we'll go back to that architecture diagram for one more second and you see for example we were looking at our cassandra nodes uh we just looked at our shell script we also looked at the node exporter ah well we did not look at the node exporter what node exporter does is it publishes the metrics in this format every node will publish this as a url and and then prometheus can go grab this matrix at every [Music] given interval whatever is configured on the prometheus server so we can look at the prometheus setup right now so if you look at prometheus current there should be a aml file here and this is the prometheus ml file so if you look at more prometheus yaml you can see here um prometheus has lot of plugins uh we have not configured the alert manager but i mentioned about alert manager earlier so you can configure this alert manager and it will be able to send out alerts if at all something wrong with one of the nodes is down or something you can send a alert to your on-call team or support team now you can see further here for example this is where we are configuring our cassandra node matrix node exporter matrix what we are telling is scrape every 180 seconds and it will go to any of this configured any or all of this configured node exporters and gets the metrics and publishes them or stores those metrics into prometheus database so once you have prometheus running um prometheus url itself like you know prometheus website will look like this so basically you can you can see the prometheus running here you can see if at all prometheus generated any alerts now we don't have any configured alerts here so it doesn't show anything and then you can go into status and look at the targets and these are the targets basically we told prometheus to go and collect metrics from so these are all the node exporters which are publishing their metrics each node and you can look at like say for example you can open one of these tabs and you can look at the metrics published by that specific server so these are all the metrics published by the server okay then as i explained right all these metrics from prometheus are are being pumped into grafana and grafana shows the nice dashboard now my favorite dashboard is is this like you know you can see the memory usage and the cpu usage and also this one which is like telling me how frequently my garbage collector is running and if at all there is there is a too much garbage collection happening then your cluster might be suffering with gc pauses so you might have to tune increase the allocated heap or something like that so i think that is pretty much the rundown of the entire prometheus graphana journey entire project is published on github so you can read through how to configure and make it work for your own cluster this is pretty much like you know canned project if you don't want to understand how it is done you can just configure it and use it for your cluster and if at all you want to understand in detail everything is posted on github so all the details are available thank you very much this was a exciting day i attended several other topics today morning and every speaker was amazing and they brought a lot of insights into cassandra if you're already working on cassandra i hope you learnt a lot today if you are new to cassandra then i hope to see you on the follow-up sessions thank you very much [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
