  "description": "Watch this series: http://bit.ly/tutorial-dmmw | This is an overview of a sample data model for a hotel application from the O’Reilly book “Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition.” Jeff Carpenter shares questions submitted by one of his readers, who noted some of the challenges that would be associated with using this data model in a real application.\n\nABOUT DATA MODEL MEETS WORLD\nThis series takes a look at some of the challenges that users of Apache Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise encounter when creating data models for real world applications. There are a lot of great resources available to learn the basics of Cassandra data modeling, but this series focuses on that next level of questions you’ll run into when you’re developing your application.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 5\nDataStax Enterprise 5.0, the database platform for cloud applications, includes Apache Cassandra 3.x with materialized views, tiered storage and advanced replication. Introduced in 5.0 is DataStax Enterprise Graph, the first graph database fast enough to power customer-facing applications, scale to massive datasets and integrate advanced tools to power deep analytical queries.\n\nLearn more at http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise and https://academy.datastax.com/resources/whats-new-datastax-enterprise-50\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastax?sub_confirmation=1 \nSite: http://datastax.com \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/datastax \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastax \nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/datastax\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/datastax \nhttps://github.com/datastax \n\nABOUT DATASTAX ACADEMY\nOn the DataStax Academy YouTube channel, you can find tutorials, webinars and much more to help you learn and stay updated with the latest information on DataStax Enterprise©.

    "text": "[Music] hi I'm Jeff carpenter Technical Evangelist of data sacks and I'd like to talk with you about data modeling in the real world whether you're a veteran user of Cassandra or just getting started you may be aware that there are some unique constraints with data modeling now there's plenty of resources that are available for you to learn Cassandra data modeling but once you get past the basics you're going to run into some real world challenges I'm here to help you work through these challenges so that you can meet them head-on Apache Cassandra and data sacks Enterprise have been proven is the database of choice for cloud applications everything from customer facing retail systems to Internet of Things systems for this series will focus on the hotel application domain let's do a review of the recommended approach for Cassandra data modeling there are plenty of free resources available to learn to standard data modeling first there's my book Cassandra the definitive guide the second edition the entire data modeling chapter from this book is actually available for free on The O'Reilly website data stacks Academy also has an excellent course on data modeling you should really work through the exercises finally there's the killer video application which is maintained by the evangelist team this is a great example of a data model in a real world application let's start with a quick look at how we develop up data models for applications using Cassandra I'm going to use the hotel domain example from my book we might use this to build an application that allows users to shop for hotel rooms the process starts with entity-relationship data modeling you can see here the key nouns in our domain hotels nearby points of interest the rooms offered by each hotel along with the amenities and when the rooms are available finally there's information about guests and their reservations one of the great things about starting your data modeling this way is that as is agnostic of what type of data store you're going to use whether it's a tabular style like Cassandra a key value or document store or even graph this becomes important later on when we discuss multi model once we've identified the entities in our domain the attributes and relationships between them we need to think about how our application is going to access the data this is really important for Cassandra data modeling the strategy is different than typical relational data modeling instead of doing various normalization steps we use a query first as approach we designed tables around the query our application needs to support looking at this representative set of access patterns for a hotel reservation application you might imagine this goes along with a user interface storyboard a customer enters a point of interest to get a list of nearby hotels they take a hotel and view the various rooms available at the hotel the customer decides to book a room and a reservation is created they may come back on a future visit to the site to look up the room by various criteria there are also access patterns for hotel users who want to see who is coming to the property once we have the access patterns defined we'll do some logical data modeling this diagram shows a logical data model for a hotel application using a chibok code diagram named after one of our colleagues here at data stacks you'll notice that the access patterns from the previous view are referenced here to show which table supports each of the queries the diagram focuses on the shopping portion of the application will leave the reservations for later if you follow the arrows you can see how the tables relate to each other each step in our application workflow is supported by a subsequent query at this point we've already started to identify the keys for each table this will determine how the data in each table is partitioned and organized for queries the next step is to create a physical data model at this point we assign types to each of our attributes and identify the Cassandra key space that will be used for each table the final step is to write the actual Cassandra query language schema that will define our key space in our tables at this point you might be thinking hey that's a really nice data model but it's too simple my application is way more complex than that and I had some real challenges I totally sympathize with you these simplified models that we create to learn hard topics can only take us so far one of my readers was kind enough to really engage with the material in the book and he started asking some hard questions which I've shown here I'm not going to read these to you in detail but if you look closely at the highlights there are some interesting challenges here if most of the tables reference a hotel by its ID where the ID come from how do we ensure uniqueness of hotels point of interest names should all that data be stored in Cassandra if not where else would we put it these tend to be the typical questions that a lot of developers and architects have they're trying to build real applications with Kassandra so I thought I would take these reader questions along with some others that I hear frequently and distill them down to a list that we can look at one at a time there are questions like how can I ensure the unique identity of my records and still be able to find them later this is a question of identity how do i navigate the relationships between different data types stored on my tables this is a question about relationships how should my data model relate to my architecture this is a question about architecture when should I use cassandra versus other data models like key value or graph this is a question about multi model how do I support additional queries without having to create a lot of new tables this is a question about search how do I ensure my data model will perform well this is a question about scalability okay well those are the questions let's start finding some answers you [Music]",
