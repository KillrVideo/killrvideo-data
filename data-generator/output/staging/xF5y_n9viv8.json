please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so we will know we are good and we can proceed uh today with you aaron plotz and alex walshner developer advocates at data starts and we are going to speak about the one of the most exciting nosql databases apache cassandra hi aaron how you doing great alex how are you really i'm very well sorry i have interrupted you i guess oh no that's that's quite all right quarter right good so looks like we are good stream is fine and we can start well then let's start we have a lot of things to cover today and uh first two words about ourselves that's aaron on the left side on the screen and alex on the right side of the screen developer advocates at data starts we work with apache cassandra for many years and we are totally excited to meet you all here today aaron would you maybe say a couple of words about yourself oh yeah thanks alex um yeah i'm like alex said i'm also a developer advocate at data stacks before i was a developer advocate i i've worked at a few you know fortune 50 enterprises you know working on some large-scale cassandra clusters and solving some really big problems with it um i was also nominated to be a cassandra mvp years ago back when we still did that so that that's something that i'm hoping we're bringing back um and yeah and i've also worked as an author on a couple of books about cassandra and a couple other nosql databases as well so so yeah that's basically about me and great so and i'm uh also with quite strong engineering background what i love is using great tools in the right way and what i hate is inefficiency and for me fighting if inefficiency is a way to help people use right tools in the right way to solve problems not like trying to hit everything to a hammer but use a microscope when you need a microscope so let's all uh proceed that's not only two of us but there is plenty of people working on this workshop and all the other workshops we do also and this one looks uh this team looks great because there are plenty of people working to deliver the content you are watching right now and uh gerland i see there is a continuous echo i cannot confirm that sound looks good for me and on our site it's all green maybe you have headphones or something i don't know so let's proceed we first have to ask you some questions to understand what the level of the audience today and we will adjust questions properly and we will adjust topics we discuss properly so let's start uh to answer your uh so for you to answer questions we use mentee.com and to go to mendy.com the easiest way is just scan back ur code on the right or go to mentee.com and enter the code you see on the left side two nine nine seven two five one seven and uh that's easiest way for me personally to use menti is to just open it on my mobile phone and then answer questions there right now it's not really required it's optional but if you stay with us and with a mentee till the end you then participate in the game if you will answer your questions it's a quiz and then you can win the prizes so let's start and first question it's not yet a piece so don't be in a rush just some questions for us to understand you third question where are you guys and girls from so what's the place in the world you are currently located i believe i've seen in the chat uh someone from colombia hey we have a lot of people from india as always a lot of people from the united states this time and i see someone in the very south of the south america is it argentina i'm sorry i'm quite weak in south american geography i'm serene yeah africa welcome europe someone from europe like me yeah oh someone in canada too like northern canada looks like wow great okay so we have plenty of people we have few dozens of people joining at 90 already salve salve i'm learning italian meanwhile so i'm always happy to see you guys from italy uh good now there is a quite a holy work question what's your favorite program favorite programming language you can give up to three answers one answer for one question and uh aaron what do you think which language will win oh if if i had to guess i would say we will see java up there uh quite a bit yeah i hope we will see python quite high okay it's getting higher but so far java keeps these uh place that's clear oh now take a look java and python of almost the same size yeah javascript gets bigger go long hey hello fellow golang guys i write uh using golank recently quite a lot what oh it looks like python's taking it over yeah i told you i told you well fighting is great okay php uh go go and go lank is the same i see well someone put forthright in there wow that's quite rare answer nowadays also german country german companies still looking for fortran developers really c plus plus not so much hey basic basic who did that yeah all right very many years ago i started uh my programming education from uh zxx basic for zx spectrum version it was uh a quite interesting experience i would say oh you had a spectrum huh oh that's that's totally cool well it's not it wasn't exactly spectrum it was a russian clone of spectrum called uh dubna but yeah it was like spectrum based okay so that's you see java python i would say python is a little bit bigger we will see the answers then later let's go and javascript nobody likes javascript come on who put that well personally i'm not a big fan of javascript type of typescript uh but still what's your experience with sql databases whatever is it's a mysql maria postgres oracle microsoft sql server whatever doesn't matter i'm [Music] very curious of okay most of our attendees have definitely some experience masters of joints i see professional programmers great uh i'd say there will be some people who never use it sql before this workshop is about no one of the most powerful no simple databases and um it may be a little bit rough experience for you but stay strong you will make it and we are here to answer your questions that's right obviously it will be the most comfortable for those who already familiar with sql databases of course okay what's your experience with nosql databases never use it some experience okay okay there are you see the distribution is very different sql databases dominated the market of the database for dozens and dozens of dozens of years like for 70 years i would say right uh well not no to my 70 a bit less but that's 50 for sure i think um the first version of oracle came out in was it 79 i think so so yeah okay and now uh but the world is changing we get more and more data your internet service provider is not a bottleneck anymore so we want to have more data faster and faster with no delays and we have bigger variety of this data not always data is structured or sometimes we want to deploy our data to all the world now more and more global companies like netflix like apple and over others requirements have changed and then no sql databases came in and there are still a lot of developers developers who has nearly zero experience with no sql and that's totally fine today you will get in touch with uh one of the best of them uh and final question before we go to the topic are you a certified no sql developer maybe apache cassandra expert or not i believe most of our attendees aren't certified in no sql field because well it becomes a thing not so long time ago and that's introduction level workshop right so okay we have we have one certified and two even i'm curious for cassandra or for another nosql database now i'm asking that for a reason uh because uh you know what we have a next slide we always have next slide and the next slide is going to be a very big and very great surprise to you datastax sponsors your education and certification as the nosql expert in the future if you pay enough attention if you attend our courses you will be ready to pass a certification so take a look we have academy.datastax.com there are courses on nosql database for free you don't pay for them but even better you learn at the academy for free but then you want somehow to confirm what you did so it will be easier to get better salary to find maybe better job and then you get a free voucher to pass a certification for apache cassandra for free normal price is almost 150 dollars united states dollars of course but with that voucher you get this certificate you get to this exam for free and if you studied follow enough if you like put your attention into that put put efforts into that with no questions you because you'll become a certified apache cassandra expert totally free globally recognized no sql certification i love my job you know alex i was just going to say that i mean for that price you really can't uh go wrong and um you know if you if you want to study up for the certification exam um alex actually put out a workshop on it a few weeks ago that um is is actually really really good so i i advise everyone to take a look at it and uh you know help get you ready for it bankerstocks.com and i see people asking for the link that's my guy that's guys who want to have a link right now h let me check https academy.datastax.com here we go harrisbury for you for astra it's free you just sign up and get to the courses uh for developers i recommend uh developer path and for administrators i recommend obviously administrator puff you will find them on the main page of the academy good so let's move on keep this window open in the end of the workshop you will participate in a game and take your chance to win the prizes meanwhile we start with the workshop so a few things you need to know before uh we go on livestream is on youtube mostly probably you are watching it on youtube right now it is uh recorded right now and later you can get back in any moment and review it um check out the parts maybe you didn't get it stays available forever for free we have a backup channel on twitch we are streaming that as well but which is a plan b for us so we don't watch comments and we don't answer questions then speaking of questions as soon as this workshop is over uh youtube stream will be over too and you cannot ask questions in the youtube chat what do you do then to ask questions and to stay in touch with data stocks developers we recommend to use our discord server which is available at data starts dot io slash discord like that and here you will be able to communicate with huge almost 30 000 developers uh community ask your questions give your answers of course and just chat if you would like to and for games and quizzes and questions we use menu.com what we've just seen now uh hands-on we will do a practical part because it's a workshop right so you are supposed to push some buttons not just listen but there is nothing to install because we have installed everything for you in the cloud on the github we have workshop materials github.com data start steps workshop intro to cassandra then uh we use as a primary nosql database for this workshop cassandra but cassandra is quite advanced in its deployment so to simplify the things for you we already deployed it in the cloud and you don't have to deploy anything configure anything uh turn on multiple servers because cassandra is distributed so you will need many servers you don't have to do anything like that we did it for you it's called a data stacks ultra db basically uh astrodb is a cassandra in the cloud as a service one last thing as you are going to put your time and lot to learn a lot of things today we want to say thank you for that and to give you an achievement unlocked a page uh participation certificate uh for this introduction to cassandra workshop offered by datastax developers that it's already received by 572 persons and i can't wait for it to leave to have a little celebration uh to have 1000 people receiving this page and i hope you will to participate on that now how do you get this page first you have to obviously watch this workshop quite clear second you will have to do workshop steps and then complete the homework which is explained at github.com datastaxdevs workshop intro to cassandra at a homework part and i see people are asking for the github link github link is here uh it will be pasted but by our nightbot in a moment so when you complete your homework submit it following the link uh at homework part and you will be good homework so yeah we haven't been on one of our workshops yet you know we have a lot of shortcuts that are built in and we have a bot to handle those in the chat for for youtube um so you can do like you know exclamation point github and they'll get that link exclamation point mendy and you'll see the the link for mentee and many other things too good and i believe we have nightbot uh wrong misconfigured for the workshop homework i believe because it says no submission is required but actually it is required so i hope some of my colleagues are watching us right now and they will fix it in a moment but we will stir so let's go we are going to talk about many incredible things apache cassandra it was developed and first introduced in somewhere around year 2010 or uh 12 it was developed in facebook originally then later it was contributed to apache software foundation it was developed in facebook to solve facebook sites problems a lot of data a lot of output a lot of transactions every second dozens hundreds millions of transactions per second clients worldwide and a lot a lot of data obviously not no there is no relational database what can cope with such pressure a lot of data very fast still so that's a transactional database available a customer-facing database right and more and more and more data meanwhile in the united states in india in europe in africa you know well you know facebook i hope i shouldn't explain you what is it but then become later biggest cassandra users became companies like apple and netflix notice also global and very successful companies those have a lot of data and those need to have extremely fast performance incredible performance netflix serves nearly all of its streaming data with apache cassandra they have hundreds of clusters and they have 30 million iterations per second on a single most active cluster but overall count is significantly higher meanwhile they store hundreds petabytes of data over rare cassandra clusters and obviously data is distributed all across the worlds using multiple data centers but you know what netflix isn't the biggest deployment because uh apple scale is significantly higher uh by now this uh photo is the spot on the right apple scale was done on a conference a couple of years ago and now actually i believe it's closer to 200 000 dedicated apache cassandra servers running together with petabytes storage hundreds petabytes and many many many many millions operations per second yeah i remember that conference when when apple first uh you know kind of showed their their original slide and everyone was just blown away at just how much uh cassandra infra they were using that was that was pretty crazy um and you know another another note we're sharing too is that um you know i mean yeah netflix was really one of the first to um uh to kind of adopt cassandra on a large state scale and uh they actually contributed and still do a lot of the uh ecosystem tooling that um you know kind of helps helps build out and um you know helps helps uh developers use cassandra as well so netflix is very very involved in the community right and actually very good what you've mentioned that uh i am a big fan of open source i'm an open source developer i spend a lot of time working on open source and it really makes me happy what companies like apple netflix instagram are working together on cassandra delivering it as an open source project even competitors are still working together developing this project that's amazing i mean that i believe makes the world a little bit better place when people collaborate even then they compete in some other products right right okay so uh very good but why companies speak apache cassandra what makes it different from other databases there are plenty of great databases my first database i started to work with uh was in production was my sequel quite some many years ago and before that something like microsoft access i believe but it's only in the university so it's not a real deployment most of those databases work very well as long as you have data would fit into a single server but when you have when you start to have terabytes petabytes of data they just cannot handle that cassandra is designed to be big data ready from the very beginning doesn't matter how much you have it's still able to handle this pressure then meanwhile again there are plenty of databases what can store a lot of data but then when you have another problem they are usually very slow that is fine when you want to use your database as a cold storage but when it's a customer facing database you know what customers don't want to wait if you are slow your customers will go to your competitor right so that's the story uh cassandra is also designed to handle not only huge amounts of data but also dispatch them within milliseconds so it's very fast then it scales linearly and i will explain in a moment what that means usually there is a lot of questions it's highly available it's able for self-healing and automated so it decreases pressure on the iterations teams who normally have to do a lot of work maintaining their databases but cassandra automates that cassandra works perfectly spreading the data over multiple regions areas continents that's totally fine cassandra's platform agnostic and vendor independent now what does that all mean first big data ready cassandra uses partitioning of the data using multiple servers that brings us to a situation what this database cluster is clustered by default right can handle data of any sites and then you have to store some more data let's say you have had 10 servers and now they are full and you still need to store more just add more servers and cassandra server call it usually traditionally a node and you will be good because cassandra will add new nodes into this cluster redistribute those partitions and you will have enough disk space again read write performance so take a look even a single cassandra node is very performant but when you have huge pressure from the customers all across the world then there is not as there is no single server what can handle that there's just no such machine uh at all if we have too many people on the planet maybe i don't know but it's definitely too much for a single purse or a pure server then again due to the existing distributed nature of a cassandra and decentralized nature of the cassandra cassandra cluster consisting of multiple nodes able to handle very high pressure um and dispatch transfers very quickly again using multiple nodes and if you have maybe not so much volume you don't need so much disk space but you have a lot of customers requiring their answers right now you again can add more servers to your cluster the workload will be automatically redistributed over those servers notice automatically you don't have to configure it it's already done for you and you have higher for output and you are done also decentralization so masterless architecture there is no master server means what every node is able to deal with any request read or write and that's totally amazing yeah that decentralization piece i was just going to say alex is really what i think separates it from from many other databases in that um you know you'll you'll have so many other nosql databases that you know they'll be distributed but they'll only accept rights on you know a certain node or certain types of nodes which can actually like kind of form a bottleneck in and of itself but with with cassandra i mean any node can handle any request and and that is really one of its best features for sure yep uh one of the typical things one of the typical problems we've uh centralized databases when your master server or when you primary or leader server is down you have to reconfigure your application to write to another master as soon as it's selected and your application needs to know now i write to master server one now i write to master server two oh hey master one is back what do i do and let's always get lost with cassandra it's not a point you can write to any server and it will process this the query it's totally fine you don't have to think about that now there is a very important thing there are again plenty of databases what can scale can we question is how do they scale usually adding more powerful servers adding more servers into the cluster always comes with a price and i don't mean real price in dollars but i mean the price of overhead i think more servers lead you to the situation what uh it every next server will give you less and less and less and in the end uh you can add 10 more servers to a cluster it will give you uh no benefit it's not like that in cassandra cassandra scales linearly for both volume for both velocity there is no limitation and you add more servers uh cassandra scales linearly and you can scale as much as you want netflix did a great research by the way guys if you are not subscribed to netflix tech blog i believe you should it's one of the best technical blogs in the world uh regardless solving um software development and software architectural problems it's really very exciting a very interesting thing so they did a research scaling a tiny experimental cassandra cluster from 45 machines i believe to 300 and measuring performance meanwhile and notice this nice smooth line with most of the databases this line wouldn't go so high it will make like down and down and down and go somewhere here in the end but cassandra skills linearly and that is an amazing feature and one more thing it requires proper data model if you do that or if you do your job wrong then linear scaling may be under a question but we will teach you how to do date model right then highest availability so take a look cassandra is designed to be highly available and even not just full tolerant but disaster tolerant using multiple data centers or multiple availability zones over different regions and many servers per region or pair availability zone with replication technology decentralization strategy and topology replacement makes down times nearly impossible there is no single point of failure because there are no master nodes there are always multiple live replicas available uh cassandra cluster is smart so it uses network topology their data placement basically you don't want to have all your replicas within the same server rack or within the same cloud availability zone you know cloud availability zone can fail easily it happens and server racks tend to fail together cassandra automatically understands network topology and puts data into different availability zones or into different server rates so outage of a zone or a server rack doesn't lead to an availability of all of the replicas for this set of data and finally clients are also very smart so uh clients what you use in your application have very smart reconnection and strong retry mechanism which in case of failures can automatically reconnect to another server or even to another data center that's a that's a good callout alex in that you know when you think about cassandra and it's its ability to uh to work with with high availability it's uh it's really a design consideration that was driven from the the amazon dynamo paper that that came out like like 15 years ago or so but it it kind of laid the groundwork for obviously you know amazon dynamo but at the same time it really set kind of the baseline for what a highly available system looks like you know when you when you think about amazon and you think about like how many thousands of servers they have across the world there's no way that everything's working 100 of the time you know so when you design systems and you think about that possibility for co-existing with some amount of failure you know that's what really you know kind of kind of helps you be able to adapt and be able to uh remain highly available so yeah totally now uh this is the introduction to cassandra for developers workshop uh and that means what most of you are developers mostly probably and don't care about us poor operations guys but as someone from both developer and operations and devops background i can tell you what i really enjoy uh for the things what cassandra can do for the automation point of view so i do not have to do many of the maintenance operations they automated including self-healing including automated smart data placement and so on and so forth uh geographic distribution we already discussed it cassandra's trademark is multi-data center deployments granting you exceptional capability for disaster tolerance and keep your data close to your clients if your day if your clients are in the united states you don't want to serve their queries from australia or from i don't know china that's going to be too far if you are working a global company you need multiple data centers across the world and all data centers are active there is nothing like this data center expensive this data center is active okay platform agnostic means what apache cassandra can work in every cloud on-premises microsoft azure amazon web services google cloud that's totally fine it works everywhere you don't have to worry if can i launch it on azure or aws now you may think hey that's normally not a problem by a database for a database but then you are wrong there is a plenty of platform specific databases try to launch a try to launch dynamodb on google cloud or try to launch bigtable on amazon web services there is no way to do that there is just no way to do it their platform specific cassandra is agnostic you uh deployed it on aws but now you are not happy with the price you can easily migrate to google cloud with that and it will be totally fine it's not easier for many other databases and finally cassandra is well you know data stocks did a lot for apache cassandra but data stacks does not own cassandra cassandra belongs to apache software foundation non-profit non-commercial organization we should know for sure or definitely know its products at least hadoop maven kafka spark all other apache products and actually this is i believe one of the biggest and most successful non-profit non-commercial open source foundations in the world i'm very proud on the collaboration we are we are having uh that's just great so it doesn't belong to any uh commercial company it's not a proprietary database it's an open source uh database uh decentralized database management system okay so there is a lot of features in in just a couple of minutes we will discuss how it works in detail how all this magic possible but right now first we go to the hands-on lab the parent lot and aaron will share his screen i hope oh yeah i'm i'm trying to share i i hope you hope you're picking me up there yeah give me okay i see you are sharing so i'm switching to your screen in a moment all right boom you know you watch oh excellent excellent you know just just to add too we've talked a lot about apache cassandra not so much about data stacks astrodb but just just to clarify that astrodb really is um like managed cassandra under the hood you know there's you know alex and i talk a lot about um you know kind of the operational workload that that comes with managing a cassandra cluster well with astrodb we kind of take that take that away so it's like cassandra but without any of the pain you know without any of the the hassles of uh having to build up and maintain your own your own infrastructure right uh running a decentralized database across multiple data centers is not a simple job even with all amazing cassandra features it still can be quite a lot of headache and that's why we implemented astra the data stocks so cassandra experts are taking care of this headache and you just enjoy the features without need to wake up in the deep at night to realize what's going on with your top stones and why your server 52 is slowed down it's our job to do astra is a cassandra as a service in the cloud and it offers incredible free tier now actually aaron i'm switching back to your screen i was back in mind to show a couple of slides regarding astra and last one for that all the hands-on steps we will do today uh and explain it in details on our github github.com datastacksteps workshop intro to cassandra so give me a moment so aaron you are live your screen is live and you can proceed okay well um you know this is the uh the workshop or yeah really the the steps that we're going to do today um so what we're looking at here is just the get repo that that we've provided the address to um so you can go ahead and go in here and you know it talks through a lot of this it talks about you know what's expected for um you know for the homework if you wanna you know try and get your badge which is good you know i see people on on linkedin all the time you know kind of showing their badges and you know showing showing a little bit about uh you know for um you know like bragging rights and you know i think that's kind of cool that that people do that um so yeah alex do we want to do the the create your astro databases right away here yes let's start uh we have to register because we will need a couple of minutes to spin up your database so we better sign up right now for the next exercise when your database will be ready all right so if you look there's there's a whole bunch of steps in here but um i'm going to walk you through this as visually as i can so you see this link here of um you know i'll try and highlight it of astra datastax.com what i'm going to do is open that up in another tab here and um right right off the bat it's going to prompt me to log in now i can go ahead and create a new account with um you know my email and some credentials or i can you know validate with my github or with my google i'll just go ahead and and uh sign in with my uh my google account just because uh astor knows who i am oh and uh you know there's a chance that you might get uh some questionnaires like this you know just and that's just us wanting to know a little bit more about you and and really trying to understand how astr's being used so i'm going to say that i'm i'll say i'm learning cassandra that that'll be a good one here uh my primary programming language i would say is java even though i've done well pretty much everything there but that's okay um and for my role i you know at you know me at heart i'm more of a dba sre um type of a type of a person and yes i'm currently running a cassandra workload actually my laptop has about six versions of cassandra on it but that's that's okay i'll say uh say next there all right and i'll i'll skip that oh can i skip that oh just finish sign up oh there we go okay so all right so the first thing that's going to come up here is um what we call our aster dashboard um you can see i have a i have clear instructions here on how to create my first database um also important to note is that you can see my current plan down here is free um every month you get uh in credits and that's for things like data storage and data movement um but the the cool thing is that just to get started you don't have to provide a credit card or any kind of payment information um and and alex if i remember it i think you get what is it 80 gigs of storage and then i forget what the guard rail is on on throughput but um it's it's actually enough for like a small production level workload yes so uh there is around 80 gigabytes of disk space that should be enough for quite a lot of data and uh right for output read for output is also quite high that's obviously is not enough if you're running netflix uh but uh for the smaller projects it can be enough and you are allowed to use that even for small production workloads it's totally fine uh you will be you will be asked to give your credit card only when you uh pass through those limits uh and if it happens uh for you then mostly probably you are already earning some money on your project so you're good now guys there are questions about credits take a look if you are on a free tier you do not need those credits you need credits only then you are already on the paid level uh then you may need some credits uh to uh cover the expenses but if you are on a free tier there is no uh bills there is no credits needed as well so it's totally fine to have no credits don't worry about that if you are on the free tier you are good uh now uh question from shubha while creating database it's asking for region what to sell uh in general select the region which is closer to your location that's the power of a cassandra you can have your database cluster data centers over the world for now just pick the closest one maximum number of let's get advice right there alex so just just go ahead and pick one for today it's okay all right so i suppose i can start here by uh just going to create a database it'll ask for a database name um let's see here so for the database name you know it doesn't really matter there's not a whole lot that uses the database name programmatically but our instructions say to call it workshops so i'll do that and then for key space name we're going to call this chat sandra so as you could have as you can maybe guess a little bit from that we're using a uh you know like like a chat based uh app is is the the data model that we're gonna build um i'm gonna stick with google cloud and uh since i'm in north america i'll go here and i'll pick some place in south carolina that should uh that should work for me and then i'll say create all right so it'll bring me back to the dashboard here um if i zoom in yeah if i zoom in a lot but if i zoom in a bit you can see that i'm actually in a pending status right now and that means behind the scenes that uh my database is actually being spun up on the infrastructure so i should get an email in a few minutes actually telling me that it's uh that it's ready to go um so i think well we all wait for our databases to come up we transfer back to the presentation right alex yep uh totally okay so give me a moment uh right okay so we are switching back to my first i thought it will take a little bit longer for you so you caught me off guard but i'm getting back so here we go just a second it's starting uh there is a good question by tejan what does cassandra use in the back end to spin up the infrastructure so take a look cassandra is infrastructure agnostic you can put it nearly everywhere then it's for you to take care of the infrastructure infrastructure and there are some options some companies prefer to go with bare metal like to have maximum of the performance to have varied units up uh servers they go with bare metal now uh there are some companies that go with virtual machines uh in the cloud maybe in some of their own deployments third option is kubernetes and i will tell you by a secret astra so cassandra is a service astra runs on kubernetes and then finally there is a special deployment of apache cassandra if for any reason you cannot use uh astra but you still want to use cassandra on kubernetes there is kate sandra which is a great uh way basically to deploy cassandra on kubernetes and which helps a lot with that and now give me a moment yeah hey it looks like my database is up so i expect that you know i'm hoping many of yours will will too yep so meanwhile i'm switching back to my screen and we will proceed garland asks what region do i use the one which is closest to you yeah it's totally fine now let's go on okay that looks good so i can proceed now cassandra is an extremely powerful solution but how exactly it all works so plenty of uh amazing features uh how do we make it happen there are a few principal points you need to understand cassandra is different to other databases if you will try to use cassandra as my sequel if you vote joints you will fail inevitably and don't tell me i didn't warn you because i warned you right now if you want to be successful with cassandra you need to learn how it works lucky for you we did everything for you to make it happen and to get you well armed working with cassandra with our workshop and with our free courses at the academy.datastax.com okay and of course there's plenty of encryption options it's enterprise level database so all the encryption you may need is available there felipe so now focus on we are getting to some internals first thing and first very important concept data is distributed what does that mean take a look uh take a look at this example we have a single data center of cassandra cluster of a single data center of seven servers so each circle is a server and they are built in a single data center now they form it in a ring but actually that's not like server a works with only this one and only this one it's wrong each server is able to communicate with each server that is important now there is a table on the right side yes cassandra uses tables it's very simple table population by city by country so we have some data for united states cities for canada cities and so on and so forth how traditional databases store these data in the beginning you have a single server and this table is stored on this server and then sometimes you need follow a leading server follower server still a full copy of this table will be stored on each server right you know what then sometimes you get too much data and your sql database cannot handle that and then you have to do sharding and sharding is painful you actually with sharding you lost a lot of sql features uh you cannot use many shiny sql features anymore and there is a lot of manual work and it's painful slow process very fragile process you do not want to have sharding but again we discussed it already there is not a single server in the world what can handle huge data petabytes of data store it together how does it solve it the secret is in cassandra data is split into the partitions and those partitions are distributed over multiple servers therefore more servers you will have uh more partitions will be spread over this cluster uh for example here we see uh what on this server we have two different partitions if you scale out you add more servers these partitions will be migrated to different servers too so therefore pressure by volume and by for output on this particular server will be decreased how does that work yeah eric uh it's kinda matched apology but we prefer to consider it as peer-to-peer topology uh good so how exactly it works the secret is each table has a designated partition key or multiple partition keys it's also possible in this case we see what country is the partition designated partition key for this table and you can guess on this distribution right so all the data is spread based on the country so country is a partition key and those two allocated together on the same server but they're still in different partitions because each server is responsible for the range of partitions good how exactly it happened take a look is this partition key column so country name is being partitioned by a partitioner using more more free hashing algorithm there are some options but it's a default one and it's a recommended way normally you don't want to change it really now then this partitioner gets a volume doesn't matter if it's an integer or a string or multiple fields uh combined together it will use this formula free hashing algorithm to create a token so basically out of any string any value we get integer in the end here you see what australia becomes 59 and canada becomes 12 and deutschland germany becomes uh 45 but take a look normally those numbers are significantly bigger so normal partition token is not like 59 or 12 but very very very very very long number and then each server in the data center responsible for the range of tokens for example if you would have tokens from 1 to 100 uh again those numbers are much bigger of course when having four servers it will be splitted like that first server 1 to 25 second 26 to 50 third 51 to 75 and so on and therefore data from this table based on this partitioning goes uh tell me c day so token 59 where it will go server number free right then toronto and monreal data so uh token number 12 goes to the first server and german token 45 goes to this one second server and for server number four stays idling but not for long that's how it works internally now understanding token ranges token range i mean the general 100 person token range set of all possible tokens we consider it from like zero to 100 again normally numbers are higher if you have one server in your cluster which is quite a rare situation all their tokens and therefore all the partitions will be stored on this token on this server but when you add more servers token ranges will be put accordingly so in this case we have first quarter second fourth quarter and so on now when you add one more server to the cloud to your cluster token ranges will be recalculated and what does that mean recalculated means what now the first server is responsible not for 1 to 25 but 1 to 20 right a smaller amount of partitions per server slower lesser data density lesser pressure more ability to answer fast for the server and you know what you not always have christmas sales you not always have black fridays every business has times then it's everything is quiet no one is watching new episodes of game of thrones and you don't want to pay for your uh cloud infrastructure quite expensive when you have 70 thousands of database servers right quite big numbers going to be then you want to decommission servers you do not need right now and then you remove servers maybe in this case you remove two servers out of this five server data center and take the token ranges are recalculated again so obviously it will be one third second third third third and each server will have higher data density more data but um you will pay less for your servers and in any moment you can you can scale out again now notice a very important thing all those operations are completely automated and all those operations are live then you change anything with your cluster data stays available all the time there is no downtime or adding new server or decommissioning a server or on the rolling update of the servers and that is amazing so high availability for routine operations as well even if you when you have to do a major upgrade it's still possible to do it zero downtime because cassandra is designed to be zero downtime natively uh sure just add a a quick point there um yeah i like that you you talked about the the exercise of um you know when you have like black friday or heavy shopping or transactional periods where um you know you want to add more nodes you want to expand um that that's an exercise that uh that at my last job i used to do quite a bit of you know because we we'd go into the retail season and right before you know we're taking our 60 node clusters and we're building them up to 90. you know or we're taking our 150 node clusters and we're building them up to 200 and then january of every year we do the opposite where we we you're absolutely right we don't want to get you know charged for a whole lot of compute and infra that we're not really taking full advantage of so we do the same same exercise in reverse we'd go scale back down you know you know from those 200 node clusters we'd go back down to 150 or or 120 or you know what whatever but but yeah that's that's another great feature of cassandra in that it allows for that elasticity of um of infrastructure yes yes uh people often ask me about how much data i should put into node like what's the amount of data i want to have on each node and there is no simple answer basically because it depends on your strategy its data density is a quite important thing some companies like netflix prefer to have low data density they put small amount of data per server and it requires them to have more servers but what's the benefit we take is ability to quickly start new servers because we have less data to stream on them or quickly decommission servers right uh so uh therefore vivo infrastructure is flexible they can quickly bring in more nodes or quickly decommission nodes and have as much as they need without paying extra for the redundant nodes what are not required for now or without running into the situation what your customers want your database to buy operational right now and you just send them a message sorry guys my database is scaling out i cannot answer your question right now a complete  right so with smaller amount of data per node you are more flexible with higher amount of data per node you can save some on the permanent server cost but then you cannot scale so easily because you will have more volume of data to stream through your network and by the way there is a great update on that in cassandra version 4 which significantly improved bootstrapping of new servers but we aren't talking about that right now uh my point on that it all depends on your strategy and there is no uh simple answer you should put this i know company what uses cassandra is a cold storage and they have like i i'm trying to remember something for something like 15 terabytes per node maybe uh that's i've heard of crazy sizes like that yeah yeah yeah it's it's not recommended it's a cold storage right you don't expect your database to be quick with this data but it's technically possible yeah and in some scenarios it may be a reasonable choice okay now we are going to talk about data replication but uh aaron maybe there are any good questions we have to answer yeah i i see a couple out there um you know uh arnob is actually asking you know about trying to understand the um the real upper hand use cases where you know cassandra is way ahead compared to other nosql databases um you know i i suppose i could i could answer that by saying that um you know in my uh my last job you know we we supported both cassandra and mongodb in production um as well as redis and elasticsearch and neo4j um so so you know quite the spread of um quite quite the spread of of different nosql technologies um you know mongodb kind of adheres to that um even though it's distributed it adheres to that um paradigm that alex was talking about about um about having like a primary node about you know having having nodes that are secondaries you know nodes that you can fail over to um and the thing with is is that yeah you can allow it to do reads from like the secondary nodes but um you know your rights are still kind of bottlenecked on your on your primary node or primary nodes um you know also too when you start getting into kubernetes and building out uh clusters where where you know things are supposed to be supposed to be throwaway and aren't supposed to you know matter or be as long-lived it's like then you have different node types you have to worry about you know with with my um your routing servers and your config servers and and different things like that um so it just makes it a little trickier and elastic search is actually very similar in um and how it's set up with with like different node types inside of a inside of a single cluster um you know a lot of people out there there's a lot of love for redis and i can totally understand why because redis is crazy fast and redis is a great solution as long as all of your data fits in ram um as soon as you have to start going to disk for your data redis kind of loses some of its uh some of its luster there yes time so really yeah yeah oh go ahead i remember it was a great uh talk uh by radius guys uh many years ago at high lord conference in saint petersburg uh someone uh speaker said uh now we don't uh lose data i mean that's the persistent slayer development and radius now we don't lose data uh all the room was laughing and he was like no no no this time for real and this time this time for real it was very good that's funny that's funny anyway so so yeah that's just you know just in my experience about how how cassandra solves a lot of the a lot of the high throughput scenarios that um you know you'll actually run into with with some other distributed databases right right okay good uh well let's go so first thing we discussed data is distributed that means what data is distributed over multiple partitions and spread it over your servers and then you add more servers or vice versa decommission some servers it will be redistributed fresh off it over cluster to keep all servers equally busy now next thing you need to know data is replicated we already covered scalability with partitioning we already covered many great things with partitioning but you know what partitioning is not enough partitioning doesn't help us for a high availability what happens if one of those servers are down then the data storage on this server is not available and we want our data to be 100 of time available then how this happens it's called data is replicated so what is that uh data replicated replicated means data the same piece of data the same row of data or we better to say the same partition is stored on multiple servers at once for example with replication factor one and replication factor one the replication factor defines how many uh servers in a data center will store the partition replication factor one means whatever partition is stored on a single node and as you could guess it makes a cheaper uh deployment because you don't need redundant disk space but that's obviously not going to be highly available right when we have replication factor 2 it means what each server is responsible for two token ranges of itself and of either one of its neighbors and therefore each partition is stored on two different servers and if one of those servers is not available your data is still available and then finally recommended value for replication factor per data center is free free means what each partition as you could guess store it on three different servers does that mean what you need three times more disk space to sale to store the same value of data yes totally i mean there is no magic if you are going to store the same file on three different servers it will consume as much as three times disk space right but take a look disk space is cheap and what is expensive your reputation so if you want this thing to be available if you want your application to be available all the time you have to pay extra reputation is priceless and this space is cheap now even ssd disks are cheap i'm not talking about the old magnetic drives although those of course not recommended for cassandra we recommend ssd drives good so uh what happens if data arrives on the server how it's happening we get data of the united states from our table and it's going to be partition 59 notice what this server is not responsible for this partition we have in this case six different servers but replication factor is free it means what application piece of data each partition is stored on three different servers on these six servers data center then this server what got your query remember each server is able to answer every question every query it using this partition key it knows the data is located so it knows what this data is located on these these and this server and as a result it will coordinate the operations to store this data it will issue their queries to a proper replica servers and they will be stored there now question what happens if one of the servers is not available answer is this query coordinator so server what got your request and processing it will store so-called hilted handoffs and here that handoff is a special persistent data what will be dispatched to a failure server as soon as it recovers it recovers it says to neighbors hey guys i'm back online did i miss anything and they are you lazy boy you missed all the things where is your data and we said they will send to him a hinted handoff and it will be consistent again yeah just a quick point about that um you know it'll it'll it'll store hints for up to three hours by default so as long as you can bring your infrastructure back within that three-hour time period you shouldn't miss anything yeah totally uh if your server was down for more than few hours then hit the hinted handoffs will be discarded in this case you definitely have to launch a repair or maybe in some scenarios it will be even better to decommission this server and bring it back as a new fresh one to your cluster in some scenarios ability it may be a better tactics so okay now some of you may know already what is the biggest problem of replication aaron don't give them any hints i want to see an answer on the youtube chat and we won't proceed as long as you don't answer what is wrong with replication what is the biggest problem of replicated data answer in the youtube chat i think this is one of those times when i would answer because physics you know generally speaking right so consistency yeah bg and uh maniganda prakash uh answer right data consistency data consistency becomes the problem uh when you have a data replicated and that's totally right answer uh applause very well um so the main problem is there are some more options there are some more potential issues storage limitations and so on but storage limitation is always to be considered while storing data doesn't matter if you have replication or not so the right answer is consistency let's take a look we just discovered a situation with a hinted handoff and failed server but what happens for example if you d if there were more than three hours downtime hinted handoff was discarded and your didn't launch uh repair or uh if uh this server was taken out um forever just i don't know physically destroyed while storage hinted handoffs and this one got back but this server was not available at all never it's totally physically destroyed kidnapped by aliens uh damaged during a shark attack uh things happens in data centers you know uh then it means what this guy will never get an update it's called inconsistency this server stores a new value this server stores new velo value but this server in some cases in some rare scenarios but it may happen stores old value it's called internode cross node inconsistency those two are consistent same new value and this one is outdated inconsistent stale so can you make this issue disappear somehow is the magic button well gentlemen ladies i know a lot of magic buttons but not this one as far as i'm concerned it doesn't exist blame not me blame eric brewer [Laughter] so many years ago a guy called eric brewer discover it cap theorem cap for consistency availability and partition tolerance uh which claims what in the distributed environment you can have of consistency availability and partition tolerance only two qualities out of three in case of payload now this sounds a little bit not really clear so let me explain that things to you what is first of all availability a consistency and partition tolerance and why should you decide between only why can you pick only two of them in case of failure so first availability availability is the easiest concept availability means what when you ask for data you get the answer simple as that we don't speak if it's a consistent answer we don't speak it's uh like the correct answer but you ask your database you get the answer if you don't get the answer database is not available at the moment if you get the answer database is available first feature we talk about today is availability next one consistency consistency is the problem what i explain it to you right now we talked about cross node inconsistency when you have your data replicated on multiple different servers ask all of them and all of them give you the same value most up-to-date value it means what your servers are consistent your database is consistent and then uh if one of them returns outdated value stale data then that means what it's not consistent finally the third feature we want to talk about is the partition tolerance what does that mean it's the most misunderstood concept like i see even people who know cep theorem uh failed to understand this concept i see it very often in the internet on the conferences and so on but you are the best you are attending our workshops so we will explain to you partition tolerance is the ability of your distributed system in this case database to survive network partitioning and what is the network partitioning imagine you have a single data center and in this single data center you have three server racks server rack a two servers server rack b two servers server rec c two servers and boom network partitioning happens some aliens just damaged some of your wires it means what servers of a server rack a cannot reach rex b and c but uh and server from server x b and c cannot reach server uh rack a but both of them stay available to your client understand that thing if a red a is completely not available at all it's not uh network partitioning they are considered down they are not available it's a question of availability but if all of the components of your data center are operational running and available for clients but not available to each other that's network partitioning or another uh situation you have two data centers and they both available for clients but data center a cannot reach data center b and data center b cannot reach data center a that's also network partitioning and i will tell you guys network partitioning is worse than downtime now many people can say alex what can be worse than downtime i mean like really what can be worse than downtime uh database is not available application is not available customers are quitting bosses are angry we lose we are losing a lot of money what can be worse than uh downtime i will tell you network partitioning can be worse because if part of your clients will keep working with data center a while second group of your clients will work with a data center b and it will result in the inconsistency between the operations not cross node inconsistency crossnote inconsistency is not a big deal because it can be repaired automatically cassandra and some other databases are equipped to handle cross node inconsistency but inconsistency of the network partitioning is much worse because there is no automated way to handle operations and even after a few hours running in network partitioning state with split brain it's officially called split brain problem uh you know the only way for you to merge those different operations together will be a manual weight and it's not going to be a nice experience so you don't want to happen to you and as you could guess partition tolerance is the ability of a system to handle network partitioning and now what's the story then the grass is green uh sky sublime and children are laughing and rainbows and unicorns and everything is great then you have all this together your system is partitioned tolerant available and consistent at the same time but you know what happens more moreover it happens inevitably at some point you there will be some dragons there will be no network no power whatever will happen and some servers will be down or unavailable and at this moment you can decide only between ca ap and cp so you can be only there or where or where and you cannot be here and you definitely do not want to be unable to tolerate network partitioning as a result the only way for you uh to be somewhere as we cannot sacrifice partition tolerance at any cost we have to decide if we are going to be available and partition tolerant by the price of a potential consistency loss or we require to be consistency and partition tolerance by the price of the availability it leads us to the situation what in some cases uh we have to decide if we want to use cp database or ap database which day some databases will prefer availability and partition tolerance and some databases will prefer consistency and partition tolerance to availability and you cannot be in the middle sorry i again blame eric brewer not me now there is a very often misunderstanding many people claim what cassandra is ap database is that so let's take a look with cassandra you have two different knobs two different levels to control the state the position on this cap picture one is called a replication factor and second is called consistency level turning those knobs pushing those buttons you can set cassandra in different positions in different situations or on this cep theorem and that's what you need to understand cassandra is configurably consistent because the cassandra is not ap or cp strictly but you can set it to be the way you want to be moreover each database works with different kinds of data each application works with different kinds of data and some of your data is extremely important to you you cannot afford it being inconsistent imagine you work with money you don't want uh your data you don't want your bank to be inconsistent with your uh bank account right but meanwhile there is a plenty of data what applications works which you can dispatch stale data and it will be totally fine for example your profile picture on facebook who gives who cares if uh you will see not the port of what was updated five seconds ago but the previous version do you really care about that in most of the cases no so this thing in cassandra is controllable configurable and my main thing to understand the main tool to understand is a consistency level what is the consistency level in any moment of the time for each particular query for each select insert update delete operation well not perfectly but for a selected serial date insert you can set required consistency level you require to have and consistency level defines how many acknowledgements how many confirmations you will wait before the response is dispatched so what is that is how it works uh there are different consistency levels like any one local one two three quartum local core on each forum i will explain them in a moment but the main thing you need to understand is what consistency level defines the amount of uh confirmations or acknowledgments what your data was stored if we do have right or your data was uh consistent when you do a read aaron you wanted to add something oh um i was i was just going to to say alex that um you know it's it's quite common in you know like like large to solve large data problems in large enterprises to actually use like a mixed consistency level you know um many times i'd be coaching application teams that um that wanted a higher level of consistency so one thing we would have them try would be to write maybe at quorum but then to read at one you know that way they still get that high performance of of a truly highly available system on the read side but they get a little more um you know consistency on on the right side um so that's one way that um you know you'll see you'll see teams try to solve that problem too yeah now oh you will have a chance to add these uh in a moment when we start to discuss which consistency level is right currently uh we are thinking on how it works in general um no take a look uh that's a very good question by shubham uh then we do uh when we have a take a look it's a write operation we've on the data center with replication factor three we've consistency level one and first client writes data to a node normally client writes data to one of replica nodes directly but let's say it happened client wrote to a wrong node and now this node is uh is to dispatch data to a proper replica node and first thing it does it puts the data to all three replica nodes simultaneously asynchronously so it will be three network operations executed simultaneously at the very same moment of the time but now we have to wait before we get confirmation before one of the servers uh before those servers will answer yes i got your data we are good and therefore when we write with consistency level one as soon as we get first answer we immediately dispatch this answer to a client you see it's a consistency level one if work varied we require consistency level two uh consistency level two when we will wait for how many confirmations acknowledgements two of course and uh there is a consistency level quorum which basically means majority of the nodes majority for replication factor three is true majority for replication factor five is free so more than half of the nodes so in this case quorum and two are equivalent in this case we wait for two confirmations and when we do uh operation on the consistency level 3 for replication factor all or if we do a creation on the consistency level all which is equivalent to consistency level 3 before replication factor 3 we will wait for the confirmations of all of the nodes but in any scenario data will be written to all of the replica nodes for our application factor free it will be free servers for replication factor five it will be five servers and so on now we have plenty of consistency levels uh there are a couple of specials i want to mention i already explained it all all means we will wait for the confirmations of all the servers storing this data then quorum means we will wait for the confirmation of a majority of the servers storing this data so more than a half of the replica servers uh then two last points what is a local and how its difference from one and what is the local quorum how it's different from a normal form uh local is a special keyword which means i will wait for the confirmation only from the closest data center take a look imagine you have your application deployed in the united states working with united states customers let's say it's in north virginia and obviously uh you want these instances of application to work with the cassandra data center located also in north virginia right you don't want uh american customers to wait for the answer from the data center somewhere in frankfurt or i don't know australia right but if you do not use if you have multi-data center deployment but if you wait for a quorum it will means it will mean uh majority of all the replica servers and if you have three data centers uh it's going to be quite a while uh that's why it's recommended to use local which will me which means i will wait for confirmations of the majority of the servers from the closest data center i have to this application server running same for local one and then each quorum means i will wait for the quorum confirmation of every data center i have across the world it's obviously not going to be the fastest one but one of the most reliable and it's important to have then you can write to the same partition from multiple different locations and from multiple different data centers if normally your customer writes to only one data center when local quorum will be a better choice of the performance consequences uh so now again very often misunderstood thing you can define consistency level on pair query basis you can get one single query uh select something insert something and execute it three times in a row with different consistency levels for example example on java i make a prepared statement with session prepare insert into product blah blah blah blah blah values and for this prepared statement i set consistency level to be consistency level one also working with a command line i can say consistency to get current consistency level quorum in cassandra query language cell or i can set a consistency to all requiring consistency level to be all good now tell me a thing if i want my database to be fully consistent of course i do want and why shouldn't i always use consistency level on air on don't give them hints all right all right so try to guess what's wrong with the consistency level all and why shouldn't i use it all the time and while you are answering there is a good point about the eventually consistent database the fun fact but it's not cassandra eventually consistent every distributed system is eventually consistent even relational database with replication to follow your servers it will be eventually consistent because there is always a lack between master server and follower server okay yeah seeing a lot about about latency a lot about performance slow slow slow slow slow latency time delay good slow and yeah where is my so take a look uh there is a plenty of great answers and take a look latency or slow answer not always like that imagine we asked three servers and this server asks uh answers within two milliseconds and we server our answer within three milliseconds and this answer in these answers between also three milliseconds uh then what will be overall waiting time slowest plus network at duration so let's say five six milliseconds right uh there it will introduce a real delay only if one of the servers is significantly slower so we go for example three milliseconds uh four milliseconds ten milliseconds then it will be noticeable delay those two are answered already and this one was too lazy or maybe busy with compaction maybe busy with garbage collection or anything so as a result overall answer was much slower but the real problem is cp theorem is still here watching you always watching you always so a right answer if one is down everyone is down then you require consistency level all but one of the servers is not available uh you will get first you will have to wait for um uh timeout and then you will get an answer um can it reach desired consistency level you ask it for all which is free i've got answers only for two from tune we have no agreement answer is not available cp theorem is here when you set consistency level o you require your cassandra to be strongly consistent you forcefully move it from ap to cp and therefore you get your cpu you wanted your get it but by the price of availability and that's for you to decide and the great thing what you can configure it on pair query or pair kind of application set and for some data you better say sorry i cannot execute vibration we can increase consistency for your money money but for another kind of operations okay there is a still a profile picture no one cares anyway i'm kidding but not for real there are plenty of data you can totally survive it if it's uh not the lightning refresh so that's a consistency level that's a quorum uh that's replication factor and that's how they communicate now there is a question [Music] i do want my data to be consistent of course and i still want to have some of the high availability is that not possible at all is there some sneaky way to kinda get in the middle of the cap and answer is yes there is again that's a huge secret top secret don't share it i'm kidding please share it but we will teach you now there is a thing known as immediate consistency uh it's a simple mathematical uh idea if you write with the consistency level quorum or if you re-end if you read with the consistency level quorum you will be always consistent even if one of the servers are down and you can afford losing this server and still get the right data how it works take a look when we write on the replication factor 3 with consistency level quorum it means what we will wait for at least two acknowledgements right and when we read with consistency level quorum and replication factor two it means what we will wait uh for the query coordinator to get at least two answers compare them and if they are equal to despite this answer to us and if we always know what at least two of the servers got the right answer uh got the update and then we read there are two possible scenarios we asked for the data for those uh first two replicas to answer are those replicas what got the most up-to-date value then we get a most up-to-date consistent answer immediately right because they already have it and in some scenarios maybe this node what wasn't updated can answer as one of the first servers and then query coordinator for read will see hey your date is not matching something is wrong here when it will execute so call it repair repair on broken read repair the consistency update for inconsistent node with most up-to-date volume in background you don't wait for repair to complete and meanwhile you will get most up-to-date value then you've write with consistency level form and read with consistency level quorum you are always consistent and still can afford losing one server if you speak about replication factor 5 when you can afford losing up to 2 servers still being consistent and always getting consistent data that obviously raises disk space consumption but again a safe reputation is priceless aaron yes i thought you wanted to add something yup so oh no i'm good i'm good good uh so uh e you see uh shopkin uh ask you thank you for asking uh i cannot say it's the best way because we have to we have different scenarios for example in some scenarios i know a company would always write with consistency level o and then read with consistency level one reads are the fastest but rights will can fail in some scenarios for some specific deployments it may make sense overall secret is if your consistency level of write plus consistency level of read a higher than replication factor then you have immediate consistency when you write all read one it will be three plus one four four higher than three immediate consistency when you write with consistency level one and read with consistency level oh one plus three higher than three again you have immediate consistency is that the recommended weight no for sure but for some scenarios you see lower the consistency level lesser weight probability of slow downs so you need to understand this concept and balance it depending on your particular scenario that's the story i i was just going to say that's a that's a great point alex and that it really does depend you know um you know each each application is going to have its own requirements about you know what levels of consistency requires for read and write and you know that's um it's going to have its own tolerances too for uh you know for hey can it deal with data that's that's maybe a little bit stale um so yeah it really does come down to the business requirements so um you know it makes sense to understand those when uh when building your models out for sure right okay so uh last point i wanted to mention is what data is globally distributed so we discussed it already multi-data center deployments and that's quite an often use case for uh cassandra even if you don't have higher output and you don't have petabytes of data but still you want your data to be available in multiple regions simultaneously very quickly it's totally feasible and you can go with hybrid cloud or multi-cloud deployments that's also totally feasible cassandra's platform agnostic you can run it everywhere then last point before we go to the next hand on step is when to use in short every time we speak about scalability team and the chance for your application to have thousands uh like a very huge pressure for reads or rights there are plenty of databases for scale for reads but for right no guys no really not real evan streaming internet of things locks analytics any kind of data efficient time series that's totally cassandra case availability for mission critical applications with no data loss always available that's again very cassandra use case distributed means you want your data to be available in all the regions of the planet with low latency very cassandra scenario you want some of your data to be not available in some specific regions very cassando's scenario because for some cases you may specify replication factor 0 and then this case this data center will not get these pieces of data at all maybe your data of your german clients should stay only in the territory of germany then you just set for this piece of data replication factor zero for the united states data center and it won't go where compliance and there's plenty of scenarios you may want it and uh that's uh what we need to know now okay uh you're right i see shukha got his answer already very well so um iron what do you think about uh running the next step of the lab yeah i think that's a that's a great idea um why don't i get ahead to um to getting the uh getting the table getting the table creation step going yes yes totally i will leave you alone for a couple of minutes but at first i will switch your display on boom so your screen is live and uh see you in a moment you can go on all right well hey um we have a few tables that uh that we're going to create although before i start talking about you know the the tables specifically um we should mention you know a key space and really what a key space is we get this question a lot you know especially um in terms of uh you know like new folks using using astra you know when you first create an astra database it asks you to hey what what's the name of the key space you need because you always need one um really a key space is just a a logical collection of tables i mean and that's really all it is you know if you're looking for you know like an analog or something similar between the relational world um you know like like inside of uh you know like a relational database you can define a logical database and really all it is is it's just a way to um kind of logically group your tables together um you know one thing we we talked about too with with um you know cassandra and building applications on top of cassandra is that um you know you should really look at building um one key space for your application uh so that's that's you know just just important something to some understand you know your application might use several tables but it should kind of stick to uh stick to one key space so um the first thing we're going to do is let's get out oh and i've been signed out um so if you if you leave your your astra dashboard alone long enough what'll happen is it'll it'll automatically sign you out so um i'm going to go ahead and sign back in come on oh there we go okay it's going all right and um you know if i go ahead and click on my workshops database um and i scroll down here at the very bottom you can see that i have a chat sandra key space which is the one i put in at creation time now if i go over here to cql console you're going to see this start to come up there we go um and the first thing that we're going to do is just take a look at the key spaces that that we have available to us and the way to do that is to run a describe command and you can also shorten that to desk you know so if i say describe key spaces you know i get um you know all of the key spaces that are that are delivered as a part of a default cluster for uh data stacks aster db um the one we want is this chat sandra key space so i'm going to just say use chat okay now this is pretty cool it has tab completion so if i just hit tab oh i thought it had oh yeah there it goes there's just little delay that's it that's it um so it'll go ahead and tab complete as long as you've typed out enough to uh to be unique um so now you can see my prompt has changed so that i'm using the chat chat sandra um key space i mean if you go ahead and just um you know describe the key space singular um you'll see that well we don't have any tables in here right now but we have our our basic you know key space definition um and and you can see that right now i've just got a replication factor of three in my u.s east one data center so that's what we're that's what we start with so from there let's let's create a simple table here so if i go back to uh the readme here and i scroll down you can see the step 2c we're going to create the users table so it's got this little icon over here you can see it create if not exist i can copy that and then i can jump back over to my cql console and paste that in and it'll go ahead and create that table so now if i arrow back up through my command history here oh a little bit you'll see that i have a describe key space and if i hit enter there there we go it um will show my key space definition along with the user table that i i just created all right so now there are two other tables that i'm going to create one thing that we we talk a lot about and alex actually came out and mentioned this is that um data duplication is okay um in cassandra as with many distributed databases what you want to think about is building your tables to suit your queries now in this case in chat sandra users you can see that we have email defined as our loan primary key now this will work great you know as long as we're querying our users by email address and usually usually you do but in our chat application here we're going to also have not just users but posts to worry about and sometimes with chat posts you know you want to be able to query based on um like the id of a post or you you want to be able to query by a user or you want to be able to query by a room um so in this case we're going to do scroll down to step 2d you can see that we have two tables here posts by user and that's keyed by user id as a partition key and then post id is the clustering key now a clustering key is an interesting concept really all it is is just it kind of tells cassandra within a partition this is how i want this data sorted so it's pretty simple that way and then post by room also has a primary key that's made up of both a partition key and a clustering key so we have this uh this room id that we're partitioning on and we're also sorting it by post id inside of there so what i'm going to do again is go over to the corner here where i have that that copy icon and i'm going to create both my tables just by pasting them just like that there we go now if i do a desk key space you'll see that i have my user table post by user and posts by room um so very quickly i have i have three tables out here um let's see all right so alex i don't know oh alex is back hey all right all right i was gonna ask if you wanted me to go right into the crud operations in the interest of time or if you wanted to take back over for for a minute here uh yes uh i'm ready to take over and give me a moment i'm switching back to me before i proceed there's a great question uh from uh who was that um uh great question about what is a top stone in cassandra uh so i see someone who has some experience with cassandra already tom stone is a very interesting concept which is not familiar to other databases to many other databases to most of our databases but big thing in cassandra take a look let me explode your brain for good you will get it back in a moment uh but in the new very promising order in cassandra insert update and delete exactly the same operations that's right they're all right yeah usually uh then i say that somewhere at the conference i see people with um glass eyes just like uh missing from this reality what do you mean insert update and delete of the same operations okay i can understand insert and update because we well we know absurds um when update work is an insertive data doesn't exist or insert work as an update if date is present um that's familiar but how can delete is an insert and the answer is take a look cassandra it's very important working with cassandra to understand uh how it was designed to solve which kind of problems uh designed it's a customer facing database it means it has to work extremely fast while storing petabytes of data so very a lot it implies some limitations in short you cannot execute search and update operations on disk why why because this is slow these operations are slow even with ssd disks ram memory is much faster but don't forget we work with big data and big data doesn't fit into ram as a result we kind of need to do a create read update delete operations via data which has to return disk but still do it within milliseconds latency is not allowed how do we do that in short answer we do it in background uh cassandra uses a lot of background operations where um some quick uh duration for example as quick as possible executed in the beginning and then you get the answer for example right ahead log a commit clock your data is persistent before it really gets in the order at uh segments on disk it's a more advanced concept we don't explain today sorry cassandra cannot be explained in full in depth within two hours we will be out of two hours anyway anniversary okay but when you do and delete no data is actually deleted but a special record is inserted showing whatever data but now it's not present it was there we have killed it and this stomp stone stays uh as a part of the table as a record in the table as long as all the data will not be wiped out during a compaction which is the next advanced uh pink way again don't explain today it's any way more about that durations and today we speak that for developers but in short his special record it's called top stone because well it is a top stone there were some data no it's killed sorry it's not present anymore that's what the top stone is it's a special record what marks the data is deleted and the real data will be deleted significantly later good so let's go on we have not so much time left and still some very important concepts to discuss right so uh the data start for us uh from a row and that's something what must be familiar true uh to you row is a single structural data item in a table then with traditional databases you go to the tables and if you do so with cassandra no sql police will come to you and arrest you because never forget about partitions partitions are the groups of row having the same partition token or value of the partition uh column it's a base unit of access in cassandra never forget about the partitions partition is the base unit of accessing cassandra not a single rule in this case for example you can see what all of those employees belong to the same department of wizardry and in this case department is the partition key for the employees table then only then we go to the table and table is a group of columns and rows storing partitions then we create a table and sql what you have seen already we have to define few things first we have to define key space we will use key space is just a logical group of a table so don't take it too big then we have to give this name to this table when we define columns in this case all of the columns are typed text but we have more than one single type in cassandra then we have to define primary key which will consist of partition key and clustering column what does that all mean let me show you uh data is replicated speaking of key space before creating a table as you have seen we need a key space we can create a key space in this case i create key space users and creating key space we have to define we must define at least two things there are plenty of different options uh but the default values will be used but two two values you must specify replication strategy and replication factor per data center you want this data to be stored in this case we have two k2 replication strategies simple strategy and network topology strategy simple strategy is good for your laptop and bad for anything else a network topology strategy is called network topology strategy because it is network available networks your strategy quite obvious in short that's a placement strategy which tries to keep your replicas as far away from each other within data center as possible if we speak about a data center it will put replicas into a different server racks if we speak about a cloud it will put data of the same region into different availability zones for the obvious redundancy and high availability purposes in short simple network topology strategy for production and maybe staging simple strategy for uh whatever test or dev environment you have and then very simple you specify data center you specify replication factor for this data center data center replication factor there is a good question people usually fail to answer how many data centers i have in this cluster usually people say 2. that's wrong because i can have 20. i shouldn't specify all of them so in this case i have to i can have 20 data centers but still i can specify only two of them and have data only in two of them uh good then uh primary key what is the primary key why creating a table we have to specify a primary key primary key is a simple thing it's an identifier for a row it's always must have partition key which is a part of it and may have clustering columns those are optional a simple idea of a primary key it defines unique role you may want to access for example user stable with user rating as a primary key completely fine you will have as much um partitions as much users you have but it's completely fine and then a primary key city last name first name email again totally fine you will have as much partitions as much cds you have and still each row will be unique because of a last name first name and email then partition key partition key you must understand are already partition key is an identifier for a partition it always must present it you needs to have at least one column may have more and in this case we will have comments for a video you are watching now on youtube partition it by video id or again as discussed you may have as many partitions as users you have if you give the field which is completely unique and clustering columns have two duties first duty they are present in the primary key to ensure uniqueness of the data for example we have here uh primary key city last name first name what's wrong with this game it's not going to be unique there are more than 20 john smiths in new york and when we have to add email as a clustering column so this part primary key will be unique otherwise as cassandra using absurds every next as john smith will be a very bad surprise to the previous one we want to avoid that then a second example clustering columns are also reported responsible for the data sorting order as a result if we do a review store comments for a video uh partitioned by video id based on the comment id will it be unique yes it will because comment id is unique it's fine from uniqlo's point of view but they will be not sorted and usually we show comments latest first so we want to press sort them based on the clustering column which basically makes this presorting uh now those are the most important slides of a presentation they even have a slight of a year award i developed those slides so and i gave them this award i do believe they deserve it they and your understanding of those concepts basically will define if you will succeed um if you will have success with cassandra or you will fail first rule of a good partitioning stir together what you retrieve together it is an important thing uh example for these uh commentaries for a video for example you open a video on youtube you want to see all the comments big mistake if you ask me don't read comments on youtube uh not for our videos our attendees are great but in general not really worth your time but uh still we want while uh showing a video to a customer to a guest to a friend uh we want to show uh comments within single one select statement not asking dozens of servers for pieces of different comments right right all the rows with the same partition key will be stored together they will be neighbors to each other and therefore way will they can be easily retrieved together so first rule store together what you retrieve together then next thing avoid big partition don't you forget why we use partitions at all we have partitions to be able to handle data of any size and still dispatch it 15 milliseconds then if you don't pay enough attention to this rule you make too big partitions you again run into the trouble you was avoiding with cassandra's partitioning so it's very important for us to avoid big partitions but how big is big there is only one hard limit up to two billion cells per partition cell basically is interception of a column and a row so multiply amount of columns by the amount of rows and you will get amount of hard limit is 2 billion cells per partition but there are recommendations and recommendations are much stricter we recommend to have not more than 100 000 rows in a partition and we recommend to have not more than 100 megabytes in a partition uh those recommendations are built by data stocks fuel team those are really best of the best experts in cassandra world and there are many of companies who paid a big price for this knowledge you get for free right now uh and there are some companies would pay at much higher price if they didn't pay attention to our recommendations uh of the biggest partition we have ever seen was something like one and a half terabytes and believe me that's them wrong that's a very very very very bad idea you can forget about scaling you can forget about performance you have to pay attention to a partition size now i would bet you you wouldn't be able to read that wow a terrible partition is just that i can't even wrap my head around that yeah you know what uh as aerodynamic you have to learn aerodynamics if you cannot build uh powerful enough engines um that's a joke like and uh you have to learn uh partitioning and data modeling if you cannot buy expensive enough servers uh so but in general i do recommend you to understand partitioning rules simple and very yeah we did the biggest part of them together now there is a very important thing avoid big and constantly growing partitions uh not all the partitions um size can be predefined imagine i'm trying to store data of my network of sensors internet of things infrastructure with many millions of sensors reporting first state every few seconds if i would build the data model for this table uh being partitioned just by a sensor id with the data coming into database sensor id time stamp and volume so i don't know temperature 50 degrees at uh 5 p.m uh and sensor ids i don't know one two three will this data model work well it will in the beginning but as those sensors report their state every few seconds after a few months partitions will be too big i can't i can handle that in a couple of ways but that traditional way if you don't want to delete data uh regularly or if you don't want to use time to leave cassandra supports time to leave on per record and even per value basis then you can go with bucketing bucketing is a great approach there instead of these failed sensor id as a partition key i make a compound partition key consisting of sensor ready as before but also month year for example now it's january february march of 2022 that means what month year will be zero free 2022 it can be an integer it can be in string it doesn't matter and then as month changes march is over last record goes to this uh partition then month changes sensor id is the same year is the same month has changed what does that mean for us will the cache value the token will be the same no partitioner will create a new token therefore new partition will be created we will not touch previous partition we will write to a new partition and as a result a new partition for a new month will be created we can easily calculate so if each sensor reports its state every 10 seconds and we have bucketing based on the month we can easily calculate how many records we will have per sensor per month per year and basically that's the idea of bucketing and that's a very important uh idea um so too many partitions is not a problem you can have as much partitions as you want as i don't remember the exact name but there is something like amount of atoms in the universe something like that so you can have as many partitions as you want that's fine yeah it's like it's like two to this posit two to the positive sixty-third to the negative sixty-third i think yeah and i'm trying to remember what that number is but it's it's huge that's huge it's huge uh and uuid is unique per sensor per device in this example so we will have as many ids as many sensors we have and each sensor id will be unique yes okay so and finally avoid chord partitions price is not the only consideration if you have one partition being written or being read all the time and all the others are idling not really use it then it's quite bad for scaling for example you have one partition overloaded with operations all the time all the hours are not busy you see what cluster performance is low and you are like okay i have money i will put some more servers into that will it help erin what do you think no it won't right if all of your partitions are busy overloaded and you have a lot of them you add more servers token ranges will be recalculated and as a result you will have less partition per server less pressure on server and you are good again but if the pressure over your partition is uneven and one single partition is overloaded while others are hiding you can add thousands of servers yet still you will have only three servers with normal replication factor free responsible for this particular partition very for scaling won't work that's what i told you before cassandra skills linearly but you have to do your part of the work it's a sharing responsibility yep very much last few words on the data modeling uh just like in a few minutes uh what did we have left from the lab i maybe will ask guys to complete the lab without you what do you think um yeah we're we're kind of pushing on time here yeah i mean really if um as long as folks could uh could step through you know step three in the readme it's pretty simple it goes through you know the inserts that you do and then querying and uh you know there's some good notes in there too about um you know making sure that you're you're querying always using a where clause um and why that's important um so yeah i think that's a good idea alex that we could have everyone kind of kind of go through there they're on their own okay uh by the way give this guy a medal uh shubha asks grace rahul asks great questions so i again have to answer one of them take a look uh uuid is not an auto generated number but user can give while inserting exactly right in short people with uh experience of relational databases use it to use sequential ids generated by the database and you know what sequential ids are great as long as you can afford them what is the sequential id you store your data and you ask your database to give you an id for this data you store data you get an id in the future you can load this data back to your application server using this id you know sequential ids generated by a database very traditional in sql world sounds good doesn't work why because cassandra is distributed decentralized database to get a sequential id we will have to make an agreement between all of the servers in the cluster what's going to be next id and it may be sounds feasible when you have one two three five servers but when you have 200 servers that already doesn't sound like a good idea that's why with cassandra you treat id values differently you generate them on the application side using special uuid function which will generate a long long long long id string of digits and characters which is granted to be universally unique uuid means universally unique identifier the probability of the collision is like um it will not happen uh so uh working with cassandra you generate unique ids on the application side and you insert data with these uids into the database it's actually much more convenient than waiting for your database to dispatch a sequential id to you because you can start working with data for example in microservices system even before data being persisted to the database and some scenarios it may be quite a lot of uh bedroom uid is a data type in cassandra then well yes it is it is a data type in cassandra but not only data type it's also a generic concept available for multiple programming languages and so on and so forth and youtube okay excellent collection i was connection i was scared at the moment we lost the connection no but we are good okay who okay so that's a close one uh important things to us to understand is cassandra is a nosql database it means instead of normalization we prefer denormalization what all of that means normalization means i hope most of you know what's that is what you are trying to remove redundancy in your data to keep your data integrity uh following the uniqueness like every piece of data should be stored only once database normalization is a process of structuring relational database in accordance with the so-called normal forms in order to reduce 3d redundancy and improved data integrity it was proposed by edgar court very many dozens of years ago now take a look in the universities on the courses they teach us what the normalization is the right way to do things and generalization is evil is a demon you have to avoid you know what life is not a star wars movie there is not like a light side of the force dark side of the force generalization is actually great as long as you control it not when it controls you right so uh as a good developer as a good engineer you need to learn both normalization and denormalization and know when to use them and then not to use them what's wrong with the normalization with normalization we have simple rights and it helps us to have data integrity in relational databases with foreign keys indexes checks on delete cascade and all the other fancy sql things that is great but normalization comes with a price and in many scenarios you do not want to pay this price normalization is not free everything has a price what are the price of a normalization you had a fast write you will have slow read and queries thanks to joins sometimes very hard to maintain uh biggest uh sql statement i've ever seen consisted of 61 join and you know why it didn't have 62 uh because it was my sequel and my sequel doesn't allow you to have more than 61 join in a single select statement in short time is the price yeah by the way hello glad to see you uh time is the price you have fast rights because you have to write to one single place but you will have slow reads because every next join will be slower and slower and sql databases cannot be fast over huge distributed data besides the fact it's a nightmare to maintain multiple joints queries then what is a denormalization generalization is a strategy use it on a database to increase performance in a computing uh denormalization is the process of trying to improve the read performance of the database at the expense of potentially potentially losing some right performance by adding redundant copies of the data basically in generalization data is being cross table duplicated to simplify reads you still have table employees and departments but now you have department name right into the employee table heresy heresy the normalization no denormalization is your friend if you know how to use it what are the benefits of a denormalization and data duplication quick reads now you don't have to execute a multiple joints also simple queries it's very easy to work with the queries what as simple as that select from where something boom done no joins very easy to maintain then again everything comes with a price what's the price of a denomination now you have to do multiple rights at once if you change department name you will need to rename the department in the department's table but also rename the department in all the employees of this department for the employees table that means at least two rights maybe more in some scenarios also manual integrity uh no foreign keys no foreign case check no on delete cascade but it's fine because it's a non-relational nosql database so we don't have foreign keys and joints anyway now take a look at the trick yeah casey you are right the normalization will consume more uh disk space totally but uh that is a normal price to pay as i said before uh disk space is cheap reputation is priceless and behaving your application works fast it's also quite cool yes you pay for this space so what um now last streak what really a lot of people do not understand from the performance point of view in most of the scenarios you can execute joints in the normalization strategy only one by one by one if you have a chance of joining tables you cannot do first part and then second part and third part simultaneously you cannot run them in parallel why because the next join will be will depend on the previous one on the data on runtime therefore they cannot be executed in parallel and as a result you have to wait for the first join to be completed for the second zone to be completed then you have a lot of data it's going to be slow then you have a lot of distributed data over thousands of servers that's going to be slow as hell and you don't want to have it but think about the generalization multiple rights can i execute them in parallel yes i can cassandra scales perfectly for rights too not only for reads so as the result in a distributed system like cassandra the normalization is the best approach because i can do multiple writes in parallel but i cannot do complex read in parallel as a result the normalization is a much better strategy good so we are getting to the last slide uh how do we design data model for apache cassandra guys ladies take a look we have a two hours workshop dedicated only to data modeling and it's well deserved your time so if you are going to work with cassandra i beg you to spend your time at least at this workshop two hours of pure data modeling with cassandra it's free available at this channel just fine cassandra data modeling data stacks developers it's amazing one and but if you not just want to work with cassandra but if you uh want to be an architect if you want to really understand how it works we have a free data modeling course at the academy it's not going to be two hours it's longer but it's worth every minute you invest in that now for you to get simple understanding i will uh have you this data modeling in three minutes but obviously after that you will not be ready to pass the exam for sure because it's more advanced but let's focus on and let's move so non-sql data modeling works in opposite way not like in traditional relational data modeling we start of thinking of our customers customer first we think of a user behavior if you have heard of user stories of what exactly they are doing and how they are using our applications analyzing customer behavior we identify workflows sequences of actions people are doing to reach their goal and then we define queries table not exist create table was never executed but we already know which query we will do to fulfill these demands to to fulfill these workflow demands we already know queries and then knowing queries we design tables for those queries to answer those questions using the normalization and then using the normalization we load data in multiple tables for example using batch we putting this data to multiple tables so it goes quite opposite not in the way like you do it for relational data modeling but it's a very cool thing for me it's actually invent much easier than relational data modeling process of data modeling methodology is very simple at first step we have to decide uh on the conceptual data model and application workflow right application workflow are the actions we have to do and conceptual data model is usually described in an entity relationship diagram i will show in a second mapping those together we create queries and we define logical data model applying physical optimizations we get in the end physical data model for example we are on youtube and there are videos users and video can be commented by user and user can write a comment to a video that is what you see now is a conceptual data model described in entity relationship diagram the type user with some properties id email blah blah blah we have video with some properties id email blah blah blah title video is being commented by uh user comments on and each comment has time stamps and text let's call it entity relationship relationship diagram then we have application workflow and use case is simple or user opens a profile we want to show all the comments related to this user using its identifier we know user id because user opens a profile it means what users log it in and we already know the id right then someone user opens a video page in this case we have to find comments related to a target video using its identifier most present first so notice in first case we know id of a user in second use case we know id of a video that makes big difference uh you will see in a moment mapping that together we have to build the query and query in a human language will sound like find comments posted by a user with a known id and second query will be find comments for a video give a known id most recent first now tell me a thing for those two queries can we use the same table can we use a single table for those two queries or maybe something is different yeah the chat's pretty quiet yeah yeah yeah we make them think and it's quite late actually in india guys uh thank you for staying for us till the end we are starting the game in few mile minutes uh and you want to take your chance to win our prizes but right now if you want me to start the game you have to answer a question will one table here be enough or we will need different tables okay uh maniganda prakash thinks we will need different tables yeah anil kumar agrees very well so in short while uh don't forget partition key defines data partitioning and we could have a single table here but that means what for a branch of queries uh if we don't have a partition key we cannot specify it we will do a full cluster scan if you don't specify a partition key in your query it's like order a pizza without specifying your full home address and then delivery boy or delivery girl will have to bring you uh bringing the pizza knock every door on your street like maybe you order a pizza or maybe you ordered pizza and that yet is as dumb as it sounds if i i don't know about you but when i order something i specify a full address that totally makes sense right so partition key is the full address of your data if you don't specify it you force cassandra to go and knock every door on the street and yes it is dump it's called full cluster scanner and in one case we know only user id and second case we know only video id therefore we will need two different tables for these scenarios that is the normalization in action so one table will work if we apply a dark magic like uh allo filtering but that is a totally bad idea different tables is the right way correct and then what you see is called chabatko diagram we are very proud to have our chumchibatko phd uh as our colleague and by the way with a huge relief uh we have to uh announce uh he was caught um he was uh in ukraine when the war started and recently he was uh he and his family uh they were evacuated from the ukraine so he avoid the danger and that is a great news we are totally happy for him to uh be saved and be safe now so what you see right now yeah what you see right now is chibatko diagram something what he developed as the part of his data modeling methodology for cassandra and uh what you see here right now is comments by user is a table user id is a partition key creation day is a clustering column descending sorting order comment id is a clustering column ascending sorted order comments by video are basically the same but we have video id instead of user id so and then we go to physical data model in physical data model we pick already some real data types and apply some optimizations for example you've seen here comments by user have creation date and commentating but here we have only comment id uh what's happened with a creation date we do need this information right answer is short for the comment id we use time uuid thing and time uuid is a universally unique identifier which embeds timestamp but you can sort it by time so it's universally unique value but you can sort the sending or ascending uh by timestamp and that's actually a pretty cool thing we have less data volume and still have our data sorted and unique very nice same for comment id for comments by video and finally we have this uh thing converted into the cql schema data and we see create table if not exist comments by user user id uid comment id time to uid video id are you id comment text primary key partition key is user id comment ids clustering column clustering order by comment id descending because we need this data in a descending order yes a timestamp plus uuid is time uid correct uh and basically the same for comments by video just video id instead of user id and uh for the ending of the hands-on lab we will ask you to do it on your own to get the page you have to complete it and don't forget in the end to make the screenshot but first we go to the game now some prizes oh i think we can skip that one yes uh uh chris where is a good question but let us first play the game and then i will answer your question okay now uh ladies and gentlemen please go to nancy.com and use my code 29972517 i hope you are there already and answer our questions answer quick and give the right answers those who will get the most points quick answer deserves more points we'll get the chances to get our prizes and if you participated already in our quiz and if you have won something please let by others yet check their luck so we are starting in a moment it's a quiz time on intro to cassandra and actually you know what let us have some music for that oh that's a great idea music plays and we can start i give you a few moments to join and set the thumbs up uh on main team and we start in few seconds uh maintain id is right on top of the screen two nine nine seven two five one seven and you can get it actually by a exclamation mark minty command around it right in the chat oh thank you aaron i was slower no problem oh but wait it's wrong uh uh nightbot is misconfigured yeah that is wrong isn't it whoa okay do not use nightbot the quote is 2997 oh yeah thank you eric two five one seven yeah thank you eric that's right and nightbot is wrong good so i see 25 people are joining us already or maybe even more and that's going to be the first question there will be many questions eight questions some of them will be easy and some of them will be not so easy now focus on get ready this third answer fast to get more points how many master notes does cassandra cluster need at least three per cluster prepared data center enough to maintain consistency not a single one cassandra is decentralized music plays time sticking and you have to think fast we gave you all the information required and the time is up who was the fastest one oh my god i cannot believe aaron aaron we will be fired after we show really really take a look at that 17 people gave the wrong answer 17 no no no no unbelievable so 19 people made it right not a single one cassandra cluster has no master notes cassandra is a peer-to-peer architecture masterless there are no such an idea of a master server because every server is uh the same from the responsibilities so at least reaper cluster or flipper dc that's wrong enough to maintain consistency that's wrong right answer not a single one now let me see the leaderboard 19 people give the right answer but who was there that's good yeah okay ximen aj and alex are fast that is good but we have more questions that's going to be question number two so transfer fast to get more points how data is being distributed all data is replicated to each server by partitions range of partitions per node with address locators or using postmail maybe yeah this is a tough one yeah okay no looks like it's not so tough at least not for our amazing attendees data is distributed by partitions range of partitions per node definitely not all data is replicated to each server apple handles hundreds petabytes it makes no sense to copy that size or to each server no way there is no such server in the world delete it ah okay so leaders made no mistakes but ravi kumar was this time faster than alex and bge gets to a second place ages on the third if he man is holding the first position but well well difference is not so big so what will change after the next questions question number three still anybody's game yeah question number three so transfer fast to get more points which replication factor is recommended 1.5 3 15 42 maybe what's the story here what's the replication fact was recommended time is up and the right answer oh well man it was too easy right reputation factor three is recommended in some scenarios you may want to have five and for some specific purposes you may stick to one although it's not a traditional workload let's say and it's definitely not recommended and replication factor 1 1.5 is it's like a half bit you cannot help half server so it's technically not possible okay so most of you made it but who was the fastest one misrend apoenta was the fastest getting to the sixth place he-man and bge are holding first and second and ravi kumar is on the 30th ag just 14 points behind ravi kumar that's close and i see shukra is actually shared with fourth place with apollina so that's like zero points difference yeah that's close now that i've ever seen a tie before that's pretty cool yeah good okay okay okay okay okay we are in the middle it's question number four and i think you are getting nervous already right everyone wants to win answer fast to get more points what is astrodb astrodb is a gateway to a stars it's a local in-memory version of cassandra it's cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a development tool most of you have answered it already and the time is over so it was easy astrodb is a cassandra as a service in the cloud it's not local it's a cloud and not in memory it's persistent then it's a development tool well you definitely can use astrodb as a development tool um yeah that's fair but but still the answer which is closer to a truck astra is a cassandra as a service in the cloud with no headache it's maintained and managed and handed by data starts and okay that's most of the answers were very close i see no difference in the finding the leaderboard at this stage just he-man gets a little bit faster with 202 points difference from bge will he make a mistake we still have some questions so let's see yeah no ties anymore nah question number five answer fast to get more points what is a primary key same as partition key it's the main house key does not apply to no sql databases uniquely identifies a row it's a column in the partition key maybe so time is up and most of you made it right primary key can be the same as a partition key but it's by default not the same they may match if you have no clustering codes but the most close to the trap statement is primary key uniquely identifies a row so who made a mistake hey bg oh man i think he will not recover because the competition is tight bg i'm sorry ag gets to the second place because of that and alex returns we took his third place but you know what our prizes made so diva makes no difference uh first second and third place getting the same price just maybe he man has higher chances to brag about his win if he will win of course and hi teja very nice unicorn as your avatar and shiva i'm happy you like our show bg keep fighting you still have free questions maybe some of the leaders will make a mistake so answer fast to get more points what is the partition key oh there's a good one a consecutive number applied to each new record the designated fields in your table to partition your data an optional table field for optional secondary partitioning the key to partitioning this reality from the next i don't know that last one sounds pretty good good to me but the right answer is it's a designated field in your table to partition your data we do not use sequential consecutive ids in cassandra it will require too much time for the database instances to agree on what's going to be the next number well well well well well well you man it was the fastest time yeah he-man was the fastest time this one no changes on the top three but five times in the middle part of the leaderboard we've asked is just like 110 points behind alex so alex has to be very very careful there is someone just breathing to his back right now shubha did really good that time got down pretty quickly yes that's totally that's question number seven and i hope you already know what to do so answer fast to get more points executing select query without a partition key is the recommended way to retrieve data the right way if the data was inserted without a partition key a way to full cluster scan illegal and punishable by low well i think it should be that one should be it should be it should be so the right answer is it's a way to full cluster scan and it's a bad bad bad bad bad thing you don't want to have in your cluster so you have to avoid doing preparations without a partition key at all costs and by default cassandra will not execute them at all and but by my heart i would answer answer number four illegal and punishable by law by no secret yeah as no sequel police officers we stand on the side what it's illegal and punishable by law right so final leaderboard before the last question who was fast and who was slow who is going to get out of the list okay so opponent fights and ravi kumar is a little bit lower when he used to be super on the ninth place and the top three with he-man aeg and alex and very very close to paul and skeets just few moments before the end of the game and we start the last question question number hey this is it now don't make a mistake it may cost you too much on the leaderboard but nothing in real life so don't worry too much about that too don't feel bad if you fail to answer right and we start answer fast to get more points in the data modeling methodology we start modeling the conceptual data model and application workflow physical data model logical data model copy paste from stack overflow well stack overflow is a great resource it helps us a lot basically that's right oh but i wouldn't start uh data modeling from stack overflow around from data stacks or kdb maybe but not from staffordshire right answer is conceptual data model and application workflow are the first steps in the data modeling framework or data modeling methodology so i cannot wait i worry for you all alex both alex and a.g makes a mistake oh my god okay looks like someone was too nervous and failed to answer right now he man paul and ravi kumar we congratulate you the top three positions on our please you did great job you deserve it your uh prizes very well uh aaron could you please paste the email of bagarian yeah that's uh yeah yeah let me let me find gary's email it should just be gary.datastage.com yep um i'm pretty sure so we congratulate winners please make a screenshot of your screen showing your uh place showing your position make a screenshot and send it to gary.harvey at datastax.com aaron will paste his email in the chat in a moment if you are on the leaderboard but not in the top 3 we still congratulate you so much because you know what our prizes well it's a cool swag but not apartments not yachts and so on not ferraris i'm sorry so don't be too sad about that you attended a great workshop and at least i hope so and you made it to be on top 10 out of many dozens of people it is a great result and now finally if you are not on the leaderboard still you learn it a lot and come again for our next workshop so that will help you a lot uh subha for the data modeling workshop please watch the recording of a previous one or better attend a data modeling course um at the academy.datas.com it's free which is a part actually of a developer cassandra developer path so if you are heading to get the certificate you will pass this course anyway and yeah thank you teja sharing knowledge is the greatest gift i really enjoy those workshops good now we will ask you a question what do you think about this workshop what did you like the most what was the maybe not so great i will keep this window open so you can feel your feedback even after the workshop and meanwhile last few slides oh yeah this okay uh not jack fryer but gary we already sent that for the homework complete the lap as explained in workshop intro to cassandra make a screenshot complete those two scenarios very simple like 10 minutes each it will not take much time you can do it later and then submit your homework and expect your page reform notice what page is a page it's cool but what really matters is your nosql certificate which you get only when you are passing the exam for more learning if you're learning for more data uh more things to learn we recommend visiting slashdev datastax.com great place and more data and uh data modeling and cassandra fundamentals there and courses available for free at data stocks academy at academy.data starts the phone for your voucher and certification i already told you get your voucher and become a certified nosql developer for free how do you get your voucher complete developer path or administrator path on the academy you will need to do it anyway to get ready for the exam uh idea is very simple there are two paths developer administrator and kids android we don't touch today and get your voucher after passing a course and actually i'm not sure we are sharing it via link today this one discussed it already if you like this workshop don't forget to push like and subscribe button and for more workshops by data stocks come to our website at datastax.com workshops and thank you so much for coming it was great time together uh yep thanks everyone it was great to see everyone here there is a question by chris i wanted to answer but i'm not sure i get this question after all chris blender asks if a video is global but users are localized the partition key cannot be regional uh so what would your partition be to keep data together um aaron do you have an idea i'm not sure i got the situation i i you know i i read through that one like three or four times and that and that does seem yeah a little a little confusing to be honest yeah yeah i don't know um you know maybe if um you know you can reach out in the discord um and maybe clarify that a little bit we'll be able to help you out afterward i think that's probably the best approach here yep yeah so we will be happy to discuss that voucher will be sent automatically once we complete the course uh almost at this moment uh to get the voucher you complete the course uh developer path for administrator path uh and you send an email at academy.data it's explained on the academy you just send an email i completed for course here is my email and uh this way shivan at this moment after this workshop you are not directly go and take certification for free because you are not ready you will fail the exam to get ready for the exam uh you have to go to the academy.datastarts.com and pass the training not to two hours training it's longer and then it's done you write an email to the academy at datastax.com and then you get your voucher uh that's the scenario and i see no more questions so if you have any more questions uh we will be happy to meet you and talk to you at the datastax discord server thank you so much for coming you are great you are the best especially those who already almost 1am or around that uh you are the best and thank you so much for being with us see you on our next workshops if you live in europe and you are going to attend kubecon in valencia in may when see you there i will be speaking there and i will be happy to meet you and talk to you in life and maybe share some beers it would be amazing but i know most of you are not from uh europe so yeah i doubt it will happen okay so all the best and see you again later good luck hey thanks everyone bye a little bit of music for you to enjoy and relax after a workshop [Music] i have more room no more formats to change [Music] is [Music] [Music] uh [Music] oh",
