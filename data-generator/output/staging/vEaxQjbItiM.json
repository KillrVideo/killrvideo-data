    "text": "[Music] hi i'm arthem chabatko and this is using gremlin with dec graph frames gremlin is a preferred language when it comes to defining traversals in data stacks enterprise graph this is also true for dsa graph frames here we describe a general strategy of using gremlin api with dsc graph frames the following code is executable for example in spark shell first we create a dsc graph frame for a particular graph that exists in dac graph we call metadsc graph for killer video on the spark session object second we begin our traversal with methods v or e just like a regular gremlin traversal next we use gremlin steps such as in out both has and so forth finally we use a method that can trigger computation in spark such as data frames show in this example this is a list of gremlin steps supported by dsc graph frames i assume that you have the required prerequisites and already familiar with kremlin so i will not go through individual steps as you may recognize types of traversals that we can define with these steps include simple projecting statistical and ordering of course there are a number of other kremlin steps that may not be supported yet you should check the documentation for the most current list if a certain gremlin step is required for your traversal and is not currently supported by dsc graph frames there are always other spark api such as spar graph frames and data frames that can complement your traversal all gram and predicates are supported by dac graph frames to use a predicate you have to qualify it with p there are also four tokens that can be used to refer to a label id map key and map value for example if you need to group count by label and order by key you will need to use those they are qualified with t let's look at some examples these two traversals compute simple statistical information about our kilo video graph we count how many vertices we have in the graph as well as find vertex distribution by vertex label because we use the ac graph frame api all computation is done by spark in this example we are dropping all nose edges in the graph and output edge distribution by label as you can see there are composer director belongs to actor cinematographer rated and screenwriter edges there are no longer any nose edges drop can also be used to draw vertices and properties and this is one way to do bulk dropping with gremlin api of dse graph frames there is another way that uses dec graph frame api directly and it also supports bulk insertions and updates we will talk about bulk operations in more detail in a separate presentation this is a simple traversal that finds robert denier's movies from 1970s we start with the verdicts with labeled person and named robert de niro traverse all incoming actor ages and get to the movie vertices we then verify that the year property is greater than or equal to 1970 and less than 1980. we get to the title and year values of such movies and output them using data frames methods show the result contains three fine movies our next example of a gremlin traversal combines steps of both simple traversals and statistical traversals we find the person verdicts for their denier hop to his movies and get to rated edges so that we can retrieve movie radiance we then compute the rating distribution for all of robert de niro's movies notice that the results are not ordered it would be nice to improve this traversal to output the result in the ascending ratings order even so gremlin traversal step order is supported by the ac graph frames the local scope to order a map is not for now we will have to use another api for ordering in many cases the api that readily complements kremlin when using dac graph frames is data frame api we have already seen data frames show method that triggers execution and displays the results as a table other methods can be used to implement operations that are not available in gremlin api and even combine graph and non-graph data in a single query as you will experience soon gremlin and data frames is a very powerful combination so here we find rating distributions for robert de niro's movies and order the results by rating as before we find the person vertex for robert de niro traverse incoming actor ages to his movies and get to rating edges so that we can retrieve movie ratings we then compute the rating distribution for all the opportunities movies finally we order the resulting data frame by its rating column and output the result notice that the f matter that is used to convert a dsc graph traversal object to a data frame object we can omit it in scalar and spark shell as the conversion happens implicitly however it can also be convenient to keep for better readability and easier distinction between gremlin and data frame apis now let's go a bit further let's save the result of our analysis of robert deniro's movie ratings into a cassandra table we should assume that we already have cassandra key space killer underscore video and empty table linear ratings with columns rating and count the traversal itself should look familiar there is a gremlin part where we compute the grammar distribution and the data frame part which use the spark assigner connectors to save the results to cassandra if the saving to cassandra code looks new to you consider taking our course on data stakes enterprise analytics with apache spark on data stacks academy to learn more lastly we use spark sql to retrieve data back from cassandra table to see that we indeed achieved our goal and it worked and finally our most complex example where we find and compare rating distributions for al pacino and robert de niro by retrieving and combining data from both graph and cassandra that should be interesting we get al pacino rating distribution from the graph and robert de niro's rating distribution from the table in cassandra we populated in the previous example we then take the two resulting data frames or tables and perform a full outer join on the radian column the full outer join is required to preserve any rows from both tables that cannot satisfy the join condition we order the resulting table by rating and show the result you should be able to recognize that this traversal uses gremlin dse graph frames data frames spark cassandra connector and spark sql now that's what i call powerful and it is time for you to embrace the power of dsa graph frames gremlin site",
