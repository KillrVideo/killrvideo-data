say to welcome you to this workshop by datastax with a special guest so first things first um please tell me if you are hearing us loud and clear can you give me a thumbs up if you can hear us let's see sound check i hope it's good how is the sound nobody's answering okay okay i can hear myself okay we can oh great hi neverend hi rodrigo hi raul nice to see you again alessio jean-pierre everybody so rox can you test your sound please perfect uh good morning good afternoon or good evening i like to say that can everybody hear me that is rags yeah and today we have a special guest so daniel from red dot hello daniel welcome thank you for joining how are you yeah welcome everybody okay perfect okay so shall we go ahead and introduce ourselves my name is raghavan srinivas i go by rags uh basically um you know i'm i'm really about simplifying distributed systems development uh i feel like you know kubernetes has done a lot in terms of uh providing the infrastructure but it's still not easy to simplify the developer inner loop it's not easy to do the inner loop which is a lightweight ci cd and that's kind of what we're going to be focusing in today's workshop uh and you know we put in a lot of effort to you know make this happen and obviously um you know work closely with daniel from red hat and you know uh so hopefully you will you will see the power of the platform um during the workshop stephanie so well i'm stefano i'm developer advocate at data stocks and uh yeah today we will guide you through this very cool topic which is carpus i have to say this is not my expertise so i will mostly leave to the experts here and yeah so i think we had a small technical trouble getting uh daniel on screen so you will enjoy a still of him but nevertheless he's going to present himself now so please go ahead yeah thank you so much stefano yeah my name is danielle i'm working for redhead as technical marketing major and develop advocate specialized cloud name runtime quartus and spring with node.js and vertex and i'm spending a lot of time to integrate a platform with the cloud name runtime pacificary subarus and service mesh and i'm also cncf ambassador and devops institute ambassador to evangelize a lot of cloud network architecture and cloud that will best practice how to build your hybrid cloud here's my contact information feel free to reach out to me if you have any question around cloud native stuff and just in terms of clarification for those of you from the java world who may be somewhat new to cloud native the cncf is the cloud native compute foundation um you know which does some excellent work on the cloud native side uh and obviously like what daniel said he's one of the ambassadors for cncf and there are a lot more around the world as well so with that said um should we start the mentee and and get an idea of the audience we're talking to because that's the most important thing yes you know know the audience yes please all right so let me try this this is the first time i'm doing this but but i'll yes so uh we are about to ask you a few questions and to do that just so questions just to get to know better what kind of audience we have and to do that we are asking you to join uh mendy.com so this should be i'm okay i'm gonna paste a link uh and instructions on the on the youtube chat here we we ask you to kindly join mendy.com and enter the code that you see here so yes right you should be able to press i to make this easier to read but anyway you are presenting right so that should be good very good so please go to mentee.com enter the code here 63035160 and while we wait for you to join and to give you give us some informations about you um i'll tell you one thing by the end of this workshop this same mentee.com will be used to ask you some questions on the topic that you are about to see and if you will answer fast and correct you will get a chance to win some swag kindly provided by red hat some corkus themed swag so please keep mendy open after these initial questions and you will get a chance to win some nice prizes yeah and stefano it feels like you're under emphasizing the part because the swag is really cool you know it's yes exactly and and i'm not good at either so so let's get started i think we have okay enough number of people so sorry if you press i again you're you're back to the the blue screen of mentee and you should be able to see how many are joining i i see a 30 something a bit more 34 okay so yeah i think we can start anyway you will have time to to join by for for the competition at the end of today so let's go ahead and i think you just pressed yeah yeah we have quite a few quite a few who have not joined yet so let's let's wait for a magic number let's say 36 37 what do you think okay we're already 36. okay we should keep going right what do you think yeah we're at 37. okay it feels like i'm doing an auction all right so let's go ahead with the next one okay so yeah now we're asking you where are you coming from where are you tuning in from just to have an idea i see north america south america somebody in the middle of the ocean i guess europe india russia canada is that canada saudi arabia portugal or spain uk very good so yeah we have an audience from all over the world i see china probably that's too small to distinguish but yeah great okay cool i think i think india is beating the world in the workshop right but but i know that most indians would like uh india to win the world cup uh the t20 uh so hopefully they'll win it uh but but in the meantime you know at least to enjoy the workshop for the next like uh um you know an hour and 15 minutes yeah i feel like i should i should keep going yeah okay let's go ahead because there are a few other questions yeah yeah what's your experience great so are you new to cassandra do you know what cassandra is i do you have some experience or you really are a master of cassandra so exactly nice we got to watch out for those two people right or three people now who are no sql gurus yeah nice to see there are some gurus there is always something more to learn especially today is about a very specific topic how to use quarkus with cassandra which is cool some experienced people i think this is this is on par with what we expected right you know we expected a lot of beginners and and welcome to all the beginners and welcome to those who uh you know are experienced as well and the gurus as well all right moving on to the next question so do you have do you already have a certification an apache cassandra certification developer or administrator someone does many don't which is makes sense he's in line with what we saw earlier and yeah that's that's pretty much what i expected let me let me bring up the uh meticon you know just in case anybody is interested um okay and join later so yeah please join and and stay join uh stay keep the connection to mendy because later there will be the quiz now uh let me anticipate one a very quick thing about this question we are asking you if if you are certified because getting the certification getting the apache center certification involves taking an exam this exam has a cost but today by the end of this workshop we will be able to give you for free vouchers in order that make you uh eligible to take the exam for free so stay tuned and you will get a chance to get the certification obviously you still have to study because that's life but you will be able to get the to take the exam for free and to get a certified apache cassandra developer or administrator which will be a great boost to your career so stay tuned okay so more more on that by the end of the day but still in the meantime how many of you how many of our workshops have you attended so for some of you it is the first workshop as a few of you okay so some of them more than i have one idea here for the swag i i like your honesty honestly yeah so maybe maybe it's a good time to remind you that we run workshops several per week and all of uh about all topics development front-end backend various languages databases mostly cassandra and related uh topics but still very broad topics and please connect with us and stay stay with us because we offer new content very frequently so yeah and usually it's on wednesday and thursday and nowadays we are trying to make it more friendly for us as well um you know not just for uh asia but you know for us as well so if you can reach out to your counterparts in the us and let them know that you know there are more friendly u.s times you know that may help as well yeah so rodrigo you made the right choice to decide to get certified please stay tuned uh in the meantime you'll find a link in the youtube chat to stay up to date with our workshop offering so i think we can go ahead now you can go forward what's your profile java developer well that fits with today so we will see database administrator system administrator jackable trades yeah i like jackable trades yeah there are quite some yeah it's good to be able to do a bit of everything i it's surprising that we don't have any database admins although this is a cassandra workshop right which is which is fine because it's really more of a development uh workshop yeah and and there are managed solutions that make you make it easy to do without operations more on that later okay yes okay so thank you for the answers i think that was so because because there's another you know java being predominant you would like to kind of get the idea okay there are three people with greater than 10 years fantastic some people don't know anything about java which is fine you can still uh you know benefit from this workshop um you know as long as you follow the steps i think it's good all right so i think i think this is kind of one part of what we expected as well uh but i'm glad to see a lot of people who have uh worked more than 10 years in java okay so another question have you used quarkus before yes someone did many didn't yet yeah maybe who knows well if you haven't used that yet that's then today is for you but probably also if you use that because there's always something more to learn some hands-on to do because today's practice with you you will be able to do your own coding and running stuff all our workshop are very hands-on like you said yeah and even if you're a quest expert here or you may pick up a tip or two um okay yeah absolutely okay all right i think that that's good and the last question here probably is what ide do you use yeah so vs code intellij well the yeah eclipse is probably eclipsed yeah so intellij seems to win among especially among java developers yeah not not to be not a surprise surprise yeah exactly there yeah for those who are those who put other um you know if you can put in the chat uh what id you use that would be useful uh you know especially if it's a you're using i mean you're a java developer and you're using another ide you know i mean i yeah i always i'm curious but but you know you don't need to put it in chat okay so i can share my dirty secret i mostly uh use a text editor as my id text editor plus console okay guys that tells about what kind of complex projects i handle currently but yeah okay one of the things i the reason for putting up this question is because as you know we will be using an integrated ide called the git part which which really is very powerful you know it provides you not only an ide but it provides your terminal uh and it does a whole lot of things you know including uh bringing up a browser and things like that so yeah so it's pretty cool so the reason you know for those of you who have not used vs code this might take a little bit of uh um you know getting used to but but you know it's pretty easy to use vs code anyway all right with that out of the way i think we should get back to yeah so i think we are done with the initial questions so it's time for us to start but please keep the mentee open for the quiz yeah now right you can just exactly you can just switch to your slides and just give it a second i'll make sure that i have the right one oh right here so okay so so we're right here yeah okay danielle um we we are not just uh you know two of us here uh we have a whole team that's going to be supporting us you know they'll be helping out with the chat and and so on uh although i think there is another workshop going on at the same time uh but like what uh you know stefano said before we have other workshops and run by our team so with that said let's jump straight into quarters danielle thank you so much rex and then first of all i think this workshop pretty amazing for all of you because i just saw a lot of people don't have any experience of forecasting so maybe this is a really good chance to catch up what progress is so corkers is just java framework and then we can say the supersonic subatomic java let me explain why we call that if you're going to next libraries so here is a job i was born almost 26 years ago and at a time java was a little more focused on the high uh true food and we did a 24 7 running process all the time and then you just need to appeal a virtual machine to run your bgc application it's dynamic behavior when you uh compile your buy code and immediate application and then you could run any app server over the internet that was the beauty of the java technology at a time but things changed there so we are moving forward immutable infrastructure aka kubernetes and then just imagine that you just package one containerized microsoft application with the java and then you need to scale up maybe thousand part or a hundred thousand part uh based on your business capabilities but if you still have the same behavior or dynamic capability it's totally not a productive uh technology and architecture stack so that's why we design the carcass if we go into the next slide please yeah i think i think one of the things that i mentioned here is that even though it's a paradigm change uh you can still use you know intellij or vs code or whatever you know that you uh have been using and kind of follow the same um you know ci cd uh you know pipelines that you used yeah that's a really good catch all right thanks for that and also we cannot ignore the java developer around the world so if i remember correctly there are more than 15 million java developers around the world to develop business application every single day so we cannot ignore them so that's why we are developing new java framework but this java framework was born after new technologies such as container packaging like a linux container like a docker oci something like that as well as kubernetes so java this quarkx was born a little bit more focus on kubernetes and a container first as you can see we optimized the memory preference and the startup time and uh and also memory properly as well let me a little bit more detail next slide so uh i think there is a good question here uh daniel that uh you may want to address what is the difference between quarkus plus native and quarks quarkus plus jvm i think this is a question by gupta yeah yeah sure yeah good question actually we got a more slide for that okay that's fine let's let's answer this question uh a little bit later because we have a slide there for that i don't know and then so uh we uh improve a lot of developer productivity so all matter is developer experiences so we provide developer ui and developer ci cli and also uh as you can see there are live coding that is the beauty of the carcass you're gonna go through this almost feature during the workshop today so as an example when you run parkinson's on time like a maven quarkx dev it's a quarkx dam mode and it's just running your local machine jvm and then whenever you change your application code the carcass automatically detect your change code application property file or ymo file and automatically recompile rebuild and restart your local environment so developer sample you don't need to do anything just keep focusing your bgc application development that is the beauty of the live coding capability so we got a lot of customer success story with the dead developer productivity so they are more than 30 percent uh i mean uh the developer developing time reduced 30 percent of the whole uh application development time also there are dev services so when you add some specific uh maybelline dependency we can call quarkx extension for example when you add post sql or mongodb or ms sql data dependency on your gradle project or the maple project quarkx automatically stands of your container like a docker container for post sql database or mongodb or even single sign or kick log or redis data grid or something like that so you don't need to use uh daca compose you don't need to use uh darker seri to stand up your local machine or even you don't need to install that database or cluster to interact your business application yeah i think i think one of the things that has been underemphasized in this day of containers and micro services is the inner loop right the inner loop takes a lot you know the significant time for the developer and if you can somehow speed this up you will achieve um exponential proportion in developer productivity and you will see this in action today um sorry danielle did i interrupt you did you have something else here or should i absolutely not yeah absolutely not that is a really good point so in order to innovate uh the workflow process standpoint the developer totally saved their time you don't need to do a re-compile review leave deploy stuff just only focusing application department yeah the next uh great feature of the forecasting is uh quarkus enable java developer to unify imperative and reactivate application development at the same time as an example if you needed my your company uh needed you to develop new reactivate application along with the event driven architecture for example we need to create a new application communicate backhand kafka server in order to there maybe you need to use like a screen reactive this is a totally different architecture uh rather than the general supreme boot application also you maybe run something new technology like a node.js or a typescript or something else to implement reactivate application so this is a huge burden for general java developers but quarkx provides the same capability for imperative record recast response to synchronize real-time application also reactivate application only different thing you need to care about for developer standpoint you just need to use proper annotation in the left side the inject is a similar thing with a spring boot uh older wire to cdi injection and then you can see the get like a request mapping in spring size and it just produced the text plane or application json format is it just traditional microservices but right side you can see something a little bit different annotation like a channel qualifier and you can add outgoing incoming annotation in order to implement same functionality in for springboot you need to use spread integrations you need to use screencloud stream something like that so this is a huge benefit for developer as well next libraries so here how does a typical java framework works so in a build time you need to just pick it up your paper packaging tool like a maven gradle and then once you're packaging you have a good job file but the behind the scene when you run the java file using java command line there are a lot of stuff working on underneath for example the parts annotation and the scanning your annotation and you need to enable disable some features also uh parsing descriptor there are a lot of stuff thing at the end of that you just your java framework just to run your application based on thread or pull so let's go next slide please so the quarkx shift all this stuff from right to left in a build time so this is the uh huge change in kubernetes immutable infrastructure just imagine that so at runtime you just think about oh i just run my application but behind the scene there are a lot of uh working underneath which means people say oh java too heavyweight java to slow on kubernetes specifically like a software less or like a scalability but we just doing in the build time which means we just run actually uh create a process and thread at runtime this is makes focus super fast and uh small memory perfect next slide please yeah uh one of the things that's trendy in today's industry is kind of shift everything left right so the earlier you can do in the life cycle software development lifecycle the better it is and and that's kind of what quarkus does you know which which seems obvious but i just wanted to say it anyway yeah here is uh uh i'm going to answer the questions what is the difference between quarkx slash native and quaker slash jbm so quercus actually allows developer to package that application two different type of one is jvm using hotspot running on java virtual machine just like a traditional java application a java file artifact and run on jbm the other one is native which means the quarkx java framework allows developer to create a native executable file like a go or the like a python something like that you don't need to use this jvm to run the network secure file you don't need to use a java command line just run that file it is executable file and then the little bit technically dead native executable file running on grivm and specifically subtract vm as runtime so this makes carcass super fast and it's small memory perfectly just like a go even more than go so just compare to jbm versus native it's more than 300 times faster than start-up time for example when you have the hello world application like a restful api something like that it just takes a uh making uh 0.7 seconds less than one second to start up like let's say just one second but we you if you have a same application and packaging network secure while you just need to 10 millisecond one five milliseconds to start up same application yeah i think yesterday i was working with a colleague of mine who was giving me some feedback about this workshop and and basically he did this jvm packaging and the native packaging and he said wow this feels a little zippy you know you can you can feel it even though our application is very simple uh it still you know starts up really quickly and and and you will see that in action yourself and hopefully experience the same thing as well yeah that's great and then so you can actually use uh uh implement a java native thing on your traditional java framework but you need to run about the old complex like a java reflection stuff but with the quarkx you don't need to worry about that because you just keep developing traditional java like a postal class city ib and the services and resources job open and then just using uh maybelline command line like a maven packaging and sap native which allows you packaging every compilation automatically the behind the scene carcass carcass actually can do all of the native compilation at all so this is a super important thing you don't need to learn any specific technology or syntax something like that it's still java standard way you can also add a lot of extension like a enterprise java capability like a single sign-on security and a messaging with a copycat and database and you're gonna learn how to use your cassandra database with the quarkx with a simple way you just keep developing the traditional java application like a cloud native way but just only focus on how to set it up like application properly so what kind of use case you actually do use parksd so you can actually use everything like a traditional microservices with the data transaction like a cloud and also you can develop cloud native like based on kubernetes for reactive application or serverless function and you can develop like a command line application and also are there a kubernetes operator thing or gear up action for your devops pipeline the quarkx provide the stat capability to implement their functionalities next live please so here are the uh our new uh free ebook here so my colleague eric de andrea is uh right to disable i also participate in uh writing this wonderful chapter like a chapter five which is a little bit more focused on how to implement eventually with an application like a reactive application communicate copica cluster and the cloud event on kubernetes but this is a more important thing is this blue showcase of what differences and similarity between carcass and spring boot so if you already a lot of experience of the spring boot how to develop microservices or specific use case maybe this is really helpful to understand uh how what capable caucus is to implement same functionality with a more productive and effective way next libraries yeah and and actually martin warburg i think he works for uh microsoft now uh you know he's a very well known person in the you know in the java space some of you might might relate to that um also i know that eric is not feeling too well right now otherwise he would have been here as well uh so we wish him a speedy recovery and with that uh danielle anymore you want to act before i jump and jump into astra no i'm good and i'm going to stay uh in the workshop in the back channel so if you have any question around the focusing or doing some troubleshooting in the workshop and i'll just uh ask the question in the channel at the chat window in the youtube and i'm more than happy to address your questions perfect okay thank you daniel um with that let's jump into astra uh i think daily talked about uh you know very powerful uh platform a very reactive platform you know responsive platform uh but as nicholas worth put it about 50 years ago actually uh you know programs is equal to algorithms plus data structures right uh so i think the algorithms are optimized with quarkx uh whereas you still have to have responsive data and that's where astro fits in so once you have the two together uh it makes it makes a lot easier right you know it makes it a lot responsive and so on uh what is uh you know um what is astra really it's basically uh you know it starts with the panchi cassandra and essentially it's a database apache a service um apache cassandra as we know you know is used by uh like the apples and the netflix of the world they really use this um and really uh very scalable uh the way i kind of look at this from a java programming perspective is that it's really a big distributed hash set and i don't need to worry about how to distribute it i don't need to worry about what happens if a particular node goes down and all that because you know apache cassandra takes care of all that for you and and you know we're going to be using astra which is a database as a service which essentially means that you don't have to do any of the system administration yourself and let us worry about this how is the data distributed we have what is referred to as a partition key and that is the central tenet um you know in in cassandra so it's distributed based on partition keys uh it's also made highly available because there are two copies of that kept elsewhere just in case the node um you know uses uh that that you know one of the nodes dies you can still get it from the other nodes there are a number of other things that you know makes it very unique um you know makes cassandra very unique uh you should attend some of our nosql workshops our intro to cassandra workshop to get a little bit more uh details about that but essentially what it what cassandra does is it it distributes the data uh based on on the partition key um and and really uh the cool thing about uh about cassandra and and and and if you want to use it uh there are a number of different ways of using this you know one is the easiest option is to go sign up on astra which is what you're going to do today but there are also other options like for example you can you know you can install this on your own cloud we have something called as a kate sandra which is kubernetes um you know cassandra running on kubernetes and you can install that as well on multicloud i myself have a number of uh those running um you know on different clouds uh like quarkus you know really when it comes to data um if you want highly scalable highly available totally distributed cloud native um i think i think you know there are a number of use cases where you can use cassandra we all know that you know there is no i mean this technology is not a silver bullet right um you know there are certain things that may not fit your use cases uh but but you know it's it's really you know when you're looking for fast responsive uh micro services based service mesh based that's useful okay so i skipped that slide but really what is astra is it's like i said um you know it's database as a service you know that's the easiest way to understand that but there are a number of other advantages with that as well it is front-ended by what is called as a stargate api okay and we'll talk about that in a second um and and you know essentially what it can do is do a lot of the uh day-to-day operations behind the scenes automatically for you um you can migrate into astra there are there was a webinar i'm not going to talk too much about that but you can migrate your you know if you have an existing database cassandra database you can migrate into astra uh you can work with you know you know with us to make this happen so specifically with respect to quarkx and cassandra what we'll be doing today is looking at the quarkus cassandra extension um you know you can you can do we have a cassandra driver we have cassandra driver object mapper support which maps objects um to relational you know in a way right um so essentially it's an easier way to kind of deal with it using data access object data transfer objects and so on and although we won't be using that in today's uh exercise uh in today's workshop i will point you at one um you know repository that kind of does that does that uh the primary thing is native emit support uh and and you know like i said you can spin up a a database today and astra and get started pretty straightforward the first thing you're going to do is you're going to provide the the you know appropriate artifacts needed to connect to astra right so basically you provide this path to astra bundle that zip it's a secure connect bundle and and it kind of walks you through that uh you have you provide a username and a password you know essentially uh it's a client secret and a client id client id and client secret you know that's kind of what you use and then you can provide some cassandra related uh um you know configuration as well so this is again you know enabled by the um by the uh caucus driver that that we uh we support okay um we are primarily going to use the sql session today and and eric and i had a discussion for a long long time uh about but sql it's not reactive you know it's synchronous right um and and all points are correct and and you may think that you know today's example you're not quite doing reactive um you know but it's coming it's grpc is coming and it's the cloud native way to call sql the key benefits of grpc is that you know it's a lightweight client library and that's the way the cool kids who do microservice and service mesh um you know do reactive these days right so grpc is coming but the nice thing about this is you know if you're using sql okay this is kind of what we're going to see today more or less um the grpc is exactly you know it's going to use the sql in the back end but we don't really care about how that is done so in other words you know you you can potentially see a workshop you know a follow-on workshop which essentially uses grpc and and is truly reactive okay in today's exercise what we're going to do in today's workshop we're going to go through the mechanics but but pretty soon we're going to you know start looking at kind of the data access object um you know the data transfer objects that most of you as java programmers understand you know because it's a lot easier to do it you know why are these objects because it provides you with standard getter methods center methods and so on um you know that could be a follow-on workshop it also supports mutiny types and and you know this is an easier way of again um doing programming you know using data databases okay but i know that you guys are kind of chomping in a bit you know waiting to get started on the workshop so so let me jump straight to here uh you know like i said astra is front-ended by stargate and and what it does is it provides you with a number of different apis uh document api sql graphql um you know and we have workshops for pretty much all of this so we're not going to make you a cassandra expert in this workshop nor will we make you a caucus expert in this workshop but but you know you will definitely get to that by by getting your hands dirty okay so with that let's jump to live coding and and my goal here is to not talk too much i'll let you guys do a lot of the work but what i want to do is kind of talk about some of these you know some of the sharp edges okay that you probably want to avoid um because you know there are certain things that that you may want to take care of okay so let me go into doing a little bit of the light coating and then i'll turn you guys loose maybe you know in about 10 minutes and then my suggestion is i won't talk too much but but at the end you know i will kind of walk through each of those different steps that you're going to go through um and and if you can put in the chat that you know with a thumbs up exercise one i finished up exercise one exercise two exercise three or something i think that will help you know to kind of you know understand where you are uh and it also kind of provides a pure pressure for other people you know but don't feel pressured uh you know if you want to do the uh coding yourself later you can do that as well okay so enough of talking let's jump into live coding what do you think yeah um all right that's great so much talking no no i think it's good i think it's the right time to start working with the database so if you're okay rux let's help our friends here to start by creating their database right yes so so to yeah to create a database very straightforward you know you you uh the link is provided um i believe it's something like astro.datastax.com or something so um okay i i already have already sorry i'll put that in the chat but um if you're okay i'll also give the link to the github repository for later reference yes because let's let's give this so you will find now in in the youtube chat and i'll also give it to the discord folks in the main chat room channel yes so this is the link so the first thing you want to do is create the astrodb instance so yes so okay what i just gave you is a link to a repository containing basically all instructions to do the exercise of today uh wherever you want by yourself so in a self-service way that being said today i think as rock said we are we are going to do that together so it's a follow-along kind of thing so first thing first i'll give you this link where you will create your astra tv here yeah so i just noticed that nightbot for some reason uh has trouble starting today so we are on our own drugs sorry i know why maybe there is i think there is another worship going on that might have made things a bit complicated but that's okay so okay you see this create your raster db here so if you click on this you will be uh brought to may i share my screen racks for this part so i'll guide my our attendees through the creation of the of the database is that okay yeah absolutely fine okay yeah and and and my suggestion is you know once you finish this just put a thumbs up and say exercise one exercise two or whatever as the case may be okay so i'll just do the extra part and then i'll leave it to you because that's more your thing so okay so you should be seeing my screen now the github repository of which i gave you the link so you see there are all sorts of instructions uh an introduction you probably are able to so that that's made in a way that that makes it for a self-service kind of thing now let's jump straight to step one which is create your astrodb instance so rugs has been say has been explaining what asterisk is basically a database is a service managed in the cloud for you by data stocks uh built on apache cassandra and today by going to this link that you find in the chat astrodev 1027 you will be brought to a screen like this that will give you the possibility of registering so you will be able to register yourself name email password or just sign in with github or google and you will be able to sign up and create your own database now um as 3db is has a very high level as a very generous free tier so you will be able to spin up your own database and that will be yours for good and you you will be you can just keep it for free and use it as much as you want within a rather high free tier limit which is 80 gigabit gigabytes of storage and 20 read write 20 million read write operations per month because the free credit is renewed every month so let's say you sign in and you should go to a screen now obviously i already have my account so let me please sign and the cool thing is you can even run some like small production workloads with the future which is within those accounts that's very cool yeah so actually it's not just for a for a couple of exercises so you can you can run real applications very much real application and still staying within the free tier so let's say you're signing up and you you will be asked to create your database now you can name your database everything you want but for the next parts to work smoothly we suggest you to suspend your creativity and just use the names we suggest so they are all given in the in the in the readme here you see database name workshops and uh key space name to-do list that's because today's sample application is going to be the hello world of useful applications namely a nice to-do list running within quarkus so let me drop these here in the chat just for everyone to follow please use these names when creating your database so i know that anshul gupta is already done but you don't have to you don't have to wait for it to be ready if it even if it's pending you know just let us know yeah yeah exactly so i'll yeah thank you yeah i'll come to that in a second so database name workshops key space name to the list then you you have to choose where and under which cloud provider this database will be spun up you can choose whatever you want maybe you want to keep it close to you so i'm in europe so i'll go for aws europe frankfurt but any any other choice should work then you click this create database button that you see here and in a few seconds you should be going to your dashboard and you should see your database here workshops you see that's here listed in among my databases now uh for a few minutes this database will be in the pending state that's normal you just give it a few minutes for for everything to be set up and set in motion in a few minutes you that database will be active up and running ready for the next steps now um if you attended other workshops or by by us you might already have your workshop databases here in which case that's no problem you just you can just use this already existing database and with this nice and then you ellipses you should just enter this database when it will be ready and there will be an add key space button here so if you ever find yourself having the database already you just create the key space called to-do list init so you can have many key spaces within a database now what is a key space that's not super relevant for us today but it is basically a grouping of tables within a database so that's just a logical way of grouping together related tables uh even the name of the key space is better to to be kept standard so to-do list should make everything that follows work smoothly that's it for the database now let me go back to my to my main dashboard so we can keep an eye on when the database called workshops is becoming active and now as you see here you see my workshops database is active so whether it's active or not i would like you to give me a thumbs up or an okay in the chat just to know so i've already seen someone went through step one which is creation of the database yeah so yeah there's a question rahul maybe that that this question is a bit uh out of scope for today you suggest you to reach us on discord where we have time to go through operations related questions so now we are a bit tight on time to speak about backups and um databases so please save this question for this card i i gave you the link that's really cool right yeah so i see a lot of thumbs up so that's very good let's uh go to the next step because now we created the database very good it's probably actually it's becoming active for many of you so we give another minute or so i'm just browsing through the readme of the repository now it's time to create your token because obviously this is a database in the cloud uh it it is so you need some credentials to be able to access it from anywhere and these credentials come in the form of okay okay super thank you rahul so i see many thumbs up piling up so let me go forward let's create the astra token the astra token is something is a basically authentication string a token that we will use within the quercus application to authenticate ourselves and reach the database in a authorized manner and this token we create through the astra ui so there are two ways to create the token the quickest way is see where i am i am in the main dashboard where i list i have the list of my databases here i i want to create a token to access the database called workshops so let me go on the right you probably don't need to scroll horizontally but i want my screen to be super giant so everybody of you can read smoothly so on the on the far right of this line there is this three dots ellipsis menu and if you open it there is a nice generate token item here so let me click on this generate a token now pay attention i'm creating my token and i will have to copy it on somewhere i will have to copy it to my machine because the tokens once created will not be shown again for security reasons so this is this this is the interface that lets me create a new token for this database uh it's all explained in the readme so if you go there you see that you have to generate the token with the role database administration administrator so it will be able to create tables and do say super user kind of things so database administrator is going to be my role here when i create the token now let me click generate token and voila instantly i have my token now this is what i was saying the token is actually made by by three parts there is a client id which will play the role of a username in the in the authentication through quarkus there is a client secret and there is a token now you can download all of them as a csv for later uh lookup now maybe uh rust if i remember correctly we need the client id and the client secret right correct yeah okay yeah so yeah so if you want i can i can share mine and okay so this is how we create the token one you can also keep this window open this this tab open and keep it there but just out just for to avoid the losing is mistakenly i will just save my token csv file locally for use opening it later okay so let me keep this token available as you see i already have some of them for from previous workshops now we so so there's a question where do we need a token if you have a client secret yeah that's beautiful yeah there are various ways there are actually a lot of ways to connect to your raster database uh through drivers interfaces um api like this graphql and different kind of http apis that are that rugs mentioned and some of them will require the token proper and some of them will require the client to a decline secret payer so that's that's why so now but in in this particular case we are using um token and the client id and secret right so okay so that's the question i am in the secure connect bundle and the idea idea is that uh again you know this needs to be secure uh just the client id and secret is not good enough because we want to customize it um and and that's the reason you know some of these might might simplify in the future but but that's kind of where we are right yeah exactly right okay so let's say we have our database and we generate our token and uh let's not so keep these uh strings in mind and that's it for the generation of token and these client id client secret and token will be used all the all three of them as drugs just said they will all be used later in the application now uh okay i think yes did that answer your question yes so rox i think it's time to jump to git pod yeah so i i already have get part open one of the things that i want to talk to you about uh a sharp corner here uh if you don't mind sharing myself yes sure so i'll i'll leave that to you indeed so please everyone keep your token all the three strings available for later and i'll back come back to rack's screen okay perfect okay so so you see the dashboard here uh you know if you go to workshops right um so what you can do is you can click on workshops and you'll do this in a little bit but i wanted to provide you a heads up because you know this is something that is the toughest glimmie part of the workshop you know is to be able to kind of get that zip file into get part okay and you'll see this in a second so what you want to do is you click on connect and then java and these are all provided okay and and you click on download bundle okay and this secure connect bundle okay if you click on this this is going to go into your local file system right which is where you're you know you're kind of looking through this and all that so i have it on downloads right and then i when you have the git part up and running okay so what you want to do here is to be able to transfer this zip file um so you can see here i i don't have my zip file here right so the easiest way to do it is just you know kind of drag and drop it okay and right now i'm having trouble with that i don't know why so so what i can do is take it here and and drop it at this right place so you have to drop it right here otherwise it's not going to work okay so so you you once you put it here the file is not displayed that's fine because it's a zip file right uh and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna go into i'm jumping up jumping ahead a little bit but but basically trying to give you this so that um you know if you're already trying to go forward uh this will help you okay so main resources um and then application properties okay um there are two things that you need to enter here okay which is the username and the password and this was basically the client id and the client secret uh that you got when you generated the application token you know i think uh stefano showed how you can save it right you're going to put that in so this is going to happen in the next step but i wanted to provide you with a heads up earlier and and i'll switch back to stefano who will show you how to bring up the git part okay want to do that stefano or you want me to do stefano we can't hear you i think right sorry okay so back to i was saying sorry um another another piece of information needed to connect from from the application from the quercus application is the secure connect bundle we didn't mention yet properly so rugs were showing that and this is something also this is also something needed to can properly connect it contains a bunch of certificates and other pieces so it's a zip file that we will have to get over to git pod for the application to work in git but now very quickly i'll go to my workshops database here and i'll hit connect rux did you already show that very quickly right so yes i did okay that's that comes later in the readme it's step 5b as i wrote in the chat again connect so i'm in my workshops database i go to connect today we are going to be java so there is you see here a lot of different ways to connect with astrodb i go to java and i've i'm given an option here download your secure connect bundle this is really just a file that i will i'm able to download here and this file if you connect to astrodb to your database through java will be needed and that's very so it encodes a lot of small of tiny configuration parameters that make the connection to astra easy in one step so it contains certificates region name you see everything needed so i'm i'm just downloading a zip file is it here i'll save it somewhere now i'm have to say i'm not familiar with windows so i have no idea what is where this file went but i will be able to find it now back to gitbot so this uh secure connect bundle is actually described here below so we if you're doing that by if you're following it by yourself you will find it i think here in step 5b here it's described but now let's go back to where we were so gitpod now what is gitbot it is this very nice and easy to use ide in a browser and to open gitbot now i have to okay let me close this to open git put you just have to click open this link in your tab so you see this big button open in git pod in the readme you just right click or middle click whatever and open link in your tab ta-da you see now i'm about to start with gitbot here i can login and i prefer to do that with github which you haven't seen it but it has opened a small temporary new window to hand to negotiate authentication through github but the final point is that you see i have my own gitpod instance starting up now what happens behind the scenes with this simple click on the button is a new gitpod instance is created for me a repository is cloned for me in this ide in the cloud and you see an interface very similar to visual studio code is open for me i have a file browser on the left i have a file editor here above and i have a nice console here below and the console is now running stuff you see maybe i hope you can appreciate what is written here that i see downloading this and that in progress repackaging so it there are some initial setup command that are running for us so no nothing to do here while this works maybe i'll just show again how to use drag and drop you remember the secure bundle that was very nicely downloaded from the astra ui now here i hope you can see it i cannot make it bigger sorry for some reason but i think you can see the secure connect workshops zip file here it i i know it might look very tiny but this is my local computer and now i just take the zip file and i will drag and drop it here on the right on the left file browser in git pod you see that the panel become become a light blue and if i drop it the zip file is there for me in git pod ready for me to use so this is all we need from astra ui we have a token that contains client id client secret and the token itself and we downloaded the secure bundle and we brought it over to gitbot now uh with that i'll leave that again i'll leave that back to rugs for the for the following are you ready with your git pod i think mine is also ready yeah mine is ready okay so let me give it back to you that's okay um i haven't put the username and password but we'll walk through the step anyway right so so that's good you mean the client the secret and client id correct correct exactly yeah okay yeah so so uh do i have the right one here i'm looking at the wrong one yeah the wrong one all right this is the one that i'm looking at so let me get rid of this i don't need this so people are able to see my screen okay yeah your screen is on screen yeah okay so so what i um you know what uh stefano did was kind of talk about you know get part um and and uh you know talk about what are the this is where you know in three is where you're going to be interacting the most this is the terminal window two is kind of like where you can edit the files and and this is of course the explorer window on the left okay all of this is explained if you haven't used git power before but i don't want to dwell too much on that because that's the easy part now let's set up our application right so the easiest way to do it is you know just do this you know open source main resources application properties application properties is the file that we're going to be using a lot right so let me go into my git pod okay and i already have it open but i'm gonna use the command anyway okay and the first time around when you want to put something in the clipboard it might ask you uh see text and images copied to the clipboard uh just say hello okay so that it allows you okay and now what i have to do is i have to put the username and the password okay so let me see if if i have it here i think i had it somewhere here okay so here's my client id okay so i copy it back to my username right and then my client secret okay so let me go here and copy this okay so i basically do a copy of that and put it in here and you're good to go that's it that's all you need okay because we already connected the zip file and you essentially did the username and the password and now we are able to connect to uh quarkx database okay so one of the cool things about gitpart is it does an autosave okay and now we are ready ready for business the first thing so so let's let's see if we can get here because this is this is a step that that takes a while so let's give everybody about maybe two to three minutes five minutes maybe right um so that everybody is comfortable with this uh as soon as you do this uh you know give give a uh thumbs up okay yeah rux so i'm sorry in the meantime while we wait these two minutes there is a question in the chat about what exactly is this being downloaded oh yeah yeah uh i i i think it worked it's a runtime right it's a modern version of the java jvm exactly yeah yeah what what we are you know downloading is the uh the grull vm um and the java vm obviously uh the best way to look at that is you know you can do an echo dollar java home like something like this yeah and that will tell you um okay where where the java you know uh paths are and so on so i see that you know a couple of people already um so um you know already gave a thumbs up so um you know go ahead and do this we'll wait for a few minutes because it i know that this takes a while uh a little bit of time at least so so let's wait for a few and if you're having trouble i know that one akif you had a you had a problem right um so akif if you want to uh let us know what the error message is that that will help oh there it is vs code it's not synced oh yeah you can ignore that i don't think it it's it's a problem but if you wanted uh i think it might ask you to reload uh vs code uh you can do that as well you know so yeah perfect we're seeing a lot of thumbs up that's good there's still a lot of people watching this and and following along so i'll wait for a few more minutes and then we can do the first step okay okay i see more and more thumbs up piling up so someone went unsure went to four five six in a row so congratulations you are way ahead of us very right and that's and that's cool because you know typically what i've done with many of my hands on lab is i've i've spoken for a half an hour and then let you know attendees lose because each person has their own pace of doing it but you know in data stacks what we do is we try to wait uh at some logical points so so if you feel like you want to go ahead feel free to go ahead if you feel like you're lagging behind i want to do it later that's fine too but i think the ideal thing is you know just kind of follow along as much as someone rodrigo i think you are at the homework that should be if i'm not mistaken the last step so congratulations congratulations seriously um yeah okay something that we can we afford another minute before we go ahead so everybody has time to edit their application properties maybe because that's an important thing uh at the end of this of today's workshop there we will be leaving a small homework for you to do and uh yeah okay probably you might need some more guidance about the homework or not depending on yeah on your level of knowledge and patience so uh okay you'll wait anyway if if when this workshop will be over and you will be maybe still doing the homework uh you might want to reach us to to ask for guidance or for help or whatever so please join us on discord where the discussion game can continue even after this live is over so this is where the long-term discussion goes on so please join our our discord community we have we are there there's a lot of people and a lot of topics going on also more or less astra and cassandra related but in a broad sense okay and by the way those of you who can who complete the homework and submit it to us through a github issue as explained in the readme you will be awarded a nice badge that you will can can then brag about all over so yeah a completion badge i'm not sure about the dark theme in gitbot there probably is but i have no idea okay so that's all i wanted to say about the homework so i just want to you know you can see these two windows pop up right here service is available on port 8080 a service is available on port 5505 you can just ignore those those are informational okay so basically it's opening those ports you know five five zero zero five is used for debugging and the att is used to access the application okay so you'll see that yes there is a dark team in github and and you can get to it uh i'd like to see on the chat if anybody is having any issues um so that we can proceed um with the next step and and you you probably already saw me doing it on the screen but uh but you know if you're not let me know proceed okay i wanna okay that's fine and that is fine because what i what i suggested you do is bring it up and once the application is running it will be fine yes you can uh i'm sure uh you can use intellij although we will be using visual uh vs code here um so you know i don't know if you saw the instructions right up front we are not going to be able to support that uh um you know different kind of install we really have only two hours and we want to be able to support just the standard happy path like uh stefano was mentioning yeah so you can totally run locally everything but that's an advanced thing because you will have to you know troubleshoot your yourself is is anybody having trouble or should we just go ahead if anybody is having trouble just put it in the chat right now so that we can help you looks like we did a good job with the instructions and and with the demo nobody seems to be having trouble so let's proceed with the next step right what do you think all right so let's go ahead and and look at the next step which is basically um you know we'll run the test okay so we set up the application because we set up the application properties i set up the client id secret and so on and now we're going to run the unit test very simple to run unit test unfortunately we're going to be only doing this one test quarkx framework is fantastic for testing um but but really we don't have too much time here maybe it's a follow-on workshop okay so you can see me talking about this follow-on workshop because the platform is so big you know it's not possible to cover all of that today okay so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to run that test okay and you can see here the test right and hopefully you'll see all greens in no reds okay and it's downloading a whole bunch of stuff like what do we say maven downloads the entire world something like that right but eventually you know you should be able to see this test running okay so if the test is running you should be see you should be able to see uh something like this table created so automatically it creates the table for you and if you go back into the astra dashboard and look through sql you can see all this um yourself but but you know this is just a an empty table that you can start using okay so so please give me a thumbs up once once you finish this uh this part which is i believe what is it exercise five six whatever uh it was exercise six six so i think we are almost yeah yeah so if you can just say six yes i think it's good yeah so you should be able to see the table created through um within in in the output after running all tests right if you if you if you just do this uh you know copy the one command right and run that it'll tell you exactly that because otherwise you'll have to wait through all this output right yeah it's taking me notes after all the whole test suit takes what two minutes anyway you probably at the most yeah you know first time around it's a little bit slower um you know it's really i think 17.2 seconds not even that right so you can see here all that i got was the table created true if you don't get this then then you know there's no point in advancing okay let me know all right yeah so maybe we can ask for a few thumbs up if you if you if you guys managed to see the table created through which means that the test went through all right and the table was created i don't want to hurry you any of you but but you know i think this is a pretty straightforward step yeah so so one of the other things that i want to talk about is sometimes what happens is you know in get part you make sure that you're at the terminal window but sometimes my cursor is here and i think i'm typing in the terminal and i'm actually typing in the editor window and that will screw up everything especially if you have the palm file like you know let's say i have the pom file and you put like a queue here or something you're thinking you're typing in the terminal and you put a queue you have no idea where it went uh that will screw up everything okay so just just keep that in back of the mind so we're getting to the really cool part uh you know which is the light coating you know the heart reloading the debugging part once we have this done and then it should be smooth sailing from there hopefully let me just mention one thing just for fun if you manage to get to the table created through output uh maybe not don't do that now but if you go to the astra ui and connect even with the cql console for those who know what it is if you go to the key space you will see that a table has been indeed created with some columns so and that will be the table used by the application later so everything matches sorry exactly so for those of you who are who are kind of following along um you know that's fine but for those of you a little bit advanced you know you may want to go to the sql uh dashboard and kind of look around play around with it you know maybe add a few entries there because a typical microservice right you will get you know input from other services so think of the sql session as like a a microservice adding you know entries into your to-do uh you know i gave an example of where my my coach says you know go ahead and do this right and i drop everything and i go ahead and do that right so that's gonna work anybody stuck you know if you're stuck please let us know we are here to help as much as we can i think all right it's all right so let's proceed with the next step okay which is basically uh the qualcomm and the heart reloading part this is kind of the coolest part right so what we're going to do we're going to skip test here okay and go back to the git part okay and again the terminal window and just run the focus dev and skip test okay and danielle um you know uh let me know if there's some parts that need to be uh featured um but but you know i'm gonna i'm gonna try to show um you know most of this okay so this is the cool part just by hitting one button right uh you know you can you can get you know help right and you can open the application in the browser by just hitting the w you can see here you know w it's going to open the application in the browser b is going to open the dev ui in the browser you can force a restart um you know you can show this help or you can quit this application so there are a number of things you can do i'm just going to hit w just for the heck of it okay you'll see that this application is up and running okay so right there very cool right now what i'm gonna do is just show you how the hot reloading part works you know typically what i would do is i will have a browser which is actually looking for the changes so i'll have to refresh this myself in in today's demo uh but you typically won't have to um you know if you if you set up your browser that way okay so let me go into main where am i i'm kind of losing track here okay uh no resources right uh huh all right sorry um just give me a second i think it's may resources meta inf okay and uh index.html okay so look at index.html okay and i'm gonna get rid of this and i'm gonna get rid of this okay because i don't need to and i'm going to get rid of this as well okay so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to look at index.html okay and i'll make a very small change just as an illustrative change okay so you make sure you do it on the data ribbon okay and and just instead of fourth me on github i'm gonna do a fourth me today on github okay and and that's all you know this is auto saved for me with git part and if i do a w again notice here you will see folk me today coming up here okay so before that it was just for me on github now it's for me today on github a lot of things happened under the hood and i don't really care what happened because the quarkus platform took care of all that right it basically noticed the change it went ahead and you know rebuilt the jar so whatever it was required and and deployed the application and stood it up and and provided me the application so you know again uh a lot of envy from java programmers looking at other languages which provided this support but today you can do it in in java you know using the quarkx platform okay very cool uh so daniel i don't know if you want to add anything more to this the next exercise kind of talks about getting carcass metrics and all that you need to do here is just uh press d okay and then you can kind of look at if you look at the config editor right it'll kind of go through my application properties the end point that we use here is slash q slash dev so if you want to add it to yourself you can do that as well but but you know just pressing uh d you know to be there and and the uh the readme kind of talks through all that so it tells you you know what quarkx application version uh but more importantly you know um let's see what what what would be interesting here um you know what is the key space right uh what are the metrics that are enabled um you know and uh and so on and so forth you know hey rex manufactured some comment on there yes go ahead please yeah sure so in wi in a configuration editor so whenever you change something value in the wi it automatically apply for your application properly on your local file system automatically so you don't need to go back to your id tool to change the value because you already changed in the wr it's automatically changing in your local file system at the same time and also when you edit some uh key clock and like a database or like a graphql or a like a cute it's a presentation a quirks template extension you can have own wi with some gui something like uh such as uh suego ui so you don't need to install the dollar party application to uh go through the web ui because quarkx wi automatically provides that capability as embedded way perfect yeah this is great so if anything what i'd like you to do is kind of do these two steps which is seven and i'm going to get to eight in a second which is really about the debugging part okay but but please give me a thumbs up once you're done with seven so anshul was asking does the change in properties get hot replaced as well yes right perfect rodrigo is done very cool step seven done fantastic so we'll get to the hammer homework in a little bit embed um just hold off on that yeah anyway the answer is yes yeah right so the changes in the application in the dev ui are immediately effective and i managed to break my my authentication by testing that now so yeah that works exactly yeah yeah correct um so this is great so anybody stuck in step seven because step 7 is the coolest part i don't want anybody to lose out on all right so should i get to step eight i think we're rolling along here right very cool right what do you think stefan yeah step eight all right so let's go to step eight step eight is pretty straightforward uh let me kind of walk through the steps first so essentially what you're going to do is you're going to go to the explorer view and set a breakpoint okay you set a breakpoint and then what you're going to do is you're going to run it run a quarkus dev and then start the debugging session and you're going to make a very s uh simple change okay and you'll see that in a second okay you'll see that you know yours your your breakpoints are going to show up and and in instead of the debugging whatever i'm going to change it to the proper spelling and that's all that i'm doing here okay but quarkx is a lot more powerful you know you can do a lot more stuff including hot code replacement okay so you can change the code um you know as and when you know which is like changing the tires as the you know application is moving but but you know we're not going to go through all that uh we're just going to go through the simple simple step okay so let's try to do that okay so i'm going to quit out of this you don't need to okay but uh i always like to start from scratch okay so what you can do is again you know kind of run the same thing i'm gonna skip tests okay but before i do that let me see if my um i set up the breakpoint okay to set up the breakpoint uh again you know very straightforward the first thing i'm going to do is make sure i set it at the right place okay so i go in here go to the terminal window okay and voila you know it's here right and all that i need to do is go to line 60 i don't even and and hit this stop button and you'll turn red you'll see that right so if the the red means that it's it's good to go okay so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna um run my uh application and then i realize oh oops you know i i need to set a breakpoint and i set the breakpoint and i'm ready to go right notice here it's using 5005 which is really the debug port that it's using okay and it's a standard jmx thing that you know any of you are using java you probably use this before right you get rid of this not worry about that right i've set the break point right now the next step to do is to start the application debugging to do the application debugging maybe i didn't set you know give the instructions properly but first you have to hit the run and debug and then hit the debug okay so there are two steps okay so you hit the start debugging okay you'll see the debug call stack screen coming up and and where are the breakpoints and and so on at this point nothing is happening right why because you know i mean the uh um uh you know i it's it's not really hit the break point okay so let me bring up the application again okay and what i'm going to do here now is i'm going to enter something okay so i'm going to enter the game right and hopefully as everything is right it should hit the breakpoint did you see the hit the breakpoint here it hit line 60 okay and now you can look at everything in here okay the first thing to do is probably click on to do and you can see here the the value so click on that and and basically fix it properly okay is that the right spelling now debugging right so once you've corrected that hit debugging and then there is this small arrow in the middle okay which is basically continue you can see if you hover over that it says continue r you can use f5 um if you hit continue okay it should come up okay and now if you go back and look at the application right it should hopefully have that debugging part okay voila bingo right very cool right just like that we were able to do debugging and uh you know daniel has some some pretty advanced examples where he does this hot code replacement uh you're welcome to try that um you know i'm sure he'll have a pointer to that or at least talk about it uh you know later so let me give everybody like two or three minutes because seven and eight are probably the most critical parts of the workshop um so i'll let you let you guys try this out um give give like two or three minutes here if whenever you finish exercise seven if you can put a thumbs up exercise seven that'll be great where did we configure the port for debugging that's a good question and let me see if i can uh sure let's see there's something i missed anyway so i'm gonna go back to the explorer screen okay and and in vs code okay there's a launch json okay you'll see here that this is where i configured the uh the debug port i mean it doesn't have to be five zero zero five although that's kind of a um you know standard thank you if anybody is stuck on step 8 please let us know we'll try to help any comments meantime daniel on debugging or the heart code replacement you know any of those oh yeah for sure so quarkx actually provide the remote uh dev as well so you're actually using your local demo so you can run the quarkx application on your local machine it just monitor your local jbm but you can actually deploy the quarkx application to remote kubernetes uh it will be running and pod but when you run your remote dev on your local machine it automatically connects to your remote quarkxpart whenever you change the code it will automatically uh packaging and sending it to your remote pod on kubernetes automatically start so so and also you could use a remote debugging capability on kubernetes from your local machine so same capability remote dev same same capability like a live coding and a debugging just react showcased you can use the same capability on kubernetes from your local machine so you can say yeah yeah remote dev and remote debugging this is expand your inner new development capability because kubernetes is not just your production but also you can consider the kubernetes in your local development like a devops pipeline or devops platform something like that i don't know if i understand unschool's question it seems the config is where we will connect for debug where is the configuration uh specified for the debug port it's in vs code if you if you look in your gitpod editor dot vs code uh and then there is a launch.json okay that's where it is okay i don't know if i answered the question anybody stuck on step eight anybody finished up step eight you know if you can put a thumbs up you know it'll you'll know that we can proceed the last part takes a little bit of time so what i would suggest i do we do is skip everything and and and go to the last part because that takes about eight to ten minutes um if that's okay with uh with stefano or or what we can do is we can we can run that and then run mentee yeah we have 25 minutes left it should be yeah if i think that's the last part right so there should be time to do all right perfect can we see a few more thumbs up for step eight are people already uh done or in a normal java application we first specify the port in the java jvm or db yes you can do that that way as well there are there are a number of different ways of doing this but this was done um you know this is a question that anshu asked which is no actually normal java application we first specify the port in the jvm arguments where debug port will be hosted yes you can do that as well and that's exactly what visual studio code is doing you know it's using the launch.json to be able to kind of send those parameters uh you know to java okay i see got it yeah and show uh is basically clarifying in our idv configure the remote debug which can be considered as client um connecting to the debug port yeah i mean i know there are lots of moving parts here uh we kind of took the easy path again okay okay so let me continue with the next part is that good the next part is the easiest part you know all that we do here is we do the packaging i believe that's kind of what you know we did the breakpoint part we did the debugging part we saw the watch um and and we saw how we fixed you know did a very simple debugging now we package it up as a jar file okay very straightforward all that i do is i package it up um by using the target minus package right uh our clean package and that's it okay not minus package but maybe clean package okay i don't need to do clean every time you know i can just do package and it should you know pick up the right things and all that um but but you know let's not worry too much about that how do i run this like any jar file right you know all that it creates the the runnable jar file right and it should already be in target quarkus app hopefully right and actually let me show that in action what i'm going to do is i'll make sure that i'll do i'm even clean okay let's look at target okay there's no such file directory right so now if i run the clean package skip test okay and if i do the same thing now if i look at target there is a whole bunch of things that are generated the one that i'm really interested is the quarkus app right and if i look at that you'll see here the qualcomm.jar right and all that i need to do to run this is say java minus jar and target right and calculus app run dodger i'm sorry call customer okay and you'll see the same application up and running okay pretty straightforward so you can see here cable created all that and it's good okay so sometimes uh you know the to-do list app kind of uses a session id so if you go into a different browser then essentially what it does is it it's assuming that it's a different person so the to-do list kind of starts from scratch so if you lose some entries don't worry about it but but my suggestion is just stick to the same browser that way you can see the same to-do list you know it's not the greatest of optimizations but but you know it seems to work in most cases so please give me a thumbs up this shouldn't take more than like half a minute okay when you're done with step was it eight step eight no step nine sorry we're coming to the cooler parts still there are some cool parts left which is the containerizing part and the packaging part so we started with astra used the token plugged it into the application.properties um you know looked at the hot reloading looked at debugging looked at packaging and next we're going to look at containerizing and the last coolest part is kind of packaging it up as native application okay which takes a little bit of time so so i just want to give you a heads up right now if you want to run it right now that's fine you know it shouldn't matter really yes darsek uh the video recordings are going to be available it's the same link yeah so in the meantime i see an answer about use of vertex by anshul uh rux do you know the answer to that or uh yeah i mean actually i i'll turn it over to daniel daniel you're still there yeah i'm here yeah so the question is i see the logs use of vertex does quarkus internally use word.x for routing like dispatchers servlet and spring yeah that's a good question does carcass actually uh provide the reactive uh capability built on vertex for networking features as well as reactivate programming so that's why you can see a lot of the vortex logs when you uh in the focus runtime yes so it does use word dot x or what however you want to call it cool okay so let's get to the containerizing part anybody having trouble let us know um you know if you if you finish it uh as always would love to see a lot of thumbs up uh that way we know that you know you're doing doing well and like i said it shouldn't take too long you know like three seconds 30 seconds sorry not three stephano your call should i proceed yeah so containerization is what 10 minutes or so right right oh right so let me see i think i may have picked up the link i think you can of course i think i can afford next yeah it probably not even um 10 minutes we use something called as a jib plug-in okay for containerization so we're using a jib plug plug-in for easy container there are other plug-ins or you can do it manually but i am a strong believer in in a loop and using that you know so so let me show you here um if you just do a uh let me clear the screen if you just do a grip minus i jib okay in palm.xml you will see that you know it we include this container quask container image jib and that takes care of a lot of things for me you know it it essentially allows me to build the application it allows me to push the container uh if i'm using kubernetes it lets you let me uh download it from whatever repository docker hub or query or wherever whatever and it does all of this automatically for me it's a very cool um plugin not necessarily to use with quarkx but you can use it with other um platforms as well so let's look at docker images nothing here right so let's go back and try to generate the image okay so very straightforward the one thing you have to do here is make sure you you do this step which is like you know essentially jib is going to be able to take our secure connect remember that uh you know bundle and and stand it up in the container and put it in the container if you don't do this step then your authentication will fail you can try that you know but in the interest of keeping this flowing i'm gonna run this here i'm only doing a build i'm not doing anything else okay so i'm doing a build let me do a build again all that i do is cut and paste okay but take a moment to kind of read through the instructions right because that kind of tells you a little bit more okay you can see here there's some some kind of like cryptic long unique id right and this is as you may expect basically the docker images so if you if you kind of uh do the docker images you should probably be able to see that you know maybe there's a correlation between the two or maybe there is anyway it doesn't matter but you'll see here you have git part quarkus cassandra how do i run it very straightforward again all that i do is like running any docker image i run this okay so go back here and [Music] run the docker image how does it run exactly the same way there you go quarkx is running now in a container so we containerized it okay very straightforward again same thing um you know you can if you go to 8080 you will be able to see the application so let me click on it okay let's let me run it here no it's not localhost right it's uh this one slash so hopefully this should this should work now that's 8080 let me run this again okay and there it is okay that makes sense all right let's go ahead and do that containerization part i'm gonna skip the next part uh which is really about pushing it to uh um you know to docker okay so i only did the run uh the docker login part i'm just gonna make it optional for now uh because we just don't have the time to that uh do that and also you have to do a docker login and all that uh which i can do but but you know uh but but some of the cool things here that i am not talking to you about maybe i should demonstrate this let me do this anyway and then you know i don't want you to do this step because this is going to take a little bit of time okay but if you feel like you really want to do it that's fine too go ahead and do it okay so so i have to do a docker login okay and let me put in my username and password okay so i'm good to go now login succeeded right you should see the login succeeded okay and then what i'm going to do is here not only am i building but i'm also pushing this okay now i'm pushing it to docker io okay so if i go here let me actually go to docker io okay and i'm gonna log in you can see that you know i have a caucasus cassandra which is updated like two days ago okay and if i push this hopefully you should see the latest one here okay so this is uh what did i do what did i miss here username oh okay so so that's good that okay yeah because i didn't put in my docker username right had forgotten the instructions so you'll have to substitute this with the um with your own username okay so in my case it's rags and s okay so hopefully this should work okay so essentially what it's doing now it's building and essentially pushing it into docker hub you'll you'll probably see that in action here and this is the nice thing about the jib processor if it didn't work it seems like it came through really quickly so i'm not quite sure if you did it oh there it is okay a few seconds ago right so now you can use it in kubernetes you can use it anywhere you want um because now it's available in docker hub you know if you want to use my uh image and stand up your kubernetes cluster you can do that you can just use rags and escort cassandra except that it will connect to my to-do list okay and you can put whatever you want in my to-do list and make it happen uh but right you know you you kind of get the idea and and the so let's see let's see how we are doing with respect to time i will i will do the native also and i yeah what i suggest you do is because we don't have too much time uh we will run this native i want to be sure that all of you are able to run this native uh and then we'll jump straight into minty how about it does it sound like a plan yeah so uh yeah we have we i don't think we have time to do much more so maybe you can just outline what's going to happen and that might be left as an exercise for the homework so so minus p native is all that you need to do okay and and what's gonna happen here is it's gonna build a um i should have skipped the test but that's fine you know um so it takes a little bit of time for the test which really is not required you know so so this is going to take a little bit of time um so i'm going to let it run and if you guys want to do this as well just let it go um and then what we can do is we can um walk through the remaining um slides right and then do the maintaining is that yeah is that good yeah we have so many times yeah i'm gonna let this go this is gonna probably take eight minutes and and you guys can do this as well this is the last step which is i believe uh uh what is it the native part which is a step level yeah okay and this is the coolest part believe me okay because i'll come back to this yeah um in a little bit okay yeah the native images just one thing a quick thing uh maybe rocks mentioned that uh the the manifest for running kubernetes is generated for you so you can just use that and you will be ready to deploy in kubernetes that's a partial answer to a question by rodrigo who asks us to show the kubernetes deployment uh unfortunately there will be probably no time for that but i don't know rux what do you think please they can maybe reach us on on discord if you run into other right so let me let me show that here okay and actually that's a great uh point okay so i can i can definitely show that you can open the yaml just to show that it is a fully fledged deployment right that's exactly what i'm doing here right okay so the last part in 10 is to be able to open the ammo okay so i'm going to go ahead and open the ml which already got generated right okay and here's the ammo right so essentially it does everything automatically for you okay so so it put the um cassandra okay uh the only part that it's missing is my name here and that is missing because i didn't do that um you know the uh build right so if you do the build is equal to true it'll it'll it'll work okay um so so i think i i did not do that but but i'll show that in action in a little bit but it will put everything and all that you need to do to stand this up is uh you know essentially uh so let me let me actually do that and and see if that works so which is uh well let me go back here push to docker hub instead of push what i'm going to do is i'm just going to do this okay and i'm not going to clean because i don't want the other one to fail okay so so i kind of take some shortcuts here right now yeah in the meantime there is also a question about okay if you want to do that and sorry yeah yeah sorry go ahead yeah keep talking yeah sorry this there is just a question about what kubernetes cluster uh should you use for deployment for the homework i think drugs correct me if i'm wrong i think any any kubernetes cluster should do so whether it's a local kind or uh [Music] play with kubernetes probably also should go this playground in the cloud or any kubernetes cluster should be able to deploy it and i think it's rather simple uh manifest so probably there there are no version problems you know this probably any version of kubernetes is relatively modern should work it should it should yeah in theory it should and i have tried it on on a lot of uh these as well of some reason i'm i'm not getting the vagueness but i'll worry about that later okay um so so uh yeah it should really be doing the git part but uh it should actually prefix it with my name uh maybe there's a bug that i need to fix but you know i know i've seen this before so actually what i can do is bring up my my visual studio this is my local um and and what you can see here is essentially the same okay um and uh target right and communities and communities at ammo okay so you'll see here it should have something like this rags and s okay so um you know so that the entire image is there okay and pretty straightforward you know you can even kind of figure that out um but let me go back to my guitar i think mini cube kind whatever provides a local kubernetes cluster should be good to go yeah any anything it doesn't really matter yeah right yeah yeah you can use any kubernetes cluster like a mini cube or any aks eks just to make sure to log in that specific namespace before you run the kubernetes emo file and also quarkx provide the openshift processor the s5 processor as well which means you don't need to use user-run cube ctl with the yeah file because it maybe clean package command line automatically trigger uh the deployment to openshift cluster like even kubernetes cluster as well okay so there's pretty much freedom here to choose your own yep that's true so let me see if i have something running already uh some sometimes i do uh so let me show this uh so i'm using doc desktop here okay and uh if i look at parts um okay so i don't know what's going on so let's not worry up too much about that right now okay so cube context mini q oh maybe i'm not running my local uh yeah i i'm not running my uh docker desktop because you know i have so many other windows running so you you you get the idea though um all right we can get more leaders on the kubernetes part if you reach us later on discord let me drop the link again just so you might join so the the part that i really wanted to show was the uh the native image so if you want to run this native image it's very straightforward all that you're going to do is you're going to say target right and then you'll see here it has generated something called as a quarkus astra demo runner right and you want to run this you just say astra 0.1 runner right and this is running goodbye jvm jvm is gone it's running as a local image which is really really really cool right you can see already that it was so fast to start right um and and you know you can package this this up in a docker container as well if you want and it will be so fast you know again table con created is true and if i go back to my uh hit part again you'll see you know the application is up and running okay so so hopefully that kind of gave a complete idea if anybody finished uh the native packaging as well um you know just put a thumbs up there looks like ryom rastogy finished it so give it two minutes and then we'll do the monty what do you want to do yeah yeah probably we it's almost it's almost time so we should better start with the mentee in one or two minutes okay so please gather up you know don't look at the at the screen but look at your device or wherever you're running mentee because there is a lag and and let me give you a heads up that the first question is you can answer anything okay and and it's fine so please again you know jump back into mentee yes okay the first question is is like a simple simple question just uh you can answer anything okay so i i you know believe me it will work pick your choice uh but but just so that you're you're faster let's just make sure everyone is connecting through mentee i see people there so it's the same uh it's the same connection that you should probably have kept open from earlier let me paste the link again the code in the chat and i also have to say there are a few unanswered questions so but we are pretty low on time so we we kindly suggest you join us on discord and there will be time to go asynchronously over all of your unanswered questions about kubernetes and the relation between the secure bundle and the and the user id user uh secret and all that but now let's play the game because there are some prizes okay because that's what you're waiting for i think we can go all right okay so how many are connected i see more and more yes so i think we can start there are five or six questions if if i'm not mistaken and now let me remind you that you don't you not only have to answer correct but you have to answer fast because faster equal more point more points and question zero you can answer anything so that you can you can flex your muscle okay so go ahead and do it okay so get ready and please look at your phone because if you look if you watch youtube there there is a few seconds delay and that would penalize you so please look at your phone answer looking at your phone oh this is wrong oh this is right yeah okay so what these so i just put it in i just put it in just for fun yeah i think i think everything is cool right you know that yeah that answer three two one zero what is a good feature of today's workshop and the answers are astra that's pretty cool quarkus it's very cool kit pod gitpod is cool all of them yeah this was a funny question because every answer was accepted as valid so that's valid i think you can press uh forward arrow to get to the leader leaderboard and see despite the fact that all of you got it right uh yeah you know it's really fast and the difference is very negligible so hopefully you'll pick up okay but i'm sure we have the fastest and he's been also very active in the chat so yeah we appreciate that you ask a lot of questions and let's move on let's move on next question this is a real question so pay attention exactly yeah and don't look at the screen just look at my teeth yeah so so fast oops yeah sorry answer fast yeah i'm going to be back okay i think i may screw this up i may have i think you can still go to question number two okay question two okay so fast back again okay so all right let's keep that yeah let's move to question number three uh not clear what happened yeah exactly what happened there question three press enter to start countdown that should be it okay which part did the debugger use is it 80 is it 3 000 is it 5 0 0 5 or 9 000 seems like it could be any of them right yeah so let's see time is up and the right answer is 5 0 0 5 yeah yes very good so let's see all right moving on you should be bored yeah i'm sure there'll be some changes here i'm thinking probably well it's nice to see that you all paid attention most of you faster keeps the position whoa tie break with georgie fastest both of them great i'm sure george and jean-pierre i don't think i've seen him you know fastest two people you know sometimes it's split a millisecond answer yeah all right moving on let's question four i'm going to hit enter and so fast to get more products uh-huh what was the target used for hot reloading was it clean was quarkus calling them was it packaged was it hard to reload answers are coming and time is almost up so and the right answer was quarkus dev exactly it seems like we you did a great job explaining things because almost everyone gets the right answer that's good i did a bad job of kind of picking the questions right i need to make it a little a little more challenging maybe next time all right but but i think let's see if the leaderboard has changed if the leaderboard hasn't changed i need to do it no but i think our attendees have been doing a great job of following along and now it's time to relax with a nice game so yes great and poncho is still leading yeah and casually jumps to the second position uh remind that the first three position will get a price and what a price this time special prize so very cool yeah should i proceed yeah so anshul kaya and sarah version five or seven so we have there's still time to change everything in the leaderboard completely change the leaderboard exactly and so fast and do it right uh-huh [Music] yeah this is a good question and i remember daniel pointing that out in particular it's a clever way to to work with the quercus metrics nice and it is time's up let's see oh that was a tricky one oh yeah so yeah yeah that was tricky and then so i guess we didn't talk too much about this but but i i'm sure you saw that and and you know it was in the readme as well um it it basically takes you to slash q slash dev yeah and that's where you know you can get the quadcus related metrics um so nobody got the slash all but but you know obviously uh the metrics was a little confusing i guess right but let's see let's see wow quite a few who got it right whoa what a thing now i shall never jump to second and third position and angel still maintains the lead awesome one show let's see if you can hold off for the next two more questions right we are almost there almost question six which is one before the last what container related maven plug-in did we use in the workshop chip pom maven or java c and time is up okay this was confusing too maybe but i did talk about this i talked about the jib plug-in and how easy does it make to um you know to containerize yeah uh it's not the only plugin but that's the one we used in the workshop okay yeah so chip jib is the correct answer let's see the leaderboard how we're shaping up and anshul doesn't get anything and he's still leading by a lot so i think it's it's more a race to the second and third position by now because there's one more question left exactly and if function gets it wrong he probably won't make it but but if he gets it right i think he's good yeah but uh kaja and ryan uh definitely watch out because other people are very close to you okay oh yeah so do we do we explain in a little bit about what you do um you know to get the well let's finish let's finish let's finish and then i'll i'll just give a very short okay instruction answer fast answer right answer correct yes i don't think we talk too much about this but you should have an idea of what vm yeah requires you mentioned that for sure yes a few times also at that so it should be possible to pick the right answer so what is required to generate the native image great we got quite a few and there we go yes very good your lvm is correct um to be able to do native images uh java vm you know the usual uh but growl vm you are able to generate the native image um but you know any other kind of packaging you'll find [Music] okay so anshul niraj and beyond so rox please do not go away from the screen yes because now uh now it's time for the instructions congratulations to everyone but in particular anshul niraj and vyom please take a screenshot of your winning screen or on your phone take a screenshot of your winning leaderboard and i just posted in the in the chat in the youtube chat and maybe i'll also post that in just for to be sure also on discord uh instructions so basically what you have to do is please take a screenshot of your winning screen send it to this email you see jack fryer datastax.com and you should be giving us name address phone number and also since it's a jacket size and whether you want the woman or man model and if you mention quarkus in the in the in the subject you make it easier for us but uh rux if you want to to go back to the slides we also have a slide with these instructions so it stays in the recording maybe okay so you can always go back and and look at this so unsure near edge and view hopefully hopefully you're able to get the screenshot but i'm going to move ahead with the slides we just have a few left yeah and we should because we should have a slide with exactly these instructions so yes obviously it's about shipping something so we need uh your physical postal address and a few others so you can sorry so you can try this out yourself you know i'm just going to leave this up here one of the homeworks goes to this caucus um another example and you'll see that actually it's here um basically what i want you to do in a call for action here is to go try it out yourself um you know this workshop is right here workshop intro quarkus cassandra but there is also the uh data stacks provided um you know the driver and all that right if you go to stacks like github.com quarkus there is a quick start example uh so the homework will kind of you know talk to you about that as well um i know that you know danielle you wanted to talk about this and and you know i know it's be it's a little bit longer than what we anticipated about 11 minutes longer but but hopefully you are still here and and you know please go ahead and talk about this or did we lose daniel so you know basically he created a d-zone uh reference card that you can you can uh take a look at this um the best way to get started is with the um you know with with the uh url link at the bottom but but the point here is that you know you can use it in a variety of different contexts um uh you know forecasts not necessarily just with uh you know native packaging with communities or whatever but but in different contexts as well um i know danielle i really want to thank him uh i i know he had a meeting coming up i think after this so um you know that's probably the reason why he's not here but but he'll be back again tomorrow uh you know tell your friends tell your relatives tell everybody you know to attend because daniel is is great yeah there is another point another very important point and it is the voucher so i can't seem to find right now but yeah i'll find that it's it's coming out it's in the slides right feedback okay because it has been asking your feedback yeah your feedback is really important uh you know you know how to reach us um again you know you can go to this link for a workshop okay we played minty already so you know we can skip that again if you want to take a note of this you can do that as well i probably need to move this slides probably properly and and stefano you want to talk about this free certification watcher yeah very very briefly okay i just posted the important link in the chat and it you also see that in on screen so as we said at the beginning there are certification programs to get cert apache cassandra certified developer administrator and there is also a kait sandra certification we offer training for free on academydatastax.com but taking the exam in principle uh has a cost but today we are giving out for free the vouchers valid for to take the exam twice within three months i think so please go to this link and you will be filling a form and you will in a matter of days at most one week you will get a voucher to take the exam for free so i hope this answers uh the questions i'm seeing in in the in the chat and we encourage you to to use this chance because taking a certification voucher so getting cassandra certified is really a boost to your career um yeah that's it so there are also questions about when and what are the next workshops and uh maybe the best answer would be just to paste another important link in the youtube chat because we run at least a couple of workshops per week even more sometimes and if you go to this website datasucks.com workshops you will be able to keep an eye on what's coming next the credit how long is it the credit what do you mean by credit raj i think i think probably the question is uh how long is the voucher value yeah and in that case the answer is uh you have three months before it expires three months to get prepared and take the exam obviously you still have to get to to learn about cassandra and it's probably taking some weeks to complete i'm sure no you the two things are unrelated so on totally unrelated channels you fill the voucher form and get your voucher and independently you submit your homework we would like you to submit the homework within one week from now just uh as a suggestion so we can process them more or less all together and uh grading your homework is a manual process so don't be surprised if it if you don't get back if you don't hear from from us uh immediately because it's a manual process so we go through submissions one by one yeah i think that's it so this is the slide is about the workshops we run every week and please go to the website i gave you and you will see what's coming next we have cool contents not only on cassandra but on development and related technologies and we would we invite you to join us on discord where the discussion can go well beyond the end of this life which is approaching because we are almost there we are actually 15 minutes beyond the mark so yeah yeah i hope so thank you thank you very much uh i particularly want to thank stefano for hosting this workshop we had a little bit of technical difficulties but we were able to kind of walk uh you know kind of solve them uh i myself you know was using mentee the first time so so there were a little bit of hiccups but but uh i think i think overall we've been great we've been great yes yes i think we did a great job and uh you know time to pat ourselves on the back but but really i want to thank you the audience you know without you um you know there is no workshop right so um yeah i learned a lot myself uh you know especially about kind of setting up um you know the debugging and all that which is which is one of the great things about all of these workshops is to just level up the skills whether you are the um you know the workshop attendee or whether you are delivering the workshops so i think we've achieved that and and uh yeah i want to thank you all um and hopefully see you soon on some part of the world something yeah and a special thanks to daniel who was kind enough to join us today for this presentation and unfortunately since we've been running late he had to leave uh 15 minutes ago but thank you daniel anyway for the precious uh yeah thank you daniel and thank you red hat you know for helping helping us out with this yeah so i think that's it and uh yeah we hope to see you guys all of you next time at our next workshop so goodbye and don't forget to subscribe to our channel on youtube if you didn't already so with that see you next time bye bye thank you and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she could multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats you",
