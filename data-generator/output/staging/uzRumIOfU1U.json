    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed in building large-scale distributed systems hey welcome to Oh God did it already Minnesota rolls welcome to the distributed data show I'm your host Jim Hatcher here with Adrian hall yeah what do you want to fight about Adrian well what I'd really like to talk about is I want to ask you some questions about things because I have a lot of informational gaps in my graph knowledge so you have some things that you're interested in around graph data and graph data storage yeah so tell me about some of these things I'm curious well yeah so I've been I've been working with customers Lalli projects using graph yeah one of the areas that really kind of getting passionate about excited about this graph frames okay and it's a graph frame like fr AME yeah okay with an S graph frames oh poor old house oh that makes sense you're dealing with more than one yeah and it's kind of this like intersection of four or five kind of big concepts which I think is what's pretty interesting about it mm-hmm but it's you know like in an Apache spark they're the concept that it's data frame okay yes this is really they also think of graphic spark spark as a particle graphics right and graphics is there's all these libraries that lets you run graph algorithms against distributed data sources that are better built dissolve there's a graph schema okay and so you know as spark is gonna move from our TVs to data frames okay the the graph project is going from graph X to graph frames Quechan so it's a way to run the distributed algorithms your data so it's an analytic solution and so you know so there's open source graph frames and then so I say you said said it's an analytic solution so is it in the analytics part of the product also in addition to being and graph it is you know we talked about DSC analytics and what that is is integration with apache spark and I often find it that's like a misnomer to me because it's because of spark you can certainly do analytics with it but I think is at a bigger level it's a distributed execution framework right so I mean you can you can run you know aggregation queries and things like that with a between also you know dude ingest of data an ETL and so you know people graph frames is a really powerful thing and but people are using it for analytical reasons right but you can also use it for just much more utilitarian things like I want to ingest data into my graph like the ETL part of its you have you seen a lot of people using it for just like straight et oh we do yeah interesting you have a couple you have a couple of choices in the DSC graph world for ingest you can just write a straight driver program or you can use graph loader but but what you know but with the great thing my graph frames is that it runs on spark so it's innately parallelizable yeah and so you know if you if you have like a you're pulling the data in from text files or something as long as you put those on a distributed file system like the SMS you can use graph frames to say go read that data and now I want to take that I want to save it take this data save it as vertices take this data save it as edges oh I got you and then you you're ready to go from it it's like that's where we're paralyzed you know data ingest that out of the box nice yeah so what are some of the use cases that you've been using this for like within companies what are they so they're doing their eto they're pulling all the data in what is what is it around like what is the domain space well yeah so you know a common thing we see is for that initial data load in the graph we also see like maybe you've loaded data into your graph and you decide we want to change the scheme a little bit so yeah we're gonna rearrange things and we need to do a migration from our existing schema to the new one yeah so you can use it for that so and you like let's say and I think we've talked about in the past like fraud yeah so that's that's an interest of yours as far as domain space right so like how is how is graph being used to I don't know help five fraudulent find fraudulent activities and you know be able to take action on that yeah so you know I think one of the great capabilities the DAC graph is is its scalability and and how can support graph and an OLTP low latency kind of model okay yeah so so if you know if people are you know have some anti-fraud system where they're looking at transactions or looking at insurance claims or whatever it is trying to run you know algorithms against us to see yeah I need to do some quick queries I got you know somebody you know our website doing a detection so so we're you know you can use graph on that side then you can say hey I'm also gonna set this analytics data center and you know as people are writing data into the oil TP system it's also getting replicated across to the analytics system we get we can say hey you know because because I have the data and graph and there's all these really interesting graph algorithms I can do against it all of a sudden I can look at connected components I can look at you know PageRank algorithms I can think yeah I can be running these batch analytics jobs in the background and I could store store that information in to be analytic side of my cluster which because of the awesome DC replication story you know gets pushed into that LTP side of things all right all of sudden those things become available to my real-time system that I yeah I could start taking advantage of those data points so we're seems to like that you certainly see it fraud you see it in personalization and recommendation you know we talked about the fact that that graphs great for for doing personalization but you know a lot of customers aren't able to do that in real time where I'm logging on to the website you know I want to go find recommendations for products or things I bought before so that's that's kind of like even just getting around the customer 360 type of view where you have a single view into whatever disparate systems or disparate whatever the customer data stored in you can kind of map and get into that and know that you have that available information yeah right graphs of you know really good at creating those relationships and saying how can we get value of how how things are related yeah and then DAC can as decide where and we can give that to you in a scalable high concurrency low latency kind of way but we also lets you run you know the analytics against it in to do things that take longer to run and then store those things and make them available great though with the key ways so you know having the two things play together it's powerful yeah one of the one of the things I've always wanted to to see and this is just like a little pet project of mine that came up a while ago you have customer data but then like in some of these companies like for instance well that Bank of America's prime example they have almost two hundred thousand employees and I always I'm curious like what is the crossover right because you know you go back to the old story if well Ford started paying their employees enough that they could go and buy a Ford car right so where does the employee and customer start to become the same right and I've always found that super interesting because you can kind of see where a company ship through various demographics in that regard and just all sorts of other correlative stuff yeah you hear lots of people talking about you know hey you know enterprise company how did how did this customer 360 project come about right and you'll hear these anecdotal things or it's like well so-and-so called up and got a bad experience and it turns out they're they're on the board oh right their wife is on the board yeah or you know something like that where people just didn't realize the connections they didn't realize how things were really yeah and all of a sudden it you know it becomes an important thing right hey are we doing this to all of our customers when it's that exact all of a sudden and you're like wait they're not actually an outlier right but they just experienced it so let's figure out why we don't know that yeah no that's that's that's really interesting to kind of trace back through those things I've done a fair amount of work myself doing that with and without graph stores just like some standard OLTP database reporting stuff and it's it's an incredibly useful capability to have and I've always found like when I was doing that with a relational database just standard reporting it's pretty difficult but as you move and shift into something where you have graph capabilities and the ability to kind of rate or determine the correlations and relationships instead of just having one hard type it becomes much more useful and you can see the different layers and and kind of work textures almost of these relationships that where some are not as strong as other correlations so what a lot of good information and capabilities there it's a fun space to be in oh yeah cool well thanks for coming in and teaching me some stuff and telling me where we're going with this I'm always intrigued to learn more about graph and I'm looking forward to doing more work with it here in the future and on that note thanks for watching I'm Adrian and this is have a great day and we'll have more coming to you so subscribe click on the buttons have a great one thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data
