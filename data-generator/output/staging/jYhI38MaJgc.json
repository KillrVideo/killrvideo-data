    "text": "are you looking to query your structured data through cql rather than Vector search well I have a couple good tips for you they use natural language processing it's a process called NLP to cql essentially natural language processing to cql helps convert natural language to cql queries that you can then run in any database such as astb this is important because it allows for a far higher relevancy for your users because you're able to use actual cql statements rather than just doing standard Vector search and this is important because it allows your users to interact with your database through natural language rather than having to come up with the cql statements on their this allows for your app to have a huge Competitive Edge over 90% of the others and most importantly ASB supports NLP to cql so if you want to give it a try use the notebook in the link below",
