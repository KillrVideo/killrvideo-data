[Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh yeah there's some delay between my uh my move in my head and the screen some light Hello Alex howdy Kim is that uh is that morning for you yes uh it's 10 am here in Indonesia and I believe you are at down five in the morning wow right it's 5 PM but there is nothing I wouldn't do for a good Cassandra day yep thank you for being here for Indonesian developers and all the community here we're really excited to have Cassandra here in Indonesia so I think you can start okay okay so let's check oh we already okay so okay yeah YouTube channel um okay check wait um wow yeah um [Music] uh oh yeah I'm here with uh with Alex uh from data Stacks Hello Alex hello hello everyone hello so he based on Germany but when he speaks Russians and it's it's good to have him and also with Stefano later uh the two guys will uh bring the presentation most of the presentation uh today uh they are I can assure you they are very expert on that uh Cassandra thank you what work they work at data Stacks okay okay um uh down on Facebook open source database um [Music] uh Pandora OAS um Azure gcp Alibaba you name it or even on premise hybrid okay um Netflix Cassandra um uh [Music] some slide from Netflix engineer uh Finance uh Cassandra is into the single cluster clusters right I would also add here uh he is a cloud database architect in Netflix and uh one of the biggest Cassandra developers my point is uh what Apple Netflix Instagram and other companies they are not only using Cassandra but they are also developing Cassandra and they did incredible effort to release recently uh the released version four so that's incredible how many biggest companies work together to develop the database even then their competitors in real life they still work together on Cassandra I like it that's the beauty of Open Source yeah right yeah many companies many developers contribute to a technology that we may have been benefits to uh all of us actually yeah okay then okay that is Cassandra Alexa is [Music] life uh that is optimal languages Cassandra that is what application would you want to make and Stefano will present about the uh one example of how to make application using Cassandra then then highlights here foreign [Music] lagi attacks foreign dbis Japanese Cassandra just like uh Alex mentioned before yeah many many developers many companies many uh a musician contributes or to Apache Cassandra yeah and okay Alex uh uh you want to introduce yourself here Alex in your screen uh yes uh sure uh so uh first first of all I speak English Russian German I learn Italian but I don't yet speak bahasan so don't worry yeah never mind never mind yeah uh so horrible Workshop I will try to do it simple and useful for you as possible but uh Cassandra fundamentals and Cassandra data modeling will be held in English with a strong support of our bahasan speaking France so diki our partners from SPS and some more people will support you in the chat and we'll answer your questions in the chat about myself I am developer Advocate at data stacks for the last years I working to deliver uh best of World Knowledge do a best of the world Engineers like you and we will today learn the fundamentals of very powerful but not so simple database as Apache Cassandra and uh I would uh say many many thanks to Stefano latini and Dicky for the people who work so too so much to help us deliver this Cassandra de Indonesia that's incredible a day for me and that's just exciting what's the collaboration was done Behind These to make it happen so thank you so much dickin and you're welcome yep I uh did we uh do you have some more slides yeah yes okay so let's proceed okay so okay after this yeah this is uh only a notes.com Indonesia yes foreign foreign foreign [Music] uh okay so that's it from me Alex yeah enjoy the day yeah enjoy the day and I hope this day will bring many benefits to here community and developers in Indonesia yes yes so uh we will get back in one minute uh to start first Cassandra fundamentals Workshop that's let's make this day great okay foreign [Music] [Music] I'm very good I'm happy to be here and I'm happy what that's in our Cassandra day last one was too many months ago we have to do it more yeah yeah we had a summer stop but we are back to rock so hi everyone welcome it's very great to see so many people and uh yeah one yeah as you said Alex Cassandra days are one of the best things that we do because they are fully open source and it's a good occasion to reach many interested people and make Cassandra known because it's great and I think Alex is going to explain to you how great that can be yeah and I I hope you will help me yeah and yeah I will sure and in particular I think we have someone in the chat uh Luke Manuel and maybe Dicky and maybe uh also at SBS yep yeah people from SBS who will help you guys you with um questions with anything especially when it comes to language support so we will be speaking English but no problem if you want to to to express yourselves in bazen yep yeah you good and we have a question from Tommy hendravan uh what's the best case to use Cassandra we have a special slide on that so don't rush you will see it very soon and that's a good time for us to start the soundtrack we have a lot of things to cover today so let's go Apache Cassandra is a nosql distributed decentralized database and it's used by the biggest and Most Known World Companies over the world for the following features what makes this really incredible database it's at first absolutely ready to work with a big data and then I say big data I mean like huge tremendous amounts of data for example Apple handles with a with help of Cassandra hundreds petabytes of information Cassandra provides highest possible availability deep replication and multi-dated Center deployments using multi-cloud for example you can try to reach even up to 100 percent uptime either even under some very bad circumstances like a disaster or something like that so it's a highest possible availability on the database Market geographical distribution then your company is globally geographically distributed and you have clients in Australia Asia Europe and United States for example you want to keep your data as close to your clients as possible so we will always have a great response time then that's getting very important when read and write performance of course that's very important for us to for the database to be fast even then it handles again petabytes and petabytes of data and finally Apache Cassandra is managed by Apache software Foundation non-commercial non-profit open source software organization which makes the decisions about Cassandra so it's vendor independent doesn't belong to any commercial company and its open source software of course so if you want to participate in development of such a database you can do it because it's open source so Cassandra is used by many companies you know technically you are already using Cassandra even if you don't know it but if you have iPhone or MacBook you use Cassandra if you watch Netflix you use Cassandra if you send or watch photos on Instagram you use Cassandra and so on and so forth so whatever primary features people pick Cassandra first it's distributed so it's um running it can be launched in multiple data centers over the world it's highly scalable and highly responsive it's also replicated so your data is stored not on a single machine but on the multiple machines on multiple data centers so it's highly available and finally it's masterless decentralizer so there is no single point of failure with our databases those follow Master Slave or primary secondary server architecture this master server or primary server is always a single point of failure if it if it's out you cannot write to a database anymore Cassandra is decentralized that means that there is no master node and every node is able to process every request when we speak about scaling scaling is highly important for your database maybe in the beginning you don't have too much workload you don't have too many queries to serve and you don't need to have like powerful database served by the cluster of thousands and thousands CPUs so how do we scale database normally when we need more Firepower when we need higher performance typical approach is to have vertical scalability so that's a normal way for the databases to scale up a way of vertical scaling what means vertical scaling it means what basically you replace your previous machine previous server with a more performant one and which has more memory more CPU cores and so on and so forth and then you just move your database to its new server and it's great but it has some problems vertical scalability although it's easier to get it's also getting extremely expensive very soon because a powerful database servers they are also very costly and there is still problem of single point of failure as POF what then your server is down doesn't matter if it's expensive or not or if you have no internet connection with the server you cannot reach it there is another way to scale distributed systems known as horizontal scalability horizontal scalability means what we do not replace one server with another but that means what we add more servers to the cluster so that gives us some benefits first of all it's normally cheaper to reach the same performance level as we would have with a single highly performant server with multiple commodity Hardware servers second it removes single point of failure because now my data is spreaded over multiple machines and there is no single point of failure in case one is out data is replicated to others of course it's logistically harder but good news with Cassandra Cassandra manages these Logistics complexity which is very helpful for us because we just want to store our data we don't want to lose it and we prefer to spend as less time administering database as possible Cassandra skills horizontally and Cassandra has linear growth of performance and linear growth of workload Cassandra skills horizontally okay that means add more servers but what does that mean linear Global Groove exactly the point is our databases then you add more nodes into the clusters of our database and Management Systems performance doesn't grow linearly every next note introduce it to a cluster every next server may bring some overhead and as a result the more servers you add the less performance you get in the end with Cassandra which scales linearly it's different it means what if you want to have to double performance of your cluster doesn't matter if we speak of operations per second or if we speak about volume so available disk to store your data uh you basically just have to double the number of nodes and if our first cluster or if our First Data Center has three servers with overall performance of 100 000 transactions per second when we just add three more and we will have 200 000 transactions per second and so on there is a great research done by Netflix and publish it in their Netflix blog they benchmarked Cassandra scale ability on Amazon web services over a million writes per second going from like 45 servers and scaling Cassandra cluster up to 300 something um servers so quite a lot and take a look at this nice smooth uh line nice straight line the more servers we add the higher performance they have and there is nothing like these lines decreasing in the end that's famous Cassandra linear scaling by the way Netflix tag block is a great thing if you are not yet subscribed I believe you should because for me it's a great place to learn something new on how Netflix solves their technical problems for me it's always incredible reading so I do recommend you as well ah how does it work so all the great of the Cassandra features how does that work first thing data is distributed take a look here we have a cluster of a single data center of seven servers we call Cassandra server usually a node just traditionally and on the right side we have a table a simple table of country City and population count basically how many people there are per City per country how uh we we normally store these data on relational database for example each server is stores the complete stable and there is normally one master server what you can store data in and read replicas what you can read data from but you cannot write on read replicas because they are read-only replicas of course Cassandra Works differently instead of storing a copy of this table on each server Cassandra distributes datum over multiple servers so you see there are only parts of this table on each server here you may ask why why does it happen why does Cassandra is doing like that answer is answer was on the first slide Cassandra is Big Data reading and there are many definitions of what is Big Data but I prefer the simple definition big data is the data which doesn't fit to a single server uh S8 Apple handles hundreds petabytes of data with Cassandra can you imagine copying hundreds petabytes per server it makes no sense there is no server able to survive it and be performant at the same time yes with network attached storages or things like that you can have such capacity but will the but can you get the answer within single digit milliseconds no with Cassandra you can because Cassandra distributes data over multiple servers that gives us also this ability to scale indefinitely because when we just have more data we we have to put it on the bigger amount of servers we put more servers into the cluster and data will be redistributed over new servers as well so okay data is distributed but it's called partitioning by the way but how exactly data is partitioned take a look at this table again you see how country column is Market specially partition key what does that mean when we create a table we have to assign a partition key this partition key defines how data will be spreaded into partitions so take a look we have these country values Australia Canada Canada Deutschland Germany so this is a partition key value of this column is hashed by a partitioner with more more free hashing algorithm into n integer so we see here 59 12 45 45 uh why because we need these they are known as tokens basically hashed value of Australia is let's say 59 and those are tokens I would have to admit what actually normally tokens are not like 59 or 12. they are integers but much much much much bigger longer because again we may need a lot of partitions but anyway as a result every row has a token assigned to it in this case for the demonstration purposes we use a simple integers so it will be 59 12 and 45. now take a look at very important point every server you have is responsible for the range of tokens for example in this case we have four servers and each of the servers were for um responsible for the range of tokens for example this one from 1 to 25 this one from 26 to 50 51 to 75 and so on and now you can guess why do we need integers here of course rows with the token 59 will go to this server we've token 12 will go to this server and Rose with uh from token 45 we'll go to this server and this server for the moment stays without any information which is completely fine we will keep it busy later so Cassandra nodes are responsible for token ranges and rows if a token go to a proper node and they together build a partition partition we will speak a lot about it today partition is a group of rows store it together what they because they share partition key value now how Cassandra cluster scales out or scales in Imagine on many businesses sometimes you have black Fridays you have I don't know uh New Year sales or so on so when you have a lot of customers who want to buy a lot from your company and many people visiting your website using your application and so on and so forth during this time you need to have a lot of servers and then there are times when people are busy in vacations people don't visit your website don't use your application because there is I don't know whatever time is um not really for them to buy something so every every business has sometimes when it's in high demand and in low demand for example and for big companies again like Netflix it costs literally hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour to run huge infrastructure that's why Netflix prefers to keep very Dynamic infrastructure if they need more nodes way if they need more computational power they will put more servers in the cluster but for example when they release a new episode or new um yeah new episode new season of games of thrones or sometimes there is everything quiet and they don't need such many notes how that works take a look now every server in my cluster is responsible for the range of 25 tokens there are actually not from 0 to 100 again there are much bigger ranges but it should work well then I introduce a door node number five then Cassandra will automatically recalculate the token ranges and we will see what this server is responsible for token ranges from 1 to 20 this one respond from 21 to 40 41 to 60 61 to 80 81 to 100 so Cassandra cluster will recalculate a distribution of the token ranges over servers and bring some responsibility bring some data to store for the server number five quite opposite if you don't need such a high uh Firepower so a such uh high computational power on your cluster you can decommission this node take it down say it took a Sandra cluster okay I don't need that anymore and therefore again Cassandra cluster will recalculate um token ranges and this one will be responsible 1 to 33 this one will be responsible 34 to 66 and this one will be responsible 67 to 100. and data will be shuffled over a cluster to keep it all available that's incredible because this partitioning is fully automated and you don't have to think or manage it anyhow you just have to design your data model right I I'm speaking about that because well I've worked in my life with very many different databases and something similar to Cassandra's partitioning in relational database World known as sharding and it's not even close in from the any point of view you have to do a lot of manual work to make your charging work and in case you change something if you want to introduce more servers you again have to do a lot of manual work not with Cassandra thank you Cassandra so but that's not enough now with distribution of the data we can scale our cluster linearly but that's not only wet we still need to have high availability and it's done with data replication replication means what are your data is stored not on a single server but the same exact date is stored on multiple servers take a look there is a thing in Cassandra known as replication Factor replication factor means what every row is stored on as many different nodes as specified in replication Factor so in this case I have replication factor three it means what my uh rows for Canada or better to say partition it's important will be stored on three different servers that's what replication Factor 3 means how it works then my server when any of the servers because any of the service is able to process any query any request uh receives data for Australia let's say a server number 17 Galaxy query it is this server is not responsible for this piece of data data is distributed and replicated but this particular server is not responsible for this data what will it do it it becomes so-called query coordinator query coordinator's job is to Define which servers are responsible for this data and deliver this information to them about a change for example you added some new data you added a new city or change at something because there are some new citizens in Sydney for example so that's what query coordinator does it calculates proper servers and dispatch this information to them by the way it's very important to understand but there is no designated um query coordinator but every server with godspec query becomes query coordinator so if it would be a server 50 it would be server 15. as a query coordinator and as a result all of our replica servers replica because they bear bear this information [Music] um they will get this data now what happens if one of the servers is on fire literally or not so literally but that doesn't matter anyway it cannot store your data power outage network issues schedule it update whatever what happens then that's interesting Cassandra has very many layers of self-defense from cross-node inconsistency and that's the first layer of Defense it's called hinted handoff then query coordinator sees what one of the notes is not available so This Server can film it I got your data This Server confirm it I got your data and this server is quiet when query coordinator will hint will store the hint on disk and as soon as this server recovers query coordinator or query coordinators if if there could have been many operations during this time which this node was not available they will dispatch hint that he we will dispatch hints again fully automatically and with servers with server recovers and it becomes into a consistent State fully automatically and you don't have to think of that you don't have to do any manual operations that's cluster job and cluster is very good in doing that so that's just incredible it's called itself healing then a cluster recovers itself from a failed State into the good state and that's amazing and while we are having all of that that's important to understand what even when for one note is failed our data is still stored and available on our replica so we can keep working with it and the single server outage is not a reason for us to panic because we still have no downtime that's incredible High availability as it is so and uh together with decentralization distribution and replication Cassandra helps us to build a globally Geographic distributed systems for example you can have multiple data centers in multiple regions but working together and this is a single cluster so that's not like multiple clusters that's one single cluster which is a built of multiple data centers across the world um and it's very easy with Cassandra again that's a native behavior for example with our databases if you want to build multi-data Center active active then it's a big problem and obviously with Cassandra it's a native Behavior so it was created to handle this kind of workloads and finally as I said before Cassandra is platform agnostic and Cloud agnostic so you can run Cassandra cluster on Microsoft Azure Cloud Amazon web services Google Cloud platform Entre your own on-premises data center simultaneously and it will be a single cluster working together so this one may be on Azure and this one may be on AWS AWS is cheaper in the United States than in Europe for example and you can completely go for it reaching multi-cloud or hybrid Cloud as it fits your strategy how did how a data replication Works in multi-data Center deployments so take a look first that's important to understand what we can specify different replication factor for different data centers in this particular example we have replication Factor free in each data center but it can be different so I can say what in this data center I need replication Factor 5 which is a rare case but sometimes we may need it and I can have replication Factor 1 on this data center or even zero and I won't have any copies of these data on the data center East for example if the data of my West clients I don't need to be duplicated in another data center in this example we have replication factor three in each Data Center so how does the multi-data center replication works then Center in the data center West receives v-squery for still our dear Australia then that's when this node becomes a query card in nature right so it will dispatch information [Music] to all the replica nodes of each server asynchronously simultaneously non-blocking and at the same time it will make a call to a data center East to a query which will become a remote query coordinator and as soon as this remote this remote request reaches remote coordinator node it will dispatch information to replica nodes of a data center East boom deliver it so after those two simple steps deities spread it all across flag cluster um what are the main use cases for us what are the main use cases for Cassandra scalability and everything what belongs to scalability if you want to be able to handle higher output or if you need to store a high volume of data and process a lot of heavy rights or process a lot of heavy reads you can do it with Cassandra and there are many use cases when you have really right intensive operations event streaming Internet of Things locks any other write intensive time series but also heavy reads some people say Cassandra is read optimized some people Cassandra is bright optimize it you know what they both are right kinda because Cassandra is optimized for everything that's one of the best benefits people often ask me how does Cassandra compares to mongodb that's a very common question they both belong to nosql world  has of some of its benefits like this no schema or better to see flexible schema and it scales good for a read intensive operations but when you have really a lot of Rights doesn't scale so well with Cassandra decentralization it scales much better for right intense preparations of course uh okay so availability every time when you require a 100 uptime or at least as close as possible to eat with no data loss always on data database that's also very much about Cassandra and there is a lot of kind of information you want to be always on and we use it to think of the banking we use it to have to think of data like required for financial operations but what if I tell you what also Cassandra is heavily used by medical institutions exactly for always on highest possible availability for example one scientifical institution in Germany heavily uses Cassandra not because we require a big data feature at least not yet they don't have too much data but they require highest possible availability because at some point it can be a question of literally life and death so that's a very good case for Cassandra with multi-data Center highest application deployments well distributed as said you can have a global presence with Cassandra with multiple dated centers over the world uh it also may be important for compliance or gdpr purposes so for example in Europe and Germany you have to store data of German clients in your German data center you cannot store it in the United States data center with a replication factor of Cassandra you you can simply specify what you're going to have replication factor in Germany and have zero replication factor in the United States and your data won't be replicated to United States so you follow this gdpr requests I don't know if you have something like that in Indonesia but it's nice to know what this feature is available at least and finally everything what belongs to Modern Cloud native applications so everything what you may want to run on kubernetes everything what you can run as multi-cloud or hybrid Cloud Cassandra didn't support its natively now um by the way um Stefano are there any questions so you would like us to answer by voice well uh there have been a few questions about uh um whether Cassandra is good for multi-dimensional data warehousing Solutions but I answered in the chat so Cassandra itself is more for oltp but it is well Integra integrable it can integrate well with for example spark or Hadoop that was a question the other interesting question while you were about to speak about that was about what happens when you want to add a node so not only is the process of redistributing data basically automated but the nature of the of the hashing it is called consistent hashing that's a detail that makes it uh optimized so it's the way data are hashed and distributed across nodes is such that when you change the number of nodes the minimum amount of data has to move around and that's a you can mathematically prove that the the hashing that Cassandra uses is achieves the mark the minimal amount of data moving around which is good when you have terabytes yeah petabytes so yeah okay uh well that was it and uh yeah I think you can go ahead because there were questions about about consistence as well and I just answered you will soon see it more in detail so go ahead yeah thank you okay so thank you for asking questions uh don't forget and follow Stefan instructions on asking questions at datastags.io city Indonesia questions and answers that sorry by the way yeah you can ask questions in Boston and in English no problem and you can also go there and just upvote other questions just to to give them priority because then we will try to address them all from the start yep and don't forget what uh the best questions uh we'll get uh deserved prizes so you can and you should maybe ask your questions on YouTube but don't forget to go to datastags.io CD Indonesia QA question link is in the chat and ask them so famous Cassandra consistency many people call Cassandra's consistency eventual soon we will see if it's right or you will see so um I believe some of you already understand the problem when you have no replication for your datum and all data store it on a single server like traditional relational databases whatever you ask your database you always get the most up-to-date information but the replication when you store different copies of your data on multiple servers there can be a danger potential danger of inconsistency or cross node inconsistency what does that mean if two servers got the update and one server didn't get the update if you ask those two first they will give you the most up-to-date value but the third server wasn't updated for whatever reason happens and then you just ask it for the data and you get stale data that's known as gross node inconsistency let's take a look at it but before we have to learn something new um there is a thing known as cap theorem or Eric Brewer's theorem and that's very important thing to understand that's not about databases only that's about any distributed system and if you are developing distributed system you need to know how it works you're welcome so cep theorem claims what in the distributed environment in case of failure you can have only two qualities out of those three what does that mean and what are those qualities take a look three qualities of the distributed system we need to understand consistency availability and partition tolerance what does that mean let's start with the simplest one availability availability means what then you ask for something you ask your system for something you ask your database for something you get the answer that's simple uh it's a simple quality if you ask your database all the time for something can you always get the answer despite any issues your database is highly available if you ask database buttons from cases of even minor outages you don't get your answer it means your database is not highly available consistency consistency is the idea I explained it just a minute ago consistency means what whatever server of your distributed system you ask you get the same answer so basically if you have three servers and you ask each of them you will get the same answer every time and if deity date is changed you update some information it will be updated on all of the servers let's call it a consistency in this case and the third quality is partition tolerance now it's the most misunderstood quality because people like misunderstand that all the time I will help you to do it right partition tolerance means ability of your system of your database to survive Network partitioning what is Network partitioning imagine I have five servers and there is a network split so my network I have a network connectivity issues between some servers to our servers for example my servers a b and SIM can reach each hour but cannot reach servers D and E and therefore servers d and e can reach each hour but cannot reach servers a b and c let's call it Network partitioning if your database is not ready for a network partitioning so it's not partition tolerance it may lead to a real disaster then different clients will work with a different part of your clusters but updates cannot be delivered to the second part of your cluster because ABC cannot communicate with d and e and vice versa what does that make in the end some servers some of your clients work with the first segment some of your clients work with a second segment and as a final result you have two completely different copies of data and what's worse in this scenario there is no single chance to recover from the state kinda automatically it may take really a lot of manual work to try to put all the data together Network split it's also known is split brain problem um is a huge disaster because servers will restart and recover consistency may be recovered but split brain is a huge disaster so the cep theorem States what then everything is good and sun is shining and grasses green rainbows and ponies and so on your database will be consistent available and partition tolerance at once but as soon as anything bad happens power outage Network outage whatever outage then you can can pick only between those three qualities you can pick only two and at this point you have to decide if you want to be consistent and available taller and available available and partition tolerant partition tolerant and consistent so there are only three options and by no circumstances you want to create partition tolerance because it's very important it's a worst kind of a possible outcomes possible problems with that so technically we can decide between availability and partition tolerance overall known as AP and we have to decide between consistency and partition tolerance known as CP so you have to stay with consistency and partition tolerance or availability and partition tolerance CP or AP again that's not only about Cassandra that's about any kind of a distributed storages P or CP there is an um known statement what Cassandra is AP available and partition tolerant but I cannot fully agree with that because Cassandra is configurably consistent and in any moment of a time for any particular query you can set your consistency level you require to have and that means what I can switch with Cassandra from this field to this field in any particular moment of a time where each particular query so I do it with consistency level what is it consistency level consistency level means amount of replica nodes I will wait to confirm the data is not stale to confirm what data was delivered for example when I insert or update some information uh typical consistency levels we work with is any one to three Quorum and all so as said uh what does that mean consistency level one means what if I have a kind of right consistency level one replication factor three client writes something to mean query coordinator dispatches this information to all replica nodes but it will wait only for one confirmation what data was persisted so these three requests will be executed all at the same time simultaneously synchronously but as soon as I get first answer it will be immediately returned to client OK Dear Mr Sir client we got your data everything is good with consistency level worm Quorum literally means majority so for replication Factor 3 majority of the nodes will be half plus one two so majority for replication Factor 3 is to majority for replication Factor 5 is Free Health Plus One and as you could guess as consistency level is Quorum so it's two for replication factor three it works exactly the same way except of the fact I will wait for two confirmations one two okay we are good and finally we have consistency level all as you could guess I will write for confirm a I will wait for confirmations of all replica servers so I won't return answer to a client before data is uh confirmed to be received by all of the servers and um for a multi-data center deployments there are some more options uh local one local Quorum and each Quorum what does that mean local one and local Quorum both have a local prefix what does that mean take a look when you have a database servers and application servers in the United States in Asia and in Europe you want your application server in in the United States to work with which database server the closest one so in the United States so for application server in the United States local means you United States Data Center for your data center in Asia local will mean local data center in Asia and therefore for uh European local will mean European Data Center why does that matter if your application server is closest to this data center or these Cassandra cluster you don't want it to work with this one you because it will take long of a lot of time like transfer planting connection is not as fast as a local Connection in the same physical DC let's say when you specify a local one or local Quorum it will wait for the confirmation from the closest servers and each Quorum quite opposite means what it will wait for confirmation of every replica or of Quorum of replica servers in each data centers you have each Quorum can be a dangerously slow because some of the data centers may be very remote but it guarantees what Quorum of every data center will get this information now take a look do you remember when people say what Cassandra is AP I disagree um because Cassandra is neither AP or CP but Cassandra is configurable take a look you can set consistency level 1 and wait for a single confirmation it may work a little bit faster you can set consistency level Quorum and get confirmation of a majority of replica nodes for this piece of data you can set consistency level all and wait for confirmations of all of the replica servers and now you may think hey consistency level all is great consistency level all is exactly what I need I will always use consistency level all right yes but no there is a big problem the problem is cep theorem never quits never sleeps it's always there and it will catch you as soon as you go with consistence level all take a look then you go with consistency level all you move from availability and partition tolerance in the consistency and partition tolerance so basically you move from a b to CP and although it's great from the consistency point of view indeed you are not available anymore why because the ID is very simple then you start to use uh consistency level all you will have to wait for the confirmations of all of the replica servers for this partition and if one of the servers is not available or slow you will get an exception after some time cannot reach desired consistency level you choose consistency over availability here we go you are not highly available anymore now you may ask me okay Alex that's all great but you know what I work in bank or I work in somewhere I want my data to be fully consistent I don't want my client to hate me because we treated Fair bank statement bar bank accounts in the not fully consistent way uh does that mean what I cannot use Cassandra after all no uh you can and actually a lot of banks are using Cassandra um but how do they reach consistency there is a thing known is immediate consistency there is a sweet spot in the middle of cap theorem and we can try to get there as close as possible at least with the immediate consistency approach what does that mean take a look if I write with a consistency level all that means what all of the nodes will get up-to-date information I know it uh then I can read with consistency level one it doesn't matter which node will first give me the response it will be always up to date sounds good and read time may be very fast but it's not optimal from the right point of view and again I may run into the problem of um data not available because one server is down that can be a second way if I write with consistency level 1 so I know what at least one server will get my data then I can read with consistency level all and in any case I will get information from all servers query coordinator will compare the data return most up-to-date answer to me and initiate repair to recover cluster consistency but it also has this problem now my right time is perfect but read time is maybe endangered and we will have some repairs on read which is maybe not the best the right way to reach immediate consistency is right with consistency level Quorum read with consistency level curve and now take a look there is a little bit of mathematics Quorum means majority two for replication factor three free for replication factor 5. a little bit more than half and if I write with consistency level Quorum replication Factor frame that means what I will wait for two confirmation confirmations it means it's guaranteed were two of my servers got the right data they are up to date third one may be not up to date mostly probably it's up to date we cannot be sure but we already got two fastest answers then we have uh we read with consistency level Quorum consistency level Quorum means we wait for two answers and now take a look uh there are two possible scenarios all servers are up to date then we are obviously good what doesn't matter which server you ask you will get up-to-date information and there is a bad scenario when this server actually didn't get the data lay it was out or it was some network issues whatever doesn't matter it didn't get the data it somehow didn't get the hinted handoff so it has the stale data but as we wait for uh two uh answers not one but two when we read that means what again there are two possible scenarios out of that out of a bad scenario we've chosen before if those two servers are first to answer then I get most up-to-date information which is the true Network client and if this one server and this one server first to answer so I get one outdated data and I get one up-to-date information when query coordinator Compares them sees the inconsistency returns to client client most up-to-date information and initiates repair for this node so it will get data it will recovers from this inconsistency and that's the story when you write with consistency level Quorum and read with consistency level Quorum there is no mathematical possibility to run into inconsistency because you are always consistent but meanwhile you can afford losing a single node so that's the right way to work with Cassandra using immediate consistency um to be a bit more scientifical I will give you a little formula here but very simple one give consistency level of your right plus consistency level of your read is more than replication Factor let's call it immediate consistency and that means what you are always getting most up-to-date information so consistency level right Quorum will be two plus consistency level read Quorum will be two two plus two is four four is bigger than 3. and we go here is the immediate consistency consistency Traders the higher the consistency the less chance you may get stale data we pay for this with possible latency all the nodes are asked at the same time and then for the higher amount of answers we will wait to a higher of a chance there will be some latencies of course so if you execute query with a consistency level one it's obviously what you will follow the first received answer the father most uh sooner the fastest answer you will get and it depends on your situational needs absolutely and for different scenarios for different types of data within the same application you may want to use different kinds of consistency levels and that's completely fine for example for iot and sensor systems with extremely right heavy workloads where you can can have millions of February right operations per second which is quite a heavy workload you may benefit from consistency level 1 for rights if data is not required immediately the point is if data was delivered it will be delivered to other servers consistency level once already guarantees what data has reached your server now if you don't read this data from our servers immediately the very same moment you store it then consistency level one may be good choice for you if you require highest possible performance but overall our recommendation is to go for quorum quorum for the reason I've explained it already hey Stefano how it goes are there any good questions uh yes there well there is I think the chat is on fire but DK's manages to help me answering all of them but I picked a few questions that if we have a few minutes I would like to bring to anybody's attention one is a very interesting question Ismail is asking I have a workload based on event logging with a lot of Rights and few reads and they are all time ordered is Cassandra good for that and what I said is that's exactly one of the best use cases for Cassandra because not only is that right optimized so if you have a lot of a lot of Rights and few reads that's really the best use case for Cassandra because he's he mentioned if I'm not mistaken that they are using manga for that but is showing its shortcomings when it comes to this kind of workload and I can relate to that a bit uh no offense to Mong government but uh that's exactly one of the one of the the best Cassandra's built for yes and in particular uh now that's a bit of an advanced topic but if you are exploring a switch to Cassandra seriously uh there are several specialized optimizations for exactly that workload for example uh we didn't speak of compaction yet if I'm not mistaken yeah there is a specific compaction strategy to better handle the way data are kept orderly on the disk that's compaction in short so to speak and that's exactly aimed at that kind of workload uh not only that but if you are planning on on having a proof of concept uh you can try and reach us data stacks for the consultation that might be the start of a good collaboration so yeah that's a very good question and the other one um is what is the language used by Cassandra that was asked by um angoro and the cancer so Cassandra internally uses a language called cql which is not SQL it's Cassandra query language you will soon see an example of that but that's a intern let's say that's the main protocol Cassandra uses to speak with the outside world but from your application you can use any programming language because there are a lot of drivers and you will see some of them later today um the other question the other interesting question well that was by Rahul you asked what happens if some of my nodes were in in a hypernate state or sleeping State and I think that has been extensively answered by Alex because it's the same as when you're now the crashes for some reason and then comes back up so depending on how long it has been down there are several methods in practice there is the hinted handoff method that was described there is the the repair mechanism that can be manual or automated or partially scheduled and yeah so that's that's more or less an answer so consistency is always there are various mechanisms that ensure your data is the same on all nodes so those were I think the three most interesting questions and by the way I thank you all because I had a look I had a peek at the at the questions uh page and there are already a lot of interesting questions so that will make for a nice uh estimate anything session later so thank you for writing your questions there I'd already seen a few cool questions to speak a bit about right keep it going keep it coming Keep It Coming absolutely and don't forget to upload the questions you like yeah there are several upvotes as well good so now uh data how Cassandra handles data what kind of data and how it's managed let's take a look so um for us it all starts with a cell is an intersection of a row and a column it stores data very simple right um then a group of cells build a row row is a single structural data item in a table we go one step higher and we already see a partition and now that is something new I believe most of you have experience with relational databases so in relational databases you have columns you have rows you have cells but you don't have a partition and that brings us to a very common mistake when people misunderstood or underestimate the importance of a partition knowledge and the study of a partition and they run into problem uh Cassandra is a very powerful tool but from the point of the complexity as any powerful tool basically on the scale from a bicycle to a Boeing it's a very much of a Boeing and not a skate or bicycle or something like you can just jump in and write no you have to learn something from that an idea of a partition and partition management is the most important thing to learn during this Workshop so uh what is a partition I told you already a group of rows with the same partition key will group a partition in this example if we use the e-stable to define the Partition by the department then those three employees let's say working in visual tree department will build a single partition and people working in dark magic department they will build a second partition good and then finally table in Cassandra because Cassandra is also table based database it's a group of columns and rows storing partitions uh how do we create a table in Cassandra query language first of all let's take a look at these uh definition and on this statement first thing you may think is what it looks very much like SQL standard query language statement and it looks like but don't make a mistake Cassandra query language is not standard query language and if you understand SQL that doesn't mean you are already good to go with Cassandra Cassandra is different there are many people doing this mistake and then they try to use Cassandra as MySQL without joints and they inevitably fail because Cassandra is not my SQL before joints okay there is no joins but that's definitely not MySQL it requires special approach it requires some knowledge to manage so in this case we create a table and when we create a table a statement is very simple create table key space key space is a simple pinky space is just a group of the tables stored together then table name when we have column definitions see the last name first name address email in this case they all are text text text text we have more than just text data type for sure and then finally we have to define a primary key and now this one is important primary key consists of partition key and clustering columns and don't don't hurry I will explain it all step by step so when we create a key space we have to uh create so keyspace is a group of tables store it together key space creating key space we have to define a keyspace name and then there are many possible uh configurations options but only one is required really replication creating key space you must specify replication strategy and factor for these particular key space for which you will create then tables let's take a look uh for that key space is a group of tables that share configuration settings for example replication when we create key space we have to specify a specifier replication first we have to specify is a class of replication and there are only two possible strategies a simple strategy which is good for your laptop and bad for everything else and network topology strategy which is good for your production infrastructure uh what's the difference and what is that what is the network topology strategy take a look you have if you use your own data center you have a data center you have server Rex and in those server racks you have servers if you use cloud deployments you have available you have regions and in this regions you have availability zones those are basically the same as regions to Data Centers and availability zones as to server Rex more or less I'm simplifying but that's a general idea now take a look uh Cassandra tries to put your replicas as far away from each other within data center as possible not to put it into a single server Rack or into a single availability Zone but to put it to multiple different server wrecks or multiple different availability zones why because uh servers what are in the same server Rack or virtual servers in the same availability zones they tend to fail together because server rack can have a single power source and if power disappears for both server rack will be left out of power or availability Zone also tends to fail together in Cloud deployments so networked apology strategy is smart and it tries to keep your data in multiple different server racks or multiple different availability zones so the risk of two different replicas will be down at the same time will be significantly decreased so it's very easy to remember simple strategy for your laptop or maybe for test environment for development environment and networked apology strategy for production environment or staging environment now we have to define a replication factor and in this case I specify a replication Factor free for my data center United States West one and I specify replication Factor 5 for my data center Europe Central 1. now I have a special uh question to you and you can answer right in the YouTube chat tell me please how do you think how many data centers I have within this cluster considering this statement is correct hmm that's interesting how many data centers I have within this cluster if this statement is correct there is no mistake in this statement two any more options I'm curious I know a lot of people watching us right now two two any other ideas free okay why uh two correct this room no no no no no no no no no no the right answer is two or more the point is I said before you don't have to replicate your data over the wall data centers you have over each and every data center you have so my cluster May consist of five data centers or 10 data centers through dozens of data centers but if I want to have my key space users over only two of them I can completely go for that so right answer is at least two or more good so I glad we clarified that now let's move on now with a high level overview we can remember it all starts with the key space which stores tables then table have a name and have some rows and columns within the table we store partitions and there are partition key column would Define partitions clustering column we will discuss why do we need them and data column what stores data now um it's very important to understand the idea of the keys primary partition clustering column so let's take a look smoothly how it works when we create a table we always have to specify primary key primary key have two main responsibilities it must ensure uniqueness it may Define sorting a primary key always consists of at least partition K because partition key is required and it may contain clustering column if needed now take a look a good example of a primary key for our users by City table City last name first name email um there is a line bad example right behind beam which has City last name first name would you please tell me in the YouTube chat comments why this is a consider it a bad example City last name first name why is it a bad primary key foreign gave the right answer from the first attempt well done indeed I did a little check um Vera like over 20 of John Smith's in New York and every next John Smith will be a very bad surprise for the previous John Smith because Cassandra uses so-called absurd update or insert is technically the same and that means what uh next data May override previous data if you don't use special mechanism to avoid that then this is the right thing CT last name first name email in this case uh it's basically the same we just add email and email guarantees uniqueness of these primary key but let's move on now first part of the primary key is a partition key it's required what is a partition key partition key is an identifier for a partition it consists of at least one column maybe we have more and it has only one and only one requirement it partitions rows very simple for example here we have table like imagine you are watching YouTube and you are writing comments and we have to design a table to store comments for your uh to store comments for this video when we can group a ram partition them together by video ID and they will be stored together and that's quite a good strategy we will discuss soon why or if we just have a table of users not grouped by city but just table of users so we can use user ID as a partition key and that's completely fine because we will have as much partitions as much users we have and that's completely safe Cassandra can support nearly any amount of partitions you may want to have and there is a special bad example but I won't discover that right now because I have a special um explanation for that very soon I have a special slide forward and then finally last part of the primary key is the clustering column what is a clustering column clustering column has two responsibilities first it's used to ensure uniqueness as you've seen we use it with email to ensure uniqueness because first example is not unique and second is unique enough and that's the first responsibility but there is a second responsibility clustering columns also Define sorting order within the partition for example when we store a comment to a video when we show them we want to show most recent first oldest comments will be down and latest comments will be up and um this example is good because it's Unique the partition comments by video and clustering column as a comment ID will be good from the uniqueness point of view because they both are unique and comment ID is universal unique identifier that is good but it's not sorted and if we store that like that video ID created at comment ID create that will Define sorting order which may be not yet unique because there are many comments uh wrote in the same moment of a time and to avoid Collision we add comment ID as a clustering column and as a result this one will be not only unique but also sorted by time and that's a cool feature because it will be sorted on insert time so when when on read time I don't have to do sorting because it's stored already in the right order which is quite cool now if you have no time uh for the rest of the Cassandra day today and you have to leave now pay a full Focus well even if you don't have to leave and we want to stay for focus on the day still pay a full Focus because those slides are the most important if you want to learn what we are showing right now you will then as I say try to use Cassandra as MySQL you have our joins and it may lead to a big problems on your production uh Cassandra uses partitioning to distribute data if you understand this mechanism you will success you will succeed with Cassandra if you don't uh I'm not so sure so there are only three rules you have to learn only three Simple Rules and those slides are the most important slides what you will see in this year I've created those slides that's why I gave him the slide of the Year award because well it's of course a joke but I do believe they are highly important for your success and I want you to succeed so there are three Simple Rules first store together what you retrieve together what does that mean uh that mean what we should put into the partition something what will what we expect to retrieve together as a simple query for example take a look we open a video get all the comments in a single query not in a dozen of queries uh get them all on the single partition so as partitions store it together you will have to hit one single node node not a dozen of the nodes and as a result we partition comments by video ID we store it together when I open a video it will be one simple request but take a look if I don't partition comments by video ID if I I have for example partition them by comment ID so I will have as much partitions as comments I have by itself it's fine but when if this video has 1 000 of comments as a result I will have to reach 1000 of different partitions and those partitions will be distributed over cluster as a result um it will be much more operations and obviously the answer to my client will be much slower so I want to avoid that that's always think first about how to partition data think how are you going to retrieve data Stephanie will talk more about that on the second data modeling Workshop which is highly important so uh when oops wrong yeah now avoid big partitions take a look what does that mean well there are some why do we partition data first of all because we know what if we want to be quick if we want to dispatch answers within single digit milliseconds we need to partition data and give partitions not so big if partitions are too big we again run into the problem of too much data per server server still server Works slowly and we are not happy our clients not happy our boss is not happy and everyone is angry to each other to avoid that because I prefer to live in the happy society and keep my clients happy and keep my salary high because of that um we have to think how to keep our servers performant the key format is to avoid big partitions keep your partitions of a reasonable site size uh what's important for us and at this point is to control uh partition size and we control it with the partition key for example in this case video ID means what all the comments for video in YouTube will go to the same partition and as a result I retrieve them together see the first rule and about the second rule you can say hey Alex how is it right if there are some videos on YouTube what have a lot of comments like really a lot thousands thousands thousands answer is yes you are right there are some comments with a lot there are some videos we have a lot of comments but by itself let's say what is a comment author ID comment ID video ID text timestamp outer name because we use gender normalization I will explain it later so basically that's it six Seven Fields text Fields short Fields there is no way we will store any kind of a heavy data there per row and as a result yes we might have a lot of comments but this partitions still will be small because just of them weight of the Rope as it is is very low um and um there uh another example which I want to discuss uh Vera you work we work in a let's say we work in an e-commerce company what sells something and let's say we start in Europe in Europe we have a lot of countries but many of them are very small and not so many people then and we have for our clients stable partitioning daiban cup done by Counting and it works well in the beginning but let's say when we go to China and our goods are extremely popular in China and everyone is buying something from us in China and now we have uh take a look we have a dozen dozens of small partitions or maybe not so big partitions and we have one partition and we are extremely successful in China so everyone is buying something from us so literally nearly everyone um Chinese citizen is in this list and as a result we have a bunch of small partitions and one huge partition uh that's bad because that doesn't scale well and these partition huge partition is hard for uh the database to manage and maintain uh harder to compact uh we don't discuss compaction too much today but again keep partitions small and this partitioning by County may be sub-optimal because what is it about partitioning partitioning is about even data distribution over the cluster and it's better to have partitions of more or less the same size then it's easier to scale so what are the limits there is only one hard limit you cannot have more than 2 billion cells per partition amount of sales is easy to calculate columns multiplied by rows will give you the sales count and that's a hard limit and those two are recommendations in general we recommend to have not more than 100 000 rows in a partition and not more than 100 megabytes of data in a partition those are recommendations there are some people doing ugly things to Cassandra we've seen partitions over the terabyte of data and that's all for Cassandra don't do that it's disgusting um keep your practitioners performance scripting more yeah so keep your partition small it will work much better for you now I have uh Alex sorry before we move to the next slide may I just interject shortly yeah sure um I've seen a question uh by Reiki about that makes me think of the need for making a distinction now about primary key and partition key I know you spoke at length on that but that's always a bit difficult to grasp on the first uh get so look at the slide you see let's look at the first example you see primary key video ID create that comment ID these three fields are the primary key that the term is uniqueness of rows and that's one thing so there can't be two rows with the same values of these three Fields but the partition key in general is a subset of them so it's only some of these columns so in this case it's only video ID um which means that you might have several rows different rows with the same video ID because uniqueness is all three and they will be grouped in the same partition so that's just to make it clear we will come back on this point but uh it's very important that you get the distinction primarily the whole thing is for uniqueness partition key is how to group rows together in the same partition and that's only part of The Columns of the primary key uh other if they coincide then you have one row per Partition by definition if you want and that's not a problem in itself that's a good pattern in Cassandra just to make it clear sorry that was something I wanted to stress once more because it's always a bit hard to get in the first step yes yes thank you thank you so much good so now let's take a look at the real life example uh what happened with one of our uh colleagues and clients I can't I can't discover and open name because well we keep secrets of our clients but it's a real life story uh imagine we work together on a huge International telecommunication company uh it's a huge telecommunication company so we have Hardware data centers all over the world and to understand how our system works we have really millions and millions of different sensors reporting their state every few seconds every sensor reports its uni its ID reports the timestamp and it reports some value for example if it's a temperature sensor in my data center in server room it will report its ID whatever whatever one two three five six six six five uh timestamp so when this temperature recorded and value what temperature recorded or if it's a door like security system and it's a door sensor it reports any event what door was opened or closed and so on and so forth so there are very many different sensors and we store very many different information there right so every sensor reports its state every few seconds we have to store this data and redesign a model which is um looks like that primary key will be sensor ID partition key reported clustering key why do we do it first sensor ID we follow the first rule store together what you retrieve together in the future I want to see the let's say temperature diagram and I want a per sensor per room and it makes sense to store this data together for real and then I store also timestamp reported that because I want to understand I want this data unique sensor ID is not unique because the same sensor will report its state like many times per minute [Music] I'm very sorry um could I ask you uh for sorry yeah a keyboard is very loud yes sorry Mike I have to tune it sorry no no all good I'm afraid my noise suppression mechanism works not so well today now it's this microphone is too powerful so I'll switch it off for a second oh good thank you so uh well then let's take a look I have a sensor ID as a partition key reported that as clustering column for sorting and uniqueness we are all good yes or no now everything works well in the beginning but after some time I run into troubles and something goes very very wrong with my cluster now please answer in the YouTube chat what is wrong with this design and what will go wrong and when it will happen and while I'm waiting for your answers I will answer a question from Ismail the quality of secondary indexes determines how efficiently you can access records in the database how is Cassandra support for secondary indexes first of all it's obviously recommended way to work with Cassandra using primary indexes not secondary indexes and primary indexes are partition key and clustering column this way you get best performance right out of the pocket and Cassandra supports secondary indexes but the problem is Cassandra's data is decentralized distributed over multiple servers and it has exactly the same problem as you would have with any kind of a distributed data building a distributed index is quite hardening so there are indexes what based on supported on a partition level when you have secondary indexes but again limited to a single partition and to have secondary indexes over multiple partitions you have to be able to distributed secondary indexes which is quite a long story in short recommendation is to always go with primary indexes not secondary indexes although they are supported uh it will create very big partition as the partition key is sensor ID and that's the right answer over time in the beginning it will be fine because it groups data by sensor ID and in the beginning per sensor you have zero rows one row two Row three rows five rows and so on but over time it will be grow to large and as a result you will have to match data per partition and your partitions will be too big and cluster I will be installing and that's something we want to avoid how do we avoid that there are two possible solutions well maybe more but two main Solutions first one known as TTL time to leave optional property using time to leave you can specify a particular value or a wall row to be expired after this detail expires and in this case writing data to your cluster you can always specify TTL one month this row will be discarded after one month automatically and you don't have to take care about that um sadly it wasn't this case because this company wanted to store data for years so TTL was not the best way to handle that TTL is a great thing but in this particular scenario we want to store data for many years so how do we solve that there is a special approach oops known as bucketing what is bucketing bucketing means take a look here we are introducing a compound partition key so before we were getting sensor ID time stamp and value now we also store in the table month year what is a month here basically easiest to explain on an example that's a September of 2021 so month year will be zero nine two zero to one and now you can think about the trick then this month changes so when October comes it will be what 1 0 to 0 to 1 not uh 0 9 September 9th month of a year but one zero tenth month of a year October and as a result as a month changes month year will be changed and as this value change it compound partition key will be changed and token will be new one so we basically create now partitions per sensor per month and when month is over we create a new Partition as a result we will have as much partitions as much sensors multiplied by month years we will have and that's completely fine again and that's the idea you can keep month here as an integer or a string that doesn't matter but that's a primary idea of creation of the buckets restore data div now many people ask why don't we use date why do we use month year not a week not a day not an hour not just the timestamp we have timestamp why don't we put this reported ad into a partition key it could have been sensor ID reported that answer is very simple take a look uh then you order a food delivery when you order pizza do you specify your full address or do you specify only street name CTN street name I don't know about you but I prefer my Pizza Hut that's why I always specify full address so when the delivery a boy or girl reaches the place it can immediately he or she can immediately find me makes sense right now take a look why I'm talking about that right now then you uh in your query select something or insert something do not specify partition key all full all the components all the compound partition key what will happen how will Cassandra calculate which particular server to ask for your data without a full partition key there is no way to do it and executing a query without specifying all the parts of a partition key is exactly like ordering a pizza without specifying full address how is delivery boy is going to deliver this pizza to you if you didn't specify your apartment number or your house number if you live in a house basically there is only one way go through the street knock to every door and ask Hey sir have you ordered pizza oh sorry I will go to Nextdoor hey ma'am have you ordered pizza that is as stupid as it sounds exactly as stupid as it sounds what do you want you don't want your database to work like that so remember a simple rule always specify all the parts of a partition key if it's a compound partition key you have to specify all the components of this compound partition key that means what if I have to get query data of stay with sensor ID I uh will have to specify a sensor ID I want to get a data statement for a diagram of a temperature for this particular room over last three months how will my query look like select whatever I need select all from my sensors reports where sensor ID equals one one two two three three five five and month year is September 2021 or August 2021 or July 2021 so my select statement will be quite simple but imagine I have bucketing based on an hour I will have to specify each and every hour for the last three months can you imagine this query that is obviously not going to to be optimal request that's why we are bucketing based on per month you every time doing a design which Stefano will explain you in the second Workshop um that's very important Workshop you must attend so think of the partition size and maximum partition size so it's easy to calculate you know the size of a single report you know how many reports you will get per minute and then that's easy calculate approximate side of the size of a partition and make bucket based on some reasonable limitation week month maybe a day if you have a huge workload per one single writer so and then finally last slide if we hear a word rules of a good partition avoid hot partitions what is a hot partition Do You Remember by example I gave you with this uh e-commerce company which was not so maybe successful in Europe but became extremely insanely popular in China imagine it has a cluster of 10 servers the single data center just for simplification and replication factor three it has as many partitions as countries it's operate and for the dozens of European countries they are quite small and not so intensely intensively accessed and there is a one single partition which is overloaded with Chinese famous Chinese partition which is being accessed all all the time because there is a huge amount of people and someone is buying something all the time well when you can say Okay cluster of 10 servers um and they are extremely popular in China now they have a lot of money as everyone is buying something from them they have a lot of money so just buy some more servers you uh told me before what Cassandra scales linearly yes but take a look Cassandra linear scalability is a shared responsibility there is no magic button but you have to work and you have to think on how do you design this system take a look this company has money and they buy 10 more servers they added to a cluster now their cluster of 20 servers right sounds good doesn't work replication factor is free still there are same servers responsible for the same partitions when you have many of the partitions and you add more servers these partitions will be distributed over more servers as a result every server will has less partitions and that's how it scales well but if you have one huge overloaded partitions doesn't matter how many servers you add you can add 10 you can add 100 you can add 1000 it will only lead whatever partitions will be removed from these servers responsible for this one but there still will be only free servers overloaded if your partition is accessed too much then again it's a bad idea and it was not perfect design and now we have to rework it somehow and partition maybe People based on cities or something we have to think about better design for that so avoid hot partitions try to keep your partitions even by the data size and even by the access patterns you can tell me what uh okay Alex in the previous example when we have a bucketing on the sensor ID and month year aren't we running into the same problem because there are uh September partitions what are being accessed all the time but um let's say August partitions are not accessed after August has ended and the answer is yes but take a look in this case we have one huge partition one huge partition and all the hours are minor and not under heavy load and in this case we have many partitions many small partitions in this case scaling will work because when I add more servers they will be distributed over those servers so for this scenario it's completely fine but for this it isn't what partition is not scaled good and you know what uh we have 20 minutes left right Stefano you're muted thanks sorry we have 15 minutes we should be able to do a little lab so you can have hands-on experience of a Cassandra uh in the form of a database in the cloud or for the as a service so you will not have to install anything now my my plan is since I collected a few interesting questions so I think we might do like this to optimize time we first go and uh I will I will show you how you set up your free online database as a service to do later a bit a little exercise on and while we wait a few minutes for the database to become active for all of you I wrote down a few questions and I would like to quickly go through them because they are very interesting yeah so please so okay now I have to share my screen and okay give me a moment which yeah so we might have surprises because okay let me let me set up my uh let me set up my screen because I know I might have problem with resolution so one second yeah there we go I think that's good Okay so and uh I'm switching you are you already I'm switching to your screen right okay so we should be able to yep share my screen here so yeah there we go I'm sharing my screen and yes your screen is live and be very good before we proceed with that let me explain you something uh not you of course but I mean our attendees uh that's um everything what we will do now as an exercise we will do uh Viv uh Apache Cassandra based database Cloud database as a service astrodb which is absolutely Cassandra compatible which is a based on the Cassandra but um I'm sorry I have to do a bit of tricks with my screen because I want to paste a few links in the in the chat so yeah don't mind me please yeah yeah and uh why I'm talking about that you can do all the exercises locally and if you want to install Cassandra and run it locally you are completely good to go uh but to simplify that we will use today a free account on astrodb which is Cassandra as a service and why uh we want you to do those exercises all the theory is dead without practice I want to point put your hands on I want you to do the lab I want you to follow the steps what step and I will show you and that's very important to you to do that because first you will learn this better and second if you complete the homework and submit the homework as Stefano will explain you you will get a special page or participation certificate you can drag on LinkedIn or Facebook you attended Cassandra day you learn that fundamentals of one of the most powerful nosql databases in the world you just become a better developer or administrator or engineer whoever you are um so please follow that you have to do the steps in order to complete homework and get your page yeah those are wise words thank you so I let's start okay so um welcome to the practice part of today um core introduction to Cassandra presentation okay so I you will find in the YouTube chat Three Links so one is this screen to register to Astra DB what is a survey Alex just state that so you can use this or you can have your own Cassandra installation no problem so this is the screen you you I ask you to register it's free you can log in with GitHub Google or create your account so let's say you click sign in and you will be brought to a page like this more or less in particular okay I made I try to make it good big enough to for you to see by the way Alex I am I have to share my screen so I'm not seeing the YouTube chat so please help me as much as you can thank you I'm on it okay great the other links I pasted is to this repo intro to Cassandra here you will find all instructions so if you want to do this later at your own Rhythm just go ahead read here there's a lot of explanations and you will be guided to do this exercise by yourself the third link is just a link to the part about homework that will explain to you better here sorry it will explain better what you have to do to get your badge and to get your knowledge because that there is a bit of there is something to do besides what we will do today um Okay so let's start so let's say you have registered to to Astrid B so you're ready to create your own database which you will do like here you will end up either because you're logged in or because you clicked on this button create database or here create a database you click here and you will be able to create your own very own database in the cloud by the way that's in the cloud that's managed for you so instead as opposed to installing Cassandra on your own machines in the cloud by yourself you will not have to do any Administration any operations any maintenance it is just there it's a managed database so for exercise is good and I have to say not only for exercises also big big companies find it convenient not to have to deal too much with um maintenance because that's done for you in the cloud so I'll also paste these information here because we ask you to we ask you to uh please stick to these names when you create your database so you will have you will call your database killer video cluster without the e so like it like you see in the YouTube chat and the keyspace name please stick to killer video that's obviously just a choice but it will make this the comments we will run easier to run that's just it so you will not have to adapt anything so killer video cluster and killer video to complete creation of the database um you you should choose any any cloud provider you want I choose Amazon web services why not but that's the same for you and probably you want to choose Asia Pacific probably that's maybe it's convenient for you to to stick to the region and the geographic area closest to you for latency so I'm in Italy so I will choose Frankfurt and AWS why not okay so then I click create database and that's it in a few minutes you will have your own database ready to play with you see this killer video cluster now is listed here in my databases I have something more but that's a detail and you will see it in the pending state for a while let's say a few minutes so we just leave it there and I ask you to please give me a thumbs up in the chat good nice thumbs up when you get to the database in pending state so I know you you succeeded and we just wait a few minutes to for the database to become active because while this is pending behind the scenes um yeah the Astra engine is spinning up new stuff it's doing a lot of kubernetes instantiation of PODS and behind the scenes your database has been created on different machines in different data center in a single data center with multiple nodes so it's a there's something heavy going on and you just have to wait a bit so please when you create a database please stick to the database name and the key space name you know now what the key space is it is just a way to contain a few tables basically and a few other things then you choose a region a provider you click create database and you're done so we have the first thumbs up hello there well done great a lot yeah you want oh yeah yeah and welcome to the word of those who have the database ready or waiting to be ready okay so while we wait I will just uh touch on a few questions then we wait two minutes or so and then we do a bit of exercise I think we will go five minutes beyond the schedule so but there is fine okay so a few questions a few interesting questions one very quick Adam asked what is the license to use Cassandra good thing is the license is the Apache license so you're free to use it because it's open source and it will always be open source so you can use Cassandra and SQL as a free product because it's open source um then again there are commercial Solutions such as the data Stacks Enterprise and most important the one you just you're just seeing on the screen is a is a database in the cloud offer for you as a service and it is built on Apache Cassandra now you are using that as a free product and you will be able to use it for free up to a very high level of IO and storage but then above that line if you are a big business you will have to switch to a paid plan but that's absolutely not the case for today and for the time for a foreseeable future for your experimentation but if you run a big business you will switch to a paid license obviously uh another question was about unique ID so can you have the database create a unique ID for you yes and you will see it soon in the exercise another question by Rahul was about uh distribution of data between data centers and within data centers so the big distinction is that what you define at Key Space level is what happens between data centers so you take a whole key space and you decide this is going to be on this and these data centers this other key space is only on these data centers that's useful because you might have to comply to compliance regulations so this data as Alex mentioned this data has to be on Europe only but then when it comes to in-table data row by row then the distribution among the nodes in in the data center is automatic with the partitioning mechanism another interesting question was about time zones so what happens if you have a database over multiple time zones don't you run into problems with different times Well internally you store timestamps so Unix timestamps which are non-ambiguous and the trick is to be to always specify the time zone when you insert the time date time data so they will be translated in a non-ambiguous way and there will be no problems with that we all know the time zones are one of the hardest problems in data handling but this is luckily not a problem here another question was what happens if I insert is if I try to insert two rows with the same primary key it just can't happen that you have multiple rows because uniqueness is guaranteed and actually you will get an override of one row to the other so by Design you will have one row in that case um yeah then remark um Alex mentioned Pizza a few times and you will see a lot of pizza mentions in the data modeling talk because I like pizza so I put a lot of pizza and talk uh there was also nice question about the Cassandra can it work as an in-memory database well actually since it's made to work with big big data it's uh more like uh the answer is no it's mostly based on on disk storage think about what happens if you restart the node you would lose everything so no but on the other hand Cassandra is a very sophisticated in-memory mechanism to it's a caching mechanism very complicated and very powerful to make reads very fast I I would say answer is yeah answer is yes and no simultaneously first you can so first Cassandra is normally not used as an in-memory database second using some special configuration you can try to reach similar idea but you are obviously going to need to have a lot of ram ram yeah space but that's not it because there are also work Works in progress It's not yet really is it but there is a work in progress on pluggable storage engines and pluggable memory engines and in theory in the future we can have in memory as a plugable storage if you reboot your node then you you might have a problem so you have to know what you're doing in I would say yep and George asks will there be a quiz in the end a quiz will be there but as it's a Cassandra day Indonesia it will be accordingly to the schedule in approximately uh one hour from now an hour and second uh it will be held in bahasan yes so there will be actually three different quizzes we will speak of that later so uh I think it's now time to have a bit of a experience with Astra with Cassandra the underlying Cassandra so I hope all of you have your database active now uh so let's start so I have my killer video cluster here that is the database and it's active so I can start clicking on connect if I click on connect I'm broad to a new to a page where I can actually I can connect to this database in various ways today we will use the cql console look here there is a tab here called SQL console which is a very handy way to interact with the database directly with a shell that offers SQL commands particular is the language the native language to communicate with the database then again there are drivers there are various other ways to to access it but now we are looking at the say the the main most basic way to interact with the database so I'm trying to follow the instructions in the readme so I will switch between these two tabs let me bring this tab here for convenience so um I hope you are all in the SQL console and it is a console where you just type commands like this one commands have to finish with a semicolon I hope you can see my screen good big enough yep then you type your command and you click enter so what I just wrote is use killer video that means I'm set I'm moving my um sorry I can let me just move over to just to follow the steps yeah so I just I already skipped one no problem so use killer video means I will work now on the killer video key space what are the key spaces so if I type describe or desk key spaces I will see how many key spaces are there and many of them here are system key spaces created for me but my killer video is here for me to use and by the way we have a tab completion so if I type use key and I click tab I just get my command completed so I'm now working on the killer video key space and here we will do a few things uh use killer video so now we are creating a table so the next command to run is the one to create a table that you see you have seen already in Alex presentation so create table if not exist table name and then the column making the table CT text last name text and so on and then look at this command this statement specify what is the primary key of the table and as you see there is the primary key that is this whole thing and then this inner parenthesis specifies what is the partition key all in one command so let me copy this this command here the one to create the first table and I paste it here so right click paste and I execute it with enter so the table exists let's see if I write if I do describe tables I see my users by City table here okay looks like my screen being so Big Font messes up a bit the formatting but I think no I think I have to make it uh like this you can see it better okay so we have our table very good Alex please stop me if uh if there are some problems or or if I have to go slower because again I'm not seeing anything else than than the screen oh loot all good nothing what I can transfer by text very good very good okay so there is a table in our database now uh let's create a few more tables why not so there is just another couple of create table commands we create a table called commence by user where the primary key is so this is a table hosting comments about videos it's a little bit of a sample youtube-like application so users are able to comment on videos I create a table called commence by user where is store commands and they are the primary key is user ID comment ID but the partitioning is by user ID and then I also create a similar table called commence by video and notice one thing the table has the same fields but it is grouped they are grouped differently so they are grouped by video ID that's a very common pattern in Cassandra so now I copied this command and I'm ready to run them in the console it's a common pattern and sometimes the best thing is to have just duplicated data grouped differently in two ways so I can access them with different queries I will will see this better in the data modeling Workshop but still okay so let's say I created more tables so if I run desk tables here I will see look three nice tables ready for me so I think it's now it's now time to insert some data so I would do a bit of standard recruit so create retrieve update and delete first let's run a few insertions so look at this command this inserts into comments by user and it inserts so the syntax is insert into table then I specify the column names and then the values itself the values themselves look I have an ID there is this nice macro if you want that SQL expands to current time so I don't have to specify it explicitly if I want so let's run this one command or maybe yeah let's run this one first I copy it I paste it and I think this worked look um this works and I think I inserted one row already so let me just run the other insertion so I insert something else in the comments by user comments by user and comments by user so I'm inserting a few rows paste yes there we go I inserted a few more rows um maybe yeah so it looks like it's commenced by one user a few commands by the same user and then another command on another from another user for the same videos before so okay notice that we might use uh now here user ID is explicitly given that is a good use case that might happen that user ID is already known other other times one might one might use a macro like this one uuid as we as you saw the now macro that is a built-in function and it generates for me a new unique ID there are situations where that that comes very handy okay so let's insert more tables now we were inserting tables we were inserting data in the comments by user now we go to the comments by video which is another table and we just insert one two three and four different rows in this table so that those should be the same insertions mirrored if you want by hand in the other table so we were writing to comments by users and then we write two comments by video and there we go so we did a bunch of insertions how to check if these insertions worked well let's read the data so there is this nice select so let's look what is in comments by user and there it's I clean my screen it's a standard SQL command so let's plot from comments by that was comments by user so what happens if I run this command look there is my stuff so I have my results finally I see some data in the SQL console so I have um a comment by user22 and that's about video one two three blah blah uh comment by yeah sorry I would also notice what uh there is a nice highlight uh coloring if you um notice partition key will be highlighted as red and clustering column is highlighted is um cyan or what is it I'm not so good with colors and data columns are just great yes good point yes so this part you see graphically is the primary key which is made by partition key which is red and the rest that is a light blue cyan whatever and the data columns are just purple light purple so you can see at a glance how your table is made but you can also do describe table comments by user and you would see in another form the same information with some additional default properties that you might have also modified to your wheel so our select so there are four commands one is by user two the other three are from user one and they are all for the same video so we are reading data easily okay so there's a very important notice that you will find the and that's a point we insist on very much that's not a good pattern because this is I'm asking Cassandra to give me all rows in my database all rows in that table and that's usually think about how data is distributed across nodes I'm asking Cassandra go to all of your notes and get me all rows of your table but that's slow think about if you have 100 1000 notes that's a very slow query that's not the right way to to query data so a good query is the one that hits only on one partition and that's what I do in this second query so that's the typical query select Splat from comments by user where user ID equals something and let's run this one which I have to end with the with the semicolon oh sorry I think uh uh when you copy comments repository um you better push this button on the right and take a look I know on the right no I know yeah because I I skipped a few once so it was longer yeah the ID was longer sorry yep so if I run this select that's great because I'm get I'm hitting on a single partition notice that my where condition is not on any random column of the table it has to be and it is on the partition key so I'm specifying Dr cql dear Cassandra go to go straight to that one node that has the 111 partition and get me the data so that is a good way to query the data okay so let's run a few other select I can look at comments by user that's what we done already that's the not so good query but just as a check let's look at the same data in comments by video so let me clear this this is comments by user and this is comments by video this is a similar way of querying and those are both um not so good queries because they are just Full Table scans as they are called and they would query all nodes that are not so good okay so but anyway we have red data okay so let's skip to updating data let's say okay let's insert a new a new row a new row in comments by video Let's insert this data select insert into comments by video blah blah blah and then there is that guy Patrick is such a geek okay this has always been inserted I can check by by the way if you scroll up with the arrow you can go up the history and then we can select from comments by video and our new line a new row is there you see it that guy Patrick is such a geek very good um okay so we now want to change this comment because say the user in the application has edited their command how do it go around it so we update data update a row that already exists now look at the syntax update comments by video set comment equal new string and then we have a where close that has to specify the full primary key why because otherwise how can I specify which is the row to be changed so you see video ID and comment ID are the primary key here I have if I want to change the value of this row I have to specify the full primary key because uniqueness because I need to go to one single row and change some of the values by the way I only if you change values yeah if you will uh specify only video ID it will overwrite a comment for the wall partition which is not what I want yeah and yeah so by the way I cannot change the value of the part of the primary key because that would amount to creating a new a new row right so I only can change data columns so non-primary key columns but see I run my command and if I run my select again I'm pretty sure I will see you you see there was this such a gig here and now it has become that guy Patrick is on fleek so my update worked very good uh the last step would be to delete something so I again the statement to delete is delete from table where and then there is aware condition even here as Alex said you should be careful because if you specify only the partition key you are deleting the whole partition which sometimes is what you want and if you want to delete the whole partition you better do it at once because that would create less um Tombstone so well that's a bit too much today so it would it would be the the most economic way to erase the whole partition let's say so now I'm trying I want to delete that one command and let's run this delete statement shall we let me paste it here that's it so I think my delay to succeeded and to check I just do my next select on the same table comments by video let's see look comment anymore so the comment has been deleted okay that was basically is a very small demo just to show you that you can interact in a standard way with the database obviously there is a lot more to know to learn and to know but I I advise you to do this exercise by yourself if you didn't do it now maybe take a screenshot of the last deleted the the last parts so the the the the row disappearing if you take a screenshot and then you also go uh up in the homework part and do there are a few interactive scenarios let me show them to you very quickly if you there are very nice interaction interactive scenarios here that you can start and again they are a bit of lessons made interactively with a real Cassandra installation there for you to play with they are guided it's very nice and if you manage to finish them you learn a lot you take a screenshot you submit all of these uh with this uh submit form that I a little bit higher yep right submit form and then we will grade the homework and we will award you a nice badge so yeah I think we have to stop here yep I can maybe stop sharing my screen if that's okay for you Alex uh yes sure so let me remind that now we have we have a break so stop sharing we will have a break now until um until 13 15 13 13 Jakarta time right yes so in 45 minutes but during the break Alex will show you yeah there is now we finally can give you the link you can go there and there will be a quiz sponsored by uh SPS if I'm not mistaken uh and there will be some oval prices for you to win um you will find the link during the break here on the screen and while we take a break and you also maybe have something to eat so that yeah great thank you for pasting it so I think that's it so see you in 45 minutes have fun with the break and have a good lunch yeah and uh don't miss the squeeze speed dispatch we and our partners uh strategic partner Solutions many thanks to them for supporting us and you on this way well when we dispatch a lot of prizes today together with them so don't miss your chance to win that but what matters the most New York knowledge you know our prices are not Ferraris or apartments or Villas what matters more is York knowledge because your knowledge makes you better expert and raises your salary in the end and how to confirm that first complete the homework go to Astra or go to your uh and for complete the homework as specified in the repository submitted to get your page it's not the end the age is good but we have something better we have something great if because you attended these Cassandra day you get a free certification voucher so you can pass a real Cassandra certification and become a globally recognized Apache Cassandra developer or Apache Cassandra administrator for free now take a look at the moment after one single Workshop you are not ready to pass by exams seriously we have a free resource for you to learn which is about which is academy.datastacks.com it's a free Academy to learn about Cassandra and there you can choose a developer path or administrator buff take this path yeah and with voucher pass your exam and then you can become a certified specialist absolutely sponsored by data Stacks so you have to invest your time to be a better developer or administrator but you don't pay AdSense for that and well well you know what I love my job so now get your rest and get back for Stefano data modeling Workshop which is extremely important to learn in order to succeed with Cassandra and be better in your work yeah so I want to take another 30 seconds to say one thing see you later but I have to thank you all for being so engaging and asking so many interesting questions that makes our job valuable and that's why we like it and I Alex and I you know we we woke up at four in the night for today because we are in Europe but seeing you so interested and so active with the database with Cassandra makes us happy and yeah it gives us motivation to do that so great thank you guys see you later thank you and see you soon [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you

a quiz yeah to let the people compete about their Norwich yet right I love this game it's my favorite game educational entertaining and engaging but you know what uh during the lunch break you had a break quiz so are there any news about that yeah oh I think Andy already uh mentioned oh congratulations to [Music] congratulations we you got prizes from ptsps for uh answering the right uh the correct answers for our quiz it's only one quiz there will be more after this right okay yeah we have more prizes now it's data Stacks turn to despise some prizes But first you have to answer our questions so yeah uh I send the link to a quiz in YouTube chat join main team and there is also uh if you prefer a QR code there is a QR code next to the key or just jump in on mentee.com using the code specify it on the screen 8753-5851 and I suggest you to do it with your mobile phone it's just the easiest way to use mentee open it in your mobile phone browser so and I see there are many people watching us right now so I wanted to be a real competition stay focused stay tuned we are going to ask questions and you are going to answer first two questions and notebook please first questions are just to make you familiar with main team and after those two questions we go for a real competition yeah okay come on good Alex yep so um I hope you join it if you didn't jump in yet because only two small questions and when we start the quiz and the first question is going to be what's your experience with a relational databases black belt okay we got one black belt sabokitam that's great okay so most of the people have some experience but if you don't that's completely fine we're happy to see here a few students as well of course or people who don't have experience with relational databases hmm food so looks like you are getting yourself familiar with mentee then he comes the second question okay what's your experience with non-sql databases okay instead of Guru we use dewa here means gods in Indonesia okay okay and that's pretty much expected because obviously people use normally much more relational databases when no relational but I hope today we may change it a bit relational databases are great there is nothing wrong to use them but you know what in some particular use cases nosql databases can be much better okay so looks like we have a many uh we have many people join at work this already I give you last few seconds to jump in before we start competition I paste the link to a YouTube chat again and I wait for a moment I need to have one more person there that is better we sent our prizes worldwide we sent our prices to Africa we sent our prizes to Siberia we can deliver to Indonesia as well Indonesia right okay so let the battle commencement we are going to ask you questions now you have to give the right answers but you have to do it also fast because if you answer faster you get more points I hope you already muscle competency [Music] and that's a question number one and we start answer fast to get more points oh uh Alex yeah anyway that you uh because the uh the question is cut is there anyway to uh touch down at the phone maybe uh you can simply order never mind it's my it's my screen yeah yeah okay uh so uh so the here a right answer is Cassandra does not have and does not need any Master notes because Cassandra is a decentralized system there are no master notes in Cassandra they are missing as a concept yeah yep okay let's take a look at the leaderboard who was the fastest one and who gave the right answer looks like um I'm sorry if I pronounce it wrong gave the pasta stands for earning 921 points and that's a great result but buddy hertanto is only five points behind which is nearly nothing it's like one millisecond so Russians are B likes this stay focused body is very close very close and we are getting to the second question and that's a question number two so answer fast to get more points maybe you can read the questions also oh yeah yeah using address locator or replication in every server or using partition or using post mail post mail yeah of course that's obvious uh no one no one believeth us uh right answer is a distribution of data done using partitions we don't use a full copy of the data per server because on the big deployments like apple or Netflix has it would lead to just like hundreds petabytes of data per server which is obviously stupid so the right answer is using partitions now let's take a look at the leaderboard who made the Mist oh the top three winners made the mistakes that will change the face of a leaderboard I believe yes and Beyond he gets to the first place or not only on the second we had familiar name here yeah Ananda hey well done you are on the fifth place that's a good result and we are getting that is great only top three places getting prizes but haidar was the fastest let's see what it will give him we still have a lot of questions and that's question number three so answer fast to get more points foreign [Music] okay how customer cluster will can be scaled horizontally ignition scale Vector practically or no there's no way to scale Cassandra I don't know okay so most of you gave the right answer Cassandra skills horizontally by adding more servers and there is no think like a scaling factor in Cassandra only replication which is different and Cassandra doesn't well you can't scale Cassandra vertically but the recommended way is to scale horizontally so well done most of you uh and let's take a look at the leaderboard okay and Beyond this time makes a mistake it was the first place but not for long now Theo gets to the first place ramadani keeps the second and third new name congratulations new name yeah and K was the fastest one getting on the 8th Place very well done so competition going further question number four answer fast to get more points [Music] okay so what's the recommended replication Factor [Music] yeah it's about numbers 15 and one and a half three or 42 what is your favorite number okay it was easy most of you made it right recommend the triplication factor is free you in theory can have a replication Factor 15 but that's definitely not the recommended one and I would really like to see replication Factor 1.5 in the real life but cannot imagine how it would happen like only half of a server participate or a server May answer but not sure in its answer I don't know right answer is free yeah it was an easy one right so who was before and now tell makes a mistake what's going on here that is interesting so ramadani gets the first place well deserved congratulations congratulations and take a look what's Happening Here Russians here a returns to the top three with the fastest answer this time that's a persistence and new name on the top three is fairly the freaky very very close to him okay so question number five answer fast to get more points Cassandra cluster can be deployed on [Music] okay only one Cloud on the AWS anywhere any DC or ABS S3 your choice so time is up and this one was again very easy for you right okay yep Cassandra can be deployed on any combination yeah any combination of cloud providers simultaneously if you want to go multi-cloud that is a good result so that's the key point of the Cassandra good so all the leaderboard did very well and the rose dancer was the fastest keeping his second place but from Donnie gave more war of 20 once again right from dhoni Rose dancer and 30. that looks good okay and biondi is back in top 10 which is required good result we have already 50 people competing so ladies and gentlemen that's going to be question number six answer fast to get more points okay is it is it right or wrong only one cluster one DC is it right okay and the right answer was answer number four uh Cassandra cluster may have multiple data centers all data centers are active yep so looks like there are 13 people who say it what I believe possible multiple data centers but some of them are read only take a look read-only write only that exists only in relational databases world or some of the nosql databases world I don't know my sequel and so on in Cassandra World there is a uh every node is ready to answer any query write query or read query it's a decentralized masterless system that's why I love it there's no such thing as read only or write only on Cassandra and that was a mistake by Russ Johnson maybe answer it too fast of course Verdi uses this chance with his father to get to the second place and Reiki is automatically slides up to the third one and Romania stays calm and quiet on the first place let's go and that's question number seven answer fast to get more points uh what cap theorem States C A and B can be simultaneously reached only two of three can be reached only availability guaranteed uh and the fourth option I don't remember uh need new chairs cap yeah right okay uh mine no no no no no no no no no no no no no okay c-a-p yeah it was a hard one of course a cep theorem States what in case of emergency emergency failure outage any kind of a network issue or fail Power issue or whatever issue only two out of three capabilities are a guaranteed or can be achieved but not free of them right answer number two and you know what I expect quite some changes on the leaderboard now there were a lot of mistake oh okay here I'm done he makes it quite slow but uh gives the right answer and keeps the first place wow and take a look who is in the third place beyond the makes it back to the top three that's a competition that's a real game I like it and Buddy here Tanto familiar name is on place number four ready to fight for the first place well done everyone Let's Take a Look what comes next we still have some more questions and that's a question number eight so answer fast to get more points uh what's the recommended way to reach immediate consistency read write one all read write one one uh using video chat video chat yeah video chat video chat I always reach consistency with my colleagues using video chat there is no reason why Cassandra can do the same oh you see two people trusted us okay so the recommended way to reach immediate consistency is uh using I really amazed with the answers yeah yeah using uh consistency levels one all you can reach immediate consistency in deep but it's not the recommended array and read write one one is not the way you reach immediate consistency that's for sure so let's take a look what's going on on the leaderboard now oh no body and ROM dhoni I'm afraid wet was a part of mistake oh I'm done he gets only to the third place but that's still enough right fairly this time yeah okay and Beyond the climbs to the second place that's a good result and third you now have some quite solid gap on the first place we've almost 1 000 points difference to the second place and Robin was the fastest let me see what's going on on the next question that's a question number nine answer fast to get more points what is a key space someone asked about key please in the chat yeah yeah huh this is a tricky question actually yes of course hmm I don't want my quizzes to be simple that should be a real competition and the right question right answer is the second one and that was a wall wipe like 26 mistakes only on the first one so that's indeed second answer and now I'm quite afraid of the leaderboard thing and now ferdy ramdoni Ricky and Alodia make the mistake and Beyond the gets to my first place that's a fighter oh reality and take a look Robin now the fastest one uh like two times in a row already on the third place and Buddy herdanto is again on the fourth one again ready to fight for the third one that's quite a result but from Donny is still clear he's still close that's going to be question number 10 so hands for fast to get more points uh what is required in Cassandra tables partition Keys clustering columns data columns nothing is required everything is allowed and there is a question on YouTube chat is this video still accessible after the class yes this video will be accessible yes of course it will be recorded okay it was much easier partition key partition key is required clustering columns are optional so how it goes on the leaderboard who made a mistake this time ramdoni oh I'm sorry looks like he was in a rush to get back to the top three and made a mistake 30 is well known on the top first place of a leaderboard the only on the second Robin on the third and body is on the fourth but with the fastest answer which earns him a lot of points let's move on that's the question number 11 answer fast to get more points Cassandra table holds uh replication factors second one I don't remember third one was about rows and columns yeah all your rows and columns and multiple many partition or I choose the last one right oh that's quite an interesting distribution and looks like you was too much in a hurry so take a look replication factor is defined at pair key space not per table uh yes that's a tricky question but that's the most important question I believe take a look that's most common reason of mistakes and failures with Cassandra then people treat it as a MySQL without joints as I said already that means they misunderstood or underestimate importance of a partitions partitions are hold in tables and then in partitions already you have you hold ropes that's very very important to understand if you don't understand the concept of partitions and what a partition is a base unit of access not rows but partitions that's the only way to win so focus on partitions ladies and gentlemen they are matter and that was quite a wipe okay so far D keeps the first place and moreover moves on with the fastest answer well done Beyond these on the second place finally fairly the fastest ending oh yeah also the correct oh yeah and Robin is on the first place with the agung uh doing very well we still have a couple of questions so you have chances question number 12. answer fast to get more points how does Cassandra executes joints simply join using a skills that's my suggests uh uh it does joins but somehow lazy oh yeah also nice quite lazy and that was all wrong because Cassandra does not execute joints at all that Cassandra is a no sequel database and there are no joints in Cassandra that's also the important piece of information of Cassandra yep no join yeah I I want to say a word about that so take a look a well-deserved points were enough to keep the places in the top three but now the difference between top three and top four top five are much less and agunk which axono made the fastest right answer getting extremely close to the third place so now he or she I'm sorry I'm not sure um is it the male name it's a male name yeah no no yeah a real name or anything oh yeah good um okay uh so that's very close now uh what matters for us here is uh that's okay let's move on we are a little bit out of time I will explain it during the second Workshop what's going to be question routine this question will Define everything this question makes the leaderboard said and done and after that nothing can be changed ladies and gentlemen we proceed to the last question of this quiz and you know what to do answer fast to get more points uh if we have a data center with eight servers how many servers should be add to double performance of this data center four servers eight servers develop servers nothing can be done it's impossible to double Cassandra performance within a single Data Center okay so most of you gave the right answer uh take a look that's very important thing Cassandra highest performance in Cassandra linear scalability is a shared responsibility it means Cassandra has to do its job well and it does but also you have to do your job well and to learn how to do your job well you have to go to the next workshop with Stefano latini who will explain you how do you do the data model for Cassandra right but if your data model done right then if you want to double performance of the eight servers cluster you have to double amount of a server so the right answer is 8. 12 servers is too much and for servers that would be great to double cluster performance but by help of servers in that but sadly it's a little bit too optimistic right answer is 8. and we go to leaderboard and if you will see yourself on top of three places don't forget to make a screenshot of your leaderboard with your place specified I cannot believe in that all the top free participants made a mistake place make a screenshot of your screen uh if you you have a screen with your place currently uh yeah yes and there is a link uh Stefano paste the email of our community manager Jack frier please contact jack.fryer at datastacks.com to place your uh to claim your price don't forget to attach your screenshot and congratulations it was a very interesting competition it was just amazing that was like a real such a Twist positions changed so much that was that was

so uh then just join uh subscribe to our Channel by the way and uh participate in the next workshops and win prizes but first of all my congrats to the winners you did a really great job answering questions and learning something new my congratulations to all the top 10 on the leaderboard that was a competition of 50 people so if you see your name on the leaderboard that means you are in the very top first 10 out of for like 50 people that's already a great achievement and what matters the most if you purchase you will real winners are those who participated in this Cassandra day you now know something new you can be better in what you are doing you can get a better salary maybe better job and that's incredible now it's our time to proceed wearing two term very important Workshop right we go to uh data modeling yeah so it's it's time to leave for me uh see you later yes okay see you later and we will get back in a moment s [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] hey welcome again hello again so it was a great quiz lots of surprises and congratulations to anyone and to the winners yeah so we are starting this session right now Rahul so okay you should see my slides now and Alex is going to start I guess yes I think we can start great so we are right on time and uh yeah welcome this is a very important uh part of today and it is about data modeling uh subtitle building efficient applications because as you will see maybe even more important than in relational databases designing your data model properly is the key to success for your application and for its performance so let's start subtitle how not to shoot yourself in the food with Apache Cassandra that's not to scare you but we update the modeling seriously because that's the very important basic Foundation of a successful application when you have Cassandra as your database because Cassandra can give you much but you have to get to know it as you already started so just a very quick introduction just to remind you for those that might have tuned in right now um we are communicating on the YouTuber chat and also this video in its entirety of today will be there on YouTube for you to to review re-watch later anytime and you can ask questions in the chat because it's not only me and Alex but there is also there are also the SPs friends who are helping so you can ask them in English or Basin but remember that the YouTube chat will disappear when this is over today so you might want to ask your questions to the link that you see here for the later ask me anything session which is where we will discuss um the best questions and by the way the best questions will also get a prize and you can also vote somebody else's question so if you want to be eligible for the price put your name next to the question I've already seen there are many questions there many juicy questions waiting to be discussed uh the other option you can join our Discord channel that is a very thriving community and it's all about Cassandra and related things web development back-end development and so on and that is where the discussion goes on so you see here a few links we are going to paste them now and then today in the chat so please connect with us another point is that this this Workshop will be about two hours a bit less Maybe and we assume you know something about the fundamentals of Apache Cassandra that means what Alex just explained before lunch so um you might find it convenient to have a knowledge of what is a database maybe some of you know what this have experience with a relational database good but also careful because when you approach Cassandra from a relational perspective you have to unlearn some things and you will see what I mean so another last remark when is when I say Cassandra here I mean in a broad sense so Apache Cassandra but also data Stacks Enterprise which is a product built on on Apache Cassandra and also Astra DB asteroid B you know because you have been using that this morning to do a bit of exercises and they are all based on Cassandra so that being said let's start uh you know me already I'm Stefano I work at data stacks and here is are my contacts you are invited to connect with me and join me anytime so let's start what what are we going to see today first there will be a bit of introduction um about Cassandra for those who might be new to it just to set the stash then we will start speaking about the contents itself that is we will start with the idea of denormalization which is a key Concept in Cassandra data modeling then we will have a new another look at something that you already seen this morning namely how Cassandra stores data in groups data in keys and partitions which will then make us able to look closely at how querying works and then finally armed with this knowledge we will be able to look at how data modeling works and that's the most important part of this Workshop after that we will just round your knowledge with a few other important collateral Concepts so that being said let's start with introduction okay what is data modeling well broadly speaking data modeling is that operation that allows you to create your database in the best way to fit your application to make your application work best and data modeling starts with just an idea of what your application has to do and it will end when you create a database physically you create the tables and you create the tables with all of the details connected to it by the way Alex anytime there are interesting questions or there is anything feel free to stop me because I think we will spare some time throughout this Workshop so we will have time to touch a few questions okay so let me quickly review something that you have seen this morning with about Cassandra what is Cassandra well it is a high performance nosql database and as I as I mentioned it can give you so much but you have to learn how to use it so let's break this sentence down in a few of its aspects high performance in particular size Cassandra is designed to work at the so-called web scale so it can handle databases of hundreds of petabytes can you have an idea how big that is that is the scale of the web that is this modern Big Data applications that is all the rage nowadays and the nice thing is that Cassandra is able to do that with commodity Hardware so you usually don't have to buy very specialized super Computing expensive Hardware you just have to buy a lot of machines or even better you just to get them in the cloud and speed also performance in terms of speed Cassandra is optimized for fast rights but not that's not to say that reads are not fast but usually rides are the bottleneck for many databases Cassandra is specifically designed to support a very high right throughput uh you can have a throughput of tens of thousands of operation per second per node and when I say per node I imply that Cassandra is very distributed it's made to be distributed you can have databases made of thousands of nodes of single machines servers virtual servers Docker containers whatever they act as nodes and they share the data they communicate and this can also be delocalized you can have a single database spread over the world okay so it's a nosql database that's very important for us now because it means that it is not a relational database it is not based on the on the key pillars of relations and transactions there are no joins that's a very surprising and important concept there are no joints there are no foreign keys and there are to some extent to some great extent no transactions as you know them in relational databases uh you can already imagine that such a different structure compared to relational databases requires a very different way to think of how you structure your data we will come to this point later Okay so you can you have to learn how to use it that's because it's rather easy to just jump in Cassandra with a relational mindset and make are very underperforming very non-optimal data model that means you are not squeezing the power and the performance that you could from Cassandra and to to do to use Cassandra best you have to unlearn to forget something from your relational background if you come from that and that also requires you to know a bit of the internals of how Cassandra stores data and accesses data Alex is everything all right there yeah yeah okay so I just go on okay now there is an important point about Cassandra and about databases in general one usually speaks of two different uh kinds of workloads that you can have on databases one is oltp at the other end is olap all up so online transaction processing is that kind of approach that requires very many fast queries that you just that just have to work on a single piece of data very fast almost real time and they usually are always the same so you you you need something you need to change one single piece of data very fast all the time I don't know there is maybe some information about the warehouse a physical Warehouse you have to change the status of an item from from available to shipped and that has to be real time so that's very simple many queries and they have to be real time on the other end oil TP is usually customer facing site of application yeah because your customers don't want to wait you know like people so much in a hurry now if you don't answer immediately we will just switch to your competitor so oltp is something what has to happen all that time very very very very very fast yeah good point on the other hand a very different kind of use of database this is all up all up is usually let's say the kind of complex analytics you can have on a data warehousing platform let's say every Friday night there is a big analog analysis job that starts it takes hours to run it makes a lot of complex joins comparisons averages a lot of data crunching with a lot of CPU and that can take long that doesn't have to be necessarily very fast very real time actually it isn't because it's usually something that my own analytics department does for me to optimize next week's of special offers for my store or whatever usually the queries are changing constantly because it's a bit of a working process of experimentation where queries are complex and so on so it's not often customer facing and that's a very different kind of usage that's the data warehousing side of things um so usually relational databases sort of sit in the middle so they are a bit a bit good for every kind of workloads Cassandra in in comparison sits heavily on the oltp side so it's very let me say stupid actually it's very complex inside but it's best at being fast at simple changes in your data let's say and when I mean fast I mean fast so that's not to say that you can't pair Cassandra with all up workloads actually there was a question this morning on that by maybe I wrote it down uh no I didn't write this down but somebody asked a very interesting question on that you know you can actually pair uh Cassandra with tools like spark or Hadoop on top and you can have both best of both words but Cassandra itself is poised to be all ltp database all right I would uh I would say that no no all good I would say it this way if you are going to build a small house you may be fine hiring a single person who will do everything a walls roof uh Plumbing electricity and so on because it's like simple tiny uh house Cabin in the Woods it's maybe fine but if you are going to build the skyscraper you are going to hire multiple different persons because it's already much more advanced that's why when you run a tiny uh or well maybe not so tiny but when you run a small to medium-sized project you may be fine with mySQL or postgresql or something like that but on the huge projects with service oriented architecture with microservices people tend to use multiple different purpose-built databases not general purpose database like relational database but purpose build and they can have for example Cassandra working in t Apache Cassandra working in team with Apache spark spark for a lab queries Cassandra for oltp queries working together on the same data yeah that's sort of yeah the best of both words like like having your cake and internet too as they say um by the way a very practical thing to say is good luck working with queries over hundreds of petabytes so that's more or less the point the Practical point so but we will see then later okay so summarizing Cassandra is good to deal with big data very big data is highly available you saw it this morning it has no single point of failure it can withstand if properly configured it can basically have zero downtime in all conditions it is able to be geographically distributed so it meets a lot of uh nowadays important requirements and distributed means that you will have to deal with the cut theorem so you will have to do your choices but as you saw this morning you can pick your choice in a sense you can you can tune your consistency requirements it is very good at reading and writing fast and which is important and there was a question on that it is also vendor independent so it's open source protected by the Apache license so you can just use it on the other hand there might be some cons in that in in Cassandra one is that it is usually important to have qualified Engineers you can't just plug it and use it um it is it has a reputation for being a rather complex to manage because it's a heavy machinery it's heavy artillery today when you have to deal with heavy data it is as we said oltp specific mostly and it has limited search capabilities so it has no native full text search or similar matching word search or stuff like that but these cons have actually their counterpoints so yeah it requires qualified Engineers but that might be you tomorrow because by the way we offer for free to everyone who attends today we offer a voucher to get your take your exam for free and get certified and when you are certified you will usually be able to find a better wage in your position you can make your resume shine it's complex to manage yes maybe but there are today managed Solutions so you see you saw this morning a good example of a managed Cassandra in the cloud managed for you so the complexity is hidden from you or ltp yes but we just said that you can use spark Hadoop and similar distributed computation tools as for the limited search capabilities yeah but you can also plug leucine-based search engines elasticsearch or solar and they integrate pretty well so the cons are not so unsurmountable after all okay so before we jump into the topic let me quickly summarize the main differences that you will see today as far as data modeling is concerned between standard relational databases and Cassandra so in a standard database in a relation database you start you use a lot of joins and you use a lot of indices while Cassandra today's answers with denormalization and we will soon see what that means a relational database is based on the idea of referential integrity on Cassandra there is no such a thing it's your responsibility and that's mostly because referential Integrity is a very nice idea in theory but when it comes to very big quantities of data that have to be distributed there is no way to make this work fast as we need in a relational database the primary key controls uniqueness within the table while in Cassandra that's not only that but there is also the the concept of partitioning so you control how data is partitioned and how data is accessed you saw that already a bit now how queries work what kind of queries you can do and so on when you model data in a relational database you start with entities while in Cassandra as you will see it's important that you start from the queries you mean which means that the queries you need which means basically you start from the needs of your one application indeed the standard way of modeling that starts from the data and ends up with the application in Cassandra is inversed you start with the application and then you end up building your data your tables according to your application now that's all nice and good and uh Alexa are there any questions we want to touch uh nothing what I didn't answer already okay so let me go on denormalization that's the concept that is very important as I said and let's start with normalization so normalization is a noble and great concept that somehow is the foundation of the relational databases and it's an idea that is now 51 years old that was invented by Edgar Cod basically the founder of relational databases and the basic idea is that there are a series of constraints that a database has to a relational database has to obey called normal forms and they are there to ensure data Integrity so no contradictions in your data if you want the idea is that you never duplicate any piece of information this idea is a very well formulated and very consistent mathematical concept if you want and you see here in this slide an example so we have a table with recipes such as Pizza did I say already that I like pizza very much so you will see a lot of Pizza on today and then there is a table with ingredients such as mozzarella or champignons and to express the relation between pizza and its ingredient you have a third table that just contains you see it just contains numbers the code for pizza paired with the code for each ingredient so you see the name of pizza and the name of mozzarella is never duplicated is only there in one single place and relations are written in a separate table that's very good in theory and as you will see as you probably know it has a cost it has a performance cost so it's a nice idea but it might have a performance cost so that is to say it would not scale so well at the giant web scale of data I would say what uh the people may normally and people normally realize what joints can be slow especially when you go through multiple joints in a chain but they don't realize how slow they are and why it's so a big problem the main thing for you to understand here is what a chain of joints can be executed only one by one by one consequentially and you cannot run them in parallel and there is a simple law in the modern applications if you cannot run into parallel it's going to be way too slow whatever you are doing yeah and joins cannot be executed and parallel uh I mean just like there is no way to do it because you cannot do the next join before the previous one is completed yeah good point the point is that when you design something in 2021 you have to consider scaling to very big size and Cassandra is built on this idea and indeed it is able to scale and as you will see as you have seen this morning already when you access data the pro the right way in Cassandra you have constant access time so if you have 10 nodes in your cluster or 10 000 nodes the time to get your piece of data will be the same so that's very good and that's something that relational databases unfortunately are not so able to guarantee so okay normalization which we already said what is in the slide so the idea is that you start with tables that describe items in the world so a table for ingredients a table for recipes and then additional tables that describe relations instead of items and the advantage is so you see just some a bunch of SQL statements the good old ways and then you can decide later what what questions to ask so a good thing of relational databases is that once you have your once you have your tables you can have any you can ask basically any kind of question with from that from those tables so the prices that these these kind of queries involve joins so if you need in our example you need to know the ingredients of a pizza that requires joints but then that's a good thing from the same tables you just can have different kinds of of answers that's good but yeah joints are expensive they don't scale as we say so let's see what happens it happens historically that as database is increased in size database engineers in relational databases started to think yeah joints are good they work mathematically but I'm more focused on performance so let's duplicate the data here and there okay I know that I'm violating the normal forms but still I want this speed speed up so just a bit here and there I just duplicate the data and that's a bit of a clandestine thing too it's a bit of a violation of the model so it's risky in a relational database so what Cassandra does it says okay let's take this idea of duplicating data to make reading fast and let's make this idea a first class citizen in my database you see this table this table directly contains recipes and ingredients so you see there are two different rows with pizza one is pizza mozzarella and one is pizza champagneons oh the order pizza appears twice and Cassandra says who cares it's just fasted as long as I am able when I write data to handle this duplication I win a very important thing I win fast reads so basically you are moving the the concept that was the join you're removing it when you write data instead of when you read and this has two advantages one is that usually reading has to be fast because my web application is usually reading mostly so my customers will see very fast reads and they will not leave me for my competitor second point if your application when is writing let's say makes the join and writes the the denormalized data that can be made parallel easier than the joins as Alex was saying you can make them parallel this kind of right denormalization in writing so the idea of Cassandra is embrace the normalization as a foundational idea and just deal with that so you can scale up yep so I I want to add a point on that uh many people were taught in universities or whatever courses for denormalization is bad and I claim it's wrong uh the point is denormalization is bad when you do not know how to do normalization how to do denormalization and when you need what then denormalization controls you that is bad but then you control the normalization it's fine as long as you know what you are doing that's definitely exactly showing you how to do yeah that's a very good point thanks so yeah so the goal is um in Cassandra the goal is let's make let's design the data so that every query just goes to one single table and that's it like the table before right pizza ingredient Pizza ingredients if I want to know the ingredient for a pizza I just read that one table and I'm done no joins there are no joins so I have to do that so one table per query is a is an absolutely a low to follow and that's fast that's good for distributed systems because there are no joints so everything can be as fast as I want even if I scale my size of data the prices that the application in general has to deal with ensuring integrity and yeah you see this drawing in relational databases every query speaks with a certain number of tables while in Cassandra every table every query just goes to one single table okay so the idea is that I combine all columns that I need in a single table such as recipes and ingredients in one table no joins I will never try to repeat no joins today and queries are simple so even from a maintenance point of view queries are not those horrible Monsters made of tens of joints that I can never debug or optimize anymore they are simple all simple so the big takeaways are one table per query which implies I have to first know which are the queries I have to run and then I create a table and that's the the one line that maybe most important of today's talk and we will see it in detail and don't forget sorry don't forget that redundancy is your friend so no problem in having duplicated data right I wanted to add what it can be up to one table per one query and you can tell me you can tell us yes that's uh well quite a lot of work for developers and my answer is as a developer I do admit I have more work to do with Cassandra but as I get better paid for that I'm fine with that doing more work at the application layer yeah I like this observation very practical and there are some mechanisms and approaches to decrease this count so it can be one table per one query but normally there are ways what can help you improve these accounts yeah but still this would be let's say your ideal yeah thanks for best performance so yeah now pay attention to this one table per query is something that has to be because Cassandra doesn't work otherwise while one query per table is something that usually helps and usually has to be but you can also you can also have many queries going to the same tables but probably most of your queries will have each one its own table but okay so um don't forget that you can have duplicated data you might uh you know raise an eyebrow for that duplicated data the horror but don't forget that performance and keeping your customer is very more very much more precious than storage so disk is cheap right it's commodity disk usually it's not a super Computing expensive Hardware so disk is not so expensive after all nowadays these disk space is definitely cheaper than your reputation yeah and in order to be able to apply these ideas we have to Deep dive into how Cassandra stores data in tables so let's move to how keys and partitions work in dictating how data is stored in Cassandra are there any questions no no we are good we are answering great thank you so let's go on okay as I said it's important how you design the table how you choose your partitioning and your primary keys because that determines uniqueness in your table that determines how the how the rows are grouped and distributed among the nodes and it also has an effect on which are the queries that you can run okay I say it's not that you can't run other queries but other queries are so inefficient that you don't even dream of using them in production so it's the same as you can't run so today I will just assume you can't run the bad queries okay so never in production those uh you already I already mentioned the Full Table scans which are those queries that go asking to every node in the cluster and that's a terrible idea in production so it's just something that I will not even consider for a realistic application not only that but also the design of the table determines what is the needed information to write a row and this you need to know even if you are just a developer and you're not concerned with you know engine engineering your your database structure okay so let's start with a familiar concept to relational database uniqueness first as you saw already this morning a table in Cassandra is superficially a very similar concept to what is in a in a relational database so it's rows and columns think of it as a spreadsheet you see this this table here on screen you have some columns recipe name date and so on and you have rows every row is a single review of a recipe made by a particular reviewer on a given date so you see our application is a sort of uh cooking website where reviewers on a given date write their own review of pizza of cake and so on so you see I have recipe name date reviewer then rating that is a number the vote and a command okay now A Familiar concept is primary key the primary key you saw that this morning is a a set of columns that defines uniqueness of your rows that means that you can't have two rows with the same primary key values so you see in the in this uh in this table which I called reviews by recipe and the reason will be clear in a second in this table let's choose our primary key with the requirement of uniqueness so if I choose just recipe name as a primary key that clearly does not work because I have many different reviews of pizza so that's not enough maybe recipe name and reviewer might work because I might have different reviewers writing about pizza let's think if I if I just add rating to the primary key I don't think that makes much sense because I I don't want the same reviewer on the same date giving two different ratings to pizza right so that would be a Quantum thing so if Anita gives an eight to Pizza on the 1st of January that's it that's an eight I can't have a different row with a F4 let's say right so that doesn't make much sense and what about adding date that's also good and ultimately that depends on what is my application doing so do I allow Anita to give different rates to Pizza on different days that's my choice that depends on what my application is doing so those are both good choices and now just for the sake of going forward I will choose yes that I can store the whole history of ratings via Anita for pizza so I add date to the primary key so recipe name date and reviewer will be my primary key today and as you see I just marked them in blue just for as a reminder so now this table makes sense because you see every row has a different set of values for these three columns Alex sorry you're about to say something no no I'm good okay okay so so far so good that was say that is very similar to relational databases obviously once I choose the primary key if I insert a row I have to at least give the values of those three columns otherwise I'm not writing any precise row and also when I update a value when I update a row I can't change these that there was a question this morning on that I can't change the I can't edit the value of a field of a column that is part of the primary key because that would be more like ID literal and I create a new one so I can change the rating because Anita wants to edit her rating but I can't change any data into something else because it's a different row so that's the role of the primary key um now somebody might ask now we are using pizza but we might want to use a recipe ID and have a different table with recipe IDs and their name so yeah why not so that's actually something that depends on the exact flow of your application and it might work in some situations it might work better and that's a sort of a trace of relational approach and but actually in this case the relational the relation between tables so between IDs here and ID there would be done by your application basically and that might be also good that's there's nothing against that it depends on your application so every time you design an application you have to think whether to use natural keys or surrogate Keys as they are called so you can Generate random IDs for every item and use them elsewhere in your tables but that's really up to the application so there is a trace of relational if you want but today we stick to the Natural name Pizza as the key Okay so so far for for the primary key let's look at partitioning that's a concept uh more specific to Cassandra and other uh tabular nosql databases actually the partition key is a part of the primary key maybe all of it and it it tells me which rows will be grouped together in storing and it also tells me how are rows this group of rows how they are distributed scattered through the nodes making my cluster this is something that was uh explained in detail this morning by by Alex and I want to just refresh it because it's very important to have a good working data model so let's say let's jump into an example I have my table with reviews for recipes and I decide that the partitioning is made by recipe name so the partition key is recipe name as you can see in this graphic well probably you can't see much because there are a lot of tables and it's a it's a Max right that's because I'm in production and I set replication factor to three so every piece of data is actually on three different nodes so that's too complicated now let me let me switch to replication Factor one which makes it for a more readable schema and obviously I will not want to do that in production because it's too fragile but for today slides that's good so okay every one of these orange blobs is a is a is a node in my cluster and they share each one has a part of my table you see the whole table is spread as you can see every partition is identified by the name of the recipe and all rows for pizza are on one note all rows for pasta are on a different nodes and so on now you see on the bottom there is a node containing two partitions pie and fish no problem with that and usually any node contains more than one partition the opposite is the problem but that never happens so a partition is never split in pieces that are on different nodes a partition is always all together and that's very important so okay as we said each rows belong each row belongs to a partition depending on the value of recipe name in this case where is this partition it depends on the hashing algorithm that you saw this morning and decides the node that will host a given partition in its entirety all the partition is on that one node now if I want my queries to be fast I probably want that every query just has to go on one single node so it's very fast that means that I my query will have to work within a single partition and that's a very important low if I want my application to be fast I have to design my tables so that every query the application needs will be going to a single node that means every query will have to access one only partition all of it part of it no problem but no more than one partition and that's allow that I ask you to remember for later now just as an experiment a thought experiment if I change partitioning for the same table so same primary key in the recipe name reviewer date but just a different partitioning look what happened the the data the rows are distributed in a very different way but again partitions are all together so you see look at this node on the right salad Aldo salad Aldo that's a partition now because recipe name and reviewer to find the partition and that's not split that's always that's all there on that one node and that is true for all nodes here so if I choose a different partitioning the same data will be grouped differently and then since I want my queries to access every time a single node choosing the partitioning enables me some queries and not other and that's very important now you might ask what is the right choice for a partition well as I just said it depends on the query look at these two examples the two examples that we just saw they group data differently the same data now the choice on the left is able to give me all reviews for pizza at once so if my application needs that I need such a table while the choice on the right is able to give me all all reviews by on a given recipe by a given reviewer if I need only that from my application that's maybe a best choice and there are compromises to be done so if I I might want to go for the left choice but maybe there my partitions are going to become too big and this is a point we touched this morning okay so all good so far Alex yep we are good okay great so let's go on because I think many of you now have a question but I might need to do all kind of queries on the same data yeah probably so look at this example I want all reviews of pizza but I also want to see all reviews by a given reviewer for all recipes yes the answer is create two tables what's the matter again disk space is cheaper than performance so yes I can create two tables and basically keep them aligned in my own application so yeah I must take care of doing two insertions per every piece of data yes so that's what I meant when I said it's not only one table per query but maybe sometimes one query per table so I need to access the same data in two different ways probably I might have to do two different tables no problem so that's that's something that is strange to relational approaches but that's exactly the Cassandra way so keep that in mind let's go home Okay so all these all Goods so far uh I just want to draw your attention to some typical problems that we mentioned this morning already let's say at some point so everybody knows that pizza is good and maybe soup I I don't like soup as I like pizza honestly so I can imagine my my reviewers to continuously constantly write reviews about pizza and maybe not much of soup so that is not a good so if I if I have pizza if I have recipe name as a partition key in this case I end up with a partition being very small and never written and the other one the one for pizza being very big and constantly written all the time that means that I'm not using my nodes very well because many nodes are just sitting there idle and one single note has to deal with the pizza partition all the time so I'm actually having a bottleneck and that's the hot partition problem so to heal this problem usually one has to rethink partitioning and maybe also invent some different techniques to handle the data in in their application to handle the flow of the application differently another problem and you saw it this morning with the iot sensor example real life example by the way I might have partitioning that works but then time goes by and these partitions start to pile up to accumulate rows and rows and rows and at the end they are too big and there the solution might be bucketing for example so you can invent a synthetic new column built from a column that I already had just to slice a partition so that it doesn't become too big let's say there's there is this year month string that I invent from the date just to group every month in a single partition so that they are not becoming indefinitely big and I seal them when a month is over and I move to the next partition then probably in my application I I probably can imagine that I never have to look at all the history at once so that might probably work uh that's a typical solution and it's the bucketing solution uh you saw that this morning already so I'll just uh skip ahead okay so partitioning I hope you are now convinced that it's very important so it is something that you have to know for a good data model so the points are every query should always be able to go to a single partition for performance that means the Mantra is stored together what you retrieve together another point is be careful because partitions cannot be too big again for performance so there are some hard some soft limits to avoid the performance penalties as you see them on on the right um so it's not good to have giant partitions but don't worry because it's absolutely not a problem to have very small partitions indeed you can also have partitions made each by a single row that's absolutely fine and can you guess when this happens well this happens whenever your primary key is the partition key the whole primary key is used for partitioning that by definition is means that every partition is one single row and then you have to take care that your load on the partitions it must be as evenly distributed as you can so you can exploit your nodes the best way otherwise you have hot spots and idle nodes that you are not using so that's not so good okay I just mentioned the possibility of having one row per partition but that's not necessary you can actually have more than one row within a partition that's when that happens when the primary key is not completely the partition key so you have additional columns these additional columns we call clustering columns and those are in the example you see those are the one in blue and they are date and reviewer because recipe name we use it for partitioning to group together data but then within a given partition let's say within the pizza partition I have different dates and different reviewers so how how is data sorted in within the partition well they they are kept always sorted by Cassandra both on disk and in memory according to these columns um by the way yeah maybe the example is the best way to explain that I have many different reviews on pizza and if since the order is recipe name date and reviewer they will inside the pizza partition they will be sorted by date and as you can see in the salad case if the date is the same they will be sorted by reviewer by the way you can also choose whether it's ascending or descending but knowing the clustering and having control over the clustering is very important because do you remember when I said that your query has to go to a single partition but it can also go it can also no problem if it gets more than one row as long as it's within the partition well yes your query can get more than one row but for efficiency Cassandra lets you only get contiguous chunks of the partition so let's say Cassandra is able to scroll through the partition but it always Scrolls through the data within the partition in that particular order that you define here and this is an authoring that you define when you design the table and then you can't change it on that table it's just like it is and this has have implications on the queries so you should keep that in mind when you design your your your clustering yeah indeed how to choose clustering look at your queries because Cassandra Scrolls through within the partition in the order defined by the clustering so look at these two examples those are very slightly different choices for the table both have the same Partition by recipe but then the clustering is date reviewer in one case and in the other case it's a reviewer and date so you see here there are two different queries the typical query might be I need all Pizza reviews from that date or from that date onward ah you now know how the data is sorted within the partition so you can easily see that this kind of query is answered by the table on the left because then date is the first clustering column is the most important one while if I need reviews of pizza from card any data I need the choice on the right because then Reviewer is the first clustering column remember what is in the partition and how it is the or what is the order within them so and that defines the query you can you can have now there are also queries that you can run other queries that you can run on the same tables there are queries that you can run on both tables because you might want just all bits reviews and that's it so you get the whole partition in both cases but usually the precise queries will tell you how to fix how to choose partitioning and clustering that's very important okay so I hope this concept is now clear we will see it popping up again but in the meantime um I want just to show you some cql code you saw that this morning you also probably run it yourself in your in our small Hands-On session this is how you create the table in SQL now the the table will have a so this statement create table is very similar to SQL by the way look so create table name and then there is a bunch of field or column with the type column type column type then look at this primary key statement here primary key contains all the three fields that we decided are in the primary key recipe name date and reviewer and you see these additional parenthesis the the reddish part here that's how you specified what is the partition part of the primary key and that's the syntax after that you also you usually want to specify the Sorting order whether ascending or descending of the clustering columns if there are any so basically this is the command you run this morning I just wanted to show you so um let's summarize quickly the relation between the various keys because that might be a lot at once so the whole primary key is is what defines uniqueness of rows that's say a conceptual thing the rest of the table is data columns within the primary key in general you have a subset of columns that is the partitioning and that is defining the physical way data is grouped over the nodes and there has to be partitioning you can't have tables without partitioning and yeah every partition is only on one single node or better there is a partition is never split across nodes your query will have to go to a single partition to be efficient so it's important to make the right choice if there are additional columns in the primary key those are clustering columns and they Define the ordering within the partition so whether date come before reviewer or the opposite is also important because that determines how the data is sorted within the partition which in turn tells me what queries I can do I'll we will see it better later okay so much for partitioning and keys and this is one of the most important parts so I'm very happy that we managed to go in much detail on this and I have I want to ask Alex if some interesting questions came out we might want to well uh many thanks to you but uh in general all the other questions are answered very good yeah very good so we are perfectly on schedule so there will be time to to play a little maybe at the end Okay so next section is writing or better querying so read and write but I will start with writing because it's easier uh a very important point that I want to make clear at the beginning is Cassandra wants to be fast especially wants to be able to write fast that means that when I say right I just mean right so you didn't see much of how the right path Works in detail within Cassandra but the main point is that in order to be as fast as possible Cassandra does never look well never usually in the general usage Cassandra does not look at the table before writing anything uh what they mean by that I mean that insert and update are the same operation because you just write usually Cassandra does not check the table before allowing you to write so in indeed in certain updates are basically the same operation and we usually call that absurd now there is a very kind a very tiny corner of difference that is related to counters but we will we are good to ignore that today so let's say in certain updates are the same that's important because it's important also because uh the database will never tell you oh wait this this row exists already be careful when you write no you have to just write and that's important because many uh okay there is a pattern in relational databases that is I don't want to overwrite data so I try to write with an insert and the database the relational database will usually complain so I can I catch this error in my application and do this and that accordingly well be careful because that does not work in Cassandra that's for the sake of speed so if you just write a row and then write a new row with the same primary key you are silently overwriting it uh now there are ways to control these and you will quickly see them at the end but those are not meant to be the main basis your whole data model is based on because that then you kill performance okay so uh well the Syntax for inserting data is very simple by the way you run some commands this morning and it's just very similar to SQL insert into table then you list the column names and they usually have to contain the whole primary key at least the partition key values and you have you provide the same list of values matching the name of the columns and that's it so this this statement you see here this SQL statement will insert one of the reviews made by Carl on Pizza on that particular day and with a rating and a comment very good so Carl likes Pizza apparently very good I do too did I say that already you know what Stefano if you did this data modeling Workshop based on Pizza what uh what I would do like should I build one based on vodka yeah we might make a beverage section of this up this sample application okay so I I by the way I also mentioned spaetzel later in the talk so since you're based in Germany well spetzel are Fabish but still they are very popular in the whole of Germany so I like them a lot but not like pizza I have to say so okay so uh let's move on to the most important part that is reading reading data most important because not only uh you usually read your reading is customer facing more often than writing in most applications but also because it involves some more subtleties and let's see what that means so um by the way don't be don't be fooled by how similar cql the Cassandra query language how similar it is to SQL because this superficial similarity uh it's a it's a gift and a curse so it also hides a bit of the underlying differences in architecture but uh yeah back to the point these you see here some a little piece of SQL code that reads data so select columns from table where conditions that's very simple by the way also this com a similar command uh we run this morning and this is the typical result I would get so a bunch of results each one is a let's say Zooey gave rating two of pizza Carl gave a nine and so on but there's a difference with relational databases in SQL because there are a lot more constraints when you read I mean I I guess now you can you can imagine them but let's look at them in detail because you must query single partition and the reads within the partition will follow the same sequence as the data the rows are stored so there are some constraints let's look at them the where close is the most important because the where Clause must specify at least the partition key with equal signs so you should have field equal value for the whole partition key not necessarily the the primary key but the partition key yes that's because you have to tell the reading to go to a single node to access a single partition then within the partition you can but you're not not necessary but you can specify some or all of the clustering columns but again if you specify them you have to specify all of them to a point so you can't just skip the first clustering column and go to the second try to imagine why well the reason is that you would have a leapfrog way of reading your data within the partition so you would not have any more a contiguous scanning of the partition and that's not good for Cassandra and for the same reason if you can have inequalities so you can have range queries so date greater than something but only on the last clustering column you're specifying for the same reason because otherwise we would have a skipping thing you would ever a leapfrog access within the partition and that's not performing last thing the workloads should not and cannot involve columns that are not in the primary key not at all that sounds like a very harsh specification but remember you can duplicate your data you can create more tables so this is somehow the other side of the flip side of that coin a secondary indexes can help you um improve the third point but they have their own limitations yeah so we'll briefly mention them at the end but yeah they are a very helpful tool and they are indeed uh powerful but besides it's not so easy to learn how to use them properly it's very easy to misuse them and most important again if your data model is completely built on using secondary indices that's probably a sign that you can invent a better data model there is a question uh by uh Rahul can you explain why use were secondary indexes the idea of secondary indexes here is very simple normally you can query your data and search your data uh only then you specify any parts of a primary key so you must specify partition key and you can query data by any of the clustering columns left to right but if you will try to query for data column which is not part of a primary key Cassandra won't you do that I won't do that it will throw an exception like that's not allowed you can do it if you build um on that if you build on that secondary indexes you can query also by data column so it will work but uh you have to be careful on that because I said secondary indexes have their own limitations yeah Rahul stay tuned because by the end of this presentation I'll have a slide with an example and we'll just maybe mention the reason for this limitation so again since it's not it doesn't it should not be the foundation of your data model so we we put it at the end of the presentation just as a thing additional thing you better know and uh yeah we you will see an example but then we will you will you can find a lot more information on secondary indices in the in the documentation so let's just mention that later shall we so okay uh by the way um probably those of you who used Cassandra already might encounter this uh questioned uh oh how do you say opinionated statement allow filtering that you can add to a query uh I will for those of you who know this statement I will basically pretend this does not exist because we are in production and we don't want to use this statement what what what does allow filtering do it's uh oh that's bad things bad things sorry but uh what does a low filtering do bad things very bad things yes very bad things happen so I love filtering uh is a way to open the way to queries that are very inefficient because it's a way to say okay I'm okay dear cluster I am okay with in with speaking with all of the notes at once and getting my data in a bad way so it's something that you might want to do if you have a very small amount of data if you're testing if you are developing as a test but if this is used in production bad things happen so I will Ex okay there are exceptions but they are pretty Advanced use cases so I will just pretend it doesn't exist if it's okay for you I want just to add one more thing uh speaking uh seriously speaking for real um a low filtering can be harmful a low filtering can be dangerous what does that mean if you are a developer do not use a low filtering if you see your colleague using a low filtering stop him or her and if you are with you and those neighbor to you those next to you yeah yeah the point is uh that's quite a typical use case when some Junior developer just joined if your team has no idea about Cassandra but already has to work with it what do you do let's say the love Peter into all queries it works yeah yeah I mean I build my query uh query doesn't work I go Google that Google says use a low filtering I put a low filtering query Works yay now I put a little filtering to all of my queries and if nobody your cluster sucks yeah then your cluster sucks then your clients are unhappy just before just just why because before letting your Junior work with a production code you didn't send him the record of his Workshop yes and maybe he didn't get the certification which is for free yeah and all the courses are for free and they are very valuable yeah but my point yep the real point is and my real performance is if you have if you are a team leader if you are an architect if you're someone somehow responsible for a code and code quality if you have continuous integration and code quality checks I do recommend you to add checks for a low filtering uh in your code because it indeed can be harmful very high for their production cluster yeah so you have to catch it before it reaches your production remember when you said Cassandra is very powerful but you have to know how to use it yeah if you start slapping allow filtering in your production code you might really uh divide by 10 the efficiency and the performance of your cluster easily because you keep the cluster all the time very very strained and it will have trouble of all kinds the best thing is that it just works slow and even worse can happen yeah but I think we scared our audience enough we love filtering let's move on right okay so let's summarize about where it closes so where closes must specify the partition key they have to deal carefully with clustering columns and they can't involve other columns so here look on the right on the upper right I summarize the structure of my table recipe name is partition key and date reviewer are clustering columns so these are all permitted where Clauses so recipe name equal Pizza Perfect the whole partition no problem recipe name equal pizza and date equal something okay uh block within the partition contiguous block because of how the Sorting is arranged recipe name equal pizza and date greater than something is also good it's a continuous block within a single partition recipe name equals solid and date equals something and reviewer greater than Bob is also good think of how the structure within the partition is defined the ordering that's good that's a contiguous block recipe name equals salad date greater than something and date lesser than something is also good it's a completely well-formed range query within the partition no problem so these are all good uh counter examples and I make them in red as in danger because they will not work let's say rating equal nine come on rating is not even in the partition key it's not even in the primary key it just don't work recipe name equal Pizza and writing equal nine no not even if I specify the partition even there I can't just go for the value of the rating column recipe name greater than pizza no because that's partition so if I say greater than pizza I'm still trying to get a lot of partitions let's say I'm getting apricot or a cake but maybe not satsiki anyway it's many partitions because it's a alphabetic order so no recipe name equals salad that would be good and reviewer equal card I skipped the date so again that would be a leapfrog way of accessing a single partition but still no good and the last example also doesn't work because recipe name equals salad and date lesser than something that would be good but and reviewer equal card again same thing as before LeapFrog access no good so these are all bad queries okay uh now just to complete the this this topic this is the full syntax the official syntax of the select statement and this is not even looking so different than um SQL but just be be aware that many of the parts of this of this statement are heavily constrained as we just saw um yeah so that's more or less just it and I think we are closing this very important section so I will repeat that once more writing you have to provide the primary key if you want to write a single row and don't forget that inserting and updating are just absurd so you will silently overwrite a previously existing row if there is any there are exceptions we will see them later and as for reading there are heavy constraints that's the price to pay to have the table structure that allows you to scale and to be fast and to deal with giant amount of data so you have to specify the whole partition one single partition so the whole partition key with equal signs and when it comes to clustering columns if you are specifying them you have to think of how the ordering within the partition works and you have to go for contiguous chunks of data there and you can't you just can't mention any other column in the where part of your select uh I think what you just saw should have convinced you that you start from the query and then you design the table because yeah there are very heavy constraints but that's that's life that's the price to pay to be able to scale and once you know that as Alex was saying uh it is if you if you are controlling the data model then it's all good if you're controlling the normalization it's all good you just have to be aware of the compromises here at play and keep control on your side okay Alex um I guess you have been dealing with some questions so yep there's something that might be of interest to anybody no no if there would be any I would tell you great okay so let's go ahead and this is the um sorry yeah before we go ahead I want to say thank you to all of the attendees who are still with us because that's already many hours after the event begins and you are still with us you just best of the best thank you yeah thank you because you are a very valuable uh colleague and support and friend and mate in in this in this day that's going to be yeah thank you guys especially by the way because we don't speak bazan so you are a valuable help in that as well yeah maybe you have seen me writing some buzz on in in the chat that's thanks to Google Translate so I don't speak a word fortunately so yeah so okay let's start with the titular part of this talk and data modeling itself so all of this was very important tools to be able to address this point how do you practically design your tables how do you start your data modeling with Cassandra as we anticipated you start with the application and its requirement then you model the data and then you build the actual tables and this is summarized by this by this uh flowchart so let me say that data modeling is both a science and an art because yeah it's a science because it's been formalized very tightly in a precise methodology but that's not the end of it because you just don't have you just it's not just that you follow the rules because you have also to think and to make some choices at the end you have to think and make some choices let's say from your heart and there is also some some creativity involved so we will see it later in in the last stash um so basically we start with understanding the data involved in my application and this is uh ER diagram which is probably familiar to all of your relational data engineers at the same time it's very important and it's uh yeah one of the most important parts you look at your application from the start so simultaneously with understanding the data you look at your application you look at the workflow of your application and these two by the way this is the part where you will mostly speak with non-technical people so product designers users sales people anybody because you have to understand what your application is going to do yes even in a non-technical way because then it's up to you to merge these two information and map them to queries basically so to to us sorry a set of queries and then you will start from the queries and you will write down the logical data model so every query will require a table so you can now start designing your table at least in an abstract way what is called The Logical data model from The Logical data model you then derive the physical data model that is the final structure of your tables basically it's a set of create stable statements if you want and this tab will involve some optimization and some practical choices okay so let's start with the conceptual data model that's the typical entity relation diagram and yeah you speak around you also speak with non-technical people as I said and you uh end up with a mapping of the entities that play a role in your application and the relations between them and each one of those entities are relation will have some attributes right so you have recipes in this example you have reviewers and they are related by the relation that a recipe has reviews by some reviewer and both entities and relations have have their own attributes so a review might have a date a rating a comment a reviewer might have a URL of their website of picture of their face a recipe might have a name might have a preparation time a category I don't know Suite or first dishes and so on okay that's very similar to relational starting point but then things change because the other step to be done together with this oh yeah by the way sorry I forgot this is also the step where you start thinking whether you should use you remember your other issue you you should use a natural keys or surrogate keys to relate things so shall I have recipe ID or just the name Pizza as a as an end as a attribute these are similar questions might start already here uh simultaneously you should already have a good idea of the workflow of your application so let's see I'm thinking of an application where user goes to my website and they won't say they want to search for pizza and once they click Pizza they want to see all reviews for pizza let's say the most recent first well then I probably want a table so there is a query that you ever write as select or reviews for a recipe name sorted reason first let's say this will be answered by a table reviews by recipe then I can imagine my web application and there are recipes and one recipes is by Anita so a user might want to click on view all recipes by Anita and that's you see there is a proper workflow between queries now there is a second query select all reviews by Anita sorted reason first of all recipes so for pizza for soup for everything and that's probably as you saw so far I think you know that now is going to be answered by a different table at least it's a different query and it's going to be a different table we call this table reviews by reviewer because that's going to be partitioned differently because of my query right another way another kind of interaction of the user with my website would be they want to look at the profile for Anita or for car with the profile picture the websites I don't know the appearances in in the cooking shows Etc so there might be a third query select a reviewer by name and that's probably going to be answered by a yet another new table which we call reviewers so that's a simple example and let's go on because now I see I know which are the entities mapped in this relation relation diagram and I know my queries and my workflow so here are my queries and that's a good point to map my queries to actual SQL statements so let's look at my first query select all reviews for a recipe name sorted reason first and then I make it into a proper SQL statement look at this select reviewer rating comment from reviews by recipe so far so good and this is now important because it's aware condition where recipe name equal pizza because I want reviews for a recipe and date greater than this so why do I add this well because probably I want to I don't want to show a review that is too old so that's probably the good way to go and anyway I'm going to sort them by date so that's you will see now you know how clustering works so this requirement in the workloads basically it's the same as saying I want the recipes to be sorted by date and yeah let's concentrate on this first query because that will lead us to designing the table and this is the the step of the logical data model so I look at my query and I start drawing what is called Chipotle diagram and that is a notation to easily express my table in a Cassandra data model you see how it works I have a series of rows each one is a column each one will be a column in my table and with symbols such as K and C I'm noting down what is the partition key and what are if there are any what are the clustering columns and the other data columns so how does it work well I look at what are the entities and relationships attribute that I need from this query so reviewer rating and comment I need them but then I look at the equality conditions so recipe name equal Pizza tells me what is basically the partition key then I look at inequality conditions so there is an an inequality on date in the workload that tells me that date is going to be a clustering column so I'm really building out of an algorithm I'm building my table then I look at ordering so I need data to be decreasing that's easier that's the easiest choice and that's not the end of it because I also have to take care of Unicity so even though reviewers has not yet been consider for clustering I need that to be part of the primary key so I also add reviewer to the clustering columns just out of Unicity once this is done I have my draft for a table and that table will work with my query um there is still something to be done namely I have to finalize and to go to the physical data model this is a good point to start thinking about the problems we already mentioned hot partitions large partitions I estimate what size will the partition be whether there will be data imbalance workload imbalance stuff like that and it's also a good point to start thinking of the data types because Cassandra has several data types so I can decide that date is going to be guess what a date Reviewer is going to be a text rating is an integer and so on there are also some other choices here to be done because I might choose several ways to handle denormalization such as user-defined types static columns something that I just mentioned passing by so um collection types and so on so there are various ways to handle denormalization and one-to-many relationships in Cassandra and for that I have a small internet about data types so very quickly um these are the main data types that are available in Cassandra you see there are some there are some times that you probably know such as text integer float Boolean binary blob stuff like that then integer or float have different sub types so to speak there are various precisions there are types dealing with dates time unique timestamps con unique uh so time stamps in the unique sense and also unique IDs encoding also timestamps unique ideas to core uh there is also something called counter that is a sort of a special thing and yeah it is useful it also has its own limitations so we will not touch it more than this today but the nice thing is that you also can have collection types so you see that the usual collection data types you can have list of stuff so list of dates you can have set of texts you can have a map between text and integers and you can also have tuples and as data types for a column so you can have uh you can have uh mentions in Social mentions many as a single column for a reviewer if you want so you can have a single column that is a set of numbers whatever that's not the end of it you can also have user defined types so you can create a type called reviewer with name the subfields such as here ID name photo URL and score and then you can have a column called review of type reviewer so you see there are various ways to encode the relations if you want to to denormalize in creative ways in Cassandra okay back to us this was just to show you that there is a lot of choice to be done when completing the data model and making the table physical data model in this case we just do a small optimization we think oh wait rating is not going to be any number it's just 0 to 10. so instead of integer rating we make it a small end which takes a little less bytes why not so the diagram you see on the right is the final physical diagram it has all information needed to create a table indeed we now have a create table full-fledged statement and this is the final statement that creates the table and uh yeah that's the end of it so we our journey into data model has finished we have our data model we just have to write the application we know which queries to use and we are good to go yeah that's been quite a journey um let's see if I have to summarize a data model in a single slide that would be the slide indeed that is the slide so you start with your application needs and you end up with creating physical tables and the process is summarized by from the queries to creating the tables you I hope I convinced you that there is a process that is mostly on an algorithm with some inputs from your creativity and and experience so the partition key will come from which are the rows that I have to get at once the clustering columns again I will repeat it endlessly depends on how so they dictate how is how are the rows arranged within the partition and then clustering columns and maybe other columns will be the data I have to get back from my queries then I add I add some performance considerations to jump to the physical data model some optimizations some calculations on the projected the partition size and so on and that's it then my final advice which is a very important thing is please spend enough time on data modeling because its time well spent yeah if you start your application after uh thinking carefully about your data model you will not have to migrate it painfully afterwards which might be a bit of a pain because let's say your application is running you have customers you serve customers and you notice that your data model is not so perfect after all now you might have to do a migration maybe you can't afford the downtime so that's going to be a rough month or more yep so I would sincerely try to avoid that that's very important I want to clarify a bit on that I mean why take a look in Cassandra partition Keys Define how data is distributed over cluster and clustering key defines how data is store it on a node and basically you are not allow it to change any part of a primary key because you know there is a pink in SQL called it alter table yeah well you want to change something in a table alter table exists in Cassandra and exists in Cassandra Ecuador language but it's extremely limited and basically you cannot touch anything but relates to primary key any parts of it because you want to change a partition key it will bring the recalculation of all the tokens and reshuffling of all the data of a cluster which is yeah which is obviously no go because all your cluster will be busy moving data instead of answering your customers queries so that makes no sense and changing any part of a clustering key will lead to rewriting all data on the disks all partitions yeah uh so that's again a complete no-go because all your cluster will be busy you rewrite it on the disk instead of transferring queries as a result basically as model once created its primary key cannot be changed and it's quite easy to design a proper data model when you are migrating from a relational database for an existing application to Cassandra why because you already know your queries you just go and watch your queries on your existing application with relational database and you write them in form of SQL and you know which tables you have to create then you design something from scratch that's a very different story that's and that that's a very well said by Stefan spend time on modeling it's a time well spent yeah absolutely so let's say you have to do this this uh unfortunate migration how would you do about it let's say you have a lot of free space on this can you have a lot of uh notes then you might start to create a new set of tables with a new structure you will keep serving the application from the old tables and you will start writing twice on the old and the new for a lot of time then you will have a job that copies the data from the old tables to the corresponding new tables all the while serving your customers and then after painful testing you would secretly jump on reading from the new tables and then after that you would delete the old tables so that's those of you who went through such a thing also in other similar systems you know that migrations are something that makes your hair go white so please uh think carefully about data modeling that being said it's time well spent and if you are planning on writing an application that has to be very powerful Cassandra is going to be your friend absolutely okay so that's very good and I think we reached the end of the most important part of this talk there is still time because it's 20s we have another 25 minutes to go through a bit of alternates right before closing um let's start with LWT which stands for lightweight transactions which are also called CIS compare and set okay so um you remember when I said that whether you insert or you update for Cassandra it's the same it's just something that goes writing and if necessary it will secretly silently overwrite previous data yeah that's the point so inserts and updates are the same and I can hear you saying wait there are situations where I don't want to overwrite a row if it's there already and maybe somebody says I want to update conditionally I want to update this drawer only if the previous value is this one um yeah that's true so you might be tempted so there are in your application there are probably Parts where you want to do that and in your application you might be tempted to do that in your code so you read that piece of data you do your logic in your code if this then right that's an anti-pattern for a very simple reason there are no transactions in Cassandra so you it might end you might run into race conditions right so there are two different applications two different instances they read they do their calculation and they write but this happens at the same time and you end up with a uh unpredictable result so write reading before writing in general in Cassandra is an anti-pattern besides being not so performant but the main point is race conditions and then you will say okay so what can we do well the answer are these are kept secrets so far for a reason but there are so-called lightweight transactions so look at this syntax this is an insert with the final Clause that is if not exists so I want to write this row only if it doesn't exist yet on the database such a statement I can run and it will have two different outcomes you can have applied the true okay inserted or you can have no I could not apply because the the read the the row existed already there is another similar usage of lightweight transactions so I can I may want to update a value only if the previous value was so and so so in this case I want to update the rating to 9 only if it was 2 previously and also here I will get either applied true as a response or applied false and the previous rating was five so that's why I couldn't that's why Cassandra could not apply it so there are these are a sort of a miniature transactions but and you you can use them and there are cases where you should use them but let's be very clear on the on the Care on the caution to be had so lightweight transactions have use cases and the typical example is you have a small table of users and you there is an interface to create a new user in your in your application you probably don't want two different uh two different browsers to create the same user with the same ID same email say at the same time because then that would be a mess with the passwords or stuff like that or maybe when you want to change a password you want to change it only if the previous password matches right then because you want to avoid race conditions you can actually Ask Cassandra to uh transactionally take care of that or maybe you have an item in your Warehouse that has five items you are shipping one and you want to move from five to four only if the previous value is 4 is 5 otherwise you fail and then you do it again or so anyway stuff like that you know uh small uh circumscribed limited cases of transactional behavior let's say the point is that these operations are do not gain do not have the super fast performance as the rest of Cassandra because there is indeed a transaction going on at least the nodes have to speak to each other to agree on a change simultaneously that is implemented with our consensus protocol that is called paxos but this protocol this Behavior to occur requires the nodes to speak to each other a few times so you have lower performance which might be good say for the creating user case because I don't see creating users to be the main workload of your application but if the whole of your application is based on these transactions then there's something going wrong with your data model another caveat is that when we say lightweight transactions lightweight does not mean light performance it means light guarantees so there is no database lock as in a relational database transaction so it's not that the whole database is locked you can do whatever you want and then you commit there is nothing like that in Cassandra it's just a very small localized lock on that one partition usually um yeah and there is no uh rollback so it's not right it's not a transaction as you might imagine it's something to be used sparingly because it's not good for performance so if it's the main pillar of your application think your data model again that being said there are use cases where you should do that Alex we want to add something on these yes always yeah go ahead yep so um well basically everything all the most important things are say it already by you thank you so much um I would add two things so for actually free things one more time that is not a transaction in the relational uh world like in the relational world where you have Commit roll back and fancy things like that the point is um traditional transaction with rollbacks and so on require a database log and on the high pressure under dozens millions of queries per second we cannot afford this log because log on the openly accessed point of data may just paralyze your clients on the oversight of the ocean and so on and so forth so there are no database logs and verify there are no rollbacks so you cannot commit transaction when decide you don't want to do it and roll it roll it back it's just read ahead of right second Stefano said that already but people start but people still don't realize a point they think okay lightweight transaction is a read before right then though so basically it sounds like I do read when I do write so it will cost me like two operations no okay I can afford that well yes and no because lightweight transaction by the performance and time costs actually four to five code four to five times more expensive but simple uh right because of all their consensuses on the replica servers so in some scenarios it may be cheaper to do it on the application layer first do read then do right if read continuous there is no data uh because there is let's say quite a minor chance what a very the same millisecond uh to John Smith's with the same emails yeah we'll try to register on your uh application so uh for the sample use case I would suggest a different use case when you really need lightweight transaction imagine someone your client buying something from you at the same time from a mobile phone and from the laptop and there are different connections to deeper different application servers right and first application server loads his statement his account data from the database and second reads his account statement from the database so we have two copies on the application servers when he buys something simultaneously on the mobile phone and on the laptop but he has enough money only for one operation not for both of them as a result if you just do the appear operation without lightweight transaction he will get two things but although he was allowed to get only one and that's quite a bad situation because let's say by the rules of your application your customers are not allowed to go into the minus on their debit account for example in this case to avoid that you need to use lightweight transactions do you have an example of LBT with if in the end like the SQL this is right right oh that's exactly right but yes that's the point yeah so you can say for example account State the beginning of operation was two hundred dollars and you say update a customer account set State like I don't know let's say 80 dollars if State equals a previous value like whatever I just told 100 or 200 so if it's equal to the expected value if you have this lvt and both application servers execute this update then first update will be executed successfully because amount of money or on the on his bank account much as we expected but then second operation tries to complete uh then it sees what the expected amount doesn't much real amount operation is stopped applied false because of amount of money doesn't much we expect and then your application layer of business logic can handle this situation and say okay sorry uh you don't have enough money on your account so for these kind of operations when a really business business critical that's lvt a good match yeah well I think that's a very compelling point the way you put it yeah I just want to add one thing uh okay Alex yeah yeah we are good okay sorry I just want to remark that Mr Helmut used not to like spec Foo as you see because rating was two but then he decided that spatzel are very good and since this is a German dish that might be of interest for you so Shake Elmo's hand for me because I like pretzels okay just to you know relief we always say very terrible things that can happen with Cassandra so I have to make a bit of a comedy part right of course Eric Ramirez in the comments so I was sorry hi Eric I can't see the chat because I don't have double monitor today so yeah hello welcome see you later then okay so let me go ahead that was it for for lightweight transactions uh we have another 15 minutes let me quickly go through batches um but I want to go quick because we might have I want to show you some practice thing that I that you might want to do later so batches the concept of batches is this is another of the tools in your belt to to use Cassandra and it's one of the one of those tools that end up with us saying use it but sparingly so be it careful batches allowed to allow you to run multiple statements in a sort of atomic way uh so you can pack many statements and send them at once to the server for execution yes so you sure have less overhead you have less communication with this with between client and server and you also have a very strong retry mechanism that tries to ensure everything is executed within the batch uh in a bet you you are limited to only DML statements so only data changing stuff so insert updates deletes but now comes the important thing it's yes it is atomic sort of but it's not a transaction for example there is no rollback for the same reason as before so that would be too costly to coordinate a rollback in a 1000 node cluster spread over the world and so on you would just freeze your whole database and that's no good um rights are still made one by one so it is sort of atomic but it's not isolated in the AC the terminology so you might end up reading partial results of your patch if you hit the wrong millisecond plus there might be edge cases so a node might fail and you might end up having a partial rights so what are batch is good for well the golden cases are either when you are writing on two tables with the same partitioning so you group those statements let's say you have two different tables that contain the same data for different queries as we saw before you see there are just differences in in part in a clustering here and you want to insert a new review of a new recipe in two tables at once well if you think about that it's two tables but that's going to hit the same node because the partitioning is the same so it's absolutely safe to group those into a single batch and to send them to the server at once that's a golden case another similar case is that you might just have a bunch of reviews that fall into the same table the same partition and you just want to speak to the server at once look here I have two different previews of falafel they go to the same partition and I can group them into a batch and just ask the server please that one node please execute this multiple right that's good and nice that's I I mean I'm going fast because those are clear cases that just to be they're just the advantage here the problem comes when batches are used in the wrong way so for sure Cassandra batches are not bulk insertions so a super mega anti-pattern is to think ah batches I can put all kind of Rights there and just send them to the server that's absolutely against performance because you will start sending a single batch that has to speak with lots of notes and that will be I mean that will be executed but it will involve a lot of slowness and coordination and will probably time out if you exaggerate so it's not for bulk insertion by the way within the batch you have no guarantee of order of execution so the batch is internally reorganized according to something you don't have control to other uh then okay technically you can't mix counters and lightweight transactions with other operation in batches those are details so there are item potent batches on not that important and if you start acting on multiple partitions in a single batch you will have performance degradation because then there is some coordination to be had um as soon as your batch is not the golden type you will have a so-called logged patches automatically you can also specify that but the point is that login batches work in a slightly different way they store a lot of what is going to be executed they execute the statement and then they delete the log this is to internally ensure coordination and in a sense similar problems as the lightweight transactions are into play here because then you will have a communication and overhead and uh well the lesson is before using batches get some knowledge on them because they have to be used only when needed and only in the map in the manner they are invented for and again if they are the main point of your data model you might want to review that again uh I would skip ahead because batches are something a bit that you can then look up when you are advancing in your data model Journey and let me just quickly very quickly go over a few other points two or three of them one is time to leave that has been mentioned already this morning speaking of the iot example uh you should be aware that when you insert cells you might given an explicit time to leave to this cell so well let's say when I insert a row I can give it a time to leave when I insert a single value of a single row I can give it a time to leave and then this value or this row will automatically disappear after a given number of seconds that is very useful and it might be used in for clever Solutions but yeah you have to be aware that it is always personal uh that has a weird consequence so let's say I insert a whole row with the time to leave then 10 minutes later I update one value with the same time to leave now what happens that in some of the cells in that row will expire earlier than other so I will end up having partial row after a given amount of time and I wonder where did it come from so okay use time to leave there are very valid use cases but take care when you do that so that's just it but it's a very useful tool anyway uh that's just a quick mention I will just skip ahead in this season and we come to Rahul question finally so these are indices okay now a very important point so far all of today has been um about create multiple tables be careful of your queries you can query the table only in one way and so on that's true and that's the main pillar you should build your data model on but still there are indices you can build what are called secondary indices in Cassandra on tables on existing tables and this is an example Rahul and everyone you see uh there is a query here that first would not work because Reviewer is just part of the primary key but it's not a partition so you see the error tells you that and then you create an index on this column based on the table that already exists and then magically the query will work and by the way Helmut appears not to like spatzel at all anymore because echeloft means disgusting so poor Helmut has a change changes his mind a lot over this this recipe in this example now there are some caveats over creation and indices and some limitations so uh the most important thing is that you can you can index you should index columns only when they have medium cardinality so when there are not just two values like a Boolean and not one different value per each row because there you would get the best performance otherwise it's almost uh useless way of indexing or anyway performance wise is terrible um and you should take into account that indices are distributed exactly as in the base table so even if I index on a new on a column like reviewer the index will be spread over nodes as the data in the original table so I will have pieces of reviewer equal helmet here and there and there that means that if I'm interested in just a row by reviewer that would be good but if I want to have all reviews by Helmut the index is not the right way to go because again that would require me to speak with a lot of notes so in many cases you should think carefully and probably it would be better to have just two tables and maintain them by hand in many cases so think carefully uh yes so um I used to have a slide over materialized views but I think I'll skip that just know that there are materialized views but they are consider experimental so you might want to have a look there should be tables that are maintained for you as mirrors of an existing table in uh according to their own new Partition key just know that but by the way Cassandra 4 came out after a long time of uh performance Improvement and new features and it came out recently a few couple of months ago or more materialized viewers are still experimental so I'm not even mentioning them anymore at the moment so they have their own opinions there are opinion contrasting opinions on that uh some data Architects says what data Stacks Enterprise version implementation of materialized views are significantly better but let's say there are also some people well I mean like Cassandra Engineers what contradict this opinion yeah so our recommendation especially as for beginner um Cassandra users avoid materializer to use at this moment and before using them get some more knowledge and maybe speak with somebody on say community datastates.com and get gather some opinions there is a question what got me uh like what got my interest indeed uh buddy hertanto asks in what cases that select TTL will be used ah okay so Eric already answered that okay surprise it yeah it's been knowing how long will will uh that piece of data be available basically but okay okay so um I think we we come to the conclusion and we have five good minutes for a very important thing um yeah I think you have been exposed to a lot of interesting Concepts and there is there will be much to think about today uh and after today but honestly two hours are not enough to to to explore data modeling in Cassandra so you are strongly invited to find out more uh maybe Alex you can paste the link to the learning uh course I have it by website and also the academy as well because you see uh well we have the academy for uh courses and to to to to get your prepared maybe for the certification or whatever which yeah we spoke about that already but in particular I want to draw your attention on this Hands-On exercises um so you say this this first link here datastlash.com learn data modeling by example uh there you I'll I'll show you that in a second the point is that those are interactive exercises which are a bit of lessons lecture plus interactive exercise that you can do in your browser and they are different exercises about data modeling with use cases and examples and they will guide you through more and more understanding of what is data modeling through practical cases uh you will interact with a real Cassandra installation in the browser and you will end up learning a lot of things and surprise surprise if you finish any one scenario and you send us a screenshot of your final screen you will get a completion badge so you can reach us here um maybe Alex you can write these two links I already did but I will do it again okay and the com the final screen would look something like this one congratulations you completed the scenario and then there is some explanation of which scenario you completed um that's more or less it so I have a final slide of thank you but I want to quickly very quickly show you this this is the page Alex should have sent you the link to already and you see there are a few data modeling by example and let's open any one of them so there you see there is a very well built learning material and by the end of it you will end up with an interactive scenario that you can start and guess who prepared these scenarios no less than the person diagrams are uh and they name it here named after so yeah he is the author of data modeling methodology for Apache Cassandra so I think uh you would uh be in very good hands with these scenarios and yeah good luck and see you when you submit your completed scenario I hope you will learn a lot by that right I think with that unless there are some other questions I think it's um let me see it's 5 45 right yep and we have to switch to ask me anything yes just one last moment so ladies and gentlemen I see some of you already submitting their homeworks for the first workshop and that's great that means what you will get your page for Cassandra fundamentals now you can get the second one if you complete the thing uh just uh Stefano just send you pick any uh scenario which is the most interesting for you personally I would suggest sensor data modeling um which is obviously is datastacks.com learn data modeling by example incredible courses there are seven options you pick you can pick one you like the best uh you like the most in the end make a screenshot send it to me or Stefano on LinkedIn links to our linkedins are in chat and we will issue a second page so one day but two pages and a voucher for a free certification isn't that amazing ah yeah it is so uh Alex just a question um is there a bubble for me in in the AMA uh I give me a moment okay I believe at the moment we anyway uh switch to hold on okay for a second and we will discuss it and so uh don't switch off ask me anything if your questions start in a minute give us a minute for setup and we will get back to you and you can use this minute for whatever you need yeah because we will also need a minute or two see you soon so stay tuned see you soon yep [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] hey everyone looks like we are back online with our incredible experts so let's do a quick check if you can see us if you can hear us set the thumbs up in the YouTube chat right now and we will start but for me it looks like we are good okay already started scenario for sensor data modeling buttons just a blank page okay where it works for me let me check yeah okay but uh what matter is we will do it anyway first questions and answers and I think we can start looks like yeah we can see looks like we are good with video and audio on congrats so we can proceed and uh let's start with first things first question is uh let me help to translate me right okay so the first question from Budi hertanto um how is the replication technique in Cassandra to ensure there is no oh effect uh on the performance when the when the data becomes so huge yeah that's the first question from so uh do you want to answer this one yes yes I think yeah so go on oh no I mean yes uh maybe uh some of you okay Eric yeah Eric why don't you start yes so um you're probably thinking about replication in the way that uh for example if you did it with Oracle or anything like that so in Cassandra replication happens in real time so when you do a write so it doesn't matter if it's an insert update or a delete that mutation gets sent to all the replicas so it doesn't matter if your replicas are on the other side of the globe um It Gets Sent there in real time so it's not something so it's not something that's batched or you know it's not something that's scheduled to say get you know all the rights in the last five seconds get sent at a specific time and it doesn't work like that so the data size is not an issue right as long as your data model done done right which we already discussed for the last couple of hours okay so I if anyone doesn't want to add anything to this I will mark this done and uh so many people voted for your question so it's obviously a best question uh from the audience point of view please contact us using the links and the YouTube chat me or Stefano on LinkedIn we will need your address congrats okay there is a question about uh select distinct uh thing yeah okay is it possible to do this thing on Cassandra and if there's not uh what is the alternative lecture so yes there is a um an option to do a select this thing but for me if you're asking this question if you have to do a select this thing it tells me that maybe you're doing a select on multiple partitions which doesn't perform very well um so the Cassandra is designed for High Velocity transactions so you're meant to be selecting um you're meant to be retrieving just one partition not multiple records um but the quick answer is yes you can do a select this thing if I try to avoid that um it means that it probably tells me that maybe you got your data model wrong that's a great answer I have nothing to add anyone okay so let's move on to the next one I like this one I want to take this one so Denny asks uh what happens to existing data in my cluster when I add new nodes the general idea is when you have some servers let's say we speak about a small cluster of free servers one single data center free servers uh what happens to existing data in your cluster when you add new notes take a look there are three servers responsible for all their data in the cluster therefore all the possible token ranges are allocated between three of them then you add uh new nodes those token ranges will be recalculated automatically by Cassandra so you simply start new cluster start new server sorry join a new join this cluster with this server and cluster then recalculates token ranges gives part of responsibilities to store data to this server and then transfers data streams data to the new node so when it's bootstrap it it starts also to answer queries and accept writing requests basically that's what happens anyone wants to add something yeah exactly exactly that it automatically balances so it redistributes the the data so that it's balanced across all the nodes so if you started off with say three nodes and you add a fourth note um you'll end up with 25 of the data between all the formats right um just a point that this affects newly written data but to to to be sure the old data the data already existing goes in a new place uh you should you're supposed to run a manual repair just to make sure every piece of data will be dispatched to the right place and again we mentioned the consistent hashing that has the consequence that the minimal amount of data moving around takes place that's detailed but it's important that's important detail yeah Cassandra is well optimized for risk scenarios and yeah I like this question that's a good one and I like the automation behind that okay so Nikki that's for you okay yep so when the data is distributed how is if we want to query data from all zipper isn't it going to be slow because it has to be connecting to every server um maybe I can add something maybe or what booty means here something like select all select star from some table without mentioning partition what what about that Cassie yeah uh So my answer would be if you have 1 000 of servers in your cluster and if you run a stupid query with a low filtering with no real conditions and partitions yes it's obviously going to be slow but we are here to teach you not to do that so that would be my answer right um so if you need to select you know the whole if you need to do a full table scan then that's probably an analytics workload not a you know not an online transaction workload um and so if you were using spark spark would uh uh split the the data into smaller chunks and it won't do a full table scan right okay so fast oh sorry I want uh to mark this as answer it anyone wants to add something good nope good okay well uh again your step yep okay what's the main difference between Apache control with mongodb which both uh have the same bass no no SQL yeah okay that's one of the most uh openly asked questions I would say how Cassandra compares to mongodb because mongodb is one of the most known nosql databases and uh Cassandra as well so what's the principle difference first of all I have to highlight a point nosql is not a one particular type of a database nosql is a wide bunch of very different database families and there are many hundreds of different nosql databases and they are very very different so um and mongodb and Cassandra belongs to different families so their behavior is different there are many uh again different differences between them I would from my side mention first two um uses so-called schema less approach which is technically not correct because it's a flexible schema but it's still inside uh but for developer it's kind of hidden so it's known as schemales and with Cassandra you have to design table first before storing data so from the flexibility point of view mongodb makes uh kinda some benefit but there are many different also points to compare for example if you want to scale out Cassandra for reading queries like if you have a lot of reading collaborations but not so many rights Cassandra can make it but it still has these primary server secondary server uh kinda masterful approach more or less traditional and then you want to scale it forward with writes you can be quite deep in troubles because it ain't so easy to scale for brights and at some point at some point it just don't work as well quite opposite Cassandra because of his decentralized no single point of failure architecture is a very good feed for a scaling also um for rights not only for reads briefly speaking  can handle uh these flexible schema or schema layers documents which is great if you need that but if you understand the structure of your data and you going to have more operations per second when  can handle then Cassandra definitely can be your choice last Point Cassandra is a better feed for multi-dated Center deployments uh gentlemen I'm done if you want to add anything Stefano um I think I'm good with that I was addressing a question in the chat actually so yeah so before you answer that I was going to answer that follow-up question from Buddhism so just to just to add so you choose mongodb because you like storing stuff in Json documents it's like Alex said it's flexible it's easy to store data because you will if you've already got the the Json for it it's easy to store stuff but and here's the big but when you get to play with the big voice with the internet Giants when you need to scale you you have you don't have a choice you have to switch to Cassandra um because Cassandra is optimized for High Velocity throughput um whereas mongodb um and that there's nothing wrong with Moto DB right but um we have a lot of users that come to us to say we've got a problem it doesn't scale um and so they switch to Cassandra that's the major difference right yeah I would add a point on that so you see uh those questions like Cassandra  or any in our database people ask them all the time um there is nothing wrong with Cassandra there is nothing wrong with and sometimes those questions like what is better Hummer or range range is better when you need range Hammer is better when you need Hammer uh it's quite easy we cannot say What range is better when Hummer or Hammer is better than range it all depends on your needs okay is a great database and I like it there are just scenarios to feel better for Cassandra or wherever just scenarios to feel better for Mongol yeah so I I might add one small thing that uh for those of you who prefer to work with a so-called schema-less approaches but still you want to use Cassandra uh there are ways to plug a layer on top of Cassandra that makes it look like uh even though there is an underlying Cassandra with all of its guarantees you can still interact with it in a document way in a schema less way and that is something I will briefly mention in the later application development talk there's a open source tool called the Stargate that is a API layer on top of Cassandra that opens the way to accessing the data in a document schema-less way so just as a parenthesis it's not Cassandra itself but it's an open source tool that neatly integrates with that yeah absolutely and thank you for mentioning that Stargate indeed can be a great tool for many scenarios so I guess we've answered it respawn now uh Denny each of the following is just going to say can we just quickly answer um the follow-up questions from buddhi yeah sure I wanted to go you know I'm done go ahead please oh yeah oh yeah so just gonna say um so Buddy's follow-up question was they have situations where they want to do multi-partitioning reads that's what his original question was about um again there are ways of doing it you can there's a thing called the in operator so in and then brackets you specify the keys that you want to retrieve from the database um you know we provide that this is convenience so that you can do like two or three keys like you can do a read of two or three partitions um but again you know if if you need to have like lots if you need to scan lots of um partitions you probably want either got your data model wrong or two you probably have an analytics workload and you need to offload that workload to something like spark because spark can handle it more efficiently than SQL direct cql uh select statements absolutely and I would say or what in general there isn't that's not a disaster but it's not a huge problem then your uh query from time to time access to free uh partitions okay that's an additional network operations and so on but no one will die let's say uh what's the real problem is like the things like a low filtering or query being without the partition keys and so on and so forth but the occasional querying for two free partitions it's completely fine I mean yeah of course it's a it will be a little bit slower but it still will be very fast in comparison with many other databases okay so we can proceed uh well then denim which of the following is a replication strategy of Cassandra to specify how data can be replicated uh so I would say there are two primary things to consider first thing call that replication strategy and second thing called it snitch about the replication strategy we discuss it a little bit already so basically there are two kinds of replication strategy simple and network topology aware a simple strategy cares about nothing it's good for your development environment for your laptop but bad for production or any kind of production like environment and network topology aware strategy is about to put data within single uh data center as far away from each hour as possible so all of replicas won't be located in the same server wreck now there is a second Point snitch what is Snitch and how it matters snitch is exactly the tool what replication strategy will use to identify uh in topology where are the what are the data centers or whatever server wrecks so how exactly do we put data uh far away from each other within single data centers so it will be more reliable uh very very simple snitch is basically based on file properties every Cassandra node you start you can write a configuration file so it is located in data center one server Rec a and then these uh file based snitch we'll take a look at these configuration files to make the decisions with replication strategy there are more advanced Sneetches for example AWS Amazon web services based snitch which understands that apology of Amazon web services deployments and knows what Vera regions and availability zones and it help networked apology aware strategy to allocate replicas as far away from which hour is possible therefore to different availability zones a gentlemen I'm good I think you've covered it okay good wow so boom okay so we are giving some further links in the chat just for to to go deeper but okay those are obviously a bit of a more in detail thing so take down them as uh say the start of new Journeys so yeah okay so the next question from Modi once again okay yeah so it is mentioned that Cassandra is masterless to avoid as POF but then there are some coordinated coordinator nodes or are these notes become a potentially become spof yeah yeah so may I just say something on this sure very quickly because I think the answer is pretty simple uh so there is to be made a very important distinction between a node being coordinator as in a master architect Master Slave architecture and the node being query coordinator so when a node is query coordinator his special role is only there for the duration of the query so your application reaches the cluster to ask for some data for example and it will hit a single node that node for the only for the duration of the query yes we have a special role because it will be the node speaking to other nodes collecting the data ensuring the consistency works and everything and then coming back to you with the answer yes so that will be a special role for that node but once the results are given to you to the client so it's not coordinated so the role of coordinator is doesn't exist anymore so it's a very short-lived thing which means that yes your query might fail because uh in that very moment the node might have a problem because you know something might happen but then in the worst case you just retry the query one millisecond later on another node and drivers by the way are also able to do that for you but all in all in the general long term so to speak in the long-term architecture of Cassandra still there is no special node so yeah query coordinator but not coordinator in any greater sense right uh then as soon as you start to speak very coordinator um people from relational database backgrounds start to think of that as a master note which is completely wrong it's yeah let's say I have a cluster of five nodes single data center which one of them are query coordinators all of them the one who gets the query will be query will coordinate mcquarian if if server a gets the query it will coordinator query if server C gets the query it will coordinate the query so that's basically how it works every node is a coordinator node yeah and by the way if I may add something usually the drivers might be made aware of the token distribution in the cluster so when you do a query on a partition usually the drivers will know which nodes to hit to directly reach a node that holds the data so it will generally skip one useless jump of data because it will directly go to a good node with the my data so yeah which is a good segue for the next question all right right I just wanted to say what we answered questions in a row well done yeah cool I didn't see it so I close first one right yeah and uh this one we also just answer it uh uh there is no really query coordinator whoever gets the note will be query coordinator and um as just seven or eight client always tries to contact uh the replica node because it knows data location over the cluster and token ranges over the cluster if for any reason it cannot reach a replica note then it may retry it to just the node consider it closed so if I can just explain so that the Cassandra drivers have a built-in load balance load balancer within the driver itself so you don't actually need to use a load balancer or a virtual IP in front of the cluster so you can fit when you um uh use the driver in your application you can figure it to the same to say um which load balancing policy you want so there are different kinds of load balancing policy so there's a DC aware load balancing policy so that it knows that it will try to contact a local DC instead of a DC that's on the other side of the globe um there's the token away which um Stefano was talking about so token aware means that the driver knows where the data lives within your cluster so you might have 100 nodes but it knows for example that node um a is where the partition lives so it will try to prefer that in a token away policy there's also a latency aware policy so it prefers the contact nodes which are fast compared to nodes which have uh you know had a higher latency we're a little bit slower to respond in the last five seconds so by default if the driver if you don't tell it which load balancing policy to use it will do the DC aware and the the token aware wrapped inside it um by default so that's how it knows which notes the contact is a coordinator note and don't want to get into too much details but when you when when your application talks to the driver to send a request to the cluster um there's a query plan that gets built the query plan is a list of nodes that people contact so um and those are the list of possible nodes that will be used as coordinator and it tracks each one in turn like you could end up in a 50 note cluster you know you could end up with like 30 30 of them being part of the query plan um and if the driver will try them one by one until until one of the notes um responds doesn't have to do all 30 it will just contact the very first one and the very first one response will be used as the coordinator node obviously the driver now knows if a node is for example has been shut down it won't include it in the query plan so it won't be considered um to be a coordinator for that requests and this happens for every single request that you send to the cluster uh yep thank you so much uh I want to uh use my administrative privileges to move one question above because it's extremely important for us uh actually give me a moment I'm almost done yep here we go uh so sorry for moving it I had the queue but I find it very important um we already mentioned it many times what SQL has very limited search capabilities and um what are the ways for us to solve The Limited search capabilities because obviously search is essential for any kind of for any kind of applications Muslim how would you answer gentlemen Cassandra is like we said Cassandra's optimized for very fast reads and to get very fast reads you're retrieving a single partition when we talk about brief form search um you're no longer retrieving just one partition you're effectively doing a table scan um and so we need to have something like elasticsearch or Apache solar that does an inverted index of your data so that you can quickly do a search against those indices and then retrieve the partition that satisfies yours your free for search query uh gentlemen anyone else yeah that's that's okay for me yep uh well that's uh that sounds great for me um that so the point is uh Teamwork Makes dream work uh someone alone cannot be good enough in everything so if you want to reach great goals if you want to build not a heart in the wood in the woods but if you want to build the skyscraper you need to have a good team a typical teaming for search or for example analytical queries for Cassandra will be a patch solar Apache spark elasticsearch where is a more or less a known project known as Alessandro which unites Best of Both Worlds and so on in short answer is just unite uh make teamwork of that good yeah so next question uh by the way uh Stefano how much time do we have left so it's uh let me do the conversion for the guys the listeners uh it's a 16 20 now so we have 10 minutes more 10 minutes okay so I as we answer it most voted questions already I suggest us to speed up because we still have 57 questions left thank you and uh so let's no way we will make them all but yeah yeah we cannot make them all I can pick some so yeah um so next one I'm not sure I uh really understand that question what efficiency Cassandra to tuning and migration DB maybe maybe ask your question on community.datastacks.com because it doesn't make sense to us um just so in the interest of time so the next one is can I change replication factor on a lot cluster yes absolutely um yeah yeah this one is easy yes you can win you need to run repairs yep I think and for the next if I'm not wrong in particular if you increase the replication Factor you have to run repair yes if you decrease it you can leave it like that but probably you want to do a cleanup to avoid the useless replications user useless replicas from sitting there and you want to free space right right that should be it right yep but in almost all cases um we recommend replication factors of three for each data center in your class there's no I cannot think of any use case where you shouldn't have replication factor of three yeah I agree completely yeah and no it cannot be changed automatically I mean you can if you specify some special script to do so but in general I would avoid that because it's the decision what has to be done by uh people not by robots in the 99 persons and nine in periods scenarios I don't see it as a variable replication Factor scripted operation in any case yeah uh operations in Cassandra are like there are no offline operations in Cassandra yeah yeah Cassandra is designed for 100 percent of time so uh sudano please answer please ask your question again at community.datastacks.com and we will take care of it but for now we are not ready to answer sorry I will temporarily close it please okay let me answer the quickest quick question from mirzaiah um in Bahasa so um [Music] then we can okay um it means that um they don't perform well uh particularly when we're talking Cassandra because you have billions and billions of partitions um and your tables are massive when we're talking Cassandra you're not you don't have a toy application anymore it works in like my sequel or you know postgres because you have tiny amounts of data in Cassandra your users don't want to wait you know seconds or minutes they they when they open up their app they want to be able to see the data straight away right okay uh I will get one uh from the bottom but very quickly regarding data security does Cassandra have access control features authorization authentication yes sure all of us said it used by Enterprises all across the world so everything what you may think of uh uh what differences between Cassandra and our open source um I I want I want to add one sentence to this answer yes just one very quick thing not only that but there is also support for all kinds of encryption in transit and in storage just to complete the picture yeah okay uh so what's the difference between Cassandra and over open source DB I'm sorry but there are hundreds of open uh Source DBS and if you would take to compare Cassandra with each one of them it would take next I would say years so uh that's too general question I'm sorry you choose Cassandra because you have a scale problem it's as simple as that yeah okay this one is actually uh not technical but maybe uh you guys can help so uh someone asking he is a teacher here oh he is teacher and he asks and how Cassandra can be used on education Fields can you give some example yeah thank you uh yep so first of all Cassandra is open source so you cannot you you can use it free of charge uh second if you don't want to install Cassandra but still can use it I still want to use it for educational purposes you definitely should take a look at Astra so Astra DB is Cassandra as a service and it has a very very rich free tier where you use Cassandra but don't pay anything as long as you don't have production like workloads with dozens of millions of queries um then it's free for you it's sponsored by data Stacks um and poor education you can use our academy.datastars.com with free courses they are in English but now we will have very good subtitles I'm working on that so at least if you can read English you can you will be fine with that we've already answered with the um search so we can skip that um and Tommy we've talked about um using um Spark so um yes Cassandra is a good fit for analytics use spark because that's the most popular but of course you can use you know like you can do Hadoop stuff as well but you know Everyone likes using Spark yeah the next slide okay which one this one or we you once were it already yeah that's the one I was talking about okay all up workouts so this one sorry this one was answered already Yes Cassandra supports end-to-end encryption okay great not only so not only between client and server if I may add but also between nodes if you want so if you have say regulation requirements that's good for you yes yes no to node client to note no to client and so on regarding this question Cassandra is not suitable Cassandra is perfect yeah good so this one we need translation enough okay yeah uh Ken Apache Cassandra become solution for uh save huge data and uh because there are so many uh database solution here uh using centralized architecture I think the answer is clear from uh today from what you saw today so it is it doesn't have a Central master or point of failure so if you want big data and not centralized data distributed then Cassandra it's probably going to be your solution yep yeah good okay next one okay um Cassandra supports uh multi-bc backups uh whether it's on premise whether you got hybrid deployments like you know some of your DCS are on premise some of your thesis are on the public Cloud we support all of those use cases okay uh which I'm sorry Eric you are way ahead of me which question which questions okay but do you understand uh thumb oh really okay yeah great great great okay then I will close it as answer well I think multi-cluster and backup are easy to understand in Baza yeah right yeah yeah okay but I'm not sure I understand these questions sorry yeah I think the the answer could be there are no transactions in Cassandra if I get it right so transaction in general don't scale so well uh so if you mean a transaction like can meet rollback like in the so there is an interesting development of the story there are no general purpose transactions in Cassandra yet but there is a Cassandra enhancement proposal which may be accepted and then after some time we in theory could have general purpose transactions uh but it's very unclear yet if it will be accepted ever and if if even it will be accepted when it will appear in Cassandra it may take years because we cannot risk stability of the database so big changes take a lot of time to put I've lost it is not easy to make it friends with the current philosophy because it's kind of being fast right and say say goodbye to to transactions in a sense but yeah next question about data data visualization and data modeling tools um halfway is a very popular one for Cassandra it's also KDM um if you wanna if you wanna if you want to get the details of where those are um just post a question on community.datorsacks.com and we'll send you the links uh yeah sorry I think the the question is what is actually the purpose of data modeling yeah the purpose yeah the proposed the function the purpose of I would say yeah I would say you you do data model to create the right database to make your application fly oh sorry sorry my mistake yeah it is is there any tools for modeling yeah yeah highlighting a kdn yeah and they have support for cql for Cassandra data model in particular they are graphical you can drag and drop and build a lot of nice stuff and it will create I think if a mountain is taken they create the actual statement SQL statements for you at the end I don't like using them good uh okay so is it possible to select data from Cassandra only for a certain period of time yes of course but if you do a range query so uh after yesterday but before last month that has to be a clustering column it cannot be partition key obviously because on partition Keys you cannot have inequalities so it has to be a clustering column and it cannot be data column because on the clustering column and partitions key can be using for querying wait unless unless you want queries for that particular month and then the month might be your part okay in which case so anyway the general answer I would say is yes if you design your table accordingly premam that's the right answer right so I think we are a bit uh short on time at this point so I would say we have to stop here okay so Alex just a question did we introduce Eric at the beginning no we didn't so maybe he deserves it oh yes definitely definitely Eric is a bit of my hero because it's patrolling the questions the community and giving always a lot of answers and he's a knowledge uh Giant and he's also very active in answering and helping anybody so you should be you should consider yourself lucky to have him here and thank you Eric for being here on a Saturday so yeah thank you a lot absolutely helpful I I I'm I'm only to double on that uh because Eric is our community hero and you know what there are a lot of people who answer questions about Cassandra and sometimes it's a problem because not all of them giving the right answers so Eric is the one who use the right answers uh and that's incredible absolutely okay yeah so at this moment ask me anything is done if your question was unanswered please proceed to the community.datastacks.com and we can discuss it there or you can also use our Discord link is in the description of a video and our next step going to be stepping our next step is your talk I'll speak about the application development so I will show you a few examples and briefly survey the status of the node.js driver in particular great so I have to say many thanks to Eric Ramirez for joining us on Saturday for joining thank you so much joining us on Saturday uh many thanks to DK for try for translating and answering questions and absolutely we will meet again uh in the final words right after um yeah yeah so we now have application development that is 45 minutes so at 16 sorry at 5 15 we will just uh meet again to say goodbye to every one of you and to close the session close the day yeah so see you soon [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] yeah okay so we are back uh so first of all thank you for the very nice uh question session it was uh interesting the there were a lot of nice questions and it was a pleasure to discuss a bit more in detail with you now uh before the end of today which is going which has been and it's going to be a full day we will briefly survey uh something about application development as you can imagine this is a topic that goes well beyond 45 minutes so I will try to just give you an idea and run some example I prefer to put a bit less things and show you some working code simple simple examples just to give your feeling of how easy it is to start nevertheless uh originally my plan was to have some Hands-On session for you as well but unfortunately 45 minutes is really too short for that but I found a way to sort of find a solution so let's see application development now um let's start with the start you're writing an application and this application will be using a Cassandra as your database you need something between your code and the database right and usually the answer is you need a driver indeed look at this in this graphic I in my in my sketch I draw a driver within your code or within your serverless functions if you have a serverless architecture or within your API anyway this driver will be able to speak to Cassandra as I mentioned during one of the answers just before that there is another way another way that is a different kind of layer between your application and the database and it is this Stargate I keep mentioning and that's an API data layer that exposes the data in your database in different ways data API graphql documents and you name it uh anyway always built on the underlying Cassandra and the advantage is that your application your code will just have to do HTTP requests and we'll have access to different ways of looking at your data but uh that being said today I will concentrate on the good old drivers okay drivers uh Cassandra drivers are available for the majority of the most popular languages you see node python Java C is a sharp you name it and they more or less share the same the same Advanced features that are well paired with the nature of Cassandra so you you will see some of them but more or less they all have the same high level features today I will concentrate on node.js now a little anecdote originally this presentation was supposed to be about Java but we realized that most of the developer community in Indonesia um use this node.js so we built exactly for you we built this new presentation and you are the first one to see it so consider yourself a beta tester but most lucky to be exposed for the first time to this new presentation I hope you like it and feedback are welcome back to back to our points so um I will I'm giving you a uh here a link to the node.js to the documentation for the drivers to Cassandra for node but most of what I say will be more or less the same for other languages with uh syntax changes basically more or less and most important everything that you will see today every piece of code you will find in this repo you see here the link this is my own personal GitHub and you will find a repo with all pieces of code and a very well structured readme that will guide you through all exercises if you want to try them and you will explain you how to set up everything to run the code examples Okay so Oops I did something okay I opened my repo but it's open already sorry I don't know what happened I think these happen sorry lost control for a second there we go okay so before moving on let me show you the repo this is the repository just very briefly you will see here uh hello and welcome this is blah blah blah so you can go there uh maybe Alex you might want to paste this link uh in the chat just for those who want to yes bookmark it for later there are actually uh can you please send it to me on slack so I will yeah it is it is in in the all right cheat sheet I shared with you so it should be there all right yep anyway um if you go by yourself uh and you are invited to you will find instructions and instruction will ask you to set up your environment by installing uh we'll now see what so basically the driver you you will create your own astrodb if you haven't done so already this morning and then you will be able to do the practice after creating a new database or at least a new keyspace called chemistry because today's example are about chemical elements why not um but it's it is all explained here um so I chose Astra DB for the exercises so you won't have much to install obviously but in the instructions I also explain exactly what to do when if you have a Cassandra another type of Cassandra and you want to use that for for the exercise so no problem with that now you also have to set up some secrets to be able to access your database from remotely so some authentication as well as in a in one of the questions and luckily so this involves the tech getting generating and taking some token the access tokens and also a file containing certificates this will be available on the Astra UI or if you use Cassandra in other ways you will have other authentication other connection it's all explained but luckily for you everything uh here I did it already and it will take just say 10 minutes five minutes but we don't have time we want to get to the point so sorry but this will be left as an exercise for you if you want to repeat everything here um the last thing you would do before if you want to run these examples is you have to create a key space if you or it's on Astra that will be created by creating a by following instructions you will have to create a table and just let me show you the table uh it's a table containing chemical elements so symbol name atomic mass atomic number why not then you will be required to populate the table with a ready-made just to show you this list already made list of chemical elements hydrogen helium and so on Just for to play with yeah you see there is some setup to be done and that's just if you want to run exactly these examples so not necessarily obviously but um at the end of all this setup you will be able to go for the practice which is very simple pieces of code anyway uh now before going on let me show this is my Astra dashboard and you see I already have this node practice keyspace created sorry database created and if I click on it there is a key space called chemistry you saw this morning how to get to the SQL console so I'll do that and before switching back to the slides maybe it's I can make this a bit larger so I have a key space called chemistry um I hope what I'm typing will remind you of this morning a small practice session I'm now on the key space chemistry and if you see there is a table called elements I will just show you uh desk table elements contains so this table has four columns symbol atomic mass and so on let's have a quick peek at the contents but I guess you can imagine what is there so limit say 15 elements you see I just have my chemical elements neodymium californium nickel and so on so this is just the base sample data I will use then okay that being said let's go back to the slides okay so oh I think it's something oh I keep clicking the wrong place I'm sorry for that that's let's go back to presentation mode okay so let's start with the start in your node project and from this point on I will focus on node but you find information on all other drivers and they change only in the in the form and not the substance you just do an npm install of Cassandra driver which means if you work with a package.json you use such a dependency that so far so good um now the main point is how do you connect to your cluster from your your code so conceptually you need to provide contact points to your driver so your driver works at your application Level and it just needs some of the nodes it needs to be able to reach some of the nodes in your cluster the ones that I made purple here even just one but maybe a bit more than one so you are a bit more resilient if some of the nodes might be temporarily down and you don't have to specify more than a couple or maybe three is best because what happens is that from these nodes the driver will ask hey nodes tell me about your friends the note is aware of the cluster the whole cluster because there is a mechanism called gossip According to which all nodes speak very frequently with some other nodes and they collect information and they are usually very up to date with the status of the cluster and this purple node will reply back to the driver which then from this point on will keep memory of the cluster topology and it will be able to query all nodes and as we said usually it is good it is able to reach directly the node with but the partition I'm interested in which is good okay so that's more or less the story um and in Practical terms to connect from a Nord application you create a client so a client is an object in the package Cassandra driver you create a client giving it some configuration and then you call its connect method then you do your things whatever you want to do and then for good practice since the client is a resourceful object is a stateful object it will keep stuff in memory it will keep connections open TCP connections open you should shut it down when you're done now the syntax is very simple we will come then later on more details on that uh what you write in the config at least you should give the address of some of the contact points as you see here and you will specify a data center probably and you best you better Define a default key space to be able to directly go to some tables right and work with them I want and that's more or less sorry oh sorry uh I want to highlight one thing you say that already but again there I see a lot of people making a mistake so I want to highlight before you are doing that people working with a traditional databases they use it to what you have in the configuration of a driver will be used as the main permanent overtime contact point for your application Cassandra is not my SQL without joins Cassandra Works differently contact points I use it only to load information about your cluster and after that it will work after that your driver will work with the closest replica note it has to work with so yeah the the point the right Point good point Alex in the whole cluster will be Auto discovered but starting from any contact points so no problem with that you will still have um scale and by the way we will come to that later the driver is also can be configured to apply load balancing of its request so it can distribute the request across all nodes if you want and you usually want to do that by the way okay so uh you create a client like this and that's it now just to come out of completeness if you have an astrodb instance instead of giving the directly IP addresses because that's in the cloud that's there and you you give a slightly different way of connection that's all explained in the documentation and in the readme of the reaper I prepared but usually you give it the location of the zip file with certificates and you give username and password to the configuration object the rest is the same um in this code snippet I don't directly write any string with secrets in my code AS is good practice so I I put them in a secret environment file and environment variables and then I read them from my node process as it's let's say the standard practice but that's a detail and by the way this is the way I'm going to connect in the in the demo but just because I'm using an s30b for easy illustration okay so I think we are ready to run some code just have a quick look at this I instantiate my client with my configuration so okay in this presentation I will show the connection with contact points but secretly in the code I run I will be conducting Astra so this config part is different but nothing has changed so don't worry too much about that this is a very simple example I have a function main that connects the client and then runs a query you see I Define a query as a string I call client.execute query and then I act on the results one very important thing is that the node driver works asynchronously asynchronously by Design so almost every call you do is something that you can await if you want to be synchronous but in general you should attach to a promise or or a callback if you prefer so it's all very much a synchronous and as you see a client execute gives me a promise so I can tie it to a then close and then the Callback within the then will take the results read its rows and then Loop over the rows to print them so what I'm doing here I am selecting symbol and name from the chemical elements table and I just print them one by one so let me jump here and I can so in this shell I already injected my environment variables I already installed my node dependencies sorry this is this goes a bit let's try like these maybe just so you see our better so let me run this code 0 to connect connection Astra this is basically the same code that you saw in the slides and I'm running it pump you see I'm reading the table so I'm looping over the results and I get element by element all my results and at the end client closed that's it by the way client close also is you see here in this line client shutdown is also promised so I attach it to a then and then as a callback I announced the client has been closed so this is the typical uh promise chains but you can actually interchangeably work with callbacks or await okay so let's go a bit more in detail on the connection options as I mentioned already you can provide several different options to when you set up your client connection you can specify load balancing policies in this example I want to I want to stay on a single Data Center and I want this load balancing to be aware of the token ranges so I want this driver to be able to pick the right node directly when possible when a partition is specified then I can specify a special parameters of the reconnection policy so what to do when the connection is dropped how long would wait to retry and stuff like that and when a single statement fails I decide whether to retry it or not and that might seem like a easy point but there are some subtleties with the retry policy because you see not all statements in SQL are item potent there are statements that increment a counter there are statements that generate a neural with an ID left to SQL to the side so I have to be careful with item potency otherwise I might end up with duplicate rows or other problems so this required policy has to be I mean it's a bit subtle to handle um Alex can I go forward or uh yes uh we are good we are good okay great so there will soon be a bunch of pieces of code that will run because I'm now about to show you how to query data or better how to run queries because the very first query is not for data but we create a table in the code before starting let me do something uh useful let me open uh interactive Rebel of node so I'm just not running a script now even though you will find all pieces of code as single scripts but now I want to work in a console just for you know more interactivity so let me just paste the client connection part for later and then I will go back to the slides okay to the slides so the basic way you execute statements you just write them in SQL you see create a table nothing new now nothing that you haven't seen already today and I just client dot execute this string indeed I want to create a new table called Metals with uh you know properties of a method kind name and density of a metal say copper zinc gold whatever okay so let's run this simple example uh I just take the whole create table statement that's a long string and I just feed it to client execute method you see in this case I am awaiting on this command why not so that will take a few seconds because creating a table requires nodes to speak to each other because it's a schema change it's a heavy operation so to speak it's not like inserting data and looks like it's finished so my command should have worked and you know what I'm going to my cql console just to check so desk tables look luckily Metals is there and I I trust this table to have the shape that I just showed so kind name density very good by the way this kind will be used later you will see why anytime is as good as any other to remind you that here I'm awaiting this command but usually I can work with promise logic or with callback logic which are more or less the same you will see how to switch between the two and just to know just for you to know uh the driver's support concurrent execution so I might want to run several commands at once and that the driver does it for me I don't need to write any custom code for that any concurrent code myself and I can also support they can also support speculative query executions so if a command is supposed to be highly possible that it fails or something I can try to read I can try to run it also on other nodes and just hope for the fastest to come back again item potency is to be taken into account okay so let's go forward how do you write data well the basic way is you just wrap the same insert statement that you saw already today in a string a new clients.executed let's say let's say that in action writing just by putting a whole string of a query trust me I just run it I insert it copper as a regular metal with a density of zero zero one this should be I think they are grams per kilograms per square per liter or something like that kilogram per square meter I don't remember but I guarantee you that this is a wrong value so copper is very much heavier and uh yeah I just made a mistake apparently so if I select no I'm again this problem with yeah I think okay here we are so if I select from Metals guess what here is my copper so here I'm looking directly at the database here I'm writing commands in my node code and here are the slides but you know what this is not the best way to run commands in uh with the Cassandra drivers why well there are three problems one is that this is not optimal for serializing data so you see I I'm using four bytes for a number which is I mean I'm writing a number as a string that's terrible terrible serialization technique um I have to escape quotes let's say I want to insert a string with a quote I I don't want to enter escaping hell and last step and most important suppose my insert statements are behind a web application I'm opening the way to injections by the by malicious users so that's really really not the best way to go I can do better and I can do better means that I can write a command separated by the values so look at what I'm doing here I'm using client execute again but I write the statement here insert into blah blah blah but values is three question mark three placeholders and the second argument to execute is a matching array of values so string string number that's great and it will work as long as I provide a third argument with type hints so now I have to tell the execution wait the first argument is a text the second argument is a text and the third is a float let me show you that in action so this is the same statement ready to be executed and it worked don't don't mind the results which is a control return value to check what happened my point is that my Palladium has been inserted and just to remind just to reiterate let's try to make without the hints it might work it might not but in this case it will not work and the error would be basically a serialization error so it's not good enough so writing this number is not good enough to to make it serialized in the right way for this column to be written the main reason is that um JavaScript data types are not aligned with the very much more refined uh Cassandra data types so I have to provide some more information for the the data to be properly passed to the drivers sorry to the database server but I can imagine that to be a bit heavy to do all the time so there is even a better way to insert data which is the way usually the recommended way which is using prepared statements what does it mean prepared statements are a very clever way to work because uh basically the drivers go to the server go to the nodes on the cluster and tell them wait I'm going to use this insertion statement many times so you are you are aware of the data types in your table right so get the statement here ready for me the first time you you prepare knowledge of your data types and then this time and also the next times when I send your data just the numbers and the strings and whatever I have to send you will know how to make them into the columns you see you see this example here I'm executing insertion values and then there is just prepare true as an option the first time the nodes will be preparing the statements and be inserting my zinc metal and the second time the statement will be ready for me to use no need to provide hints anymore and no need and it's also optimizing um the the time needed to execute these queries so if I'm inserting if I'm using the same statement many times with the same shape and different values I absolutely want to prepare the statements because the mapping to Cassandra types is automatic by the way in these two examples you are also I also show that you can provide the list of values as an array like here or as an object with names matching the column names so let me show you these two insertions prepare statement I have my string with the same insertion and the placeholders here you see then I insert zinc then I insert Mercury so these two metals and let me run this and very quickly select them oh here we go Mercury and zinc have arrived to the database all as expected okay so now so far I've been awaiting my statements because I wanted to show just part of the game now let's go to the promise part there's there's nothing different than uh usual node promise based execution so I'm now inserting a metal that is actually a metal band so it's not a regular so type no kind will not be made Regular but it will be banned and this band is a metal band AC DC with a heavy density you see the execute method is the same as the one I was uh Alex is laughing I love it it's it's one of my favorite bands yeah great so I will be doing a few Metals a couple of metals so you will see them okay so um execute method is just as before statement values prepared through as an option but now I'll just attach a then and a catch so if it succeeded I will print insertions successful otherwise I will just print an error so this is the promise based way nothing new nothing different than the usual node way of handling promises this is just to show you that it will work okay so you see this is my output AC DC inserted very good now just to have a little fun let me break something so now the in statement will not match the data I expect an error and indeed a terrible error that at the end is this one but you see now I am in my error branch of the promise so everything as expected after all let me fix this okay so you will see here we go okay um how to switch to a callback base because sometimes you don't want to be caught in a promise infinite promise nesting so you want to work with callbacks why not and you you will use that's a nice surprise you will use the very same execute method as before client.execute you just provide a fourth argument and this argument will be the Callback which will have two different arguments error and result and if error is not null then errors have taken have occurred otherwise you just can go ahead so now I'm inserting Iron Maiden which is another metal band and let me show that to you how it works with callbacks there we go I run it Iron Maiden inserted very good so okay now I think you know how it goes I just have a quick look at my database cool everything seems to work after all Okay so this is more or less all there is to say about writing in your node application now let me show you quickly how to read because reading is not so different after all you run the same thing of query execute something and you this time it's instead of an insert is a select and again also in the work conditions you can place you can use baseholders and then provide values separately prepare the statement everything but then this time in in the in the promise part you will read the results and do something with them so results will have rows and you can then Loop over rows and then you see I'm now reading all metals with kind equal band so let me run these I want a listing of all the metal bands and there we go these two are there uh nothing new about how to work with callbacks so again I just provide a fourth argument to my execute instead of a then and I do the same this time and I want the density of copper so I'm I trust there to be just a single interesting row so I use result.first within the Callback and I print the result now nothing new I remind you that I don't want to spend time on much of the details of this code but again you find everything in the link so oh copper density is a bit low but we will see if we fix that later there are more interesting ways to to read data because the client besides the execute method which we used extensively so far has specialized methods to handle uh looping over results such as this each row so client dot each row has arguments the query the parameters prepared through and then you can you should give it another two arguments a callback to be executed row by row here you see every row will be subject to this function that I put here and then also callback both for errors and for the end of the results so in in this error callback if error is no I will just have hit the end of the of the results and if error is not null I will uh there will be an error so let me show this is just to read all regular methods so zinc copper and so forth and this is for the each row method you see I see I get my results and at the end I will get my finished reading which comes from having uh sorry here no error with this callback now very briefly we mentioned batches before and this is how you do batches actually there's nothing much to say you group your queries in an array and you give it to the method client batch uh we are with short of time so let me skip this that doesn't oh no let me run this because that is finally the one that fixes the metal density of copper besides inserting silver so let's get this right let me yeah the whole batch succeeded that's it so you can have promises callbacks the usual here and finally my copper has the right copper density yeah chemistry is saved okay so very quickly um You probably have uh mixed the workload in your application no problem you might want some queries to work with a given timeout some other to work on a given data center some other to have different consistency level no problem you can Define different execution profiles when you create the client as you see here I Define a various profiles I put them here when I create the client then I can run different queries just by specifying execution profile in the option and they will just be run with different settings consistency levels and so on so a real a real program probably needs different kinds of workloads no problem um just very quickly also when I run queries so this ISRO for example I might want to specify consistency levels and other parameters directly when I run a query no problem because this third parameters of execute or each row allows very many different options you can find all them them all in the documentation so yeah there is quite some flexibility now um I want to show very briefly a mini API a full-fledged API because we have a table with metals somebody hijacked it and put some metal bands but I wanted a table for real metals like copper zinc and this is the whole running working code of a mini API that makes it able to get all metals get a metal by name and insert a new metal in my table so this is a standard very small toy Express API which I can then reach with a rest like HTTP request I can get I can post and stuff like that so let me quickly run this so node code 0 for API api.js now this is running here on Port 5000. and well very quickly we outside of any endpoints I'm instantiating my client ready to use and then in every every one of these Express routes is basically a wrapper around a given execute method with the particular query nothing fancy here right um so for example when it's about getting a metal by name I use uh Express request parameter in the array of values for the query when I have to post to create a new metal I read the body and I add regular because I know it's real Metals here and I run my insert query so nothing really complicated going on but with a few lines I already get a working example so let me oh sorry let me open a new window to run for example my here I just asked you see this curl get does a get and I get back my result from the database or I can get only silver only and that's it here I can do a post to insert a new metal that is called harmonium which by the way does not exist and I get back on OK and acknowledgment so now if I query again for my metals uh I get my harmonium back now I'm going pretty fast because there's nothing really fancy with the code I just want to quickly show you that everything would work obviously uh you are invited and you should go much more in detail by looking at the code especially if you are a JavaScript developer um but yeah there is much to show yet and we are almost at the end of time but I think Alex would that be a problem if we go five minutes no no no I don't think there is any problems okay so how is the audience going am I going too fast maybe no no all good at least there are no requests to go slower okay good so now there is an important topic to to touch pagination because you've seen queries that gets some results and they do something with the results maybe one maybe more several rows at once and that's okay but there are some use cases where you have to get batches of results from a long list of results so for example I have a lot of metals and I want to work 10 at a time so I would like my query to be able to keep tabs on you know progressively getting page after page of the whole results and that's what pagination is for now um by the way by default the fetch size that is the number of rows to get back is five thousand which is a lot but if my rows are very fat very big I would probably have to make them smaller because there is a a performance problem otherwise so request response is too big now there are various ways to handle pagination if you don't do anything you just get the first page of results and that's it which usually is enough because 5000 but maybe there are cases where I have to do something different so um look at what I'm doing here I want I am a okay here I Define a query I want all of the regular methods just for fun I want to go two items at a time so every page would be just two rows here indeed in the options of my query that I will pass to the execute I have prepared true but I also have fetch size two you see here so I will be sure to get two rows at a time now there are various ways to handle pagination one is this for a weight uh a synchronous iterator construct so I I call my usual uh client execute and then I Loop over these results in a scene within a synchronous iterator uh in this way pagination is handled automatically by the drivers so let's see what happens I now run my four await and look at what happens I don't even notice there is pagination but I know that behind the scenes that's taking place but I get my old methods including this made up Palladium okay sorry um our mono but I do exists oops the chemist in me okay there is another way to do automatic pagination that is with passing Auto page through to the each row method that you saw already nothing fancy so I just run the code it's just different the way you so it's the the same difference you saw ready for the each row results um sorry method invocation and there you go so you see there is this index 0101 small remark this index and here in the Callback will be an index within each page as you saw Zero and zero and zero one nothing else now there are other cases in which you want to have direct manual control over page progression for example you might have a web application where the user has to click next after reviewing a screen full of results so you have to do you need an explicit way to keep tabs on the page and these again you can do in various ways one way is you have an execute method as usual and these the result of the execute method might have a page state property and then you use this page State and you pass it as an argument to the next call to execute and the driver and the server will be able to know okay I will start from here in giving you the results so this is how you so this page State you can pass around in your application and do whatever you want and you will be able to have direct control over your pages and let me show you how this works I run it and you see I have an explicit sorry first page followed by two items because I still have a two items page another page two items another page to item another page and then stop because the last time page state was null site now signaling me that it was the end of the whole thing um I also can do a slightly different variation by looking by calling explicitly the next page method within each row callback basically let me skip this so we can to we can get to more interesting stuff because the interesting stuff is uh sometimes I want to consume items without so if I'm processing items as they come page after page but my processing takes time takes the resources it might be good not to you know fill up the local buffer and for this the stream method of the client comes handy because it allows for um say handling back pressure or for pressure in this case so uh icon so I I create this stream object and then I can attach readable event and end event to it to it so as soon as items come available available I consume them and then I just stay waiting and then new items will come up and then at the end I will have a callback attached to the end event now this is interesting because it creates the full the very stream object and as you can see here there we go so I have readable rows I consume them new rows arrive and so on this is all based on stream and events and it's completely asynchronous as you can imagine uh okay so now so far I've I've been showing you how to basically plug SQL statements in your node code in the right way I want to remark that node also offers and many other drivers also offer an object-based approach so you can have objects built directly for you automatically from by knowledge of the schema so you can attach this mapper to a table or more tables and then you will have a way to interact with rows in the database as if they were objects so you can create a element like you see here with fields and then you just called insert you can get by a property you can remove items and so on I'll skip that and the only remark is that this mapper is very smart because you remember we said a lot about denormalization and maybe some insertion might have to go to several tables at once well the good news is that this mapper is able to do that for you it just compares the names of the fields of the columns in several tables and when you insert this one new element here for example it will know if there are more tables defined here in the mapping it will know which fields to insert where and it will maintain for you the multiple insertion that you remember we said it's your applications responsibility so that's not bad but I will skip the demo because that's just that code you can run that by yourself as an exercise okay uh I admit it was pretty much uh a longer a series of P pieces of code that I showed you you are invited to tweak them to play with them to run the API to modify it please go to the repo and play with it because it's much more instructive and look at the documentation now I'll just close with a few words with the other option to interact with Cassandra or a study B for that matter which is Stargate IO so Stargate is a different way to interact with your with your database other than the drivers and as we said it reduces it simplifies interaction with the database to a matter of HTTP requests of very according to various apis so the most notable maybe at the moment are a document API which is a bit like the usual schema less documents databases so this is just a screenshot but you see I create what is called a collection that is basically a particular kind of table in Cassandra I then create documents I can update a suit documents I can search by various so you notice this last line is a mongolife syntax so it makes it very easy to work with schema-less documents okay so you see in the first line there is a SDK for node and as well for as for other languages to interact with these but actually what's happening behind the scenes if you prefer is it's simple HTTP request so this is how you update the subdocument for example so no no nothing fancy going on there um Stargate makes it also possible to work with data in a c in a graphql syntax so you see this is um a typical graphql query so yeah there is quite some freedom and speaking of those Stargate enabled ways to speak with your database we data Stacks developers run a lot of workshops and they are basically all based on on Stargate because that's very interesting and most deficient the way of working with your database so if you're more interested you are invited to join us and to join us yeah and to watch some of our workshops because they are much more in detail on this on this part if you have a dedicated workshop on graphql and how do you use it by the way yes and it's very very nice because graphql is a cool topic nowadays and we are we are explaining it very well I would say yeah okay so well that was a lot of stuff I know I I appreciate that but okay so I remind you that everything you see you saw today in this talk and more you can find here by the way you should already have your roster to be so it should be very easy to set it up and play with the code um this is where you find the everything about Astra and as for Stargate this is it now um maybe Alex you can paste a few of these links you know where to find them uh yeah as we mentioned uh right now we run workshops and most of them are Stargate based so please if you want to go here and also on our YouTube channel which is the channel you are probably on right now you will be able to find a much more detail and much more examples and play with the code all of our workshops are basically um interactive they have a lot of Hands-On not only that but they are backed by GitHub repositories which also contain a readme that makes it possible for you to just go in a by yourself and just do the exercise and by the way uh if you do the exercise you want maybe to submit the homework and you will get another badge other badges so you can really collect the batches like this and be a super Cassandra hero if you want okay so yeah there are then some resources for developers that we gave you already Academy to get to study for for the certification Community where uh we can exchange question and answer like a stack Overflow um please connect with us on various channels you saw them already they are in the comments below this video and please reach us on Discord where uh the discussion can go on now you know everything there is to know almost on the drivers and on application developments so the way ahead is long and interesting please go ahead and create your wonderful applications and maybe let us know why not with that I stop here and I thank you very much for listening and sorry for taking a few minutes more than no no no it's completely fine register uh good I'm I was answering questions okay us uh so uh it looks like we are proceeding to the final word yeah I can imagine it's been a long day for those who attend as it has been for us but uh yeah very rewarding I have to say very interesting definitely definitely I think uh Dickey will join us again to say goodbye yep I hope so because I don't see him yet okay uh you have the slides for the final world right oh here here we go you probably do as well but I can we can stay on this yeah we can share my screen we can stay here yes yes second and oh yes it doesn't work hey there are three of us now all on the screen okay great thanks for telling because you know today I have one monitor only so boom now very good so that was incredible hello hi hello hello hi hi DK welcome back yeah thank you very much for such a wonderful day yeah yeah it's great I have to say yeah I believe today many developers of Indonesia have known one beautiful name called Cassandra yeah I guess yeah yeah some oh yeah um yeah so yeah thank you once again um Alex and Stefano for being here to guide us from what what a rough day you uh maybe you uh didn't have enough sleep last night starting at a bit less than usual but it wasn't worth it 5 p.m in the morning until yeah now it's now half past 12 so lunch time for us yeah but I believe it's going to be the first start and it's going to be a big start for Cassandra here in Indonesia and I I hope so yeah actually you made history this is uh one of the first event in Cassandra in Indonesia that's great to know yeah so we are making history so all of you who attended your part of history and I hope it's been very fun maybe interesting and for sure it has been great for us to interact with you and to give you hopefully useful information useful knowledge and yeah thank you for the attention and all of your very good questions and now Cassandra is your friend and please reach us or even better maybe reach the friends at the SPs so diki and everybody because by the way we thank you all for for the help in the chat and for the logistics setup and assistance in setting this up for the translation to bison and not only that for the quizzes and everything so yeah sorry uh how do you pronounce uh thank you in bahasan uh let me try let me try that should be yeah thank you thank you very much so um we have a feedback form you are invited to fill it uh to tell us maybe what you
