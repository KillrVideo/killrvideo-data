    "text": "and welcome to the last week of uh workshop series getting to a cloud with cassandra astra kubernetes and many other great tools we are going to introduce you today or introduce it in the first two weeks that's alex volosniv developer advocate at datastocks and today with me david gillardy hi david hello alex i like how you're in a little circle today i feel jealous that i'm not also in a little circle today oh i can make it but you know what let's battle do it next week yeah right yeah because we always have some content to show yeah and my circle is pretty nice although i miss my green screen hope to attach it back soon so everyone if you can see us if you can hear us let's then let know us about that in the youtube chat hi cedric hi john hello everyone and i see a lot of people today and that's really nice and we will have much more after a couple of minutes because there are some always some late cameras but we cannot wait to share what we have prepared for you today so we will try to make it quick this week is special because it ends our three week series and we are happy to have you all here we are happy to share the vouchers we are happy to share the knowledge on how to work with these technologies how to use them and how to make your app perfect good hey david what's uh what what's time for you now isn't that it is it is 12 p.m eastern 12 p.m yeah that's right 12 p.m eastern right in the afternoon right while the inauguration is going on at this moment okay yeah uh for me it's like 6 p.m and there are a thousand kilometer thousands kilometers between the speakers for you and you may be even more remote for us but that doesn't matter as long as internet connects us we are happy to be here with you yeah exactly good so then let's proceed step by step and welcome to week three and that's really incredible because you made it over the recent steps and you was with us on the easy backhand for your application part as a first week and when we were working with cassandra and kubernetes and we did a lot of work with cass operator and kate sandra and configured our application work with kate sandra and looked how it looks and how it works and i hope you did your homework but if you didn't don't worry there is all the time in the world for you to proceed just really like practical steps are the most important steps whatever we tell you you will forgot after a few weeks if you don't push the buttons on your own well and then finally we are getting to take your application to a cloud today right now in the next few minutes so that's a great moment to start then then certification vouchers that knowledge is good but it's always great then you can prove it easily but yes i own this technology i perfectly know how to use that that helps you on the job interviews it helps to your salary and so on and so forth so since certification is a great tool and because you joined our free work series and shared your time with us you have earned a certification voucher stay with us till the end of today's workshop and you will get a link to fill the form and claim your voucher this voucher is valid for two attempts and you may get if you are lucky enough if you have prepare it well you can pass both administrator and developer certifications with one single voucher and have the perfect results just and have two certifications done in just a couple of exams absolutely for free don't forget this workshop series is not enough to pass for both of us certifications you need some deeper knowledge on like how cassandra runs so we suggest you to attend the courses at the academy.datastax.com it's a solid certification it's not just a e-certification for attending the event it's a real certification with the exam which is valuable on the job interviews and so on so pass the exams and pass the course and pass the exams if you are not feel if you don't know if you are ready for the certification or not for example you use cassandra for some time already and you don't know are you good for the exam to pass we have a great thing done for a couple of times already cassandra certification workshop where we show how the certification works and what kind of a questions you get and if you go to this workshop you see what you are able to answer verbal questions we are asking there they are not the exact questions from proof of exam of course but very very very very close if you are able to answer questions on our workshop certification workshop when you will be good on the exam and alex just you know i did drop the workshop the cassandra certification workshop link both in youtube and discord and we do have those certification workshops once a month usually yeah um so if you keep a look at you know keep an eye on our youtube channel and or the eventbrite and you will see those pop up but like alex just said if you go to that repository that github repository for the cassandra workshop certification it has all the details of everything all the resources you need to figure out how to get your certification yeah and by the way you see this guy david on the side of the screen directly under him you have the subscribe button and if you stayed with us for a few weeks uh workshop series you must have pushed this button already but if you somehow didn't do it right now it's really worth it so and i see the question on youtube chat any updates on cassandra kubernetes certification well one update we are working on it is to be delivered but i don't have the exact date maybe we will announce it soon and we have to proceed and one more thing uh as you will submit the form you will receive today you don't ask for your voucher after one minute afterwards give the time because there are some people um involved with interval processing we have to check some things to avoid any how it's in english to avoid any tricks because well it's a real certificate so we don't want people to just get it for nothing so there are some validations we have to we have to vet uh the requests to that form to ensure that they are all of you who have attended yeah yeah so and it may take some time to deliver this voucher to you if you don't get it within one business week let us know and we will handle that so a little bit of housekeeping and setup uh as you know already uh two main sources to watch the video to join us online it's a youtube main channel we are in the youtube and answering questions in the stream in comments and we also on twitch for us which is the backup platform so we don't answer questions there we don't present any chat but if you have any troubles with a youtube stream maybe twitch will work better for you and then next thing for us what's a runtime going to be today is first one uh we are as we are working with the clouds we are going to use a real cloud no linux box or no laptop can emulate the real cloud for you for today demo we are going to use a google compute platform and you are going to do so for the homework uh and don't worry about the expenses you know well you have to pay for the cloud google compute platform uh offers you uh around i don't remember 250 or 300 dollars i think it's like 300 or something yeah free tier and uh you can do all the exercises without spending a cent on it for this week and for the exercises of this week and if you by any occasion use it with free tier already even in this case today's exercises are going to cost i guess like around maybe 50 cents or maximum one two dollars at maximum but actually i didn't calculate it it depends on how long do you keep the machines running uh our next we have uh google cloud to run the application and we need to store data somewhere last week's uh we use it last week we deployed cassandra with keith sandra with casa operator and you know there is pretty a lot of work today uh it's pretty a lot of work today we are going to show you the easier way so today we will use astra so you don't have to manage maintain cassandra on your own but you know what everything what we what we are doing with astro today is absolutely doable with open source apache cassandra as well so if you want to keep everything under control you don't like database as a service and you want to be like the complete boss on every beat and you prefer to do everything on your own then you can simply do the same exercises deploying it with your own cassandra or kate sandra in the cloud regarding them questions as usually we have questions in youtube chat and preferably in discord because as long as youtube stream is over uh questions are gone and with discord we can keep talking even after the workshop and finally we will yeah oh sorry alex yeah there is a question that i think is relevant for this uh over in youtube from recruit uh i think similar can be done with eks right yeah absolutely absolutely you will see soon you'll find that out a little bit more later yeah yeah you will find something like so don't run in front of a train let us drive good so unless you're really fast uh but elastic kubernetes service is exactly the thing we are going to use today yep okay so uh cloud computing a very quick overview because i want us today to spend maximum time on the practical steps so if you have no idea about what the cloud is then fasten your seat belts because we will be running a little bit so cloud computing in comparison with other old-school approaches it's an on-demand availability of a computer system resources delivered to you by the cloud providers it works for data storage and computing power first of all without direct active management by the user so it's a lot of all taken it's infrastruct it's outsource of your infrastructure to some dedicated cloud providers which may feel unusual to the old-school operations people who use it to do it all of their own but i at some point really start to enjoy it when i can focus myself as an ops guy on development of a project and helping developers developing something better when just on the going and patching operating systems and doing things like that uh first uh story of a cloud computing storage we started with amazon you know amazon which was a which was a bookstore so many years ago and uh wanted to sell more books and there were some amazon online marked and then more and more and more and more and more and you know what one of the biggest problems of a business like that they have very different they have very huge difference in the lot and the pressure on the system depending of time of a year and time of the day and so on so i mean in the night of 1st of january they aren't going to have a lot of orders but getting closer to the spring to a summer we are going to have a lot and of course if we speak about the times like black friday or christmas and getting close to christmas they are really really really busy and if you have that's always a problem old approach our infrastructure was always very slow to put the changes on so i mean it may work fast but any attempt to change something in your infrastructure is very slow in comparison with cloud computing and the problem is or you have not enough computers and then on the rush hour you cannot answer all the responses and you are losing money or vice versa you have a lot of servers to cover any need of the computational power and as a result you are paying all the time for idling servers which is bad as well and to solve this problem amazon decided to sell power a computational power of servers they don't use at this moment and that's how it's all started so uh and that people say there is no clout with just someone else's computer they think it's a good joke that's much better joke than they think because when then it's my computer when it's my server it's my headache to maintain it and then at someone's else computer it's not my headache to maintain it you know what i like it so what are the main principles of cloud computing there are different lists in the internet like main principles of cloud computing that's my favorite the most important things i personally find most important for everyone who uses the clouds first it's an on-demand self service we don't have to make phone calls to order a new server we don't have to go to an office of the hosting provider and asked to do something for us it's like in a supermarket i go to a supermarket i grab some coca-cola i put it to my bucket and i pay it in the end and that's it on self-service on demand i need it i take it immediately with no additional extra actions required then rapid flexibility recently last year we did a workshop at the kubernetes conference cubecon regarding kate sandra and it was in high demand so we have had like close to 1 000 registrations something like that and we needed to provide training instances for all of them and for just one day we needed like 100 or sorry 100 up to 1 000 servers t2 extra large so pretty big servers not the most not the biggest but pretty big and what i say just okay we need that i push the button we have them creation of these uh infrastructure took around 40 minutes and if i would have more time to adjust that it could have taken 20 minutes maybe or less and we went from zero to 1 000 and then back to zero as we needed that so very rapid flexibility ability to change your infrastructure within a couple of minutes in the very big size then resource pooling for most of the cases you can share resources you use in the cloud with some neighbors it's like a house with a lot of apartments it's like a cheaper way than normal house but it also allows you to save a lot of money and you may have sometimes troubles with annoying neighbors you still can use dedicated instances using the cloud but for most of the cases people prefer to use shared resources and resource pooling then elastic scalability that kind of relates to the flexibility but the size of a question is it's about to be elastic today you need a lot today you need tomorrow you don't need anything so that's about to scale out as much as you need to still without any problems of all the history of using aws once i reached the situation then data center when availability zone was empty so we pull it out all resources of availability zone but it's really a rare case and i mean like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of servers and that's still no problem because we're simply moving the workload to another availability zone which has more resources for us to go then pay as you go then you use old-school uh ecosystem when you use old-school infrastructure you first pay when you wait for some months to get your servers uh i know the stories when it was like uh seven to eight months to deliver some specific equipment and only after that you can use that viv cloud services you pay as you go after vets consume it yes there are options to reserve instances and pay upfront but it's not very often use case although it happens then measured service cloud providers like aws they measure your consumption up to beat or up to microsecond if you speak about for example aw aws lambda serverless functions and you have everything measured and you don't pay like with normal servers [Music] do you use it or not go server-less and pay only for pure consumption without any overpaying for that global availability as cassandra supports perfectly they are distributed over the world and you can use data center in india in china china in united states in europe in australia all together at once every way you need you will have a data center and finally what people always forget to include in this list of principles is programmable management and programmable chromebook prom sorry programmable access to the infrastructure uh if i have workload changing on my infrastructure ecosystem i don't have to set up it manually anymore i just create auto scaling group set up the limits set up the triggers and monitoring and aws or other cloud providers will adjust computational power of my infrastructure accordingly to workload and if anything changes i can still stay in my bed sleeping without worrying because i can program i can set up manage programmable management over my infrastructure and i love it when what are the deployment models of this um system we have in general we always speak about four main kinds of public cloud private cloud hybrid cloud multi-cloud that's to notice about um what is their private cloud private cloud is with openstack for example you can create your own cloud if you all have a big company and you cannot use public clouds for any reason you can have your own cloud for the resources of your company and that's pretty great what's that public cloud then that's about sharing resources resources so most of the clouds aws google cloud and so on they're public clouds you share with others hybrid cloud that's pretty advanced model already it's not always easy to set up but it may help a lot for some cases when you partially use resources on premises on your own data center in your office and you also use connected resources from public cloud for example so you can spread the workload over servers in your data center and in the public cloud so that's pretty interesting point and then multi-cloud some companies prefer to go multi-cloud in a game that's pretty advanced workload then you have part of your infrastructure and part part of your workloads in aws for example and second part in google cloud and they're working together why do that there are two cases first of all in some cases it may be better for you as a different kind of lots uh estimated differently from the price from the budget foreign point of view it may be better for you to use swisscloud or webcloud or also people often speak about disaster tolerant so if you want your application to be running even if a wall aws is down which never happened for the world dataset for wall aws to be down but for some reasons it happened before and well will happen inevitably life is live you know then you can spread your application over multiple data centers of multiple clouds to be uh cloud agnostic it's not cheap it's not easy but it works and some companies are doing that alex yeah i do have a question for you that you may know the answer to because i don't uh says uh does data sex have uh gcp like network vpc for avoiding public network for inner dc communication i know i know aws does i just i'm not sure about the other provider so uh of course that's very important for us to support uh vpcp ring it's indeed works for aws regarding gcp i have to ask people developing astra astra i mean it there are two options or it's supported already or it will support it very very soon because it's priority number one for us to support the pcp ring all right i'm i'm gonna go ahead and ask the astra team to see if i can find out the answer for uh the google and azure uh clouds yep okay so i'm to proceed then and then that's a good question like some uh some people asked why do you call cassandra cloud native like it sounds very marketish to me i'm an engineer i'm not a big fan of a marketer things and our answer is yes uh there is no marketing in that just cassandra is indeed cloud native because all the primary features of cloud deployments is perfectly support you may be geographically distributed with cassandra it's easy and you can be hybrid cloud and multi-cloud at the same time and that's cassandra is easy because cassandra is platform agnostic so there are three main uh cloud service models i want to discuss first i hope uh most of you've seen this picture already about uh private cloud or private on premise infrastructure infrastructure as a service a platform as a service and software as a service the main idea of those approaches is responsibility sharing then you run everything on your own on premises you're responsible for network for everything starting with data center and it's not easy to make your data center because you have to take care of a security you have to take care of a power supply a good network connection preferably a lot of power supplies and network connections to have some redundancy and so on and so forth so it's just a huge story by itself but it's only the very beginning because when comes networking storage servers virtualization and so on and so forth with on-premises you'll take care about everything and if you have a huge company which has a very strong department taking care of that and you have a lot of great experts and great administrators to take care on you might be fine but for many companies they don't have so much um uh specialists in this field or maybe they don't want to care of a storage and network and data centers they kind of prefer to develop something useful to clients we prefer to think of the clients not of a security with machine guns in your data center when they may think about infrastructure as a service where you outsource the lower layers to them cloud provider and you start to take care of something what you can handle easier and getting in the same direction when finally platform as a service was introduced and finally software as a service software is a service when everything is handled by cloud provider and that's the maximum what you can get to simplify your own life and just consume what you need to consume for example everyone wants to okay you want to have an application application needs to store data you need a stronger silent solution and you can use cassandra as a part of a private cloud or infrastructure as a service or platform as a service if you prefer to not think about the storage at all and just use it then you can use astra and astra is a database as a service so it's very on the right close to david by the way and on my side you see here is a private cloud so you can completely run cassandra with all these things but you will have to take care of all these things so there will be a lot of things to do well so and there are hundreds dozens hundreds maybe already thousands of providers in all the different fields for everything you can simply try to use and would love to use for your use cases story changes a little bit at some point it was a huge breakthrough with the systems like heroku i like heroku i was using it pretty intensively for some of my projects it's platform as a service you don't think of applications you just don't think of a servers you put your application hiroko takes care to keep it running and that's pretty nice and that was um very helpful approach but a lot of people use it but then smoothly we i see a question in youtube chat i want to answer does openstack supports cassandra so cassandra is platform agnostic so you can run it with openstack or whatever you want to uh and just something to add to that you know something we do on the development end here um is a lot of times you know uh before astro anyway we're running lots of clusters in openstack so no doubt there yep but then it moves smoothly now to containers and as containers took over the world and by the way if you want to learn what's the docker and how it works we have a dedicated course for that you can find it at this channel but anyway the idea starts to move more and more from platform as a service to containers as a service using normally docker containers now more and more often with kubernetes so given all the things we discuss at already we can move to cloud providers and services so what do we have speaking about that there are a lot of them and first one was amazon web services but not the only one and that's what i really want to highlight we aren't pushing you to any of the sites for today's exercises we will use a google compute platform but we could have used amazon web services we could have used microsoft azure and it still would be completely fine so uh with some of the minor of adjustments you can do the same using amazon web services if you have an account why not uh so uh by the end by the beginning i would say of your 2020 situation the market was like that so the biggest guys was definitely amazon and microsoft catching up and google cloud also growing very quickly with a little bit smaller part of the market but that that was the situation to the year 2020 now it may be changed a little bit but the general plan trend is like this well yeah real quick alex um to that question about the vpc pairing earlier yeah um we already know that it is supported in aws i have confirmation it is supported both in azure and in gcp i'm dropping some links right now um matter of fact this happened to be in the astrodocs i'm a little embarrassed that i did not know that off the top of my head but i just wanted to let you know that it's there and putting those here now all right sorry for the interruption okay good so so this situation is uh more or less clear and which one is better i will say i will not tell you because it very very very depends on your workload i know what some people think like google compute platform is currently cheaper cheaper than aws and then that definitely makes sense because they came later and it's going to be pretty hard to enter the market with prices higher than the market leader definitely so that's for you to decide today we will work with google cloud platform so amazon web services it's uh the biggest it's a market leader at this moment 24 regions 77 availability zones over 200 and something points of presence for the cloudfront and overall about 250 services of a very different purpose so it's one of the most powerful and white uh from the services point of view um provider and you can have new everything you want and build everything you want on aws because whatever you can imagine they already support it do you see these uh satellite uh on the downstairs in the center uh if you have a spare of free satellites you can launch them and manage them with amazon web services i am going to do that as soon as elon will send me my package my pack of satellites so uh 10 may so the list of main services of aws you should know about out of those 250s 250 of course not all of them are the most used in the world let's say some let's cover what you need to know and what you have to be ready to use if you are going to work with aws so uh the mother of all services is elastic compute cloud also known as ec2 elastic compute cloud is an infrastructure as a service approach so you can spawn virtual machines for you not only virtual machines anymore after last two years i believe after a couple of yeah two three years ago they launched way to use bare metal machines which is also pretty interesting for you if you prefer bare metal still staying on aws ecosystem which is pretty powerful so i completely understand that when um elastic bean stalk is kinda pass or kinda template to run applications with ease over elastic compute cloud so i wouldn't call it like a pure pass but yes it's uh also was a loser use it a lot uh before and a function as a service aws lambda is a great tool speaking about the serverless so where you have functions and you pay in for them on that's like you can rent a server with yesi tool and it doesn't matter if you use it or not you have rented a server you are going for to pay for it if you deploy an application which is uh use it like on a very different size and you don't want to pay all the time for the service you can deploy your application with aws lambda functions and you will pay only for the real usage the main price may made by amount of gigabyte seconds that's pretty interesting computational term gigabyte seconds means how many seconds your function was running and how many gigabytes of random access memory it's consumed meanwhile of course you can set the limits yeah and if you don't use this application you pay zero nothing so server or less pay as you go when speaking of the containers amazon elastic container service amazon elastic kubernetes service for kubernetes workloads and amazon fargate which is serverless for containers then on the storage size there are three main services a simple storage service for simple object storage and glass here for archives elastic block store you use as disks for your instances on ec2 and finally elastic file system that's like a network file system you can attach to any computer or even to aws lambda so your serverless functions can have real file system which is pretty interesting feature and speaking of networking there is like about 10 of different powerful network services but the most used of them is amazon virtual private cloud which allows you to create private networks then root 53 to manage your dns servers and domain names and cloud front front as a content delivery network uh hey alex there's a question in here from deepak and youtube what's the difference between simple storage service and block store so uh principal difference is very simple simple storage service uh helps you uh just it's an object storage so you throw an object or a file to it you get the id you can get this object using this id it's a plain storage uh the [Music] way to use to get objects and retrieve objects from that and there is a pretty interesting model to pay so you can choose storage class for an object and you can specify if it's object use it all the time and then you pay only for storage but uh don't pay for retrieval or you may specify what that's an object which retrieve it not really often so you pay less to store that but you pay something when it's retrieved so there are different payment models um blog storage uh is that service used to um create disks you can use with uh containers so it's like virtual hard disk drives or ssd however you prefer that you can create a disk attach it to um your one instance store some data detach attached to another instance and so on so it's literally like a hard disk drive you can attach different servers good so how do you deploy cassandra on amazon web services there are some options and uh the one which gives you the hardest uh way but also the full control over that is to instantiate an esc2 instance virtual or bare metal install cassandra on that and run it in the most traditional way people are doing that there are also some pre-built images and a mice for apache cassandra but the idea is the same that's your virtual server you are to patch it you are to update cassandra and so on and so forth uh for more modern approaches whereas amazon marketplace and data stocks managed services dms data stacks managed services when we take care of a cassandra forum or datastax enterprise then we have software as a service which is astra so you don't have to care of a database we will do it for you and another option would be amazon key spaces but that's not that's a special story because they claimed it to be cassandra then at some point we found out what it's not fully compatible and finally uh it's declared as not cassandra but amazon key spaces for cassandra it's a proprietary aws project which is not an open source cassandra and which works only on aws and not fully compatible with cassandra it still have also some features of cassandra like global availability your application and so on and so forth so if you strongly decide to stick to aws key space may work for you as long as you are fine with proprietary software and vendor lock and then finally uh with containers as a service you can use cash operator in elastic kubernetes service to have your cassandra running with hey alex there's an interesting question from akash over on youtube i think you're gonna like this one is dynamodb manage cassandra on aws uh no dynamodb is not managed at cassandra on aws that's absolutely clear uh so no deny dynamodb it has come on completely different model and so on and so forth and there is one more question i think this session is moving more on cloud instead of cassandra kubernetes on cloud so of course we are going to work on cloud so we are speaking a lot about cloud there is not a question and today is more about application on kubernetes not cassandra on kubernetes because cassandra on kubernetes we covered last week good yep uh so about amazon key spaces works on the single availability zone i wouldn't say so as far last time i looked at that the different absolutely uh with no doubts a way to run key spaces over multiple availability zones uh no cassandra doesn't match with dynamodb no cassandra is a different model cassandra is close to big table indeed but not through dynamodb or maybe i would say big table is closer to cassandra yeah i think the confusion there is that the original when cassandra was really originally built right it was based off the big table in the dynamo paper not dynamod yeah maybe right there could be a little confusion there but yeah it's the dynamo paper oh what is apache calcite i have no idea what is a copper yeah i don't know but i don't know about that one either yeah okay so microsoft azure also have a lot of regions and availability zones and a bunch of services to deliver i don't want to cover them all um what's the most important services of azure you need to know about the compute mostly the same direct comparison azure virtual machines for infrastructure azure application services for the platform as a service azure functions as serverless function as a service and kubernetes services azure kubernetes services is caac regarding the databases there is the chance to use cosmodb cosmos db which is a pretty powerful database for its model and for the storage we have disk storage blocks like ebs for aws and azure blob storage to store objects for the networking well that's mostly the same story as in aws how do you deploy cassandra on azure again situation is the same [Music] you may use it as deep as you want with uh with control you have different layers of control and different layers of responsibility with infrastructure platform or software as a service and you're always able to use cass operator and run kate sandra on azure kubernetes service and our hero for today is google cloud platform google cloud platform is one of um fast growing clouds which has also very promising ecosystem and services and also delivers a lot of different options for whatever you prefer to use um last year was a bit special to me because i managed to be to pass the certification and become a google cloud platform certified architect and i can say what i really applause their approach building of the educational materials in comparison with aws sorry people from aws gcp did their work much better for real you have something to learn from when so um regarding the services you need to know compute engine to run virtual machines application engine to run apps function as a service well cloud functions serverless and container as a service with kubernetes engine for the data analytics we have a really good offer with bigquery and they are offered with a storage network and so on is also pretty similar to aws forgive me for these words but with my experience of the different clouds i didn't find any principle difference let's say ways to deploy cassandra on gcp again the same you can run infrastructure as a service and handle of everything on your own you can run platform as a service and use cloud launcher marketplace to have it running for you you can use astra targeting gcp when you create a astra cluster you may specify the provider you prefer to use and of course the thing what we are doing and the thing what we can do is to run cassandra as a service uh using casa for you to run cassandra with cass operator in google kubernetes engine so i told you everything about astra already it's cassandra made easy in the cloud data stocks take care takes care of routine operations for you in multiple cloud providers so people just think what data stacks astra is one more cloud not like that we care of a cassandra where we are best experts and we host cassandra using aws microsoft azure or google cloud depending on your preferences okay hey yes there are there are some questions here in youtube um let's see um i think the question here is which one is cost effective pass or sass um and you know that i see someone actually answered depends on your implementation use case this is actually something similar to what i was going to say but i'm curious on your thoughts on that one so you could argue or any of that depending on how you use or abuse the cloud yesterday i did a webinar in russian language for russian speaking people regarding clouds and question number one was can you imagine why it's so hard to predict and calculate expenses on aws and you have to consider so many different facts and options even if you're just storing files which seems to be pretty simple thing and you even understand the size of them an amount of them a little bit it changes a lot regarding of so many settings you can do so if you want to estimate your future expenses on aws it's a very very long story so uh they like you have to consider up to six different uh factors just storing files six to seven different uh variables just storing files and then you start to use these these that and that servers with auto scaling groups with all the other optional things and api gateways and serverless databases it's really not easy to calculate the costs so which one is cost effective it's 100 percent depends on your workload and you can go and calculate the options uh using a google compute platform and you can do the same for aws and then you can say something what's cost efficient for you because every project is different to others so there is no way to answer um i've heard again from some of my friends what um gcp was more was a bit cheaper for them but no way i'm going to prove that i'm i don't and again it's hardly depends on your story on your use case on your workload time of the day phase of the moon and blah blah blah blah blah and so on good so and then [Music] uh people also started to move from containers to serverless or combining them for aws we usually speak of aws lambda for example but there are also serverless containers with fargate and there are many different options to run function as a service but that's not what we are going to do today but if you are interested in aws speaking of gcp you definitely have to check out google cloud functions it's great our aws lambda and aws api gateway they're also great and if you are looking for more cloud agnostic things to run serverless things then you have to check out serverless framework or apache openwhisk also pretty interesting story now getting closer to cassandra serverless best practices with driver you definitely have to consider don't forget if you are using a function as a service they um not present uh for real till it's triggered till there is an event source or http ak api call which will get to the function as a service service like for example lambda and bring your function tool to life and if you will create a driver connection within the function and you have a huge lot when you will make thousands or maybe millions of connections all the time which is not recommended way to work with cassandra so you may need to want to have database connection outside of a f function entry point over by this amount of connections may make troubles to you so consider how do you connect to the database and be aware of a number of client connections to a database as it's also maybe a problem then if you use connection from the serverless story to a database a serverless function it's going to be executed once and then to be closed and don't forget cassandra drivers are very smart and on a startup they load a lot of information about the cluster so it's good it allows you to optimize queries but then it takes time and as a result it takes time for the driver to load all the information uh just a second yeah i see just a second okay let me uh first finish with um uh point i'm speaking right now and if your driver will try to load everything uh at on the startup and it's going to be terminated directly after one query then it may be suboptimal at least so consider reducing startup time by disabling driver metadata and pulling warmup disable the smart driver features it may save you some time but also driver heartbeats may be overkill for this case and in general move data access and business logic from the function entry point may be a good solution uh a question example 4.1 so if you never use it function as a service when it's easy to explain function as a service then trigger happens when something happens what brings function to be executed function will be executed once and terminated again if you have 10 triggers happens at once then 10 functions from the same template will be executed and terminated again every time when you make a connection a cassandra is designed from the beginning to have long running connection and connection pooling and so on so uh if you create a connection uh in the driver on any every time of a function as a service execution uh at some point you may have just millions and millions of connections if um just making your database too busy to answer that's just keep the number of a connection of some limited scale yes thank you good so finally we can get to practice my favorite part and we can go and deploy our application in google kubernetes engine what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to do some steps and show you how it works and i suggest you to watch what i'm doing and do not try to do it right now jerusalem and do it immediately after the workshop and we will answer your questions on discord i will ignore questions in the youtube chat regarding the exercise for now because first watch what we are doing and see how it works so first we are going to google oops ah yeah few words about where i going two words about the application uh that's getting started with astr ui application which you can use also with uh playing cassandra it has a javascript user interface and it has java or python backends we will use python one we don't have to develop it we will work with containers so today we aren't developers and the code exists already and so that's basically all you need to know we will work with astra you can adjust that to work with cassandra as well so exercise one first thing i'm getting to my and i want it to be full screen and a little bit bigger yes good so that's my google account and i've created a new project called up to cloud workshop and it's pretty empty because it's a test account which has nothing the thing and what i'm going to work with today is kubernetes engine yeah it's him good and i'm going to list of the clusters so what's google cloud platform kubernetes engine it takes care of my kubernetes allowing me to run applications over that but i don't have to install kubernetes or do anything it's a google cloud job i'm going to create one the if up to cloud cluster good uh it will be uh zonal so the cheapest option for me and i'm going to locate it in europe so i will stick to europe west 3 which is going to be frankfurt pretty close to me and that doesn't matter which zone i will choose i will use static version and that's a cluster basics i can start it right now or i can walk through the steps on the left and change some settings for automation for networking security settings and so on and so forth but so far typical deployment of kubernetes will be perfectly fine to me so i'm going to create that you know there's a question here alex you know the answer to me is kind of again cassandra is agnostic to the cloud vendors um a question from aj in terms of easy which cloud is preferable for cassandra i guess the question is yeah in terms of easy probably i'm assuming that means easiest to deploy or something i mean all of them essentially have images that you can just spin up and go i don't know do you have any thoughts on that uh so uh one sec so now what was the question again uh we well what's easy to use uh yeah that's right that's what i think unless um aj if you want to re-ask that but it says in terms of easy which cloud is preferable for cassandra i'm so i'm interpreting easy of use or like easy to launch or something uh in terms of easy astra is preferable for cassandra that is yeah that's that's a very good point because that's you'll be able to launch up a full cassandra cluster in a couple minutes um on any of the cloud providers from that standpoint so that is yeah that's definitely the easiest way to go yeah but uh but i guess if we're talking the direct cloud providers direct cloud providers there is no principle difference i mean i say it what on my personal experience google cloud educational system was better than aws but that's only about the courses that's only about a learning curve let's say but um a way to use tools is the same let's say for them so i can't say what gcp is easier than aws or vice versa they all are very powerful and powerful tool cannot be easy when you have a hammer a hammer is a good tool but you can do with it only one job and your um how to say it in english cognitive resistance to use i'm that's maybe not proper translation but the cognitive resistant resistance to use hammer is very very low you natively understand how to use that and cloud providers with all the services more look like a boeing 777 or whatever 787 with one thousands of buttons and tumblers and none of them are easy just because we are powerful and they they can deliver very complex applications and keep that running so i wouldn't say any of them is easy if you are looking for easy go to cassette go to astronaut okay thank you alex um um in terms of maintainability efforts we are anyway waiting for my kubernetes cluster to be deployed uh so i will answer again uh answer is mostly the same that's it will take more or less the same efforts on any of the clouds except for faster so there is no difference between no principle difference at least from my point of view i mean like to maintain what uh if you're running cassandra over a virtual machine on no yeah you're answering it aws yes you do you have to ssh to a machine use node tool status and do all the things it work it would work exactly the same way on gcp so yeah and her and uh discord is saying it takes time to set up three notes from scratch inside of vm yeah totally because you know each each cassandra node is a cassandra database right and if you're doing this inside of vm on your i'm assuming you're talking like on your local system at some point between ram cpu and stuff you're just going to be limited resources wise so if you're going for multi-node clusters it's usually a lot better to do that up on cloud you know cloud providers or at least if you know servers that you have the proper resources on okay so meanwhile my cluster is in a good process so i'm going to have i'm going to have this very soon total size for it is free so by default it will be created with three machines within one zone as i dictated it to beam and that should be fine and my nodes are in progress so okay and now it looks green very well so now i can jump into this cluster and i can push the connect button and the gcloud command line tool i would execute this command in my local machine but i don't want to use my local machine for that so i will use cloud shell cloud shell is a very convenient tool from google uh so you have command line interface directly on your browser with all the required tools install it already to go for your cluster and so on so i have to authorize that and i'm executing command to get credentials for my cluster and it's done so cubeconfig is here and i can use that to um i can starting at this moment say like for example cubesat get notes and see my notes running right here so it's all here and i can use that and my cluster is ready so i want to work with now i has i have kubernetes running kubernetes by itself is useless to my clients so i want to deploy an application application application i'm going to use now intro to astrum it's pretty funny funny application you've seen that already if you attended previous courses hey alex could you could you zoom in your terminal it's a little small okay let me try like these okay maybe a little bigger there you go keep going oh yeah that's right my videos lagged a little bit so yeah that's fine i mean that's youtube sure it's like good so there are uh two ways to manage uh kubernetes you can do everything in the web interface so you can go and manage workloads and currently i don't have anything so i don't have anything deployed and you can have services and ingresses right here or you can use like plain kubernetes control that's what i'm going to do i want to oh so i want to open it in the separate page so it will be a little bit better yeah and i have to make it bigger again so yeah this one i guess is good so and i'm going to open an editor no no no no i need editor yes this one and what's that that's again a cloud ide where i can set the things up and i need cloud shell as well perfect so now i have a terminal and a way to edit files and again i'm going to make it bigger oh good i was about to ask you it's exhibited no worries i remember yeah give us a thumbs up i did i know i saw a couple folks so if it is it is it large enough for you to read now please let us know now it should be large enough definitely good so and now i have to set up a few things i created a folder already and all my files will be in this folder and i will apply these files to change the kubernetes configuration and file what i'm going what config map i'm going to use first and first things i will do is to set up the backend so i will create a file called backend.yaml and that's my file first thing i will put them i can have multiple files but i will prefer to put everything related to backhand in once is them and this one is okay i will keep it here so the configuration map configuration map is just a configuration for us to have uh everything defined and to have configurations for the kubernetes services we are going to use and next service i'm going to use here now i need to define a port now we are going not now please that's important we aren't going the best approach now now we are going the simplest approach okay there is a difference and i will show you the best approach just in some minutes now we have this uh backend file also explained here and now i'm going to apply this file so it will work and it will be executed to the kubernetes so what's defined here i define kubernetes resources in these definitions first one going to be type of config map with the data to invert two variables for myself and second one is going to be a pot and if you attended our last workshop you know what is it and if you don't i'm sorry we have to proceed and we have here a definition for this port which containers will port will have and it will have only one container we don't need more and this container is going to be from data stacks depth up to cloud type backend with container port 5000 so i'm going to apply this file uh so it will be cube ctl apply apply what apply file oops and which file i'm going to apply backend oops dot yeah sorry just second okay backhand okay now it should work backhand dot good oh finally something was wrong with the path so and now i see output of those config map was created and port astra back-end was created so everything what i applied for was created and now i can tell you still get ports to see what are they yep sorry alex there's a question here from vikrant in youtube where is the image data stacks devs slash app to cloud back-end google registry can we pick it from the docker hub too yeah uh here we don't use google so in general that's a good question by the way uh we in general when working with google cloud you are suggested to use google cloud docker registry like that's pretty obvious but in this case for the simplification we are storing our images in the normal docker hub at hub.docker.com and you can pull them from where they are publicly available so i have my code running it's astra backhand one container out of one it's running zero restarts it's absolutely fine so what happens next as soon as i have this container running i want to add something there so don't forget kubernetes is also about security and port by itself isn't accessible externally and if i want to make it accessible i have to add one more resource i'm going to add right now so let's take a look on what's happening here i'm adding a thing called service if you forgot service is something what makes networking possible between multiple pots help them to work with together and that's going to be type noteport again we are showing the simple option now and port will be 5000 and node port to be opened will be 303055 just a random number at this point that doesn't really matter so i put changes to my file and now think what should i do right now apply those changes of course so i'm going again to apply the same file and that's practical thing as i'm expanding my um infrastructure here i just applying the same file and what will happen then let's take a look closer at this so can you see it behind me you know what i will move myself a little bit closer to you to not hide text and moreover i will move you as well higher so we will not hide code from oh i get so excited i always want to be closer oh i am closer to you now i feel so much closer to you alex you kind of look like a thought bubble coming out of my head okay so we are getting back but now people will see the things yeah we are flying now exactly in good so now as i'm applied this file take a look at the first two lines config config map unchanged port astro backend unchanged service noteboard backend created so that means what we have now service now let's take a look from the different side uh because we can uh uh i want to check something on my services as this is a node board type service it's connected to the one of the nodes i'm running and i'm running three nodes oops okay type on yep i'm running three nodes and first of all i'm doing to find the node which is responsible for my port and running it right now i'm doing kubectl get ports but that will be not enough so i also have to ask cub ctl get pods dash o wide to ask for more details for that and now i see here what the note responsible for my uh service for my port sorry has them this long long id i will call it t0x2 and now having the list of the nodes here i know what this is my node t0x2 and therefore i can now require the list of the nodes get nodes dash oh wide so it's not only for pods but for nodes as well and i have these list that's my node and what i can take here there is internal ip address and external ip address so this one is going to be my ip address and i can try to go where and using this node board 30 30 30355 but it will not work three zero three five five because of a firewall so everything is protected you remember so i have to open the firewall first there are two options to do that well there are more options to do that then too but currently we will cover two you can do it in this web interface of of google cloud platform sorry or i can do it from the console so i have this console here and i'm issuing a command which is gcloud compute firewall rules create test node port hello and it will allow here my any drive incoming traffic to this port so i'm executing this command oops okay i've created it already so i have this firewall you will have to run this command it's all written down don't try to remember what i'm saying right now it's all very well explain it in the documentation for this workshop so don't worry you will be fine now i can go and open these yeah i'm a python backend api please connect me to astra via user interface so half of the work is done and now we can um update back-end address for the front-end we need to set up the back-end address it's going to work with so i'm copy-pasting this line and i'm going to change something in the settings so i have a config map here for the i have a config map right here and that's the base address i'm setting and it will be api again it's explain it in the documentation don't worry now i'm going to apply it all so port and service unchanged config map configure it and we can proceed next thing we are going to add to our configuration is finally front-end we have back-end but we want something better when just backend okay so i'm adding one more port which is going to be astra ui and you can see what it's the same data stacks devs up to cloud but this time it will be front-end pretty easy and that's important thing here environment from config map it will take environment from and config and what is end config let's scroll up that's my and config i define it here it's a config map with a name and config and therefore it will take these data these uh configuration settings for base address and use astron to go use astra obviously enables astra and i mean not enables astro but forces application to connect to astrum and base address is well uh base address for the backend so it's all good i can try to launch yeah hey alex i got a couple questions for you um one was asking about it for the cass operator when using the cast operator um does the consent cassandra configuration start with v nodes already i think the answer is yes i think it is pre-configured to do that i just don't know 100 and i'm wondering if you do yeah yeah so uh actually i believe it's changed at recently so i cannot confirm or drop it right now but um i mean i mean especially in something like kubernetes you think it would be set by default yes so it's compared to manual taken care but i don't remember of a particular setting so you better ask david you can ask in background one of uh kate sandro guys because totally totally now the other one you're gonna laugh at this uh i love the name this is from anonymous goyal in youtube i i know it's out of context but i'm very much curious how you have only six tabs with big size and all the other tabs are small at top in chrome and i was oh yeah i see the same thing now what are you doing alex uh i mean i'm pinning uh tabs i'm going to use later i didn't know that was a thing yep okay that's great all right that was your pin there you go yeah yeah you know today i learned you can pin tabs and chroma head i use it all the time okay back to the subject yeah so uh now we added these uh astra ui port and what i have to do right now apply so cube ctl apply this file same file so unchange it and change it and change it create now the launch of this file may take some time because this container is bigger and therefore uh node needs time to take to pull that first so i can say watch i can say cube scale get puts enter and i see what my container is creating and as soon as it will get on status ready i will be good to go i will be good to proceed now it's being pulled so it may take some seconds here yeah good and finally i need to create a service to make this note available so i'm adding one more last resource here separating them with dash dash and i'm adding service so everything already looks familiar here it's going to be service its name will be nodeboard ui and it will pass through port 3000 of a container to port off the bottom to port 303 for free of the node good and we are fine so i can apply it as well and change it and change it and change it created very well and we can see how it works finally hi alex can we deploy kate sandra on gk i don't think yeah absolutely one cloud provider right it's any of them absolutely absolutely so deployment of um kate sandra is going to be very straightforward here and like in the very traditional way now that's an imp that's important important thing uh normally you would have to execute this uh firewall rule command here uh to allow traffic to this port in my case it will fail because this firewall rule exists already but you have to execute that again it explained it in the documentation so and what i can do right now i can find out where the port is running so i get my get ports and i need to do dash oh right to get more information on that and now i see what my astra ui runs uh on the note 574s so i can again cube ctl get notes and that's my guy and that's my public ipm i'm having and my port address was free zero free for free so i can go where three zero three three free and if everything was done right i will see my front end and yay but that was the most obvious way to run application but not the right one so i want briefly to show you the correct way how you run things with um okay if sorry kubernetes now i have to do some cleanup click quickly and it will be easy to do because well in my case as everything is focused on one simple file i just have to execute one little command and you know what will be this command gives you tail delete this file backhand and i'm going to wipe it out boom boom boom boom deleted deleted deleted deleted next one going to be deleted soon as well very nice i can clean up the file this one is well and we are good to check if it's all clean i can say cube city oops i can say cubesat get all and i see what only one service is running which is kubernetes which is good i want my kubernetes to be running so well then we are going to proceed first thing first i will still need the config map which sounds very familiar to us already that will be back and configured oops and i will need one deployment and this way we are going different way so and not like we did before with robots pot is too high is too low level for us with port we have to manage pots but i don't want to manage pots i want to have my application running and earn money on it so where is the difference now i create a deployment and i have a deployment to take care of replica sets and ports running and now if port will fail deployment and replica set will launch a new one for me and if i will say what amount of replicas i want to have is not one anymore but then when replica set will take care of the scaling up for me not myself as my not me personally so deployment is a more advanced way to manage pots and set replication factors and so on and so forth for bots not for cassandra i mean like replica sets it's closer to say but i'm still going to use the same backend container which is good so now i'm going to apply this one so i will have a config map and i will have the pot running and my ports are running and now i'm going to my uh web interface for the kubernetes because that's not the only way to manage the system in the workloads now we have astro backend with status oc port one on one one of one and that's up to cloud cluster so i have web interface for my things uh you remember i created services before to make it able to communicate i'm going to do the same thing and i'm going to astra backend now i will do it via web interface i see nothing in services because i didn't create service now i'm going to create service not using the console and not using files but just using web interface of kubernetes engine of gcp so i will use port 18 and target port for the back end is 5000 but service type will be node node port as we did like five minutes ago it's going to be load balancer so it will be load balancer with external ip which will balance all the queries coming all the requests coming to all the ports of my deployment currently i have one i can have 10 and then load balancer will care of distributing data over them so to expose and it may take some time because it's creating also load balancer but it will be fine actually i think it's fine already because usually it goes yeah i see and load balancer should be good no still in progress usually it goes a bit faster but doesn't matter so there's some questions coming in about load balancing here very good timing um yep should yeah so so i saw a couple of them um does it distribute in ron robin any limitations will be in the load balancer right where the load balancer introduced latency well the load balancer it's still the same load balancer that you get you know by default uh through the driver right so when you're talking to your cluster regardless if it's just a pure cassandra cluster if it's on kubernetes um then it's it's still going to use unless you configure it otherwise the load balancer there in the driver so is it round robin the base configuration is what token aware data center and round robin so it actually takes all those things into a combination when determining what node to go to alex do you have anything you want to add to that uh not really um so i mean if load balancer increases latency i mean there is some laws of physics uh processed query takes longer time than unprocessed does it work right go ahead yeah does it worth it yes absolutely so yeah because you cause part of what the load balancer does um why i think it the overhead is so minimal of what might be there compared to the benefits you get if you imagine in a cassandra cluster with a default replication factor of three you've got three nodes that can service a particular operation any given time the load balancer through the driver is gonna automatically go to the node that's gonna have the best chance of giving you the best response right so and that's something that's being done automatically for you so i think that alone will outweigh any kind of little overhead because you're automatically getting a load balance performance benefit just by using it yep again uh don't forget what in general speaking of load balancing the um two um types of alloy balancing used in the clouds network level and application level so network level uh works at the uh works with tcp ip packets or udp packets usually tcp and it's lightningly fast so it's deadly fast it's like the overhead is close to zero for having that application layer load balancing is a bit more slower a bit slower because it has to unpack the package get it completely see the heaters see them see their properties values of them of a packet in order to establish routing because downside of a network level balancer it may use only very primitive rules where to set the packet like just it's just a packet for it and it can judge by the sender ip but that's it mostly that's all the data it may use for the routing and with application level balancing you may use very sophisticated load balancing grouting rules and set send packages to very different backends depending on those rules http headers hosts and so on and so forth so as you just have seen i have this service finally created i have an external port created for me by the kubernetes engine and i can open it and you see it's here and backend api is here and i can use that and it means what now i have this address this external endpoint to use as a back-end address for the service to use good so we are good to go this one works and we can proceed to the ui which is great uh because well we still want to have my ui here and next one is going to be can config map for ui so i'm getting to my editor and adding one more resource here which is going to be again config map but not for backend but for front-end so it's ui and i will need this ip address to set these settings usually i would connect it a bit differently so that would work in the internal network no proof of public ip but now for demo purposes it's perfectly fine and i will need by itself my astra ui deployment so with config map everything is easy so i ain't going to explain anything here it's a config map named ui config and everyone who wants use can use this ui config cam and that's again the deployment you remember so i don't have to manage ports on my own but i can just create a deployment to manage my ports for me i'm very lazy i prefer kubernetes and kubernetes deployment to take care of these things and they are good so i'm going to apply them good so i want to watch at my ports and they are running i'm lucky this time it was much faster so and we need to what to do what we need to open we need to have a service to get to my front end now we are going to oops sorry yeah so i'm getting to workloads i'm finding my astra ui and i have to create a service for that so i scroll down i have exposing services empty i push the expose button and target port will be 3 000 in this case as of container and a launch it so again take a moment to spawn a load balancer for it and we are going to be good in a moment almost ready are there any questions to answer while we are waiting for the balance to start no i think all of the questions uh so far around no bouncing and everything have been answered and we did oh by the way just for clarification i did get confirmation um found it in the uh cass operator cassandra yaml example that the default setting is eight v nodes um so did get that yeah very possible so an external end point is ready so i can open this one and yes i want to go to this page and hey [Music] where is my node so port 3000 yes that should be correct that's interesting so i need a moment to check if it's all good so my pots are running service type load balancer yes service type load balancer yes and astra backhand astro ui all good so what all looks pretty good to me connection we've used that surveyor okay anything interesting on youtube i'm just a comment um by vladimir in um gcp makes starting a kubernetes cluster so easy for the last few months i was under the impression that it was really difficult [Laughter] because it is difficult yeah yeah but i mean through the through the ui and i was actually just commenting here i was going to say it's you know between what you get in the ui and doing and then if you're talking cassandra when you add in things like the cast operator kate sandra it makes it a ton easier if you if you try to do your own cassandra cluster without something like the cast operator right in in kubernetes that's that's definitely a fun project oh yeah definitely so expose i'm recreating um service because it looks like last time something went wrong and i don't have time to debug it for real so i will either just recreate this one to save some of our time uh meanwhile while it's being created let's take a look at the thing what are going to happen don't forget to use my astra database i will need to have username password and secure connect bundle file i have to download and i have my cluster right here it's a free tier cluster the same as yours exactly on the connect file i can choose connecting using a driver for example with python there will be no principal difference because only thing i have to do is to download file and that's it so i have this file already and i will need user password and key space i have all of them already so this one must be created it's astro ui service and i'm going to open it finally yes i know what's going on let me check one thing but no it all should be applied already and change it and change it and change it and change it so all running 94 so 9480 this one is correct yeah backhand is operational it's always about front-end so and workloads are running and all good so that's pretty very because i used these just half an hour because before the workshop and it was all good so really weird connection refused so okay i know what's wrong it's a typo it should be front end not backhand sorry my bad so this one i'm to wipe out in a moment done and it will be good cubesat applying nothing like doing something live to see that it's real yeah yeah yeah that's always problems of uh live events now i have my workloads services are empty astro backend is here so one more time exposing one which is weird back end we've poured 5000 expose very good as always one minor typo and you've lost it but now it will be good so now i can get back those files now it's correct now it's frontend but i will have to adjust this ip address i hope you know we can do if you'd like alex if it makes sense um let you adjust and relaunch and then we could probably go into menti dude swag yeah i also think what we can dement you right now because it will be faster just to save some of the time and come back yeah you are right you are right i will create both services and show the connection step okay first service is here already anyway so as you wish we can launch it right now or we can uh proceed because at my side it's mostly done one last action here so okay yep i have to adjust the ap address and clean it up a little bit first one done now i can apply that alex you'll appreciate this i just saw it now john paul uh john pat yeah john paul over and youtube says shall we all say abracadabra at the same time it worked for me most of the time yeah it always helped so good now i'm running these last missing service which was misconfigured so hey refresh i have front-end ui as well now i know it's here it's running show it me in the web interface please yeah it should be available by now anyway here we go so australia is here i am spawning one more service for that with target port 3000 expose and now it will work cedric beat me to it yeah expecto patronum yeah i was i was actually thinking of a uh one of the spells from harry potter and cedric got me on that one and this issue is fixed already at github right now actually so when you will start to you to do your homework it will be good already we don't need this one cloud shell is running service details is here okay an external in point should be good yes so we have it here with me i'm going to connect to my database and key space was up to cloud very well and here i have to upload the secure connect bundle zip file i've used recently and my test connection is hey where is my test connection yes and my test connection is green so it's all good cancel close and so it's running and we can launch a new journey how should we call our spacecraft david uh you know why don't we why don't we just call it expecto expecton and journey a lot journey summary will be to explode [Laughter] good so we are going to explode the moon and that's going to be very soon as we are taking off and it works and we have everything configured and it starts in the moment actually we should have writing rows in a second so last few things so long await longest awaited certification vouchers thanks for joining our free week series and you definitely deserve it a certification voucher and how to claim that fill in the form now because form will be closed after i don't know it's better to ask jack but it's definitely going to be closed pretty soon each voucher allows two attempts one voucher per person you will receive voucher i would say up to next week including so don't uh send us a warning email if you don't get it today please there are people doing that regularly we need time to validate their requests and check if everything is fine uh then don't again those three workshops were not enough to pass the exam but uh success the most important for the successful application with cassandra is a good data model and we ask a lot of things like that for example in the exam so you definitely want to attend a our cassandra courses at the academy.datastacks.com or datastax.com and what may help you also is the certification um workshops we are going to have one within one month as soon as you get the voucher voucher will be valid for how long it will be valid three months three months yeah so that should be enough you will have enough time and then it's not only about vouchers vouchers a great certifications are great but real knowledge and skills are more important so that's the link at github.com data stacks academy taking your app to taking your kubernetes to a cloud and i'm going to copy paste this link in a second to you at least to youtube and i guess david may copy paste it to discord okay thank you uh yeah once i see it pop i'll do that yeah it should be good by now and do the steps as explained here it may help you a lot there are also slides i have to update them i will do it right now and i believe we are done for today what do you think probably i do see one question though i think might be worth answering um and the question is from john paul how to find the cluster id um i don't know john paul are you asking for how do you find the database id in astra are you asking for the cluster id uh from kubernetes yeah i don't know as well yeah so maybe but but other than that matter of fact you can always follow up with us um on discord definitely want to say for those of you who joined us today in the youtube chat if you're not on discord get on the discord server um because once we stop the stream today then the chat is going to end um and the conversations kind of stop but if you have follow-up questions or if you want to be able to contact later or whatever the discord channel is really a good place to do that um so matter of fact we should just i'll just drop the discord link here real fast if i can only spell it properly here it goes okay and i will drop here is the discord boom go to that link and go ahead and sign up for the discord channel and um and jack could you drop the voucher form please oh okay so i think the clarification is the cluster id needed to claim the voucher so what you do is you should have instructions in the form that will show you what you do when you go into astr you're going to create a database if you haven't already in astra again use that free tier and then once you've created that database you just you just click on it and the database id for the uh for your astro database will be there and it'll even have a little widget for you to copy that's what you want to paste into that form again the form will actually have the instructions there jack just dropped it thank you jack and jack can you drop that in discord as well please and um and then that way everybody can hit those forms and that should be it as far as getting the id i think that's it for me yeah so i think we are mostly done don't forget we still stay available at linkedin and discord so by the way don't forget to add us on linkedin and don't forget to subscribe to this channel we still have a lot of things to publish for you and that was alex voloshnev developer advocated data stacks and david gellard same and thank you for being with us feign thank you for walking through weeks series it wasn't always easy but it always was useful if you have any questions and don't hesitate to contact us and it was wednesday so we are passing the middle of the week now go and enjoy your lunch or whatever your local time zone is we will repeat with work show tomorrow it will be morning my time and it's always big pleasure to answer your questions so thank you and ciao thank you see ya [Music] on the same page [Music] me [Music] um [Music] you",
