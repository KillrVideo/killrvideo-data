the tests all the tests ran last session which means the schema migration tool will work when I actually attach it to all the hooks within the CLI it's interesting so I've been building this in c-sharp to work as a schema migration tool against Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise so that's that's relatively straightforward like that's that part's kind of done except for the CLI part because all the functionality is there but I didn't hook it into the actual console app the console app still says hello world so that's one big part that we need to work on still gets trained out there's a whole lot of what might be termed busy work that needs to be done but the busy work is the stuff that delivers it to you the audience and to whoever wants to use a schema migration tool written in c-sharp for Apache Cassandra dodged stacks Enterprise and this is only core functionality so don't think this is all that is written there will be more coming but right now we just make sure we need to make sure that we can deliver this and right now last session even though we had success with the test I immediately dove into getting the CI getting the build to work in it I don't believe it does work at this point we need to get in there and get that figured out so we need to build to work and let's say yeah there's our failed build so I bounced this over here so we get a better view oh and I have an authorization problem all I need a sign-in yeah let's see if I can sign in with this don't remember where I left off with getting signed in last time I'm gonna be able to secretly do it in front of y'all or do I need a like oh dear all right so everybody gets to look at my face for a minute and look at the c-sharp screen still while I log in so logging in everybody please hold logging in still logging in part way there Oh first second off third second factor triple digit SuperDuper off enabled going through the fifth realm of authentication and we are almost there now as you can see always takes a few layers you know you got to make sure all layers of that auth is there oh my god what happened to my face I mean I know I know I look funny but Wow look look at this I'm squished I'm squished yo hey as your dev dev dev ops as your as your dev ops don't make it squish my face so this is completely unrelated stuff but I got a I gotta fix this here we go we'll go with this one oh my god not stretches it out okay I'm gonna bah for now then don't want information but there we go okay so get to builds going on we got truck service base need to kind of figure out where to go with that I mean Christine are gonna get you hooked up with some next steps around there we got a lot of different things we've been working on unrelated to c-sharp right now though this is what we're after the Cassie schema migrator so let's get in here and figure out what in the world do I got going on cuz I don't really know something broke resuming build a tee know what and multistage I don't need a multi stage pipeline around try it no no no no don't sure authorize I wonder if that's gonna oh they died well that's a that's a problem let's let's get in here and do this what is this yeah moth pull does not exist or does not has not been authorized the pipeline is not valid what what this seems like a my problem more than add your DevOps problem seven days last 30 days well let's go back into pipelines now let's look at all pipelines those pipelines I just want to look at I go in here yeah okay so this is September 4th okay that one that one built so where is let's look at the what does this test get started what in the no no no what is that even about I don't know what just happened you just totally kicked me out well ok we'll look at that in a minute but so ok let's get this straight let's let's figure out where we are here but look at issues will be organized gotta be organized when you're building software so I don't have a logo yet I gotta get a logo figured out set up documentation for the application need to kind of flesh out that documentation more determine outputs for Mac OS Linux and windows oh that last time we did that from a dotnet build perspective right so there was quite a few commands let's open up code and I'll show you those real quick because I have I have the commands the question is hello test 10 no that's not it the go test build terraform new streaming notes may be streaming notes nope how this is always a tough part delete me later nope that's not it either but it's got secrets in it genius Adrienne she's sharp our notes that's probably where it is oh that doesn't exist alright well anyway I told my desktop somewhere now I have the commands so we need to get those in there so that's that's basically done I need to put the commands in here let's edit and then I'm gonna actually lets your navigate out - it's on my desktop somewhere which is what I'm looking for Cassie yes oh I got the Sunday threshing code there's secrets OOP that all right bear with me I'm gonna find it whoops just I opened Lord get out of there it is it is here somewhere come on damn it okay and the wheat and later can go stream notes I have like ten stream notes content dog have a content doc that's gonna be a lot of good stuff I get to that here's a here's a blog entry a whole freakin blog entry for an unrelated topic net builds I found it okay so here is oh and I actually put this in the notes of the last session so here are the builds builds for different platform deliverables what come on okay and then on here's the map of those all right so these are the different builds that will build it for each of the platforms so that one is ready to go I just need to get it into the end of the build process which is what I was working on last time augmentation used ones to be able to store connection information locally so that is I think I did that this is implemented and then this one we got that figured out that's implemented now not phooey I just yeah delete that let's just close the issue there we go then we can do an up-and-down it's proven to operate and work now then we got usual once to press a CTO for the schema migration yep that's that MSP restore connection information locally we got that all right so let's get some of the other issues in here feature requests oh yeah we need to it's here I need to write log to history table of migrations a record needs written for each up or down migration to whatever versioned point one migrates to okay and this is labels let's say good first issue it's gonna be an enhancement yeah and then we got another new issue we need to all right one thing is to write that logout and then the other thing I need to be able to do is migrate user wants to be able to migrate up to X version or down to Y version my great so that'll be an interesting it basically be a refactor and an additional functionality and refactoring a little bit of the code to get that in there but it won't be too much of an issue but it definitely needs to be done that's your I migrate up the 1.4 oh I got to figure out how that versions are gonna be done or migrate down version 3.2 migrate up to version 3.2 whoops to like eight down to version 1.4 something similar to those commands and then this is gonna be an enhancement it's also a good first feature definitely would love some help so if you feel like diving in there and put it in that project that one all need to be in help pointed and put it in the project sure yeah okay all right so now let's get that going go back to the pipeline here we're gonna figure out what the let's say run yeah run just run a new thing sure let's do system dynamics Diagnostics I mean oh I thought it went green for a second hahaha that'd be kind of weird oh wait I wanted to go pipelines this pipeline just now one second it just crashed out what is the excuse here well let's let's try a new one let's try just a new pipeline altogether so we'll do github and we're gonna do kasi schema migrator existing as your pipelines yeah mo yeah path is right there I think that's what it is let's close up all these let's open the project take a take a gander we're in the we're in the refactor right now oh it's Azure pipelines and config I have both ah what to do what to do what is this for oh that's for that and this is for this yeah okay restore and build so that should work on that one so let's oh look it put the new that's what I put and it crapped out on me last time restore and build all right let's run that let's see what we get okay well let's oh okay oh this is not put up there I'll bet good status yep get and going back to 1604 what's going on here we're queued what's that mean initializing job all right stuffs happening all right dad that'll probably work bet you that's what the problem was so let's get rid of we got pipelines let's get rid of this one edit oh I thought settings how do you how do you get rid of delete I have to put that in there say what I got to do oh that's my Bernie Sanders impression all right I think I got it I think I got oh look at there look at green yeah that's what I'm talking about sweet okay so 1604 works let's see about a sure that puts as your DevOps Ubuntu image all right Microsoft hosted agents for as your pipelines those pipelines I had a boon to image so it's just well I guess 1604 is fine really I don't really have a problem with that windows container 1803 I guess I could do Oh use use Packer Linux VM to create virtual machines and edger now this is amazing since this thing I don't even know if this works instructions to build one is images Packer to create Windows to do a pot use a pipeline image okay well I kind of see what you're doing there but I don't really want to go to that trouble so anyway on the positive note other positive notes here's all the tests all tests currently work here's my table for testing etc in the database what I actually need to start populating per that one github issue is this history table which it does show connection con validate which means connection validate check right and then it shows the validated so matches to whichever one it started with there and that basically happens every single time anything occurs okay I figured you know just write it every time a connection is occurring test is occurring whatever it's fine needs to be there needs that verification it ought to be plain and simple that's that's it so here when I actually do a new thing let's let's start working on this build and see if we can't get line at three named Windows build and put script this is where we need to go back here let's do let's get the Windows one working just get that one working first I don't know if that one's gonna work or not and then get status good add to the pipeline adding the windows x64 dotnet build maybe I should update to 3.0 - should I update to dotnet 3.0 hmm I don't know think when I asked I'm going to ask Twitter yeah let's ask Twitter we're in my tweet go always it just loses yeah that's that's very true sorry to get political but there we go well we'll see let's see what anybody and everybody says sure somebody respond soon um alright so how's our build there how's it going let's check let's check on our build an error occurred wrong number of segments it's here add command camel to Azure DevOps tasks inputs bash for Linux and Mac OS and cmd.exe in Windows hmm well script date /t get to date list contents of folder era to her so frustrating so why didn't that work display the name working directory it's classic what that didn't make any sense whatsoever what is what is this page do I need a change this does this need to be at at - I don't know what this stuff means it's not intuitive at all good ad trying another random thing wish there was a check like a way to as your CLI check build status or something just within here I guess I could look at the readme is it does it display let's take a look at it stop plugins yeah let's get those yeah maybe that's a way to do it so I'll restart now and go check well that's restarting trine another random thing check out worked windows build so I have this build it goes against those three CS proj way - can I like does that keep up with the bottom now yeah okay that tags so if I click this it tags to the bottom until it's done I guess so build works right there okay so then windows yeah oh do I need self-contained what applicants are required to use the application how this either set self-contained to false or used set use that post to true what yep I don't get that at all I don't know what that means all right what does that got to do with what does it have to do with any of this actually seems arbitrary so let's let's go back and we'll try I don't need that open the writer is opening with the thing so I'm waiting for just a second let's try let's try the Linux 64 self-contained yeah I got self contained in there so self contain true and that that says it broke on self-contained a required e is the application host what's that crap me and so like if I woopsy me I don't know if I open the right project because we're in the refactor one come on nyan cat' you can do this here we go okay so now I got a way I think we can tell the status here yeah okay so it should build failed and we can bounce out there by looking at the readme but let's wait yeah we're here in kasi refactored land right oh yeah cuz the name that's why it says okay so that yeah that's I guess it's properly broken for whatever reason so it's released when six for self contained true well let's change it to the Lenox one and we'll see if it can publish the Linux one all right people let's see here how do we do I do have to oh I thought I'd be able to click and oh it is going just going slow what's going on oh it's what happened oh release crap what is the problem here what is the freakin problem this is this is seriously not intuitive that's your yeah bill task net for COI whoa oh maybe I need to use it though I need this there's some examples let's try some examples here command build dotnet core CLI 2.0 build multiple projects okay let's let's try this see if I can swap out the build for that instead of using a bash script thingy or whatever so down that core to Oh build and let's let's actually get rid of these I just want to build the solution because it should build the whole damn thing which is Cassie scheme vemma my great daughter see if that works because that would be cleaner it'd probably be better if we were actually using the CLI dotnet core CLI to build this so ad trying out the actual diet met COI for the build duty duty duty duty is that dude I don't know what that does whoa what is that your store oh okay yeah it's getting the packages how did I mess it up stalling the drivers okay dad looks that looks promising what's this shell thing Wow look at it look that crazy shell that's executed this this UUID good thingy what even what even is that that's some interesting wild stuff okay so here's the dotnet seoi runnin we doing good oh come whoa snapples yeah alright so that worked that's a big plus let's uh let's yank this actually let's get that clean out of there I don't even think we need that it whoops I don't know what I did but anyway we don't even need that anymore you just have that okay so let's do a git add commit cleaned up the build process okay so we still need to do a number of things though so there's this and let's see if we can do click on that sir it's okay we got that push done Ezio like push oh yeah we don't need to dad we don't need to pack oh we need to publish that's what we need to do let's take a look at that selector config config command pack what so what's the pack do need a package to it specific output directory pack a symbol package why don't I don't need a package it for I want to package it as an executable or something well I want to publish anyway I know that so just copy all this publish package to an external endpoint with a stored new get config file and stored credentials I don't need could drink credentials either it's just a CLI I do need to add that to it though matter of fact let's add that to issues here add configuration for other credential types to be to be to be used setup the CLI so that it can be used with things like vault or other tooling or even environment variables or execution of cql since the labels enhance make a good first issue help on it yes please okay boom okay that's some progress the here's all this stuff I guess this is the basic follow the self resist all the machines on hosted been - yeah 7-zip ansible that's interesting ansible add your CLI basic CLI look at that JQ hell yeah that's installed FTP SFTP sudo telnet unzip W get that's no net cat put IP on here right IP comes on it though I guess okay that's cool that's cool and then they got build essentials you need that clang see make oh ok and docker compose docker Wow all the dotnet core versions of infinity I guess Erlang what oh my god that's kind of Awesome hilarious I'm I'm noting that there I gonna put that much what is this oh yeah OOP all right and then it's got Haskell to that's that's google chrome go nine ten eleven twelve oh that's interesting this is a little bit of a sidetrack but I just wanted to see what is on this image in I don't know I don't actually know what that it is no GS MS sequel server client tools best sequel server route what that seems like that's I'm not even going to talk about it right now bunch of PHP Wow Google API is terraformed yeah yeah that's cool so wait holy snapples I could run terraform from the host and how do I secure the passwords where do I get those where can I put those like in a secure vault I guess I guess I could use it as your vault that's badass I'm gonna I'm gonna have to figure that out later that's pretty sweet okay anyway get down through this Android Roman Kagan welcome and thanks for following just getting through some builds here Alpine ok Alpine's there that's kind of cool a lot of stuff a lot of stuff there I like that I like that that it has all that stuff not that it's gonna do any good for me right now because I just need to do this all right let's go actually RTFM this a bit so requests major version not actually sure what that would do in the context of this path to new get config don't need new get feed restore custom let's see let's do this inputs build so I want to do package publish as the command so let's read my stuff go here we go so this is gonna be publish that be yes solution fall projects custom do I want to do so I did these commands but let's your can I run that from here let's just whoops there we go so that should work if that works it should work on the host machine oh okay self contain false or no no I want to do I don't want it okay that worked but what did it say to do with false said self what run run time identifiers self-contained applications are required to use the application host either set self-contained a false or set use app host to true use app post what was it yeah use fuse app host all right I don't know if that's it false well how do you how do you set the damn thing it's clearly not this so contained it falls or set a post use a post to true alright well let's do false and then where is it where is it putting this let's do this let's I'm gonna nuke this stuff cuz I just want a completely clean build yep let's alright put it back be hard-headed I think that's what I just did there's Cassie console and don't call it that how do we give it a name let's give the name dotnet publish command I shouldn't manifest no bill no dependencies versus Excel contain sorry frame with a specified chart framework in the project file for self indices be resolved manifest no bill no dependencies never store output to configuration right okay so let's let's actually change yeah dot oh oh so how do I so how do I change pipelines yeah projects custom arguments publish how do I do output modify output path what what require when burden schema includes symbols no build configuration pack directory publish feed credentials publish package metadata publish VST SV no packages to push no verbosity restore note newly config bath include nougat feeds to use modify output path well feel like that published web projects projects zip after publish modify output ban fine the output arguments arguments to suck you might for example build configuration output folder runtime the arguments of arguments arguments every minutes - OH let's do this on some let's do Linux x64 whoops 64 or kasi setting a publish folder path all right so should I put modify out Pat path true still I feel like that should probably go in there like this trying another switch whatever it's called pushing that let's go take a look at the bill now so this is running at 22 seconds let's go look at the job where we at we're on checkout installing xunit abstractions [Music] what was that yeah I'm not publishing a web maybe I need a package oh that is that is what I need to do probably say package yeah that's runtime identifiers yeah that's nuts too and I'm not feel about that so detonate public pax the application it's depending it's into a folder for deployment to a hosting system right which is what we're trying to do so it is pop pop flesh right yeah dotnet publish so both of these aired I'll do they air out with the what well let's let's go back and look at my command it's this so let's get to let's get this in there doesn't it publish but then release our Linux x64 so contained true I need to set that as false but it at least tell me so keep your fingers crossed here we go adding arguments based on known good build yet foolish all right a little bit of progress sir maybe let's go check the process of building builds so tedious but kind of interesting great if you like trial and error troubleshooting all right how we doing here 42 seconds it's getting pretty long Oh Oh what was that the same no no web project he said publish web project property to publish web projects well why does that even need no no that's just all right removing the web projects that whatever whatever that is I don't really even know whoops damn it good commit removing the what did I do project bit let's see there's that one I wonder if a dupes hazard of ops build console app what what is this do this before all your dotnet core apps if you need a version of.net core sdk that isn't already install the hosts agent add an extra step here as your pipelines oh-oh I'm doing to to also not to one let's let's put that in there that might be important we're on there nope yeah 2.40 one okay good and whoops it and commit adding the two tattooed for one versions and building the solution with okay and then restore dependencies so should I do I need that one oh I don't want to do a customer feed I just want to do that so should be fine right they come back here would you say TAS version might not be able to impose alright whatever I'm gonna can I comment it out okay comment that out we're now I guess so let's you're gonna leave the restorer should I just do let's go back to that I'm curious what else it says to do Sunday done that you can do it custom okay then builds his progeny Gration release update this to match your need okay so it says to do that it's see how that is you can run any custom botnet command in your pipeline the following example shows how to install and use a.net global tool okay so here's my my publishes right there let's do this let's actually take this out and this this this let's take these arguments and put them down here like that I don't care if it built each of those well we'll try it we'll see what that does this solution should build it oh can I take that off put quotes around the actual command trying another command technique hey dusarque are you little slow on catching the chat today I've been I've been tearing through this trying to get it to collect code coverage on I don't even care about that right now I just want the thing to build configuration about this match your need that is not that is not even remotely is there a freakin executable in here does all this other crap have to go with it that's that's kind of a problem what in tarnation yeah I don't none of happen to ship all that stuff with it is gonna be completely unacceptable let's go back over here and see how our bill is going not good I guess filled with EXA code failed with exit code [Music] okay so I got checkout restore Oh criminy I don't need to do all that can I just do this and then right yeah okay seven second build let's just take all this stuff out of here publish these Linux x64 yeah is it is kind of fun I do like putting together a bill even though I'm not the biggest fan of trial-and-error debugging it gets a little frustrating but in this particular situation I like putting the other builds cuz I know I'm gonna get an end product and have that then consistently set just ship product to end-users and that's the name of the game right trying to get something to people where they can use it to do whatever it is that they're doing why is this crap maybe I can do if I can do a particular project so there's that dot o output folder so let's do Adrienne's build let's see if that works poor lead Court whoa that's whoa craziness what's going on in here where does where does that end up oh it ends up being a freaking folder it is all that garbage stuff that is not not even a good thing let's get rid of that get rid of that uh how to build it there too so let's do I get out of here alright so that was cool so let's do put this here though so we can see it dot o Linux x64 and then we'll say kasi like that yep okay see if that'll work now and get commit adding just the scripts to run oh the hour is up it's like I need to roll in her mid but you know we're gonna keep going we're gonna keep going because I do not have a meeting right now and yeah I'm having fun so whatevs at least a few more minutes here we go pipelines where are we at here how we run it cute all right command line whoop male on button no my god so fast I'm missing what's happening what did what did happen a restoring package so that stores in it I'm not really sure really sure what this host machine is doing but we're about to find out yo yep so while y'all are here don't forget to follow and go follow me at Adriene hall on Twitch - well yeah don't forget to follow we're gonna be doing a lot of work on this c-sharp schema migration application for Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise we do a lot of other stuff on the channel too so you follow you know you get all the good bits it makes it easy to set reminders etc for all of our events that are listed in the events up top oh wait sorry it's this way isn't it it's the events up up top over there yep one day I'm gonna figure out how to point on this thing since everything's actually backwards so what what happened I didn't see what happened something broke bash exited with code one Cassie console yup not not happy with this not happy with this at all this is not intuitive I want a self-contained app let's see if out let's speak about I know it is okay so that's that's breaking on the test I don't care about the test anyway the the bill doesn't need the test so let's do I'm gonna do a specific project I wanna build a specific project so dotnet build the project I didn't build command right I just that's what I was on wasn't it a new Brunner welcome to the channel you're gonna get all the good stuff now so it's you're done that a mess build no dead framework interactive dependencies incremental no restore output runtime verbosity no I just wanna run like one one project run run solution project done net build build server my great news publish project the project near so closely set some note restore flag okay oh okay so maybe dotnet publish just like that of course that's not our thing there so to be let's just do this let's do kasi console just try locally real quick is that gonna hit it project file does not exist all right so maybe just the this underweight it's probably okay um no so we'll do this probably no it's gonna be cast so like that magic okay so let's get that in there the right way whoo crazy stuff y'all alright so if that one works we can get all the others added real quick I have all the build in there yep sure is that's cool though that's cool good stuff need to set the build server though so the build server will actually put the files out there and the release folder for github figure that out later we gotta get the build at least the build working first bait basic build for just the Cassie console project like like we want then let's let's get going here come on it's gonna be a new one already six wait six minutes ago fifty hello whoa hi there is running now whoops I'm gonna do that everyone back in the job and whoa that's not what I wanted to do I wanted to go to the bill job there we go okay this is where I wanted to go consul sent us everywhere can business just send it anyway okay that's the dotnet restore running which that seems to work fine I think we I don't think I've had a problem with that a single time yet and then by the way y'all house what's the house the volume on the music it's it like super annoying level or is it at a reasonable level I always try to keep it at a set 30 and I've noticed it's been pegged up to almost 40 so I'm just wanted to ask and get a feel for what everybody hears because what I hear is different than what y'all hear I have it freaking cranked I talk and I can't even hear myself talking right now I'm just like rocking out to the music it's okay cool alright good stuff last thing I want you all to do is struggle hearing me saying pertinent stuff when there's some goofy music blasting over it cool it's all it's all pretzel rock which speaking of it hasn't been posting that the songs in the channel has it it hasn't that's weird so that probably means no it's that's weird whatever I'm hosting it it's posted in my channel oh I see what's wrong derp alright it might start posting it now anyway looks like we got a good build which if that's the case we just made huge progress success 52 seconds yes okay I'm stoked boom okay alright we're gonna be able to cross off an issue y'all that's gonna be super wicked cool okay boom all right now let's I did all that I need to actually come back here there it is okay we're output so Linux missiles 64 and then win 64 here we go look at a progress you know sometimes it's a battle but then you get there look at that we're gonna build it we're gonna build it on a Mac - this is gonna run on frickin everything under the Sun practically I need to figure out if there's like a freebsd build and we can cover freebsd - just for you know just for the heck of it now let's get these mapped accordingly - here I mean these the the Mac OS ones seriously like I would expect it to run on either or like I don't know why I got a build to a particular version of that there's not like specific hooks or anything special for the filesystem or anything for to need that but there it is Mojave and whatever that previous version is the dot thirteen one alright so let's see if we can get all that added adding let's do this oh my god we're gonna be able to if this works this works I'm gonna be freakin stoked we're gonna be able to close that issue for all the builds [Music] [Music] it's like all this all this work so much work so much work there go one to run in there alright so yeah this is this is definitely working yeah yeah it's tense I'm on like pins and needles come on come on thing do all the work do all the work right make sure to put it in the folders it's almost there got all the fingers crossed all the fingers crossed look at that it's the advantage of learning to play guitar and tight I guess type helped typing help too over there did it oh my god y'all uh uh after struggling with that for so long I mean it was only like two hours probably worth of work but it seemed like a week where the time all right all right hell yeah so if we bounce back over here build is gold done books not done done there we go and then look at that green I love it green that should update too soon and B oh it is five okay that's right I added another issue all right let's get over to code status I didn't do a last minute thing right now okay and clear exit is it talking about over here it's your view Falls yeah no I don't I don't even know if I I don't know what just happened there but anyway don't ask I'll add all the directory so under here though has missing packages what no it doesn't fiddlesticks that's nonsense let's run it though let's run the console Oh what happened here core lib project was restored using got everybody 2 to 6 but with current setting this version to 2 would be used instead the same settings are used for restore and for all right can't win sometimes oh I don't want to do a deploy anyway I want to do just build let's do just a build see if that see if that fixes it no of course of course there's some conflict right alright so guess what there's our there's our build directory though I'm gonna actually delete that alright so we got the builds done that is super freakin awesome next session though let's talk about that let's talk about what's coming up next next session I'm gonna do more of the build kind of clean it up a little bit might be some of that between now and whenever the next session is which should be next week Wednesday 2:00 p.m. as always for data stacks is c-sharp our but we're gonna we're gonna work on those features we're gonna clean up the build I'm also going to there are a few other little things but basically get it into a shippable state and get the documentation done and posted up there on github so people can download and use the executables per their particular operating system right whether you have Linux rather you're running Mac whatever right that's the that's the whole name of the game here and you'll be able to do your schema migration so I want to actually be able to get the executable and see what it looks like to get to executable and use it on a machine that doesn't have all these development tools in the pipeline right like ie development tools that are all installed on it I have some virtual machines that are set up that we'll use to test this stuff and all that will be coming up in the next episode or three or four however many of the data data stacks is a c-sharp our that I do also besides this one though this is Friday I'm pretty sure at 1:00 p.m. I think it's at 1:00 p.m. PDT Pacific I will be diving back into refactoring killer video which is which is basically a big old lifted up and shifted over into completely new net core projects there's like 10 projects or something that thing and the big solution overall so it's like a big enterprise type grade upgrade to the latest dotnet core and upgrading all the libraries to the latest stuff and just modernize the the core stack all together so check that out I'm gonna be working on that at 1:00 p.m. on Friday and I'm gonna continue that and aim to do the c-sharp refactoring for killer video every Monday and Friday at 1:00 p.m. check the events in the thing and follow be sure to follow and I'll be doing all of that um let's see what is the other the other bits here what oh yes all my time zones are PDT we're on Pacific sometimes I try to remember to state but yeah good good catch there um and I need to make sure I do that since I'm talking to technically the whole world right yeah so those two things are coming up I am now about to switch over and dive into my own twitch channel and Adrian hall I'm doing some go coding on similar things just got to build fixed on it previously in the week and that's that's gonna be a short session because I am heading out to check out the plumie release party and some other events that are happening here in Seattle such as hashey conf and engine ex-con for both happening right now so I've been kind of crash the parties and stuff so anyway until next time happy coding and all that good jazz cheerio [Music] [Music] [Applause]",
