    "text": "hello and welcome to today's workshop today we're going to be talking about managing big data for use in a front-end application and we're going to be doing that by using a netflix clone as a example so we'll be developing a netflix clone using react the jam stack and graphql apis so let's start with a few housekeeping things today's workshop is going to be very much hands-on and we'll be working out of a github repo we'll have a link in the description to our github repo and we'll be working out of that pretty regularly for this workshop we'll also be using a tool called git pod now our goal with these workshops is to make sure that there's nothing to install on your local machine if you want to work locally you absolutely can there are some instructions in the github repo just some dependencies that we that our project expects to make sure things are working fluidly but we'll be using git pod which is a cloud-based ide that integrates really well with github it'll be able to you'll be able to launch a a cloud-based ide right out of our github and it will include a predetermined environment that we know works that has all the dependencies you need so it's really easy to get started and really useful we'll also be using a tool called netlify now nutlify is a global cdn and a hosting solution for web applications primarily what we're going to be using it for today is the netlify cli which is a development tool which allows us to emulate the netlify environment on our local machine or in this case in getpod and that allows us to use the serverless function and and backend that netlify provides for us locally rather than having to deploy it to production uh to get those functionalities uh it makes it very easy to if you would like to deploy this actually to production it will provide some tools to be able to do that very fluidly but we'll be primarily using the cli tool and finally for our database to manage our big data we're going to be using astrodb and astrodb is a database as a service built on the apache cassandra project it has a lot of really cool features including a data layer that we call stargate that is going to expose our database through various different apis including rest graphql and document apis and we'll be using graphql today so today's workshop is definitely geared towards the beginners and intermediate level users uh we will walk you through all the things that you need to know to be successful in deploying this app we are not going to dive too deep into the react side of things as far as ui we will talk about how to fetch the data from the front end and how to fetch the data from the database using the server list functions but everything is pretty easy to understand and we aim to make it easy to understand so for today's workshop you will be able to earn a badge if you would like to there is some homework that is specified in the github repo and if you would like to complete that homework and get a badge issue that you can use on social media or linkedin or anything like that you totally can do that and it's really really cool we have several badges as you can see for all of our workshops and we have lots of users taking advantage of that so we'll have more details at the end and the homework requirements are specified in the github repo so check that out all right so let's get started with our content for today we're going to be building a full stack application now what you see on the screen right now is kind of the standard definition of a full stack application right we're going to be making a web application so we have our mobile browsers and our web browsers as kind of the interface to our application we have our front end which composes our user interface um and then we have a back end that the front end will talk to which will then give it we'll have some functionality in the back end usually the back end will talk to the database and the database is where we're going to store all of our information this is kind of the standard model we're going to be doing things a little bit differently today we're going to be using the jam stack methodology and what that means is our application is going to be comprised of the user interface as well as apis which is those serverless functions that netlify will expose to our front end those serverless functions will then talk to the database through an api layer stargate in this case the graphql api which will expose that data from our database to our serverless functions so this is what it's going to look like for our application today we're going to be using react for our user interface jam stack serverless functions for our apis and those will be hosted in a node.js environment and then for our database we'll be using a cassandra database through astrodb and then graphql apis through stargate that live on top of it so let's go ahead and start building this application we're going to start at the database and we'll kind of work towards the front end right so our database is going to be a cassandra database through astrodb so let's go ahead and start with that we're going to create an astrodb [Music] so astrodb is completely free to get started all that you need is a github account or a google account or you can sign up with a regular email and password no credit card is needed to sign up at all uh it's really quick to get started and completely free so i'm gonna go ahead and sign in with google because i have a google account feel free to uh pause the video and sign up uh it might ask you like a survey question of why are you you're using it education is i think one of the options and that is a perfectly good answer i'm going to go ahead and sign in once you sign up you will be greeted by a a dashboard that looks like this you won't have any databases i have a couple that are in terminating mode right now but i'm going to go ahead and create a database now you can either use this blue button on the right or the create database up on the left then we're going to create a database now our database name is going to be workshops and we recommend following the the naming convention that we have here a lot of the code in the application assumes these names so the easiest path forward is just to use the the names that we have here if you want to use your own you absolutely can you just have to make sure you change it everywhere that it's referenced so our database name will be workshops and then our key space will be netflix and our a key space is kind of like a schema or a namespace uh it's just a collection of tables and then for the provider in region you can select whatever provider you want uh you don't need an account with that provider astra handles it completely for you and for the region you can just select a region that is closest to you so i'm going to go ahead and choose us central and then you can click create database and what this is doing is it's creating a a distributed cassandra cluster of three nodes so there's actually going to be three nodes where all of your data is going to be stored in a distributed fashion so as you can see my workshops db is in pending status it'll just take a couple of minutes to switch to active and while we're waiting for that we can get to some other explanation okay so we are using the graphql api now astrodb comes with this stargate data layer that provides different apis now we can use any of the apis that are available to us we don't have to specifically specify we have rest document and graphql apis today we're going to be using graphql but what is graphql well graphql was created by facebook in 2012 but it really gained popularity when github announced their move to graphql in 2016. uh it is an api query language that allows you to specifically request the data that you want rather than just getting all the data that the endpoint would provide so typically with a rest endpoint you would hit that endpoint give it whatever you know information it needed and it would send you back just this huge bulk of data regardless of whether you need all that data or not graphql lets you specify which data you want and it just sends that back which really reduces the bandwidth and it's really useful for like mobile applications so graphql actually requires a schema to be in place and you can describe your data by creating types so for example we have here a type called project that we're defining as having a name tagline and contributors and the data type for contributors is another defined type called user and it will have its own subset of data types and so we can kind of nest these uh types to have a hierarchy of different of all the data that we that we have and you can ask for what you want so in this query we are we're asking specifically for a tagline where the project type uh has a name graphql and so when the so on the return under the get predictable results we see that all we get back is the tagline we don't get any of the other data we don't get the name we don't get the contributors we just get the tagline so if we do an analysis on the strengths and weaknesses of graphql we see that declarative data fetching being able to specify the data that you want is really powerful we also have flexible versioning and it matches the standards using json and http some of the weaknesses though is that it uses a single endpoint right we don't have multiple endpoints like we would in rest apis we have a single endpoint and that makes it pretty difficult for security or monitoring you would have to set up different endpoints if you really wanted to separate that security which is kind of a downside of con if you would it does have a complex implementation it is still young and still maturing but in our case we're using the stargate data layer which simplifies that for us significantly and caching is pretty hard but there are solutions for that netflix itself uses graphql and it uses apollo as a good solution for caching the main target for graphql is the backend for front end as well as mainly mobile bandwidth considerations all right so this is kind of our structure that we're using right now so astrodb is a cassandra database it is hosted on we know whatever provider you selected aws azure and google cloud and then we have that stargate data layer that exposes these apis and we're using in this case graphql now we have several different tools in astra to interact with our data through these apis and uh we're going to be using the graphql playground to uh to kind of visualize how we're using graphql and and start inserting some data if we go back to our astra dashboard we see that our database is now active so what we want to do is first create a security token so all of our communication to our database needs to be authenticated and we do that by creating a security token so on the right in your dashboard you'll see this ellipses menu for your database if you drop that down you can click on the link generate a token and i'm going to go ahead and select a role i'm going to use the database administrator this is a high level role and we're going to be doing things like creating tables defining the schema entering data so we want a you know make sure that we have the permissions to do so so i'm going to use database administrator and i'm going to generate a token now this uh token is available only once if you navigate away from this page you will not be able to get to this page again you'll have to generate a new token so we have a download token details button which will download a csv i'm going to allow and now i have a csv downloaded that has all this data and i can reference that later i'm going to try and keep this window open just for ease of use so i'm going to actually open a new tab and go back to my dashboard all right so now we have a token and you don't actually need the client id or client secret we just need the token for today so this token is what we're going to use to authenticate both our graphql playground usage and our app so i'm going to go back to the dashboard and i'm going to go ahead and click on my database workshops and at the top you see there are several different tabs i'm going to click on the connect tab and on the left side you have all of our different apis i'm going to click on graphql api and there should be a link for the graphql playground right here i'm going to click that and open it opens in a new tab and now we have a graphql playground let me make this bigger so it's readable all right so the first thing that we want to do is i'm going to go over the kind of the layout here graphql playground has two different tabs as you can see there's a graphql schema tab and a graphql tab so the graphql schema tab is where we are going to do our ddl commands or defining our schema so this is where we're going to create our tables for the the second tab is where we're going to do things like insert data and query data so we want to make sure that we're doing the correct commands in the correct tab otherwise you'll run into some issues all right the first thing that we need to do is authenticate our communication in graphql playground so if you go down to http headers and click on it you'll see that there is a space for the cassandra token and if we just replace populate me with our cassandra token we can now see that our error is gone and everything is working all right so we want to create a table i'm now in step 3c in our github repo and i'm just going to copy this uh mutation out of the github repo and paste it here so we can see it a little bit better now a mutation in graphql is how we do edit commands right so this is how we would do creating tables or inserting data anytime we edit the data or the schema it's a mutation so in this case we are creating a mutation and we're calling the mutation we're giving it a name called reference list and we're running the command create table we're giving it the key space that we want to uh create the table in and we are giving the table a name and we're naming the table reference list we have a command here if not exists equals true so if there's a table already that exists uh it's not going to overwrite it and then we give it two sections called partition keys and clustering keys now these are the columns that we're defining for the table and the reason we have we call them partition keys and clustering keys is because of how cassandra works cassandra is a distributed database and what that means is the data in each table is going to be distributed around the cluster and in this case we have a three node cluster but it needs to know how to distribute that data and it does that by using a partition key in this case we are defining a column called label and the data type is text and we're saying that that column that data in that column is our partition key and so that's what cassandra is going to use to distribute that data around the cluster and clustering keys is how we define uniqueness so partition keys plus clustering keys define a unique row so in this case we are creating a column called value and we're defining the type as text and together the the label and the value will be a unique row clustering keys also have a a unique aspect where you can order the data on disk in a specific order so that when we read it back it will be in the correct order the order that we expect without having to do an order by operation on read which is pretty expensive so i'm going to go ahead and click play and you can see that we are returned the name of our mutation and true this means graphql is successful and it has created the table all right so let's go ahead and insert some data into this table i'm going to go to the next tab the graphql tab and remember that we have to uh authenticate again so the the two tabs are pointing at different endpoints so we need to authenticate this as well you can open up the http headers replace populate me with your astra token and then there is one other step that we need to do for this graphql playground defaults to a endpoint that is not uh the correct endpoint so if we go and go ahead and make this bigger so we can see all right there we go so we have this url up at the top this is the endpoint that this tab is pointing to we have to replace this last part where it's referencing the system we need to replace it with our key space when which in this case is netflix and once we do that you can see our error goes away and we are ready to do some data entry okay so i'm going to go ahead and copy the mutation for entering this data or inserting this data right out of the github repo it's a little bit easier than typing it i'm in step 4c let me just go ahead and copy this block and paste it in here so we can take a look at it so as you can see we are defining a new mutation we are calling this mutation insert genres and this is actually a bundle of multiple mutations right and so each of these sections is its own mutation that are going to be executed sequentially this first one we are naming action and we are calling a command that's actually dynamically generated by the api by the graphql api and it is appending the command insert to a name of a table in this case reference list that is the table that we just created so insert reference list is a dynamically created command to insert data into that table you can see that we are defining our values label one of our columns is genre and then the other column value we're saying is action and this is going to be the same for all of our other genres so for example drama is going to have the label genre and then value as dramas and then we are also asking for a specific return value so once it's done executing this insert it's going to return the value that we inserted so in this case it will return action for this one and for the next one it will return anime and so on so i'm going to go ahead and click the big play button and we can see that we are returned the value for each of these mutations this is basically just confirming that each of these genres have been added to the table so let's go ahead and do a sample query let's query the data from this table so i'm in step five and i'm going to just copy this query out of the github repo and paste it in here so we are defining a query right so we're retrieving data we're not inserting data so it's not a mutation we're retrieving data it is a query and we're naming this query get all genre we are querying the reference list table and we are going to filter by the value where the label column equals genre right so we're saying give me the data from the rows that have the label genre and the return to me the value so these are the values that we are asking to be returned right and so since we're only retrieving the value we're not going to be retrieving this label we already know what the label is anyway we just want the value so what this is going to do is just return the name of the genre so if i go ahead and execute this you can see that all we get is an array with several objects where value equals action anime award winning and so on all right so let's create another table we're going to create a movie stable because we're creating a table we need to go back to the first tab the graphql schema tab i'm going to go ahead and clear this mutation out and i'm in step 6. i'm going to copy this mutation out of the github repo paste it in here so we can take a look at it this is going to be very similar to the first create table mutation we are defining a mutation we're calling it movies by genre we're executing the create table command in our netflix key space and we're giving the table name movies by genre uh making sure if not exist equals true and then we have to define our columns and again partition key we are defining as genre our clustering keys are year and title so genre year and title together will define a unique row and then we have the rest of our columns which will just be under values so we have our synopsis duration and thumbnail and their respective data types if you would like to learn more about how partition keys and clustering keys work and more about cassandra in particular we do have an introduction to cassandra workshop as well okay so i'm going to execute this mutation and as you can see we have our movies by genre mutation equals true which means that succeeded and we now have a movies by genre table so let's go ahead and insert some data so i'm going back to the graphql tab to insert data and i'm going to copy the mutation out of step 7 from the github repo into here and we can take a look at it all right so we are creating a mutation a bulk mutation called insert movies where we have several mutations the first one is called inception we are using that dynamically created command insert movies by genre because we now have a movies by genre table and we are providing the values genre year title synopsis duration and thumbnail and we are requesting back as confirmation the value of title so what this should do is once it inserts it should give us back the title for each entry all right so let's go ahead and execute this and as you can see we have our inception mutation and we are having returned the inception uh title and so on and so forth for all of these entries all right so let's do a sample query for these movies we're going to copy this query out of step 8. and as you can see we are querying the table movies by genre we are filtering by the genre sci-fi making sure that we are selecting just the sci-fi genre and we are ordering by year descending now this is actually not necessary because we're ordering this the this data on disk but this is how you would order by if if you were not doing that and we're requesting the values year title duration synopsis and thumbnail so if i go ahead and execute this you can see that i am retrieving the year title duration synopsis and thumbnail for each of our movies so we have prometheus inception aliens and blade runner because we only entered for four entries all right so this is great we have inserted data and we are now retrieving the data but in reality we're probably going to have more than four movies in our database so what do we do if we have hundreds or thousands of entries and we don't want to retrieve all of that data all at once well we can use paging so if you move down to step 8b we'll have an example of how to do paging so i'm going to copy this out and replace it we're just adding the options field and we're going to give it the page size of two and if i execute this you'll notice that i'm only getting the first two entries something else that i'm requesting as a return is the page state now the page state is is generated by the api and it is a unique jumble of characters as you can see right here and what that does is we can then return this page state back into the request to get the next page of entries so the way we do that is i'm going to go ahead and copy this out of step 8 c we're just adding the page state here so if i replace this page state with the page state that we were returned in our last query and i execute this we will get the next page so right now we have prometheus and inception if i execute this we now get aliens and blade runner so this is how we can kind of iterate through the data rather than getting all the data at once we can use this page functionality so now we have a couple of movies in our database but we want a huge selection so if you go to step nine in the github repo we have a data set that you can download and if you download uh this file it is a csv called movies by genre just save that to your desktop and we go back to our astra dashboard let's go into our workshops database again and at the top you'll see an option for load data it's at the top right if i click on that link i can then upload a csv and upload the movies by genre i'm going to click next the table name should be movies by genre this is defined by the file name if your file saved differently make sure that this table name is movies by genre with underscores in between the words that is important and then if you scroll down we need to select a partition key if you remember we created our movies by genre table with the partition key of genre and we don't have to do anything else the clustering columns are predetermined so we can just click on next and then for the target database we are working in the workshops database and then we our target key space should be netflix and go ahead and click next so now that data is being uploaded you'll probably get an email saying that the upload started and you'll get another email when it completes it shouldn't take too long just a couple of minutes but what we're doing is we're actually uploading over 6 000 different movie entries okay so while we're waiting for that bulk data to upload let's talk a little bit about the next steps we have just created our database and entered in a bunch of data so our next step is to work on our application and we're going to be using git pod to spin up a created predefined environment for our application which will load up the correct version of node the correct version of npm if you want to work locally you absolutely can the github repo has instructions on which node version and npm are known to work most the latest versions should work just fine though [Music] all right so in our github repo i am now in part two and i'm going to click on this open in git pod button i'm actually going to open it in a new tab and move this new tab over to my big window and i'm going to continue with github all right so gitpod is now starting up the environment it's going to be installing a bunch of different dependencies that are required and it'll take a little bit of time while we're waiting for that to complete let's talk about the serverless functions that we'll be using now all of the code here is already complete um but let's let's take a look at it so under the functions directory on the left side actually let me make this big uh so it is easily readable and i'm going to make the terminal a little smaller on the left side you'll see your uh your file structure and this is based on visual studio code so if you're used to that environment this will be very familiar i'm going to drop down the functions folder and as you can see we have two files here get genres and get movies these are our serverless functions so netlify is actually going to look for files in this directory to dynamically create endpoints based on the file name so those endpoints will point to these functions that will then get executed when that endpoint gets gets hit so we take a look at the function here this is the standard format for a function we have exports.handler equals asynchronous function and is looking for an event so when this endpoint is hit it's going to execute this function now we are looking for a body or the event.body so we're going to be sending information with our request and the url is going to be defined by an an environment variable called astra graphql endpoint and that's going to be a unique endpoint to your database and we'll be uh entering that data in in just a little bit and then we have our query and this query should look very familiar because it is a query that we just executed in the playground we are querying the table reference list filtering by the label genre so we want to get the genres we are defining the page size as something that we define from the front end so this is going to be sent in with the request as well as the page state because we're going to be storing the page state that we get back from each request and then sending that back from the front end to the next request so that is something that will be bundled with the request as well and then we are looking for our values so these values are going to the names of the genres and then of course we are requesting our page state so that we can then get the next page all right so once that that request is hit it's going to execute this response this query so it is a built-in javascript fetch method we are including our application token with our request so that it's authenticated that is also an environment variable that we'll define later and then the body is just that query that we just built and on a success we get a 200 and we get our response body sent back and on an error we get a 500 and an error sent back the get movies function is very similar we are hard coding the page size but we are still looking for that page state from the front end and we are looking for a genre defined from the front end as well all right so let's take a look at how we make these requests from the front end so these serverless functions are going to be hosted by netlify in a in a back-end infrastructure that they provide but how do we call on these uh serverless function functions from the front end so if i drop down the source directory and i go to app.js this is our main app file and you can see that we have a few things here here's our react component we are defining the page size as four so this is where we would change the page size if we wanted to load more than four genres at a time we have a few state variables for our requested page our current page state the genres that we have existing and whether we're fetching or not so this is our fetch method right here let's take a look at this in depth we are checking if we're already fetching make sure that we're not fetching again at the same time and then we have our our fetch method right our built-in javascript fetch method now this is the url that netlify dynamically generates for each of our endpoints it's going to be looking at netlify functions slash get genres in this case and get genres is the name of our file so it dynamically creates these endpoints based on the name of the file and then we are sending in with the body our current page state and our desired page size and then we're waiting for the response and in the response we then need to set our new page state right because we got a page state from the response and so we are setting our state variable to the new page state and then we are setting our genres as the existing genres and concatenating the new genres right because we don't want to replace the current genres with the new ones we want to add that list and keep it growing because we're going to be doing an infinite scroll type thing and then we set is fetching as false so that we can make another fetch if we need to then if we scroll down we can see in our return block this is our ui side of things we're taking those that genre state variable and we're mapping the values to a section component where we are giving it the genre value let's take a look a quick look at the section component so let's drop down components go to section.js and we can see that we have some state variables movies uh our current page state and then we have our fetch method right here so just like in app.js it's very similar we are now looking at the generated endpoint dot notify functions slash get movies and we are sending in the genre that we want right because we're getting movies from a specific genre and then our current page state as well and we will be getting movies back from the response so we set our our movies state variable to the values that we get and our new page state will be set to our page state state variable as well all right so let's get this app running and see what it looks like the first thing i need to do is in my terminal i need to run a command to install the netlife cli so i'm going to go ahead and npm install dash g4 globally netlify cli oops cloi all right so what this is going to do is install the nut cli which will allow us to uh run the app in an environment that emulates netlify's production environment right so we'll be able to have access to serverless functions as well as the dynamic back end that it generates for us all right so now that that is done we need to enter our environment variables right so we're referencing two environment variables we have our graphql endpoint and our application token so to do that we're going to create a new file you can do that one of two ways you can either use the ui here to create a new file dot enb is the name of file or if you want to use the terminal you can also run the command touch dot env and that will also create the the file all right so in here we need to enter two things uh and i'm in step six of part two you can copy this block out of the github and paste it into the env but first we need the application token so in your csv that you downloaded for your application token you can just copy that out and paste it in here if you did not download a csv you will probably need to regenerate a token which is fine and then for our graphql endpoint we need to get this from our astra dashboard so i'm going to go to astra dashboard [Music] i am in my workshops database in the connect tab i'm going to go to the graphql api section and then i'm going to scroll down and look for the endpoint it's in number four here and copy this value right here and this is the endpoint and this is actually what uh the graphql playground uses as well so if you still have the playground open you can copy it out of there as well i'm going to pull paste that there make sure it ends in netflix and that should be everything that we need so i'm going to go ahead and save this and now i'm going to just do a quick npm install to make sure all the dependencies are installed for our application and now that that's done we will do a netlify dev and this is going to run the application in that netlify environment all right so it should open a simple browser you can actually click on this button on the top right to pop it out into a separate window and let's make this big right and as you can see we have our netflix clone running and the the genres are being populated here and you can see all of our movies and as you can see only the first four genres are being populated until i move my mouse into the next section and it automatically starts loading the next page and so that's how our our genre paging system is working it actually looks for the mouse enter into that section to load the next view and for the paging for our movies you can see if i click on this arrow it then generates the next page of movies and loads them in all right so that is our netflix clone congratulations on getting the uh the netflix clone up and running hopefully you learned a lot about how graphql works and how to use that api from the front end to uh reference big data in your database so for homework uh if you would like to get the netflix badge for our workshop you can complete the homework that we uh showed in the github repo basically it is importing a movie that you like into the db using graphql you can use the graphql playground as shown in step 7 and then get a screenshot of your netflix clone running in gitpod or if you would like to deploy it to nutify you can do that as well and the screenshot should show your custom movie and you can upload that to uh the the submission form that we have in the github repo as well and then as an optional homework uh there is a video by anyakubao who goes through the more of the ui side of things more the react ui side of things for this app and we'll have a link to that video in the description it is also in the github repo thank you for joining today's workshop we have workshops every single week we do them live as well if you go to datasacks.com workshops you can see the upcoming workshops that you can attend and register for we also have a discord of around 18 000 users right now and this is a growing
