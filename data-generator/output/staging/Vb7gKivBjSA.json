    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] hi I'm Adrian and this episode we're really gonna focus on one of the major issues about managing state in a multi cloud architecture so really why is this an issue and why is it a major issue it's an issue I just thought it was an issue on Tuesday yeah yeah it's it's been around before multi-cloud I think multi-cloud probably introduces even more thought and concern that needs to be taken into account whenever you're designing an architecture for an application so I guess the the problem is just to state the obvious the management of data between your system of record down in your database you know you have your your data stacks enterprise cluster and all that stuff is safe but you have all these different tiers that the data needs to flow through you might have a CDN with some data that doesn't change a lot you know that's just super easy to cache and then a website goes to it and grabs it whenever it needs it prime example Netflix puts a lot of their movies out in CBN's the whole multi-gigabyte movie is sitting out on a CDN to make it easier for like east coast to watch or west coast right the movies not changing this film that's done it's shot so that's great but then the other stuff might be cached at different tiers throughout their architecture like the login information or the you know and another solution maybe the e-commerce bucket might be have different cash levels of state-managed throughout the environment and in a multi cloud environment even though you at some point will write what's in the cart to your data store your system of record in the meantime like for a few seconds here there certain elements in your cart would be in this kind of cached State give that quick performance like I'm adding this adding this removing this and I need to make sure that state so state management for that all the way down is extremely important but the problem space is extremely complex too because of the different levels and layers in which you need to manage where everything is right so as we've been discussing and as you've just said to everyone this is a pretty major issue but and like we've been talking there may be a few best practices in place around this so we have a few that we just kind of been brainstorming here yeah but you know I bet there's way more and so we'd really love to hear from the audience yeah please add your two cents yeah give us your comments give us your tweets really we're thinking about maybe once we get enough of that we'll compile lists and we'll blog it will post it you know something that other people can benefit from you know getting these best practices and getting these pain points and in in the meantime though the ones we've been talking about specifically we we've been ruminating on domain and how to split down and break apart the domain that you're working in which really kind of gets us into that micro service space real quick also security like what how do you secure this data it's it's all over the place all of a sudden you have CDN security you have to deal with you have stuff out in some caching tier and then you have your stuff in the system of record like how are each of these secured how are they communicating cloud architectures right different different providers right right exactly so like one provider may have some built-in support for things another might not so a lot of a lot of variables there and then the other one that we feel is super obvious but often overlooked it's testing you have to test post facto of deployment to production you need to test before deployment before you sign off on v1 of anything testing is fundamentally important with state management and especially as you start doing state management across multiple clouds so always be testing yeah yeah always be testing that's that's a good one we got to keep that one planted in your brain so the the the first thing with the domains I think is a lot of things have been solved with going to micro service architectures because you get to break off and kind of slice a domain into things you had you'd mentioned we were talking about a grocery store as a particular domain and one of the things there is it's kind of easy to think visually of the department or the grocery store broken into its domains you have like vegetables you have the meat you have dairy dairy you know whatever it is snacks and as you break those apart you can immediately see very specific domains and you can also see immediate scaling concerns and things like that like 4th of July everybody's gonna be trying to barbecue so the meat section is just going to be going crazy if you break part your domain you can scale and manage that state for that domain very specifically to its needs and you can have like a team or whatnot work on it so it makes that best that a best practice which is to break those apart into manageable chunks you know departments or whatever within your overall domain if you do that it makes it dramatically easier to scale the parts that you need scaled so it's really what you were kind of saying it's not just the actual data availability per se but also the development and the deployment oh yeah there's a lot of elements that add to basically container izing or yep breaking up your domain definitely yeah the the benefits of breaking apart efficiently definitely they did it goes far beyond just state management but it is very key for statement yeah so and then the next thing we were we were discussing a lot is the security realm of things right right so honestly security should always be a consideration and really should be it always should be it really has state management it's just one of the many elements that you should be focused on security but security should always be there ah and really but best practice is what we kind of wanted to highlight here for state management and kind of with it slightly different Flair so with data kind of being outside of a single place it's no longer just in your typical database one place it's gonna be there's gonna be numerous of situations and additional layers with now your data being in different places and may be different like we said different different cloud providers right right it's gonna be in different places so we really need to keep that security as one of our concerns it's good see it's not like you just put a password on the database and your data is secure exactly it's gonna be moving across channels so you gotta make sure you get things encrypted which we're gonna talk about in another episode in depth right been doing a lot of work with that lately right encrypted on both ways right exactly going coming and going and and one of the problems I saw which just cracked me up I had worked with a group that did all this work to make sure a thing was encrypted but then at the endpoints it wasn't actually encrypted it was being encrypted post facto of being munched around or whatever so he had this whole phase where it was just completely open you know plain text right then they encrypt it and it rolled out so in the browser etcetera they were fiddling around with stuff is all in plain text then they encrypted and send it across the wire so you could intercept it right right or the right or the tip of that right you have it encrypted on both sides but then you send it through the wire and clear text yeah so that's always yeah exactly it's not a good situation that happens a lot yeah so those are again just keeping those things in mind and especially because data is now moving so many places and more places than you actually originally maybe have we're thinking of that definitely has to be a concern so kind of here I think we've actually asked a lot more questions around security than we really answered yes but I think if you're just keeping your focus there on security it's really gonna help you I think that's a perfect way to state it because really today's security is not tomorrow's security and it wasn't yesterday's security either once you get there security is very very much even more so a lot of the time than ongoing development a continuously morphing situation like you have to stay on top of things you have to read about it on a regular basis you know even like just set up checkpoints on a weekly basis to like talk shop about what is going on what you think you have covered what we don't think you have covered you're gonna be fine a new stuff all the time right you know someone's always coming up with an exploit to figure out how to get into some layer or some abstraction of it so yeah just keeping it at the top top of the mine exactly and now you have so many layers that there's so many other layers to now right so we're gonna have another episode around security yep for multi cloud architectures so stay tuned for that because it's the top of our minds exam all the time so watch that episode so let's talk about our kind of of some of our best practices kind of one that I think both of us were pretty passionate about and that's where we testing I was yeah we have to test yes test yeah lots of testing why you always after that it's really weird I think sometimes testing and really these two best practices that we're just talking about you know security and testing yes these seem to be such a routine afterthought with so many aspects of software development but testing needs to really start early and you need to you need to prototype out things and you really need to test your different cloud providers you test the connections between them test us to us tons of integration testing load testing whatever and I think even more so it's important in a multi cloud environment because you do testing in one cloud or the other cloud or you do testing in your application like you do some integration testing or some unit testing specifically but then you get out there in the these cloud environments and what you did test for is going to be different in testing versus production right and and not like a little bit like in application testing a lot of the time people will do some tests and then Oh production is different well yeah maybe the data is a little different or whatever there but the differential on that's small but you get the multi cloud and you're talking about literal physical things are different in these providers so the networking is different the pipes between things are different there's so many new additional things to be concerned about that you need tests in place that when you push something out there you can get real observable feedback from the environment right there's really no way around giving it a try and the actual environment right it's you're gonna find things that you didn't even consider and if you give yourself enough lead time with your testing to actually do that you'll have time to fix it right as opposed to okay we're ready for deployment and right you you can always deploy and follow the age-old practice of deployment and then you test it I don't suggest that I hope your company survives but that's not the way that is easiest to deal with the ramifications of deployment testing needs to be upfront testing needs to be set up in a way that it is observable once it's in production you need that whole that whole spectrum covered yeah so test test test and test some more yeah I like it and I agree so we've talked about just a few just I think just today we just had three of some of the best practices that we've been discussed there's got to be a ton more there's got to be a ton more and around state management amount expanding it out to just best practices and multi-cloud architectures so really please please comment add more we we want to keep talking about it yeah we want to know your two cents and yeah like mentioned we'll put them all together and provide it back out for everybody yeah maybe even make it a living document yeah yeah like security it'll change a lot yeah exactly all righty good I'm Adrian I'm Amanda thank
