with all the people and that is amazing I see multiple dozens of people join it already so hello everyone I see our term in the comments higher term ah connection is excellent if you can see us if you can hear us then please let us know in the YouTube chat so we know we can start but at my site everything looks green actually trim is healthy hey a ciao Christian commentary we have people from all around the world I guess well we will see soon how it goes so let's start well um today in the film uh developer Advocate Alex voluschniff that's me my job primary job in it is an IIT Exorcist there are some stupid mistakes and misconceptions people doing permanently in their jobs software developers operations teams and I hate it so my job to help free people get rid of those demons but not software running in background but mistakes they're doing and use right tools in the right way exactly then they need them uh today with me David Chang developer advocated data Stacks David could you please introduce yourself sure and I see that it says developer question mark architect that should be a forward slash um but that comes developer architect had been in the industry for over 30 years and I've worked taken Securities path to Apache Cassandra and data Stacks I've worked in desktop applications embedded in real-time systems machine controls defense um Finance or do you name it throughout the industry the one thing that's been common in every place I've worked from mobile development to embedded development to Enterprise development is data it's always all about the data and even in this Brave New World of AI and you know generative Ai and machine learning there is no AI without data so uh eventually I found my home in the data world and and just loving working with Apache Cassandra and helping people learn how to solve problems with with Cassandra yep cool so yeah you are totally right uh and then let us keep moving uh today is it's a workshop about nosql and workshop part mean means what not only we me and David are going to do some work but you are going to do it too we believe in Hands-On learning that means what you are not only listening but you are working you are solving tanks tasks you're pushing buttons to organize that in the best and most convenient way for you we use free primary platforms to make this Workshop live and in the Keep It In Action first all the source code is open sourced and it's available on GitHub uh then for our data we use astrodb which is basically a managed Apache Cassandra so Cassandra in the cloud and I don't remember if for this Workshop we are using gitbot David we're actually using Astra CLI in the browser right right you'll be able to work directly in the browser through our Astra user interface and Alexa just to remind you this is the one of the workshops that we've ported to Academy yeah all we've updated uh all the updated content is on datastacks.academy yes okay so I hope this part is clear now uh completing this short course you are getting your participation certificate or we call it just page so you can break on LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever you prefer only thing you have to do is to watch these stream preferably live but even if you watch it recorded you still can ask your questions using our Discord server and then uh answer the quiz in the end of the data Stacks Academy course link is attached good so now I'm going to ask you some questions and to answer my questions you go to mandy.com easiest way to do it is just to use your mobile phone and you can scare this QR scan this QR code or you can go to mentee.com manually and enter the code which is on the screen 9703-8858 questions will be coming all through the workshop again and again different questions of course so don't uh tweet then the first set of questions will be done yes and the link or the coach will be available using comment mentee yes all right thank you David right it's everything is here already and nightbot is assisting us so good let's move on then uh code to join will be on the screen on top of the screen so feel free to jump in later so what's your experience with relational databases a bit a lot black belt okay there is someone we've left to join a group by black belt totally I see some people on the beginning their path or maybe already too tired of relational databases and not using them anymore so forgot nearly everything but most of you have some relational database experience or a lot of that that is totally great we will discuss relational databases in a moment good so let's keep the questions coming what's your experience with nosql databases plenty a little known known little little plenty okay but you see David we have no okay we have some nosql experts that is good uh if you have no experience uh don't worry that's uh introduction level Workshop and those people who have solid experience with one group of nosql databases this experience will not help them with another group of databases in general one of the biggest demons I am constantly fighting in my job as I.T Exorcist is this misunderstanding of what a nosql truly is and those are totally different databases now you will see in a moment no meanwhile let me ask you one more question but this one please add answer in YouTube chat because it's not added to this deck but I still want to know your answer do you think what do you think about statement nosql is schemales do you think null SQL is schemales or do you think maybe that's not perfectly correct statement or you know what it's perfectly incorrect statement I'm very curious not sure well that's a good answer sure why not and meanwhile last before we proceed yeah yeah I think you asked a trick question yeah sure that's that's a very tricky question you know I'm doing this job for quite a long time and I love asking like pretty Advanced uh questions you see we have people with a pretty strong relational database experience and some no SQL experience so oh yeah no SQL has its own schema not like okay it's not schema less uh it's not I think it depends it depends fit for purpose so people uh one last question okay while you are answering where are you located I will ask one more question about nosql how to type any number you think how many nosql databases in the world or maybe yeah how many nosql databases in the world currently exist what you could go and use is it 5 50 500 or whatever what do you think no idea good answer for your answer perfectly hi Mohammed uh five or six 150 25 no idea any anyone else about a hundred more than 10 no idea five a few dozens under 10 one ring to rule them all yes uh more than 15 Okay so if we go to dbn giants.com you will see what currently known more than 250 no SQL databases and most of them belong to totally different families graph databases um a column in our databases key value databases those are different databases for different purpose so if your answer is no SQL is schemaless I'm sorry but I just did my job well and that is a wrong answer no sequel some databases and some are perfectly structured have tables and that's perfectly fine you will see in a moment so Alex I think that makes every possible response some none all other than all correct yes yes yes but yeah there are plenty correct answers yes there are very many nosql databases um actually a couple of hundreds and some of them are pretty schema full and graph databases are schema full for example although they don't have tables as easy but let me keep moving and meanwhile we have people from all around the world I see a lot of Africa India Europe United States no one from Australia those lazy guys must be sleeping it's going to be like pretty late now right so let's move on yeah and I believe ants were at least one is perfectly correct yeah definitely well then last question what database you are using the most currently or maybe was using in your former project yes that's pretty interesting to see people from some interesting places yeah this one better to answer on Main team so we will see a nice visualization of what worked as a database that's that must be painful I see Cosmos DB Oracle quite a lot of Oracle actually that's interesting cool postgres of course pretty much expected you yeah some people are using Cassandra and that's great that will be introduction but I still will try to surprise you that usually happens okay age baits haven't heard this name for quite some time Aurora okay dynamodb well pretty much expect it cool so I hope everyone who wanted to join join it already and that means we are going to uh next part but before we go to the next part we are going to talk a little bit so relational databases for dominating databases market for literally dozens and dozens and dozens of years and they are perfectly great some people now say what nosql databases will replace uh relational databases and that's a complete like you that's not totally not happening for many many many many many many projects relational databases will be a perfect choice well nearly forever I would say also not for all you will see soon what I'm talking about but biggest limitation of traditional relational databases what was the biggest reason for people to start develop something different so nosql databases is a very very limited scalability amount of data on the planet grows very quickly and recently we were very interesting research done by IDC agency ordered by Seagate company maybe you know sea Gateway we were pretty famous producers of height hard disk drive some time ago by the year 2010 overall amount of digital data on Google was estimated to be two zettabytes currently by this year it's expect its estimated around 120 so basically 60 times bigger and it keeps growing faster and faster so few requirements have changed we will speak about requirements a lot in the first part of this Workshop more volume we need more and more to store more and more data we need these data to be dispatched faster and faster before your internet service provider was lazy and slow most of the people had slow internet connection so it doesn't matter if your database is fast now it matters a lot because everyone has fast internet connection even on mobile phones and then finally we didn't want to store only strict schema data one of the most famous early nosql databases was and obviously as it was considered schema less or better to say flexible schema because schema technically present is just hidden from a developer um when yes well nosql well became known as schemales but it's a mistake nosql can be schema full good yeah and that is zettabytes zettabytes right cool so now that is a really so common misconception I spent years fighting it and I actually kindly ask you to join me in this Crusade people thinking of nosql databases as document databases mongodb all these bunch of things you are throwing Json documents and you have them store it somewhere that is cool that's a great family for many projects it's um will be a perfect choice but not for all of our projects and you know there are very different tools there's still no SQL databases graph databases graph databases are interesting that the graph databases you in the we call relational databases relational but you know what they weigh less relational than graph databases in relational databases relations uh actually second class citizens then you create a relation between two entities when you make this kind of a foreign key linking to entities can you put the date and time when it happened could you put some properties on this relation no then if you want to have something like that you will need a new table and then that's not a relation anymore but just you entity a new table in your database from this point of view graph databases are way more relational than relational databases per se that sounds a little bit weird but that's exactly how it works in graph databases you have much better control over relations and they have real properties and you can explore those graphs and like relations are truly first class citizens here is that it no we speak about key value databases like Dynamo radius people mentioned them a lot today there's also no SQL they don't support SQL they are non-relational databases and they are great databases that perfectly matching the definition of nosql and they are strict schema you have to declare schema in dynamodb for example object databases special use case still doesn't support SQL still stores data tabular databases like Cassandra we will speak about today but also Google bigtable time series databases maybe there are some people like me with operations and monitoring experience site reliability engineering things like Prometheus mostly probably you are using Prometheus already and Ledger databases would also a very separate case and that is still no SQL database your experience with  will not help you with no 4G your experience with neo4j will not help you with Cassandra that's why literally any statement about nosql is or nosql was is wrong because people are actually speaking about very different databases very different families of databases sometimes completely opposite kind of a databases so that's why I say be careful with this definition nosql is way too wide okay so we have a few hundreds of a nosql databases today we are going to speak mostly about Apache Cassandra why Apache Cassandra and it's one of the most powerful databases on the world and definitely the most powerful open source database there are some proprietary Solutions based on the same white paper like Google Cloud bigtable for example or dynamodb but those are proprietary and I am in personal and big fan of Open Source so I'm an open source maintainer contributor I write a lot of Open Source Code all our education basically is open source it and that means but we prefer to work with open source with no vendor locked in bigtable is great but if your application is tightly closed directly output with bigtable and you decide to move from Google Cloud to Amazon web services like good luck people you're going to the right half of your application right Cassandra is open source so if you are not happy hosting it or running it on Google Cloud you can perfectly move to your own data center or Amazon web services or whatever or maybe think about Astra we will mention later but yeah that's the idea bill of Open Source uh yes uh Jose slides are going to be available for sure and like there are plenty of additional materials you will see soon so but why Cassandra and by but why for now I mean not why you should use that this question you will answer on your own version should you or maybe should not at the moment which is also a pretty valid answer but first question I want to answer is why Cassandra was originally created and last point before we go in uh there is a discussion on how do we train our developers how do we train Engineers using Cassandra are we going to answer a question how to use or how it works internally and some people say like no one cares how it works internally people just want how to know how to use that and you know what people what only want to know how to use that I don't call them engineers those are people who press red button then red light is blinking or press green button then green light is blinking those are not Engineers sorry ingenious must understand how it works internally so today we will do a deeper dive than people normally do on how Cassandra Works internally only this way you will understand how to use that right and then better do it or not and the benefit of course to that Alex is that knowing how it works internally as opposed to say working with Oracle allows you to really get the most performance out of it or the most consistency really to tune it and uh fit it to the problem you're trying to solve so it really is important that we understand both the high level of how to use it and the lower level of how it works yes of course yeah that doesn't mean we are not going to tell you how to use it no we do of course but not only that because only that will be not enough uh you don't want your airplane pilot to be trained on only how to use it because then everything is green you will be fine but then something goes wrong you are going to have not a nice landing so this uh disclaimer don't try this at home is actually of course a joke please try this at home please learn things follow things up on our data Stacks Academy we have training grounds where you can try everything in there in the cloud you don't have to deploy anything on your own machine please try this at home but there are still some things I recommend to avoid first have any one of you ever heard about Farm driven development or maybe now we should call it manga driven development uh what was that meta Apple Netflix Google Amazon right have any one of you heard about uh Farm driven development or Manga driven development no anyone nope nope nope okay okay oh that means you are pretty happy people because I did hurt and even saw this in action and that's always hurts my architect's heart heart driven development is the development like approach to development of a software projects then companies are picking uh software Solutions speaking databases speaking different tools just because some huge company using this product like Yay Netflix uses Cassandra let's go use Cassandra too people Netflix uses Cassandra for Netflix size problems that doesn't mean Cassandra is a good or bad feat for you but you need to analyze your scenario and think like when it feeds when it's not any better understand consequences price to pay I don't mean money I'm in limitations because there is no Silver Bullet in a database world so Farm driven development is then you develop your project based it on some cool Technologies what huge companies are using it's nearly always lead to some huge problems now next question have you even heard about CV driven development I also saw that so many times it always makes me crazy and green nope anyone anyone ever heard about CV development or maybe did if you ever did fan please stop cool you all are amazing people thank you so much because CV driven development is one of the biggest dirtiest scenes in the what you can do to your employer CV driven development is then employee employees software Engineers are pulling some technologies in the projects because we want to put those into their CV through basically to put that into a resume you don't care what if it fits your project or not you just want to use it and you pull it into your project and now project is half broken and everything is slow but your CV has some new shiny words that is awful I consider that basically as a crime and we fight it very thoroughly here so please don't do CV driven development and that's very important for us like to really stop this we up let me give me a moment to restart yes that should be good yeah someone noted that during Corona times many folks did CV driven learning courses yes learning learning is always good learning is always good learning is always good CV driven development and you put projects when you put tools into your project based on what you need not your company needs is not good at all right good so I am happy we understand each other here and finally today we worked with uh one for most powerful databases in the moment and that's extremely Advanced at complex and efficient technology and great power comes with great responsibility great responsibility in our case it means what you need to learn how to land before taking off otherwise you are going to have crash landing and we do we want you to avoid that if you're getting to a airplane pilot cabin you see 1000 of different knobs and levers and you know you better not take off without learning how to use all of those exactly the same happens with Advanced distributed decentralized Technologies that's what we will be doing today help you to learn how it works so how it started in the year 2008 Facebook reached very first 100 million users that is a huge number and they were I believe first uh publicly available company um what reached maybe there were some hours but I believe Facebook was number one situation this time it was not only about amount of people situation was about some more um requirements what weren't a big thing before users all around the world all around all the continents doesn't matter how fast your database if it's deployed in Europe customers in Australia are not going to be happy next thing fast internet connection I mentioned that already beforehand your internet service provider lost my almost probably was the slowest uh piece of chain now chain link now it wasn't anymore now more and more people had fast internet connection even for mobile phones well 2008 maybe not for mobile phones but still for laptops yes for sure more and more data sadly Facebook doesn't Opera open how many data they have but there was quite some numbers we speak about petabytes Maybe hundreds of petabytes and of course now very strict High availability requirements so a lot of things changed before all of those points weren't really a thing situation totally change it so they had encountered some problems what warranted between before and that led to a little bit of Discovery there is no database to answer those situations now we are going to become all of us I see there are dozens of people on the stream perfect now all of us going to become software Architects and we are going to think like software Architects and Architects first think they do they Define requirements so what's what we are going to do if you don't know where we're going every road will get you nowhere and our requirements going to look like that in comparison with a previous uh things or databases we're asked to do first now we have users all around the world and that is a pretty strong requirement it was new by that time then volume we are speaking about millions of queries per second millions of queries per second again maybe dozens of or hundreds of queries per second then volume so a lot of data really a lot we are going to we are going to have nearly immediate response that's very important for us to have strict SLA on time SLA means service level agreement and that is something what we promised to our customers to deliver SLA on response time means like we are going to answer most of our queries within I don't know 12 milliseconds basically I mean you can Define different restrictions but that's what SLA on time response time means but also we have one more SLA service level agreement on high availability High availability so ha SLA means how how much time we are going to be available are we going to be available available all the time or we can afford some down times people hate downtime so we need to stay up time like newly always if I can jump here of course for those of you who are new to nosql or new to Cassandra you're going to see some things here that look very foreign from your relational database experience why did Cassandra do that and the answer is this slide to meet users needs all over the world at high volume and provide the high level slas for performance and for availability and that's driven many of the design decisions that will seem completely foreign or out of left field from our relational background yes yes perfect uh thank you so much David you are perfectly right and that's very good you mentioned that you see I hear from time to time like from a developers who have no understanding on why like why I believe is the most important question in it and software development and people very often ignore this question and that leads to many mistakes I I'm on the recent conference I met a guy who was like yeah I've heard about Cassandra that's such a shitty database it doesn't have joins search possibilities are so limited uh like how it happened what people still using that that's a very bad database I was like okay uh what are you using um well I'm using postgres and postgres is a good database yes postgres is a good database yes sure postgres is a good database like I'm no doubt to this question I know it I liked postgres there are joins and cool search capabilities and all these kind of things but tell me please dear sir what's the biggest pressure on your database like how many queries per second do you execute with your postgres he was like okay maybe five to ten thousand uh requests per second and what was the biggest like most powerful passgous deployments you've ever heard like how many queries per second they perform well clustered postgres was capable of handling some around 100 some dozens thousands or hundreds thousands of queries per second I believe when we speak about Cassandra we speak about literally dozens millions of queries per second on a single cluster it's a specialized database to answer those requirements uh yeah so thanks Pa thanks David let's move on uh So based on those requirements we can speak about architectural decisions as Architects we design decisions or make decisions based on the requirements we just formalized and first answer we need to have multiple active data centers um working together so we need to have basically data center per each continent or maybe even more to have uh data close to customers so we can answer responses quickly questions quickly and but meanwhile it helps us with high availability because even then there is a real disaster and region is wiped off uh we still can work with the customers using different data centers now uh to answer volume and velocity questions we have to partition our data we need to split our data into chunks that means there are no single server capable of handling dozens millions of queries per second we have to distribute this workload over multiple servers and Cassandra is a distributed database so that's exactly what it does it partitions data over multiple servers it helps us with scaling it helps us with basically handling any data of any sites petabytes and petabytes and petabytes now SLA on response time how do we ensure we are always dispatching quick responses first we will have to do generalization we discussed today and second we will need to have partition based routing I will not stop on that right now but you will see my explanation in half an hour and yes thank you David can you please voice it voice it in the yes you absolutely must understand partitioning to understand and effectively use Cassandra it's absolutely key to the way Cassandra works correct yes that's totally like if you hear someone saying oh but Cassandra is slow you can just without even any further knowledge just tell him or her ah you have your data model done wrong boom and 99 percent of the case as you will be right that means people don't understand partitioning and they take off their airplanes without learning how to fly and how to land good yeah I came out of our services group and the number one issue we have working with customers who have issues is it comes back to data model data model data model yep always like that by the way I was curious David if we combine our uh common experience uh your experience and my experience in a software development or in it Fields like how many years we will have for two of us I bet around 40 or more uh I have over 30 on my own okay and I have around 20 on my side so we have overall half century of experience in information Technologies that's quite some number right yes okay uh funny good let's move on and finally service level agreement on high availability SLA on ha if you need to have your data highly available all time at all costs you definitely need to think about replication and replication means your data every single piece of data and store it in multiple different places that basically like a backup but backup usually you've write uh put it on somewhere on these can put it onto your storage place whatever and replica means live replica it's attached all the time and available all the time so if something happens with a First Source of data clients can easily switch to a replica to another replica you will see it in action in a moment and then finally decentralization we discuss very soon I don't want to stop on it right now but you see that's very important process we are switching from four requirements we have on distribution volume time and availability enter some architectural decisions we did based on these requirements and that's a very important process good now there is one more thing I want to say one of the reasons relational databases were totally owning the market of databases was because we're General enough multi-purpose and jack of all trades master of known they can play a little bit on both sides of a data field what's this field about on the left side of the field there are oltp databases so online transaction processing on right side of a field there are olap olap online analytical processing and those are very very very different let me explain this well but my oltp databases we usually mean databases what handling workloads or we mean just workloads without any databases behind them those are customer facing in most of the cases we have a lot of operations per second if we speak about big companies of course and we have a very strict service level agreements because your customers will not wait for you to recover from a downtime they will go to your competitor and if you don't want it to happen with your business so that's why we are talking today about Apache Cassandra now yes that's usually a lot of operations and we require them to be very very fast and always available on the other side of the field we have online analytical processing that's about exploration of the data about the analysis about our analysts marketing people I don't know sales doing some analysis over data we have and thinking how to improve our interaction with customers how to grow our business and that usually includes very very complexity queries working with historical data exploring customer Behavior or I don't know exploring whatever change in your region if we speak about some kind of a Webber forecast system uh so very very very a different kind of things usually olap workloads can take hours in some cases even weeks to be done and that is perfectly fine because guys who are running them or girls who are wearing them or whoever running them those uh employees on a salary and they can they they are not customers those are two principally different things so relational databases for dozens years we were good enough on both sides but requirements are getting stricter and stricter and we have to perform faster and faster or we need to do more and more advanced research and exploration over data on all upside of things it led to the development of data warehouses or data Lakes specialize it on data analysis and on oil tpd side of things it came to the appearance of a databases like Apache Cassandra which is specialized to be customer facing very quickly but Cassandra is not so good with complex queries with like dozens of joints for example while there are no joints in Cassandra it's no relational databases um database why no joins because we have petabytes of data spread it over thousand servers as you will see again in a moment so as Humanity developed from uh generally the generalized state where everyone was a firmer a hunter a gatherer a warrior if required but meanwhile we developed dentists we developed book writers we developed software developers we took this way from generalization to specialization why because specialization is more efficient and that's exactly the same what's happening with the databases they are going this way from generalization a little bit of everything to specialization one purpose but when well done so in the end we are speaking about distributed decentralized oltp database distributed means it perfectly runs in multiple data centers simultaneously being building a single cluster decentralized it means what it follows not traditional uh leader folder architecture how we formerly use it to call it Master Slave architecture if this definition more familiar to you but in general decentralize it it follows peer-to-peer architecture the each node communicates with each node and each node is capable of processing each and every query finally it's mostly oil TP specific and well that's a database it kind of means what it stores data but I hope if you are here with us at this stage of a workshop that means you kinda know what the database is I hope so what are the Cassandra biggest users for today uh I would mention first Apple and Netflix and actually I love those guys because they are not just users but also developers both of those companies although they are competitors in real life for some parts of a businesses they still work together developing Apache Cassandra because Cassandra is an open source project last year Apple reported what they current account more than 300 000 database servers with Apache Cassandra storing hundreds of petabytes of data and dispatching millions of queries per second Netflix I love those guys because they are even all more open they provide us more data about how they use Cassandra by the way if you are interested how Netflix uses Cassandra we have a special recording available at dts6.io Cassandra at Netflix where a cloud database architect from Netflix tells on how they use Cassandra at Netflix and like that was a very interesting talk I organized at Cassandra de India a couple of years ago and vinay joined us and shared his experience it was just great so they reported what on their single most active Cassandra cluster they handle 30 Millions operations per second and this number actually scares me because that's really a lot good so let me ask you a question and that's going to be first question so please get to your main team and tell me Cassandra is the best feat poor uh all app workloads oltp workloads both types of workloads oh yeah I see people answering cool keep your mentee close to you I will keep asking questions so don't miss and David thank you for the link to Cassandra at Netflix I thought you were thanking me for saying some of us like Alex were Wizards [Laughter] uh yes definitely uh well and you know Wizards are never late uh so uh yes correct answer is Cassandra is best fit for oltp kind of workloads for both kinds of workload pure Cassandra will not be a good feel because you cannot try and run really complex queries over Cassandra playing Cassandra you can you attach for example Apache spark on top to read data for Cassandra and run even SQL queries over SQL database it's technically possible that that's not vanilla Cassandra right that's extended using Apache spark for example right okay yes sorry Alex we go back to those four things Alex highlighted uh Geographic availability high volume uh time SLA and availability SLA it really fits that oltp environment yes yes that's mostly about oltpin cool so uh question ask it so finally most important things and most important features you need to know Cassandra is really ready for big data and then I say big data I'm in data what doesn't fit single server like really doesn't fit single server Cassandra is a good feat when you need extreme read write performance so when you need to handle more and more and more and more queries per second that might be a good choice for you Cassandra is famous for its linear scalability what that means it means basically it introduces zero overhead on adding more servers Cassandra scales horizontally not vertically by adding more servers to the cluster and that's a very interesting research done by Netflix where you have your uh their test environment scaling from 50 servers to 300 servers while measuring amount of Rights per node notice I'm speaking about rights many relational databases scale well when we speak about reads because following this leader folder architecture you can always add more followers and you will be good but how do you add more uh leaders how do you add more Master servers that's not going to be easy and they speak about right scaling yeah David yeah in those databases if you look at this curve for rights you'll see that the curve eventually start writhing steadily and starts to start to level off relatively quickly yeah so that's why we talk about that linear scalability it's huge when you're talking about huge huge write volumes yep yep so basically for most of a database it's even capable of scaling at all this line would be somewhere here and not straight like the Cassandra so we basically scale it up their cluster from 50 nodes to 300 nodes and look at the results they got that was a really great job and by the way again many thanks to Netflix for this support and for these like work proofing how it scales that's important for us very important thing and yes uh sivakumar we do can say Cassandra is really good for right heavy applications really good there are some limitations coming so there is no Silver Bullet there is no perfect database if someone says you what is a perfect database or Cassandra is a perfect database or whatever Oracle is a perfect database like be careful this guy is going to sell something to you right uh it all depends on your use case and there is no Silver Bullet good so please notice like David getting back again to your uh Mark you recently please notice this asterisk if you know when you have this Mark in your contract or in your I don't know mortgage papers whatever you need to pay very a lot of attention to uh text in small font somewhere down right there might be some tricks the real trick is this feature Works only only if you have your data model done right and that's what we teach on our free data Stacks academic course at well data Stacks Academy but let's keep going finally highest availability so we have multiple live replicas with multiple data centers that means what the same piece of data can be in Mumbai free replicas and Frankfurt free replicas and Boston three replicas that means what outage of a single node never lead to outage of the cluster even outage of a full data center never lead to the outage of a cluster so if you cannot reach desired availability uh with Cassandra basically you cannot reach it at all it's uh the most available database in the open source field for a moment now we do can speak about 100 percent of time there are companies where our clients uh who reached this 100 percent of time over years and the perfect IP biggest problem with big companies they never want to share their names so we don't know really so we cannot share like who are those good uh uh now operations over cluster of thousands and dozens thousands even hundreds of servers may be very very painful uh so my favorite part here as I'm a very lazy engineer I believe for only lazy Engineers are efficient enough what Cassandra cluster is small smart and execute many operations on its own and I don't have to you will see severe self self recovery capabilities soon and I don't have to do it manually as um on my own it's just many of iterations done by your database itself that is just amazing a geographical distribution is already mentioned but let me highlight one more thing we usually we often speak about geographical distribution for our databases as well but for most of them it will be active passive so one data center is active you can both write and read data from it and our databases are passive or standby you can only read data but right data you still have to the active data center Viv Cassandra it is different with Cassandra all data centers are active so you not only be being you in California you not only read data from a Californian data center you also write it here not in the uh Indian or Chinese data center of course because obviously it's going to be slow and finally it's not bound to any platform so you can run it anywhere any cloud provider your own data center so AWS or Google Cloud doesn't matter why because it's vendor independent originally it was developed in Facebook but after that after some Adventures it was contributed to a budget software Foundation which you know for sure or at least know its products it's an open source Foundation what is famous for Hadoop spark Kafka zookeeper Maven and many many many other projects good so now here comes some pain because there is always price to pay joints no joints and people be like what do you mean no joints I want to join data from multiple tables don't forget we are speaking about geographically distributed data with hundreds or thousands of servers and uh like joints don't work in such environment okay they work for some databases but it's always always going to be extremely slow because Sunway is designed to be fast working with data you must always know the partition key and you will see it soon in action so I will not stop there it has pretty limited search capabilities and that means if you are going to do search over your data you're going to do some um some more work like using maybe spark maybe using additionally elasticsearch over Cassandra there are some ways to do that so these kind of things and it requires qualified Personnel so if you are not if you don't have like uh Engineers ready for that you really better send your people to data Stacks Academy to get proper training not short Workshop but real training and Alex I want to jump in something in the slide it says very limited search capabilities when I first learned about Apache Cassandra I saw that and I thought well isn't that what a database does and my response to that today is Cassandra has very powerful query capabilities because we it allows us to team a data model or or custom build a data model to support certain queries now but if you want to do ad hoc searching Beyond those queries for which your data model was designed that's a that's a challenge in Cassandra so it's definitely tuned for high performance queries but not generic searching uh yeah so Vera uh there is a way to get a good search for capabilities with Cassandra but that will require some pretty a lot of play with data model a lot of denormalization and it will fit some some particular cases but not all of them uh good uh oh I see a interesting question Tobin asks how with Sila Sila is a startup attempt to reproduce uh Cassandra's success following the same white paper um it's a single project it's a single company uh project uh so uh and project what basically implemented I believe like 10 or maybe 15 persons of Cassandra capabilities but claims to be equal my test shown it's not equal even close so if you want to trust your business success on some startup company which maybe not get enough funding tomorrow and uh basically stop any kind of Maintenance and development of a database so you will have to do it on your own and we've decentralized the distributed Solutions this kind of work requires a very very expensive software engineers then good luck I prefer to stick to open source original what is developed by Apple Netflix Instagram data stacks of course and many others let's go how does join affect performance that's a good question by Amin so let me answer joints per se effect first join do affect do affect performance then your note server relational database server execute join it needs to gather and intersect a lot of data basically in memory and that's pretty expensive operation already but what I meant is what actually uh then you have some pieces of your data distributed across hundreds of servers for each next join in your SQL statement you will head to gather this data in a single place and process it and do it again and again so each and every join Over distributed data is definitely going to be extremely slow and make node execute executing it within so people let's keep coming let's keep questions coming and that is the next question so uh tell me I mentioned that briefly and now I'm interested if he was listening thoroughly enough how to scale Cassandra cluster by scaling up so vertically upgrading servers scaling out horizontally so adding servers or Cassandra cluster does not need any scaling what will be your answer oh yes hey take a look David looks like we are getting our salary this month right yeah yes uh scaling up is a traditional uh upgrade for traditional scaling way for relational databases or for um scene or single host or a leader folder databases because they don't support horizontal scaling horizontal scaling helps you to scale much better because to a cluster you can add more and more and more and more servers while vertical scaling so upgrade servers scale up getting prohibitively expensive uh very soon it requires downtime of a cluster in Cassandra scaling is uh downtime less it's a live operation so database stays available all the time because some and two people answer it Cassandra cluster does not need scaling thank you Apache software Foundation Community likes your mood but that's not correct no each there is no Silver Bullet Cassandra cluster totally can require scaling that's for sure and given when Cassandra uh was was released in open source it was very prescient of Cassandra to rely on horizontal scaling because shortly or around the same time Cassandra came out we had this revolution in cloud-based Services where horizontal scaling is really really easy you just fire up more instances in the cloud so it fits This Cloud Model perfectly we explain it in details very soon good uh so we are going to talk about some Holy Grail uh some of the most important things of how it works finally internally and the first rule we need to know is all servers are created equal that's very important and very unusual to people with pure relational experience pure relational background because uh most of the databases and no SQL many nosql databases as well like  they follow a leader follower architecture to a leader you can read and write to a follower you can read only that's logistically most convenient architecture it's easiest to develop from a database point of view like people who develop a databases it's easiest for them to develop but it introduced some limitations first it's single point of failure if anything happens with your leader server you are not going to write any data it's hard to scale for rights you always can add more follower servers but if you need to scale for rights if you're getting too much rights you are getting more and more customers you will have row more and more rights then you the only way for you to go for it is to a vertical scaling for leader server which is expensive and each includes downtime and all the other things I've already mentioned and finally application needs to know where to write if you write if you will attempt to write a request to a follower server you will get an exception that doesn't work this way so Cassandra follows different architecture it's masterless or peer-to-peer there are no single point of failure each node is capable of processing rights and reads and uh well if node is down then your client your driver will just switch to next available node or maybe even next available data center depending on the situation so application can conduct any node because any node is capable of processing every request notice it doesn't mean what each node stores all the data very common misunderstanding of course not it's not possible uh so no each node is responsible for a part of data as you will see soon [Music] get back to your phones and try to make me right answer how many masternodes for a Cassandra cluster we need to have minimum free pre-prodated Center count of four replicas divided by three or no masternodes okay I see you answering faster and faster that is cool thank you for everyone who joined and yes no master notes there is no concept of masternodes you see even after us being speaking about the uh masterless architecture for a long long time where I steal people with relational background background who cannot uh accept this idea like their minds resist tries to resist that no people there are no master servers in Cassandra no at all not a single one it doesn't exist that's a truly uh that's a true democracy and everyone is equal you know good so uh getting getting full verb now my favorite part part what always brings the biggest amount of misunderstanding uh and meanwhile there is a good question by sivakumar does Cassandra needs a specific client yes like you work with relational databases using normal drivers uh like postgres drivers for postgres for example uh then exactly you work this way with uh Cassandra you just need Casio Cassandra drivers where by the way mostly developed by data stacks let me check some stream stats yeah we are looking good so let's also the super Kumari might add then there is another open source project called Stargate to use rest graphql uh grpc and a number of other uh ways to access Cassandra without going through a a language specific driver so to get to Cassandra but I'll I'll share the uh link for that open source project yep uh perfect so uh now please pay attention because this part is very important like that's a very internal every person working with Cassandra must understand date is partitioned and that is the game changer you totally must understand that if you are going to work with Cassandra um let me explain this idea based on the real example based on some real data imagine we have a lot of temperature sensors deployed in multiple different places in this case for example in the United States so we will have each sensor records temperature and each sensor belongs to One Network one network can I have multiple sensors One sensor belongs all only to uh one single Network so it's one-to-many relations and each sensor the records temperature Cassandra works with tables so we can take a look at this table definition we are going to create table sensors by Network so network will be some text some ID sensor ID will be also some text and temperature will be integer actually it should be mostly probably flawed but let's simplify so we see we have table sensors by network network sensor temperature and some states for example some Network names some sensor IDs some temperature recordings so far so good now we have this table on the right and we have seven servers in our data center how this data is going to be stored internally in relational databases and in many of nosql databases you will have these data copied everywhere like each table is in full present all all of the servers as long as you don't use sharding but sharding is out of scope for today that's how it looks in Cassandra in Cassandra data is organized in distributed tables so each um so pieces of those table will belong to different servers it gives you huge power it means what you can store more and more data over more and more servers and still be able to answer query within single digit milliseconds answer extremely fast and don't get me wrong it also brings a lot of problems to you because when these partitioning distributed partitioning is also can be pretty painful now if we want to search if we want to run search for example find a sensor which currently has temperature for example 45 degrees how many servers would you ask with this question in a small to medium data relational database you will ask one and only one server right so it's going to be pretty cheap and fast operation um then if we have this distributed table and we want to find all their uh rows all the sensors store currently having 45 degrees we are going to ask this server right so we get the answer but also we are going to this one maybe in Idaho there are also sensor with a temperature 45 by the way 210 something is really bad happening in Idaho uh then Georgia and Hawaii we have to check too maybe Florida maybe Delaware maybe California maybe Alabama who knows we have to ask literally every server in the cluster and let's call it full cluster scan or Full Table scan and if you think it must be very slow and inefficient you are perfectly right it is slow and it is inefficient uh pow has awesome answer what effect Kansas server is down you will see in a moment we answer that on the very next part very soon that is what was a good question sir uh or Madam sorry I don't know okay so that's how data is spread it okay but data spread how it happens we know why for scaling for capability for performance for the greater power but how it's happened it's happening base it on the partition key you remember this part I intentionally skip it something here but now let's take a closer look at it there is a primary key definition and primary key first part of a primary key always will be partition key and this partition key decides how data will be distributed so in this case you see one partition one partition one partition one partition one partition one partition one partition another partition uh notice what each server is capable of handling of a lot of partitions of course so there can be many partitions neighbors to each other and that's perfectly fine if we would arrange data differently like based not on them uh network but for example based on the sensor ID what would happen we would have as many partitions as many sensors we have and they will be distributed totally different if we would partition our data based on temperature we are currently recording that's going to be messy because like the partition key going to change pretty quickly as soon as temperature changes sunrises and that's going to be a totally different story but for our purpose we design it with partitioning based on network and that's why our table name is sensor by Network and then finally a last layer of how it works underneath the hood we have this table on the left side Alabama sensor idf001 with a value 92. how it works how data is being distributed to server a not to server B for example there is a special mechanism called it partitioner partitioner modern partitioner and modern Cassandra in modern data Stacks Enterprise in astrodb Works using murmur free hashing algorithm I really love this name murmur free like some cats murmuring while hashing my data I love it so this partitioner takes whatever value you give to it and converts it into integer value so for example if we give to it Alabama it becomes 59. or if you give it Idaho it becomes 12. Hawaii okay 45 so hashing you might hope you know what the hashing is now interesting point foreign in a data center is responsible for a range of possible tokens so partitioner generates tokens integer values for us 59 12 45 and so on those are like usually huge numbers you usually don't see partition token 59 it's going to be long long long long integer and each server is responsible for a range of tokens for example if we have four servers Data Center each server will be responsible for approximately quarter of your token of all possible tokens so we speak to 1 to 25 26 to 50 51 to 75 and so on in this case with four data centers four token ranges okay so far so good I see David answering a ton of questions thank you for asking and then we can easily realize what if that's Alabama partition Alabama going to be token 59 then token 59 belongs to the server which is responsible for token range which includes 59 51 to 75 includes 59 then we go either so 12 goes to the first server 45 goes to a second server and fourth server stays lazy and empty with no datum for the moment for this six record uh table let's move on why partitioning what is Big Data there are 100 of different definitions of what the big data is and they are huge and clunky and like I don't really like them I'm a simple practical guy I solve problems and getting my money for that uh best big data definition I ever met was developed by me sorry but yeah I believe that's right big data is a data what does not fit to a single server and by splitting it into chunks we spread these big data over multiple amount of servers getting its highly performant so even though when you have billions of records and petabytes of data you still get select statement and get your answer very quickly doesn't matter if you are in Africa or if you are in the United States or in Australia so why does a real power how Works scaling with Cassandra how do we fit more data or how do we process more uh queries imagine we have four nodes Data Center and each node responsible for quarter so 25 percent of all possible tokens and we know what uh Black Friday is coming or for example it's Netflix and we are releasing last episode of Game of Thrones and we are totally sure what everyone will be watching that okay uh so we go and we scale out we add one more server then happens a process called a token range recalculation so cluster recalculates now we have more servers that means each server is responsible for smaller amount of data as a result we assign new token ranges or part of all token ranges to a new server stream data from old owners to a new owner and boom now we have less data per each server less queries per each server and we can process more customer queries or we have more disk space depending on what's our current situation is now imagine uh we don't need it anymore Black Friday is gone or we just dispatched last video of a Game of Thrones and everyone is unhappy everyone is angry no one is watching Netflix anymore what's going to happen we are not going to pay extra for the servers we don't need anymore that means we need to do down scaling and we tell to a cluster we don't need those free don't knows to service anymore now we you are to downscale and to the commission to servers so we can save money on our Cloud costs a Payless for our servers okay so now you know what's going on token range recalculation Cassandra cluster recalculates token ranges and Boots more data on each server streams it back and we can take off to servers after some time so let cluster time to stream data back and biggest and best part of it first all scaling operations are automated so I just tell that's your new server join cluster and all happening automatically or I tell like I'm going to the commission with server so get off the cluster I don't need you anymore so I can kill the server very soon and it's totally fine for a cluster I just need to let the time to stream data back to hours then all scaling operations are live so scaling operations on many databases encure downtime while database does not answer any requests Cassandra keeps those live and requests are being dispatched still and that is really cool and finally yeah it's uh did I say that again yes I did but still I love it it's automated so I can launch per process and go drink coffee go watch a movie and cluster does it for me like I say I'm lazy enough token Rangers definition is totally automated yes you you can have control over it but you better don't really better don't uh cool so time for question number five uh jump to main team so ah oops uh no no no no no no it's early sorry sorry sorry sorry okay yes I made this question to earlier let's speak about the last part before we go to Hands-On part data is partitioned what gives us scaling capability but that's not enough because uh now we can have a lot of data but if something is broken then that means we still will be downtime for at least part of the data how do we address that we do it with replication and first thing you need to understand this replication Factor replication factor means number of servers what will be used to store these partition then you create a key space and key space is basically like a schema in postgres for example each table belongs to schema or each table belongs to key space just group logical group of tables then you create a key space you must Define replication and uh there are plenty of options but one you really must specify is replication all the hour have some reasonable defaults and um replication we must Define replication class and replication Factor the replication factor it's very easy you just specify data centers you need to have this data and how many replicas you are going to have in this data center uh by the way I really like asking questions here uh please tell me in YouTube chat uh how many but if this statement is correct how many data centers I have in my cluster and little hint that is a tricky question but please still give me a number what do you think how many data centers I have in my cluster try like they are should try to guess two five five two two eight eight free two data centers anyone okay yeah that's a tricky question people uh free for us minimum five oh no no I'm a Layla I'm asking not about servers but about data centers data centers on the left so regarding the right part you would be right but I'm asking about data centers but thank you yeah it was close so okay people I'm sorry is there a creator of a data modeling methodology uh um so basically he is one of the best Cassandra experts in the world and uh our companies notice I said if this statement is correct so I support here I expect here okay right answer thank you um right answer is well uh number is definitely going to be somehow n but what n is n if the statement is correct if a statement is right so it's going to be executed that means what I have at least to Data Centers but please notice at least that is important part of the answer because for example I might have dozens of data centers and uh still if I have a dozen of a data centers I might not need these data with sensor data on any other than those two data centers if I don't need my datever I don't specify vendor and no data of this key space no tables belonging to this case space will be deployed on these data centers so people who speaking about three and five that is a count of the servers I'm going to have in my key space for this data so uh that means what I mostly probably I have uh at least uh three servers on United States West one Data Center and at least five servers on Europe is two data center although that's there is no simple answer because there are some Adventures can possible but the right answer is two or more if the statement is correct cool so uh the replication Factor one each server in your data center going to store partition uh only one server will be responsible for partition replication Factor two means what each partition is stored on two servers and replication factor three means what each partition is stored in three nodes and usually we do not recommend to go higher than free in some exceptional situations you might want to have five for example but that happens pretty rarely um now joining those two ideas together replication and partitioning how do those interlocks technically internally yeah notes our servers are the same thing in Cassandra terminology sorry for yeah it's cool so then we have replication Factor one each server will be responsible for its own token range then we have replication Factor two each server is going to be responsible for its own token range plus token range of its neighbor with replication factor three of two neighbors and so on so that's how it works and uh so internally the replication Factor free when data arrives This Server gets this data and it sees what it's not responsible for the token range these data belongs to so for example we know what partition token for partition sorry partition Key Forest becomes 59 for example that means what we will work with those free servers but this request is processed by this server and it's not responsible for this part of this token range it's not responsible for this data so that's totally fine each server in the cluster actually even your driver in your application understands token ranges it's called a token aware because of that this server will dispatch your data to the proper servers because it knows them already so execute those free asynchronous calls deliver data to those servers and then operation is done during this operation This Server is called query coordinator it means what it coordinates operations so rights for example for this query but each server is a query coordinator again if that server will get this update then it becomes query coordinator If This Server would get this query it will become a query coordinator so that's how it works good uh yeah so that was I was just talking about each Cassandra note each Cassandra driver understands data allocation in the cluster it's called a token aware application can conduct literally any server and still get the answer if server is responsible for your data that's cool if server is not responsible it knows who is responsible and it will execute coordination it will get this data for you from its neighbors in normal circumstances dry build will contact replica node to avoid node responsible for your data because driver is token aware so driver will get data properly good uh and uh David it's your time all right so we're going to look at the Hands-On portion and I guess Alex you need to switch over and display yes let me switch to your display give me a second sure and as we get started I'm working through the the lab exercises from a cat excuse me datastacks.academy and you need to look up this course which is under workshops and it's called w001 introduction to nosql with Apache Cassandra I'm going to run through some of those pretty quickly and I you know this is all the introduction if you were looking at this course on on Academy without following us on the video but the first thing we're going to do is create an instance of Astra DB we haven't talked about astrodb much but Astra DB is data Stacks as hosted Cassandra in the cloud and I will tell you those of us who work at datastacks I have access to Cassandra on my desktop I have access to Cassandra in kubernetes Cassandra and Docker uh Cassandra in every possible form but if you asked me to very quickly kick something out or test something in Cassandra I go to Astra it's real simple and I use the same free account that you do data Stacks doesn't have my credit card and I get a pretty good chunk of usage free each month and you don't have to you do have to register but there's no credit card involved so from the academy I'm going to click on this link create Astra DB and also this link is just paste it into the YouTube chat yeah and now I'm going to sign in I already have an account so I'm going to sign in with my data Stacks Google account and that will bring me to Astra and if you look I'm concerned about databases there are no databases currently so if I click there are no databases so I'm going to create a serverless Astra database and the parameters for creating that database are here in Academy the database is going to be called workshops it's going to the key space we're going to create in a key space is a grouping of tables and a few other things that's called sensor underscore data and we're going to create it in the glue in the Google Cloud so Workshop sensor underscore data Google cloud and here are the regions that are available to me the ones that aren't shown as locked and I'm actually based in Iowa so I'm going to choose Council Bluffs Iowa and just a little notice if you was the fast on one of our previous workshops uh then basically you might have this database or workshops already and that's perfectly fine uh so you will just have to create a new key space right or you may have to resume the workspace in case it's it's gone to sleep you'll notice now the work the workshop database is pending it takes a minute or two to create while we're doing that let's take a look here is the connect tab that shows you a number of ways to connect to your database to start with you can generate a token that gives you the credentials and the information necessary to connect you can get a secure connect bundle which also includes the the TLs artifacts you need to connect from an app from an application you can install the Astra CLI which includes our cql shell to run as to run commands on your desktop we're going to run them in this web interface and you can look through other ways to access it there are various apis I mentioned Stargate Stargate is a facade that sits in front of Astra DB or Cassandra you can run it locally and lets you use a document API to use Json style access a graphql API to and we talked a little bit about graphql as well as a rest API so if you have an existing application using one of these other apis you can certainly use it with minimal change to access Cassandra and more about you know lots of examples and ways to connect with with the different apis here workshops still excuse me the workshop database is still starting up some of the other tabs here is a health tab once the database is active you'll see a number of graphical displays having to do with database health and database performance so it does give you some monitoring the cql console will be spending time there so I'm not going to focus on that but that will allow us to execute cql commands and I don't know if we've said but cql is stands for Cassandra query language and it's very similar to SQL unfortunately it sounds a lot like SQL so you may hear me slip and say SQL but I really mean Cassandra query language in this context and it's the way you interact and run commands against the database CDC part of Astra DB or excuse me Astra in addition to the database is we have a hosted uh pulsar service so we can do change data capture and streaming a lot of other cool things so our Workshop database is active and now you can see um here are some statistics we haven't done anything with it so there are no latencies and requests and all of that but it gives you an idea of some of the things that are available all right so let's go to the cql console it's going to connect and what we're going to do is we're going to explore the key spaces so we're going to go in and describe the key spaces that are already there now you'll see we use the describe command there is code completion here so I said K and press Tab and this shows the key spaces that have been created notice that we created the sensor data key space but there are a number of other key spaces that are also prefixed with system or data or data Stacks those were there automatically or automatically so those are the system key spaces and our sensitive sensor data key space next thing with a key space you need to use that key space just like you would use a schema in a relational database so I'm just going to copy the use command and use the key space all right that's that's exercise one pretty simple connecting to uh Astra DB creating a database in key space and using the key space it's all spelled out on datastacks.academy so Alex I'm going to hand it back to you give me a second sure and it was a question about uh about certificates coupons for the exams and yes you can receive a coupon for this exam but would strongly encourage you to take um we have two certifications an administrator certification and a developer certification and at data Stacks Academy the administrator certification the prerequisites are ds201 which is a much expanded version of this content Plus ds210 or admin specific content once you've completed those two classes or for the developer ds201 again and ds220 which is the in-depth data modeling once you've completed either of those two sequences you are eligible to receive a voucher good for two attempts at one exam or if you do a great job and I know you will and past exam the first attempt you can use that same voucher for the second exam but you would be advised to take the courses at Academy first for to be really prepared to take the to take the exam I see some people of experience here that's great uh cool so I'm switching back to my screen and I'm going to ask you a question so get back to your main team uh and my question is going to be what is the biggest problem of replication and that's going to be this question this time what is the biggest problem of replicated data increase the disk space consumption more Network transactions because data is spreaded across multiple servers or a potential cross node inconsistency again as all of my questions this one is tricky yes and sure we can post yeah wow people you are doing great actually normally most of my students not doing so well here so we really got some people of experience that is great so notice the part biggest problem replicated data indeed leads to increased disk space consumption but you know what disk space is cheap reputation is priceless okay uh I like most of the co-op companies using Cassandra so big companies normally can afford buying more disks but cannot afford downtime so that's exactly like Cassandra use case more Network transactions yes it is a problem but again um currently even sdns even software defined networks are still very fast so it's kinda again a problem you can leave that but potential cross node and consistency is a really really big deal so let me show you something yes yes what is potential cross node inconsistency when they are changing a value and data is replicated one of the nodes storing this data one of the replicas might not get the update that leads to the situation then OneNote stores outdated stale data and others store new data that is not about Cassandra that's exactly the same about every distributed system more than single host system you introduce caching you can run into inconsistency problem easily you introduce distributed caching you are going to run into this problem one day or an hour so like I can tell that's like quite a big deal for every kind of a distributed system and of course as Cassandra is used in Banks it's used in like I don't know Health institutions many different companies uh that is a very very uh serious thing yeah and that's interesting point David Cassandra currently uses boxes but there are some huge upgrades are coming and paxus is going to be replaced uh first paxis version one is going to be replaced with pax's version 2 which is happening right now and then later thanks to Apple and thanks to University of [Music] um it's going to be replaced that with protocol Accord which is a very interesting thing okay ah good question by I mean how does one not not getting right operation happen oh easily thousands of questions thousands of options Network outage so Network link is broken uh node being in reboot or on maintenance or anything like uh basically whatever can happen and single update will not reach the node response replicant it's totally happening you see when you have thousands of servers and millions of operations per second it's just a question of time something bad will happen good so ask these potential inconsistency is a huge problem like the big biggest problem of replication uh we uh going uh to address this problem very very very seriously Cassandra has layered defense to be able to protect itself from these kind of issues and first layer of defense is going to be so-called hinted handoffs what is hinted handoff imagine the example we discussed already a query coordinator dispatches updates to our servers and sees what two servers returning confirmation acknowledgment I got your data everything is great we are good it works and then one of the servers does not respond we don't know what happens we don't know what went wrong maybe power outage maybe Network outage maybe server is too busy I don't know maybe some aliens stolen This Server everything can happen especially if you host your data center in New York like you watch a movie something bad's happening in New York all the time and uh then query coordinator stores so-called hint hint is a persistent piece of data it's stored on disk it will survive reboot in Cassandra cluster servers are gossiping they are communicating with each other all the time and then the server sees what its neighbor recover it so there is a gossip what server uh what was outed now return it server number seven let's say then a query coordinator will dispatch this hint uh to them is it's a server what makes it the update and that works totally completely absolutely automatically automatically I better I better say automatically that means what I do not participate in this situation and still consistency is recovered it might happen deep at night and as an operations guy I won't even get a phone call or page or Duty whatever invocation come and fix our system system fixes itself and that is totally lovely good but you know what that is not enough because in some cases still hint and something might happen with query coordinator with hints something else might happen so actually as a delay it defends we are going to have multiple layers more than this first one hintendo is a Cassandra job you don't have to worry about it then repairs is an administrator job and this Workshop is for developers so we won't speak about repairs too much right now there is a repair on read which is again Cassandra job so you don't have to worry about that Elite a bit like that's totally automated too but think you really need to understand is consistency level and that is a developer job so that's means you are going to learn it so we go to CP theorem one of my favorite parts and one of the most misunderstood parts now if you are tired I don't know maybe it's a deep night at your place please focus and refresh this part is very very important so wake up we are working stay strong we are getting close to the end cep theorem operates free features availability consistency and partition tolerance what does that all means availability basically means uptime you ask me a question you get the answer if outage leads uh to no response to you so downtime your system is not available if outage still uh keep if even in case of outage of a single server or a group of servers your system still returns your response your system is highly available and that's the easiest like everyone understands that now consistency consistency in the terminology of cep theorem means no stale data you ask for something you get the most recent value punked done like if you get some stale data previously valid but uh wrong now your system is inconsistent and then finally partition tolerance partition tolerance is the most misunderstood uh idea partition tolerance is the ability of a distributed system to survive Network partitioning and most of the people on the internet don't get it most of the people internet of the internet thinks what partitioning is then group of your servers is not available at all completely they are wiped out let me show you something what is Network partition imagine I have six servers data center one two three four five six and there is a network partitioning in between of them so my cluster kaida splitted in a group a and in a group b but all of those groups are available for the clients so one client application one in instance one can conduct This Server and application instance 2 on another server can conduct these server that but in between they cannot communicate This Server cannot reach that server that is a network partitioning in the cep theorem and in the database Theory situation so group a cannot communicate with Group B Group B cannot communicate with group a but they both are available to your customers really so many people don't understand this point if Group B is completely isolated and unavailable not available for anyone is that partitioning no it's downtime for this group it's a simple plain down time doesn't matter if there is a power missing or network missing they still cannot be accessed they will be outdated but they will not get conflicting updates so real Network partitioning is groups are isolated but available to customers all groups so partition tolerance is the ability of a system to survive Network partitioning with relational databases it can lead to a problem called split brain and split brain is a damn disaster imagine I have uh some disaster disaster recovery scenarios and imagine that is my master server or my leader server in this data center and uh this group is isolated like that what happened with group a master or leader follower follower folder well everything is fine this group is operational it's going to handle some more workloads because like we lost some follower servers but still it will be operational what's happened on this side those two servers two followers cannot reach leader server anymore if they just stop processing any queries it's bad but that's not a real problem real problem if I have some recovery plan automated recovery plan uh in action like failover failover mechanisms are enabled not switch over vicious manual but failover which is automated and for example two of those decide what this server is going to be new master and it becomes a new master as a result of an election and our liberal server sorry and it gets all the updates now two so part of the updates May get to this one part of the insert or updates can get to this one and they will be conflicting because they may lead to different places they store it on a different servers so when finally Network partitioning the type disappears you have a leader follower architecture database with two leaders good luck handling this situation because like there is no automated day to handle that you will literally spend weeks and months reading the logs and trying to recognize what the hell happened here and was these uh goods sold and delivered to a customer with customer or vet Customer because the data was isolated one from another split brain is a huge problem if there is a master node correct yep uh as Cassandra is masterless uh then that's that's might be different scenarios so it doesn't mean what you cannot run in the problems with Cassandra you can that's for sure I see David is smiling yes but definitely there cannot please be split brain problem because Cassandra handles the situation totally different and there are no master servers and with some of the side conversations about a consistency level and replication Factor by correctly configuring those you can choose which problems you are willing to accept and which problems you know under which case you're going to say nope I will not operate under this condition uh sorry sorry be explaining it just on the next slide yeah yep so don't rush it comes it comes it comes yeah good question by the way we've asked that uh uh well with Daniel okay thank you sir that's a good question good so let's go now finally we discussed uh terms definitions of that theorem now what the theorem States idea is in the distributed environment we don't speak about single host database we speak about multiple host database in case of emergency in case of an outage in case of something goes wrong you can have only two guaranteed qualities out of three so basically the story is you in case when everything is green servers are running network is running customers are happy you somehow have both consistency availability and partition tolerance but then happens and that's just a question of time as all we know you have to decide where are you going to be partition and tolerance is something a partition tolerance is something we cannot sacrifice that's why people speaking about databases most commonly speak about so-called CP databases so database is consistent and partition tolerance paying the price of the availability they are sacrificing availability to become consistent and partition tolerant while other databases choose to be available and partition tolerance here partition tolerant buy the price of eventual consistency let me explain that a little bit better if your database is available and partition tolerant but eventually consistent that means whatever theoretically you can get stale data but you always get data and now don't rush with your own ideas but let me finish please first that's very important to like miss one very important point some other databases choose to be consistent and partition tolerant they reside here and that comes with a price of availability like you always get a consistent answer but you get no answer at all if in case of an outage system tells you I cannot uh do that some of my servers are down you are not getting maybe those servers store the most up-to-date value I cannot check right now you get no answer at all now there is a very common misunderstanding is Cassandra AP or CP and most of the people familiar with Cassandra say of course Cassandra is AP that's what we have been told for years and that is wrong that is wrong and now many people hate me for that but that is wrong because right answer is Cassandra is tunably consistent or configurably consistent by pushing some buttons by changing some configurations you can travel in between and set up different approach CP or AP for different pieces of data you store in any moment of a time for each particular query you can set desired consistency level you're required to have and that will lead database behavior for this particular query so if you get the very same query like in this example we work with insert into insert in the product some values you can set consistency level for this particular statement for example in this case I set consistency level 1 I will explain it in a moment and then execute this query again setting different consistency level and execute these query again setting different consistency level and those queries will be executed and treated differently okay now what is that consistency level consistency level as we work with replicated data means how many acknowledgments we will wait how many confirmations we need to get before we consider it insert or update operation as complete completed successfully or read operation What We Gather it enough data to return consistent answer based on the current requirements each each [Music] you see the story each piece of data you store uh it might be uh of a higher importance or lesser importance uh thing like for example uh you're the same very same application uh you can work with your money and can work with your profile picture I don't know like uh Chinese WeChat you have money there messages um profile pictures everything do you really care if you just change it to your profile Peak but some people will still get your previous profile pic is it a disaster no I think you can survive that but do you want your financial financial data to be consistent yes hell of course you are so uh of course you do so that's the story so changing consistency level of different for different queries working with different data we jump in between different options of a cep theorem for example with consistency level one we will wait only for one confirmation out of three replicas take a look we have replication factor three so we have three replicas but we have consistency level one that means when client executes query query coordinator will execute free rights one two three to all the replicas but as soon as the fastest server answers greater coordinator will immediately return confirmation to a customer hey man I got your data perfect is watch that it's the fastest way because as soon as we get first reply obviously the fastest reply we don't wait for anything we immediately tell to a client what um we are good but you know what might happen those two guys might be down and client will never know what his update didn't reach those servers so one is the fastest actually only one consistency level is faster which is any so any then one when we go to more advanced scenarios must use it a consistency level is quorum quorum means majority majority means for replication factor three it's going to be at least two servers easy as that if we have for example replication Factor 5 when majority will be free a replication Factor free with consistency level worm is the most efficient uh fast and meanwhile economically reasonable way so this way having consistency level Quorum we can afford losing this node store our data to two more nodes and uh be fine even then this server is down we still can read data and get data and that is totally fine and then finally with consistency level all we will require all acknowledgments for all replicas and there is a very interesting issue think about that now my data seems to be fully consistent and I want my data to be consistent all right I bet you too so you see write my data with consistency level all always is that a good idea doesn't look so great why because of a very very teeny tiny problem CP theorem is still there watching you always watching eurozovski always so then one of the notes is very slow or one of the notes is down completely desired count of acknowledgments cannot be reached and that means well first we wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait and then beginning an exception cannot reach desired consistency level uh sorry come again later what's just happened we move it ourselves with consistency level all from AP to CP so now we are consistent and partition tolerant exactly as you desired but by the price of availability [Laughter] I always help you like that's my favorite slide here David you know good yes uh so that's exactly uh Helen asks a very good question what if they have replication Factor even and consistency level Quorum it still goes the same way so majority so half plus one exactly that's why we recommend not to go with uh and we've even count of a service because it's actually um economically not reasonable best way is to have uneven uh count of servers three five usually recommended values yeah so uh it will just require more servers to build Quorum so it will be more expensive for you uh but will not give you any real benefit so that's why we go for uh uneven numbers so it will work but it will be more expensive for no reason at least I cannot imagine anything more reasonable here good uh okay so finally most of you now must be asking then if I still want to be fast and meanwhile I want my data to be like really consistent what will be the easiest way for me to reach that answer is immediate consistency what is immediate consistency a concept is a purely mathematical if you write with consistency level uh plus sorry if your consistency level on right plus your consistency level on read higher than replication factor that means you have immediate consistency so for example imagine I have these six servers Data Center and replication factor is free and I'm writing with consistency level Quorum and I'm reading with consistency level Quorum that's going to be consistency level Quorum or three is two so it's going to be 2 plus 2 equal 4 4 higher bigger than free and that means I have immediate consistency it will be the same if I write for example with consistency level all and read with one three plus one uh bigger than three or if I write with consistency level one and read with consistency level all one plus three equals four four bigger than three immediate consistency but obviously anytime you see consistency level all it means you are sacrificing uh your capability to survive any kind of outage and that's obviously bad now let me explain that yep sure can I jump in on that what you're sacrificing is your ability to write but in return you do get something if you use one and all yeah consistency one you get very high performance and highly available reads yes the solar performance lower availability rights so you need to decide what fits your use case yeah it's use case dependent uh so for example you uh you really have huge pressure on reads like really millions of queries per seconds on reads this way you really have to think about a consistency level one for read and taking care of Rights properly uh that's a little bit different story but yes there are some like you see we are speaking about a real rocket science and there are some things to consider yeah like things to consider for example to get certified as Apache Cassandra developer what can totally help you boost your salary but that's out of scope for today's Workshop uh so yes take a look you've read data on consistency level Quorum that means what you always know what your data was stored on at least two servers otherwise you would get an exception and then you read data on consistency level Quorum it means what a query coordinator on read will compare two pieces of data or digests of those two pieces of data see if they are matching their data is valid and we return these data to client immediately if uh uh it may if we Imagine This Server was not updated and if we read data from this server as its query coordinator and replica simultaneously which happens very often most of the time and This Server responds often faster but it stores outdated information not like this one then query coordinator notices what data digest is going to be different and in this case it will do two things first it will obviously get information from this one a returned answer to a client it will be a little bit slower because of those procedures but still you get a consistent data which is mostly more important but also it will initiate repair for this partition for This Server so it will recover from its inconsistent State and it will never happen again so when your consistence level uh right on consistency level read higher or together higher than replication Factor you have immediate consistency and you are good and you are consistent and that is as close as you can get to the magic middle of these cap Labyrinth so what are a kind of a consistency levels we have uh one two three nothing to explain we just explicitly specifying how many confirmations we need to have then Quorum means uh well Quorum majority or means all there are two more cases to consider local one local Quorum and each Quorum what does that mean local is a very simple idea local means what I tell to my application to work only then expect confirmations only from the closest data center imagine your clients are in the United States and your application runs uh in the United States and your data center you have data center and database instance uh data center of a cluster in the United States you want American customers working for American application and American application work with American data center for the database not with Australia not with Europe not with India yeah but if American by saying local Quorum it means I need Quorum office servers from the closest data center not uh from the remote one but from the local data center this concept must be simple very simple so you don't wait for the confirmation of a servers uh what are being remote to view to those application instance so usually for a multi-data center deployments we go with local quorum and each Quorum is the most aggressive uh consistency level except all uh so each Quorum says I need you to reach Quorum and each and every data center I have this way you guarantee what information will be spreaded immediately all around the world but obviously if one of the data centers is down you're going to wait wait wait wait wait wait when and then get an exception because this Square risk where consistency level was not reached cool let's move on uh two questions and I believe those are last questions from my side uh nope not lost okay and first question is going to be CP theorem says what on failure C A and P are guaranteed if C fails so do A and P only CA or CP can be guaranteed let's see people are like answering but slowly yes that's an intensive Workshop you are learning many new things today so you will have to think about that then for days yes perfect um CP theorem says what on failure only CA or CP can be guaranteed but or is the key word here you cannot have all of that and that's not our fault blame Eric Brewer for this discovery okay good okay then uh next question tell me please recommended consistency level for immediate consistency read write one one read write 100 read write quorum quorum okay this time it gets faster we just discussed it so make sense okay what's going to be yes so that's a tricky question a second answer one all is technically correct with one all you will reach mediate consistency but it's not recommended with one one you are not reaching immediate consistency at all you are just guaranteed to run in a problem uh sooner or later so recommended consistency level for immediate consistency is read write urum kurum good and we are almost done with this part I don't remember okay well you know what uh I will switch to you David okay very good thank you Alex and I do want to apologize to everybody attending as you can tell Alex and I get really excited about this material and you've been asking great great questions we've been trying to take the time to answer them so you can see we're kind of pressing our time here but if you'll hang on with us we'll we've still got some more Hands-On stuff and a little more to do yet yes exactly next thing we're going to do is create some table then in this application we have sensors of different types on different networks I believe there's a volcano sensor and an ocean sensor and here we're having two tables sensors by Network and set and temperatures by sensor and notice it says bad so there's a problem with that one but let's create them I'm going to copy the cql and simply paste it into cqlsh and didn't work so I have to select a key space foreign so use sensor data through my key space now I'm going to paste my create statements back in and to create statements returned appropriately but if you look at that create statement this one this table table by sensor is bad this gets to a problem that one of you asked before and that problem was what if your partitions are unbalanced or what if you have an issue with Partition size what this is going to do is partition based on sensors so I have if I have a sensor by Kilauea volcano in Hawaii and another one by a volcano somewhere in Iceland if the one set if One sensor is reading you know every five seconds and one every five days one I will have an imbalance of partition size the other is as long as these centers are running more and more data is getting read into the Iceland partition or the Kilauea partition and they're growing unbounded so you have a problem there in that the partition size will just continue to grow until it exceeds the size available to store on a single node and one of the guarantees of partitions is that all data in a partition is co-resident stored on the same node so this that's why this particular data model is bad it has to do with the partition sizing so the solution is that we're going to create buckets instead of storing all the data all the sensor data which may be very high rate acquisition we're going to store data in in buckets by date so all the data from January 1st will be one partition all the data excuse me for Kilauea from January 1st and all the data from Kilauea for January 2nd so the partition key which is the inner parenthesis is the primary key will now be made up of two Fields one identifies the sensor as before the other the date to X is the bucket so what we're going to do is drop the old table we haven't put any data in it so we're just going to drop the table and take a second or two for that to respond and then we're going to create the new table grouped by sensor and date so each partition is a date or excuse me a bucket for a specific date and then we can describe the tables just to see what we've done and now we have those two tables centers by Network and temperature uh temperatures by set by sensors and did we create the networks table I'm not sure so I'm going to create the networks table just because we'll need it later and that was a creative not exists so that that succeeded as I said I'm following along with the instructions on datastacks Academy or GitHub you have both links and you can follow along I'm I'm going through it kind of quickly but you can do this on your own afterwards I'm going to turn it back over to Alex I hope give me a second oh moment I will let you know when do we switch and Daniel you asked about the certificate yes remember you will get a badge after completing the the course in academy or GitHub and there's a quiz at the end and you'll get a badge after that as far as the certificates as I said we'd recommend that you follow the admin or developer path at datastex Academy and that would be two courses or fundamentals course and our admin course are fundamentals and data modeling and then you can send an email to Academy at datastex.com and you'll see all that in academy and you'll receive a voucher to take the certification exams so coupon for finishing uh this and the quiz and voucher for exams after finishing the two Academy courses and I'll turn it back to Alex I already switched the screen thank you so yes um uh that's we are getting actually to the last part uh and thank you for staying with us you spend your time wisely so final part and that is a very very introduction into Data modeling data modeling is a huge thing and it's extremely important thing you really need to learn data modeling if you would like to be successful with Cassandra actually it goes to this to very database to all the databases when you speak about uh that's a fun fact last year I was at conference at Frankfurt and uh quite surprisingly uh I have to say whatever they were approach to data modeling is nearly exactly the same as ours with Cassandra it's really so close maybe uh our Tom chavatko will say more about that because I know he did research about this topic maybe like you would tell us a couple of your ideas based on that in the chat if possible but yeah the general idea it's a very common thing for many of the different nosql databases so let's go data modeling is about modeling our data in the right way and uh what do we manage we manage rows column Stables all these kind of things yeah he is basically he's yeah I would say more than wizard actually but yeah let's go so a very very uh tiny part of it is the intersection of row and column uh call it a cell that shouldn't be a big surprise to you then group of cells uh is a single structural data item and a table called troll then new thing group of rows stored together is a partition because we share same partition token and then finally Table stores partitions and partitions have rows and never forget about that you should never forget about partitions because partitions they never forget about you so keep it fair good and data is organized in distributed tables so uh what we discussed that already let's move on then you create a table you have to model your data and very important thing is to choosing the most important thing might be to choosing the proper partition key because partition key will decide how data is partitioned okay and for example here you see on the temperatures by sensor we partition our data based on sensor and date because they all are becoming partition key uh so the temperature was stored at some date and now we have sensor what store it sensor ID and date will be combined and combined together before making the hash with this more more free algorithm based on that and as a result all the records for this sensor for this date will be stored in the single partition which will be reasonable for most of the scenarios if you adjust your sensor it might become too big over time because every sensor records more and more and more partitions and if you uh do something like sensor and timestamp then you will have each and it will when you will have as many partitions as many records you have which is technically fine so you can do that it will work on a right time but thinking how do you work with Cassandra working with data in Cassandra you always have to remember right time read time write time read time can I write temperature sensor uh like that using sensor and timestamp don't forget on each operation I need to know partition key all the parts of a partition key so when I write it do I know it I know sensor ID because it just reported its temperature and I know it timestamp because I know perfectly when it happened so can I store this data yes but then read time comes and you're going to read this data do you know sensor ID let's imagine yes your customer just told you I need to see temperatures for the sensor number XYZ ID XYZ so that's good to mean but to retrieve data from the table design it like that sensor and timestamp to do it properly you will have to know all the timestamps of all the records you store it and imagine you storing your temperature sensor state every second which happens on factories for example all the time that's not going to be easy to retrieve this kind of data right uh then second part of a primary key are the clustering columns clustering columns Define a sorting order and they Define how data physically store it on disk so for example if we store our temperatures by sensor data partitioning by sensor and date to make smaller partition and then we use clustering column timestamp as a clustering column for sorting so it will be sorted by when this recording was done it makes totally a lot of sense so you can order data and retrieve some pieces by date sort by timestamp so that makes a lot of sense that works perfectly that is a very good example on how to do this kind of things if you do your key primary key with no clustering columns at all then what happens as primary key defines uniqueness you will have in this case only one record per sensor for example if you do record like that sensor and type stamp as a clustering column it will work but all the records of the same sensor will always go to the same partition and partition will become too big in the end so you are getting the idea now primary key is something what uniquely identifies a row it consists of a partition key required and clustering column optional now why I'm talking so much about that why data modeling in Cassandra is so deadly I'm not afraid of his word why data modeling is so deadly important take a look partition Keys now attention please Partition Keys Define data distribution over the cluster got it right we will get back to that in a moment and clustering columns Define how data is physically written on disk now answer a question maybe not on the YouTube chat but to yourself speaking of Cassandra typical deployments dozens to hundreds to thousands of servers multiple petabytes of data up to petabytes of data multiple data centers building constructing a cluster around the world planet can we change partition key can we do alter table set new Partition key what will happen if we do that that will create new tokens for all the data you have new tokens mostly probably will belong to different token ranges not where data was before so basically all your petabytes of data in your clusters hack cluster have to be shuffled put to another server because now this server is responsible for this partition that will take weeks maybe months to happen and first that is not possible at all you can once created partition key cannot be changed but the same with a clustering column as it defines how data is physically written on disk and we speak about petabytes once you change clustering column it will require data to be Rewritten across all the cluster it will again take weeks and months so guess what it's not possible once created data model can not be changed you will need new tables and you will need to migrate your data and if your data model was wrong then you will have to do a lot of additional work so stay lazy do it right from the first how to do it right learn at the Academy learn at datastags.academy it's a free course on open source Apache Cassandra alter table still present so you can add some fields for example so-called data columns but you can not do anything with a primary key that's it it's immutable and finally just three rules to know before we let you go rules of a good partition store together what you retrieve together if you are going to read this data together then obviously you need to store it together so your select query will reach one server not uh you will need you will not need to do a dozen of queries trying to gather it all together think about partitioning right time read time write time read time then avoid big partitions uh designing our partitions based on a customer party for our users our customers based on the country they leave that's a very bad idea some countries are huge there are so many people I don't know like India China well you know what I mean like uh hundreds Millions but meanwhile there are tiny countries like San Marino where maybe I don't know I don't know how many people live where let's say 50 000 that means what some partition will be disastrously huge and some partitions will be tiny then your cluster will try to balance but as balancing is partition based it will not really work uh so you really need to try to create even partitions so each partition will be more or less similar to all the others and uh we very often at this part exactly as David said we need bucketing so we create a partition key not based on just some real value but also using some scientific value oh uh graze Christian um but adding some special value interpretation uh key so it will be used uh when creating a partition token and it will change so here we add uh to our sensors also month year or date or week of the year or just year if you don't have too many records and then these bucketed value changes over the next month and again next month every time you partition will be created and that is a very good technique and then finally avoid hot partitions uh in real life when we say hot then that usually we mean something good right something we would like to have hot car I don't know whatever but in Cassandra the hot partition is something you definitely don't want to have imagine we have a data center with 100 servers and we store these temperature by sensor information and we decide to partition it on date and we have replication Factor free if partition is decided on date that means what all sensors writing data today will write it to free servers out of our 100. and those three servers will be overloaded because our billion of sensors right to only free servers so workload is not spread at over 100 of servers but only what it all goes to each one of those three then date change tomorrow comes then that's the next partition because it's a new date new date great so again three different servers responsible for all the pressure on them and now you can say like we are rich company we can afford uh buying one more hundred servers and you go do that will it help no it won't because it's still the same data center still the same data model still the same partitioning replication Factor free and now free out of your 200 servers will be busy and average 197 will be idling because we have nothing to do today where we will be busy tomorrow but not today right so this idea on the partitioning by date exactly shows how you destroy perfect Cassandra scalability and that's what I mean and I say when someone says Cassandra is slow you just tell him is your data model is wrong seriously man you should get data modeling course at data Stacks Academy we are working hard by the way to revamp it and make it even more user friendly although it's pretty good cool uh last questions number eight and all correct answers give maximum points select operation retypation if you vowed partition key is a syntax error it's okay to get all data it's very bad or it's illegal and punishable by loan you know I work in nosql Palace so if you do select without partition keys I will come for you so if you ask me if you ask me right answer is the fourth one it should be illegal in pineapple or punishable by law but right answer select about partition key is very bad because it leads to full cluster scan no it's not a cat okay to get all your data only if you have one two three servers and even then it's not okay it technically does not lead to a syntax error if you don't specify any verse statement just expect some stupid results uh yeah cool uh David you want to add something yeah no I I fully agree with this uh it is however the only way to get all your data so if you must but to be still a bad practice and I agree Alex should be the no sequel police yeah but boys but boys what you're gonna do okay next question and that's going to be your last question and we will see the leaderboard we will know who was the fastest or who was not the fastest but most correct 18 players ready so let's go last question ladies and gentlemen what is the most important rule of the partitioning data or most commonly offended rule try to have as many partitions as possible keep partition size under control keep together what you retrieve together make partitions bigger [Laughter] okay okay okay okay okay okay so yeah I I decided to hide that a little bit keep together what you retrieve together is a very important rule of partitioned data so those give answer keep together what you live together are technically correct but if you think about that that's a trap if you keep together what you retrieve together that is really cool and your application will kind of work good for reads but first it can work totally wrong for totally bad for rights rights and second it still can grow over time the way you cannot fix it anymore and now you're going to spend months and months uh trying to decompress your data split it into multiple tables and so on and so forth as long as you keep partition size under control you might have uh so uh avoid big partitions it's hidden rule avoid big partitions yeah and Alex I'm going to disagree with you a little bit and say that these are both crucially important and it's maybe a little too subtle of a difference here as to which one is more important you see him if my data storage away so it's not convenient to read it puts more pressure on me as a developer right so I will have to do more work I will do some maybe application Level uh joins kinda fake joints uh or but if I don't keep partition size under control I might once like our field Engineers told me they found the customer with a partition size of 15 terabytes or something like that and that's not going to work well and like the whole performance of a database all for customers all of the queries will be affected so there is a subject to discussion I would like to have with you with some beer in uh some bar in some bar in Iowa which I hope to reach maybe next year or might be you be my guest I will be totally excited about that uh but yeah you know we have some beer in Germany maybe you've heard about it that's what you do right but the general idea is from my point of view and from my experience keeping partition size under control but okay that's debatable that's something uh I uh will agree so regarding can I come take a look we are working on the series on the Cassandra Day events over the planet uh so subscribe to our Channel And subscribe on the academy there are some events to be announced I will be totally happy to have a public discussion and share some beers and uh like share your experience and that's totally great always to talk about these things and Knight bought a friendly just pasted our LinkedIn links for today so that's not just a
