I see you are good and hey everybody no just a second so if you see us if you hear us please set the thumbs up in the YouTube chat if there are any problems with video or audio also let me know meanwhile I want to switch to different microphone so you will hear me better now yeah yeah that should be good how it goes for us good evening good evening everyone good evening for you if it's an evening for you uh or maybe it's a morning for you like for artem it's an it's morning for you right or around midday it's 10 a.m 10 in the morning good for 10 a.m that's pretty early I still cannot stop wonder I totally understand the concept Earth Sun so it totally makes sense what is getting to evening in my part of the world and it's still morning at your part of the world but these concepts are still surprises me cool yeah uh this meeting recording is to be is going to be available to you the same link everything is good and actually let's start because we have a lot of things to cover today so we really have to keep going first things first it's going to be introduction to nosql Viva Patrick Cassandra and that is a very great topic because there are a lot of powerful and great databases in node SQL world but one of the most interesting from performance and scalability point of view is definitely Apache Cassandra so we will speak about what is it how it works and how do you build efficient application with no SQL databases uh I am a developer Advocate lead to data stocks name is Alex volition and uh I really love my job because it helps me to work with you on getting developer worlds better because many people using different databases they follow this Hammer problem if you have a hammer every think looks like a nails to you so and if you learn teach if you know only how to use a relational database then you will go and try to solve all the problems with relational database now my job to give you right tools for the job you are doing and for some cases it will be relational databases but for some other nosql databases will be much better fit so and today we are with our temperature could you please introduce yourself hi everyone yeah I've been working with Cassandra science 2014 and I've been working with many other databases pretty much tried all kinds of no SQL relational data warehousing databases so um I have a lot of uh perspective on the on this topic and I love Cassandra I love Astra DB and Astro semen pulsar and happy to be here talk to you about them what great so and by the way uh secret is what today we will talk a little bit about data modeling methodology for nosql databases for Apache Cassandra and artium is a inventor developer of this methodology so you are learning from the very very first first hand uh and uh nightbot says whatever for Houston is spread to good sunny and temperature is pretty nice so good for you or Tom however in my place is not as shiny I would say okay but actually there are much more people worked on this workshop and some of them today are in the chat so please it's a live event exactly for you to be able to ask questions so please ask questions if you are not so lucky and you watch a recording then still please ask questions in our Discord server uh speaking of the workshop and Discord few places you need to know to get maximum out of this Workshop first of all that is obviously a YouTube stream you are watching right now that's youtube.com data starts devs then if YouTube works not so well for you we have a backup stream on Twitch but on Twitch we don't watch and don't answer uh comments so you better ask your questions on the YouTube chat uh YouTube chat or even better join us at our Discord server where we can communicate even then Workshop is done so that is a better way to communicate with us and to ask you some questions in the beginning and then to play a game with the prizes from data Stacks we will use mentee.com uh but I will explain that in a moment when we switch uh to Ram uh questions so you will see it in practice uh now for the Hands-On part of the workshop you will need a GitHub I hope most of you already have some uh and you don't have to install anything because we work with gitbot and gitbot is a cloud IDE with Linux box attached so you can run all the commands build your application uh connect it to the database use it work it develop it without installing anything on your laptop and as the commands executed remotely on a remote server you don't even need a very powerful laptop to run pretty pretty big containers pretty big commands and as we speak about databases today we will use data Stacks after DB astrodb is basically a Cassandra as a service in a cloud so uh to avoid installation and all the maintenance burden we go with Astron but the all the commands we're executing is exactly the same if you would go with your own locally installed Cassandra that also will work that's good for us as well um important point if you want to make your LinkedIn profile uh more signing then you can get a page from us how do you get the attendance page story is very simple you uh just first of all attend this Workshop right you do the Hands-On lab and in the end you submit your homework using the link what is specified on our GitHub repository or I believe some of our colleagues we will paste this link in the chat later and then after some time please give us the time to review your submission we will dispatch an intro to Cassandra Workshop page for you to block on LinkedIn Facebook or whatever you prefer now mentee we will need Mandy two times during the workshop first time now uh further questions and second time later for the quiz with prizes so please don't close it keep it open in another that easiest way to go to mentee is basically use your own mobile phone and open many on your mobile phone if you are watching us on a laptop or whatever computer you use or maybe TV screen I don't know so let's uh wait a moment let me switch for a second I will switch to Roper screen right now it's better and we can finally start so meant is behaving today sorry yes good mentally works so how do you join mentium very simple you all go to manatee.com and enter the code you see on the screen four six four eight three one zero one oh code is hidden a little bit behind Arjun but I see a racks pasted it in the YouTube chat already thank you man teamwork or just scan back QR code above meme foreign first thing I want to ask where are you from we have very distributed team a data Stacks here so our tomb is in Houston I'm in that's Germany and we have people in France we have people in Asia we have people in Italy in South America basically everywhere so I see some people joining from India and that's great we always had a lot of friends uh from India and United States United States United States okay free United States and uh East and free India that was an interesting balance finally someone from France I think it's Cedric but maybe it's some of our attendees let's go have you been to any of our workshops before hey ciao is a common style um no most of you are newcomers so great we run workshops nearly every week so subscribe to our workshops at datastags.com workshops maybe some of our colleagues will paste the link in the chat please and for those who was at our workshops before welcome friends it's always good to see you again do you remember what will be the next week topic I don't remember what do we speak about next week uh let me check quickly thank you and now finally before we go to the slides what's your experience with relational databases so do you use it a lot or maybe your student with not so much experience it's all fine hey so distribution is quite interesting uh okay uh I mean like it's even it's totally even okay some people don't have experience with relational databases I believe mostly students so take a look this Workshop we are going to speak about uh nosql non-relational databases so your experience with relational databases uh definitely could help but it's not a requirement so as long as you understand what is the database you are good to go and we have a couple of notes of SQL Masters which is great uh thank you keep this window open we will need it for the game in the end now let's start then thank you for answering and let's go uh why no SQL but I'm not going to answer a question why would you use that I'm going to answer a question first of all why it exists at all why what's wrong is there anything wrong with relational databases but now we speak about nosql so often or it's maybe nothing too bad with relational databases we will see in a moment so historically relational databases dominated the world of relational databases for uh dozens of years literally for dozens of Hills uh but then later that was not so much I think anymore and people started to talk about and people started to use relational databases more and more why it happened a general story is requirements have changed and that is pretty important to understand you remember maybe you remember the time maybe maybe you don't if you are young when we were using modems to make an in connection with internet service provider specifically when you run a modem connection your Homeland your land line phone was uh not available for your neighbors or for relatives to use because it was busy transferring your data and it was extremely slow it doesn't work like that anymore and the single mobile phone what I have has more Firepower than many of the mainframes of those times United together were able to produce so requirements really change it and we will change it in the way what we will need much more data much faster than before and then the very different kinds of data what it was hard sometimes to feed into the requirements of traditional relational database relational databases designed to run on a single machine and thus they have limit scalability when you speak about relational database you usually speak about at maximum some thousands of queries per second it may be a little bit more if you work hard enough and if your operations team database administrators are good but still we usually will be speaking about thousands of operations per second how much no sequel can handle it depends on particular database you will see soon now second thing uh relational databases are actually great they are very very great we're still great we will be in use so no one is decommissioning relational databases they are great because for a small to medium data size projects they can work very well for both online transaction processing and online analytical processing they are versatile you don't need to run multiple different database tools to have your data available for both your customers and for your analytics what is oltp processing in database World ltp processing workloads mean it's customer facing basically it's a data storage for data what is being dispatched to your uh customers and if you are the customer do you like an application what works slow no you don't I don't either so that means what requirements for online transaction processing workload databases very fast uh very very high uh very big demand on the performance point of view while analytical processing workloads are much more about working with a data very complex very Advanced queries customers who bought something in this year from the automotive category and have bought something from the last year in a different category than whatever was ready like very very many joints and things like that often worked with cold data as well so olap analytical processing does not have such high requirements for performance and quick response because you know what those are not customers paying you money but your analytics getting seller in your company working with an analytical processing kind of data and therefore they can wait because we are paying them right and story is relational databases are somewhere in between they kinda can be pretty fast answering through our customers uh they kind of be a pretty powerful generating different reports to your analytics and marketing and sales teams and so on but it all works well as long as the data of your project fits into a single server as soon as you have more and more data and that's what we see on the previews slide inevitably each company has more and more data at some point with data if you have to dispatch it quickly you have to be to be developed delivered to client very quickly because of oil TP requirements very very fast and what happens in the end relational database do not work well on the high requirements for Big Data or for the data of a big volume as long as you can hire find a server big enough to fit your data that may be acceptable but then you have too much data that doesn't work so well what does that mean for big companies like Apple like Netflix like Instagram like Facebook it means they have they going to need something different than relational databases take a look when we speak about nosql databases many people start to think about document databases because this basically uh one of the most used kinds of databases what I use it in the world if I ask you what kind of nosql databases do you know most of you will answer  is a great database but it's only one of many how many databases database engines exist in the world uh what do you think please write on YouTube chat how many databases database engines are present and known by Humanity in the world what do you think 10 20 15 maybe five maybe one maybe hundred uh one no Rex okay that is a good answer for someone working at data stocks I understand there is only one database but actually I believe we can do better try to guess how many databases we have uh atom do you think we will make it to guess uh any kind of closer eight okay it's bigger thank you Kumar thank you for us uh answering yes the way it has to be in hundreds right uh the real answer is uh more than three hundreds so then then people start to speak what okay no 60 free more than 300 really more than 300. so then people start to speak about uh uh what is a nosql I always say what a situation is a little bit more advanced than you may think we needed a purpose build databases for more specialized attached and we have document databases yes those are great but also we have graph databases to work with graph data we have key value databases when we store simple data but we need it to be scalable and available uh we need we use object storages objects kind databases when we need just to store blobs we use tabular databases or columnar databases we use time series databases like Prometheus or open tsdb to work with time series driven data or we have Ledger databases when we work with the data what cannot be deleted under any circumstances because it's a requirement of a law what your data stays available for Audi forever and ever and ever and it's technically cannot be deleted at all so no sequel would document nosql World offers you much more than just or just Cassandra it offers you a set of tools and as a good engineer you need to know in which situation which tool to use we have a dedicated introduction to no SQL world uh Workshop but today we will speak about Apache Cassandra one of the most powerful Solutions of the no simple world what is Cassandra Cassandra was created to answer a specific problem in the year 2008 Facebook reached their first 100 million users by now in 2022 if you watch us in 2022 that's not so big there are companies having much more customers but uh Facebook were one of the first companies to reach such a number maybe the very first one and uh remember they were in a pretty bad situation in the situation when you are looking for a tool what doesn't exist take a look they had users all around the world on all of the continents or almost all of the continents most of their customers were having fast internet connection already by that time they were handling really a lot of the data like really a lot and meanwhile they have had high availability and Fast Response requirements very strict slas then we were looking for a database which will make a better answer to this kind of problems because such a database was never needed before and that led to a creation of Cassandra in Facebook in the year 2008. Apache Cassandra is one of the most well-known nosql databases it's a distributed decentralized oltp database it's distributed so it's created by Design to run on multiple machines at once of course for your test environment your development environment you could use just a single node but why should you if you use us if you could have Astra we will speak about later that's decentralize it so it does not follow Master Slave or how it's a primary server secondary server or leader follower architecture it's peer-to-peer masterless architecture and it was designed to be extremely fast in on each continent everywhere under huge pressure of very heavy data a lot of data what is it now in year 2022 Apache Cassandra is used basically by most of Forbes least companies our Apple scale by now I believe they reached around 200 000 database servers running Only Apache Cassandra with hundreds petabytes of data storage there hundreds petabytes I don't speak about things like terabytes gigabytes of data no petabytes that's really a lot and they have many millions iterations per second over hundreds of clusters but my favorite guides from Cassandra point of view on Netflix they open much more information about how we use Cassandra Apple keeps its Secrets right but Netflix is more open so we know more they have hundreds of clusters keeping petabytes of data they have dozens thousands of database servers Apache Cassandra only they use different databases as well foreign Cassandra's number one database and their single most active cluster handles 30 Millions iterations per second such power is just impossible with relational database and don't forget where clusters a geographically distributed act effective last year we have had Cassandra de India online and one guy from Netflix Cloud database architect called vinay kumarcella was speaking there if you are curious about how Netflix uses Cassandra uh there is a link on the screen dts6.io Cassandra at Netflix and that is a very interesting talk to see uh how do they use Cassandra at Netflix so if you want to if you would like to work at Netflix when learning Cassandra is definitely a smart move uh so why companies speak Cassandra today it's created to work with a big data it created to have incredible read and write performance over multiple regions uh scale in under any circumstances scale well uh for big data and just add more nodes have very high availability it also has to be automated very well so otherwise to run hundreds clusters of thousand servers you will need really huge team of operations team or operations people just maintaining it so a lot of operations are executed by cluster itself uh geographical distribution so multiple deployments running at once together it's platform agnostic and vendor independent so what does that mean oh Netflix Cassandra link please uh gentlemen could please anyone send the link it's dts6.io Cassandra at Netflix um so big data ready Cassandra uses partitioning heavily partitioning means what we split data into chunks and each server responsible for some of those channels that means what if you get too much data or too many clients using this data you can add more servers and then data being distributed over multiple new servers and each server is responsible for smaller pieces of data therefore receiving less pressure or having more disk space so ability to handle big data is the essential feature of Cassandra then read write performance Cassandra is decentralized and you can communicate with every server and each server is already powerful enough to despatch your answers quickly but being distributed over multiple data centers and keeping your data close to your customers helps you to distribute a workload uh skill immediately Netflix I love this company so you can yes as I mentioned that many times already uh did a very interesting research they scaled their test cluster from 48 I believe servers like little bit less than 50 to almost 300 servers measuring exactly scalability if that grows as well if a line is uh straight or performance will be down downgrading down scaling content my if version overhead to add new nodes and the fun part is what basically that is a totally straight line and you can go further so uh that is interesting because there are many databases what uh claim they are scalable but for real for most of them like really for most of a databases it will be in the end like that and more servers you add that will give you very minor performance boost but here we have Admiral nodes yet basically twice as much of a performance uh good now highest possible availability team replication decentralization and topology replacement we discussed later gives us some incredible features uh first of all we always have live replicas outage of a single server or even outage of a wall data center doesn't lead to your data um unreachability then if you have a decentralized it no pure if you have decentralized it peer-to-peer architecture there is no single point of uh failure so you can easily gets uh to your data even if anything happens with a single server you can write your update to another server and that's fine and also drivers drivers some mostly were created created by data Stacks by the way um yeah I have very strong reconnection and retry mechanism so that is a very uh powerful feature very important feature of Apache Cassandra then we go uh self-healing and automation that means what basically cluster executes a lot of iteration but for our database you as an administrator or developer will have to execute oh thank you arto Martin pasted the link to Netflix uh blog with this scalability research um Okay so alterations for a huge cluster a heart and a lot of those operations are executed by Cassandra so you don't have uh to worry about many many things what will require manual operations with some of relational databases for example and finally Cassandra's trademark is multi-data Center deployment and all data centers are active so for uh with some databases traditionally you have uh active passive deployments you can have multiple data centers but some will be active and some will be passive so you can read data there but you cannot write in Cassandra each data center is active Apache Cassandra is not bound to any platform it's an open source project what you can run basically everywhere and moreover your clusters can be multi-cloud or hybrid Cloud so different Data Centers of the same cluster will work together also one is being deployed to Amazon web services in our own Google cloud and third in your own data center on premises that's totally fine and you can go with that if you had for a real uptime uh and you cannot afford no doubt any downtime and finally what I like is that I am a big open source fan um data Stacks does a lot for Apache Cassandra it's our number one thing of course but data Stacks does not have Apache Cassandra because Apache Cassandra belongs to a budget software Foundation it is a non-profit open source Community already familiar to you even if you never have heard about ASF you definitely know where products Kafka Apache Kafka Maven Apache Maven Hadoop and so on so that is a totally great project what helps maintaining and developing open source everywhere and does that for dozens of years already that is actually pretty old uh logo because we're older than 20 years old by now already okay so I actually suggest us first to walk a bit to the next slides and when we will do a lab what do you think cartoon do you find are you fine if we do Workshop after the next slides ah yes indeed we should good I think it will be better good uh so let's take a look what's important for us uh like Cassandra is an incredible database and one uh think important to understand by the way Cassandra is not an easy thing to do for you as a developer or administrator uh it's advanced technology it's not a bicycle it's an airplane but you know what airplane pilots I get better paid when uh bicycle delivery people right so learning how Cassandra works and learning all of its features and buttons and knobs is not an easy thing but it's very well paid after all yeah yeah so it is a powerful but it's uh harder to learn but if it's well paid in the end I'm fine with that right good so uh Cassandra is very powerful but how it works first feature all servers are created equal and that means what Cassandra does not follow traditional architecture you see in relational database world like literal server follower server not like that uh this architecture has problems you know it's a single point of failure it's hard to scale for rights and application needs to know where to write if you write to a follower server your right will be not applied you have to write to uh Master you have to write to little replica leader server Cassandra uses different architecture Cassandra is peer-to-peer architecture so each node is able to communicate with each node each node can accept any read and any write even if this note particular node processing your query does not store data you ask for it will know which node is responsible and it will redirect your query to a proper node dispatching all proper actions this approach gives no single point of failure this approach scales well for for both reads and writes because you can add more nodes or repartition data in the proper way and your application can contact any node or any data center if required now data is replicated what does that mean replication factor means a note amount of node uh you use it to store each partition partitions we will discuss in a moment but for now let's say what each row you insert into the table it will be stored in multiple servers replication factor is defined Finance is a group of the tables so when you create a key space you say I create key space population and it will be replication strategy Network topology strategy and it will have replication Factor free for United States West one and replication Factor 5 for Europe is two on this scenario I may have multiple data centers but I will store data of the key space population only on those two specified on the screen for United States West one each row will be replicated three times and for Europe is two each row will be replicated five times an application strategy is an important thing because uh basically we're very easy to remember there are only two replication strategies what is replication strategy first of all replication strategy defines how those replicas will be distributed over the data center and that is very important what's the story uh story is simple first of all you need to have your replicas as far from each other as possible while long story short if you keep does that make any sense if you keep a backup on your of your information on the same disk where you have your primary data set of course not you want to have backup data uh on some any and our different machine or different stores right otherwise this backup may disappear right with your laptop for example and if that is the same with those replicas for example if you run your data on a normal data center you have want to have those replicas to have them on a different server Rex servers located together in a single server rack they tend to fail together uh for example if a power outage power can disappear from a wall server wreck because that basically it uses the same power supply and power delivery line and that is a problem if all of your replicas were on the servers in a single line now this data is not available [Music] water plays it in another uh replication would place it in different uh places in different availability zones good so replication Factor one means whatever partition is stored on a single node replication Factor two means what each partition or H Pro for now let's say row uh store it on a different two different nodes and three obviously means what it will be stored on three different nodes or three different servers now we finally get to partitions and replication together with partition is exactly what makes Cassandra such complex such advances but also such powerful solution data is distributed in the partitions what does that mean in Cassandra we work with data in tables tables must be familiar to you if you have any understanding of relational databases right so tables are basically the same but may work differently data in relational database a single table will be stored on a single server right and it will be duplicated to follow your servers for example in Cassandra it works differently data is splitted into different partitions across different servers so this way we distribute if we work with really big data what will hard to fit into a single machine we split it into chunks and then we have it like that spread it over different servers when we partition our data and for example server on top is responsible only for United States uh when question comes how do we do routing how do we know which server asked for which data when your application needs to read data for Los Angeles for example answer a symbol it's easy to calculate because we know how exact the data is partitioned and data is partitioned based on the partition key take a look at this slide we have this field country as a designated partition key that means what all the records we have in this table will be partitioned based on their country and therefore New York and Los Angeles will go together into the same partition and when for example Nuremberg and Berlin will go to the same partition and the same for tarantine Montreal they go to Canada partition and so on that happens because we called country a partition key in this case then we create a table as you see Cassandra Ferry language is very similar to SQL please do not make a mistake they are not the same they look similar but at the moment you start to behave like oh I know SQL so I know SQL you go to a very wrong path what can lead you to a problem SQL looks like very the same but it's not very the same it's actually very different so uh at the family I receive a question I will answer it in a moment uh when we create a table first of all we have to specify key space it will belong to and as you could guess this table will share replication settings uh from the key space then we have to specify the name we get we give some Fields text text integer country City population and we declare primary key in relational database you very often ask your database for an ID to generate with Cassandra and any in our distributed system it doesn't work this way because when all the servers have to agree on which ID is sequential next like sequential IDs in postgres and then if you have a hundred or thousands of servers it's definitely going to take some time with Cassandra we work differently we declare we create a keys primary keys on the application side in this case we designate country to be the partition key first argument of a primary key is a partition key and then country will be my partition and therefore my data will be distributed like that based on the counting uh and uh how it works uh then all together so uh partition key we just created a partition key for this table to be counting how it works internal that is a cool thing uh take a look we have here uh Cassandra nodes data center of four servers why do we have exactly four servers because I was too lazy to add more circles on this slide so that's why this data center have only four servers so when we go for it or we have special partitioner which is usually more more free hashing algorithm partitioner converting each value it's get uh to the tokens yeah that's interesting uh uh perfect question is it similar to elasticsearch no it's not it has quite exactly opposite purpose maybe my colleagues will answer in the chat uh better to that so uh each value we give to partitioner being converted to some token to some integer and we see what USA becomes number 59 and Canada becomes number 12 and Germany becomes number 45 and we see what now and each server in our data center is responsible for so-called token range token range is basically a range of tokens right and we see what server a is responsible for tokens 1 to 25 server B responsible for tokens 26 to 50 and so on and then you could guess what all the rows with token 59 will form a partition 59 what will be stored on server C and then uh Canada goes to server a and then Germany goes to server B and that is a very important thing to understand ah usually those numbers does not look like 12 or 59 or 45 those are huge huge huge uh numbers very very long one I don't remember how big they could be but they are really really big you can have billions and billions and billions of partitions uh maybe I don't remembers uh but yeah those are really big numbers and why is it happening why do we split data into chunks it's happening because Big Data your company working with cannot fit to a single server splitting it into chunks we can help spreading them over multiple servers and that makes our life much easier when we really have a lot of data um good so I want to answer a question okay no first let me show uh how the token ranges recalculation work so people say what Cassandra is a great database perfect maybe database uh for scaling that means having more computational power or more uh disk space more volume the story is when we have a four node Data Center the token range overall the global token range is split into four parts each part is going to be 25 persons uh then if we are a company waiting for Black Friday or via Netflix we work at Netflix and we are going to release last episode of the last series of a Game of Thrones and everyone in the world is going to watch it then what happens when we need more Firepower we need more servers because currently our infrastructure would not cope with that so that means we will get a new server launch Cassandra on it and tell to this Cassandra instance yeah man uh there's your plaster please join it this node node a b c d e note E joins the cluster and says hello everyone I am in ukm please give me some uh job looking for a job and then happens this token ranges recalculation before it was 25 persons of tokens approximately per node now we have approximately 20 tokens uh because some token ranges will go to the new server and as a result and you know join cluster token range is recalculated new node receives data from the previous owner owners and that happens totally automatically if you ever end all vibrations alive the separation is life there are no downtime if you have your uh if you have uh ever done serving with any relational database you must be crying right now I was crying first time when I see how Cassandra is doing that because I did charging for relational database a couple of times it was extremely painful projects with Cassandra it was just a major like a real magic it is a major but the magician is you so you still need to learn how to do this magic okay but the operations are done by Cassandra and the same story happens when Black Friday is gone or everyone has watched the last episode of Game of Thrones everyone is unhappy no one is buying anything from us or no one is watching whatever we are showing then we want to downscale to avoid paying for the servers we don't need anymore therefore we decommission a couple of servers give your Cassandra time to move the data because we are going to take down to servers you tell to Cluster I'm going to take down those two guys then cluster again recalculates token ranges now each server will be responsible for approximately 33 persons and after the data migration you can take down the servers and no downtime all scaling operations our live data is being available to your customers all the time 100 of time that's it now I want to answer questions and let's take a look what's going on that uh yeah do you want to answer a question uh go ahead I can I can uh chime in but I did look at the question so okay to be added in the cluster or we use already deployed nodes on over of over data data partition so each node as you see already each node is responsible for a range of partitions and therefore adding any new Partition like creating uh new data for example for a totally new country I don't know let's say we just got a new country somewhere in Antarctic um then it will create a new Partition and this partition will have token let's say 78. but just because more more free agent algorithm generates from uh our new country token 78 then this token obviously goes to This Server so adding new partitions uh they will be uh put on the servers what you already have and only when you add more servers you think like there's too much partitions on my servers my servers are too busy or I need more disk space than you go for scaling out you add more servers and data is being redistributed so each party so each server is responsible for less amount of partition it has more disk space and answer less requests so it can do it fast uh good question thank you now um so the this the cluster will have certain number of nodes and then when you create key space you you tell how many replicas you want to place uh of each partition so if you have 10 nodes in the cluster and your application factor is three you have enough nodes to to create to have three replicas uh so that's the and and if you keep adding more notes you can increase your application Factor if needed or if you have done even if you don't have enough nodes to create that many replicas you you still will be able to get key space you will get a warning but uh uh you will be able to create key space and add nodes later yep table with video files a video file in this case is not being partitioned because data is partitioned and based uh that is a group of rows and if video file in your example is not a role per se but it is a column overall then obviously it will be not partitioned uh if I got the question maybe I didn't get the question now other no room for scale up as well for each node already generated I mean increase compute power so scaling up uh is a good question but scaling up for a really big data becomes prohibitively expensive very soon first a second there are some limits so when you scale out you can add as many nodes as you want then you scale up then at some point uh every next our server upgrade will going to cost you a real fortune like real fortune then that's better instead of making servers scaling up uh start with some reasonable commodity server and just add more notes it works better second Point what I wanted to mention about scaling up you definitely do not want to have servers of different computational power in your cluster because token ranges recalculation right now your server a is most busy and uh you decide okay servers BCD will stay of the same level but I will do Hardware upgrade for Server a sounds good doesn't work I mean it works in the beginning but then token range through calculation uh data is being moving to another node now server B is the most busy and server a is idling and what are you going to do down ski downgrade it again back uh our recommendation is do not try to better not have servers of different performance servers of different type across your data center but you really better have your servers of the same type and just add more if you have to scale um what decides which token should store in which node so how token ranges are being calculated uh that is a long story uh but uh what that's not so important for a developer as what you need to know is how do you design your partitions and our term will explain that soon in his part uh so soon we explained on how do you design that yeah and thanks Rex uh there that's really a base it on the consistent hashing algorithm okay now finally how it works together we have partitioning and we have replication so that is the secret source of Cassandra partitioning plus replication working together means what each server is technically responsible not only for its own token range but also for token range of two other servers well a two-hour service verification factor three um you may have different replication Factor but the general story is what each server is responsible for a few different token ranges and that is very important to understand with replication factor three then data arrives to your cluster it will be splitted into three different machines what are responsible for token ranges where these data feeds boom and your date is partitioned and replicated so it's highly available each Cassandra node and even each Cassandra driver understands data allocation in a cluster it's called a token available your application can contact any server and still get the answer even if the server is not responsible for this partition you are working but usually escazan because I'm so smart they will contact not just some random node but we will conduct replica node for this partition because driver is also token aware and Driver understands which server to work with uh for these insert or for this for V select very important Point what um very common misconception very common misunderstanding and then you launch an application many people uh think what they what your IP addresses you give in the configuration are the IP addresses of the servers your application will be working with it works like that in MySQL but Cassandra is totally different in the beginning you give a only initial contact points then your application starts then Cassandra driver starts it will use this IP address to reach out the cluster and tell hi I'm going to work with you uh could you please explain me who is responsible for what how many servers in the cluster the cost driver is talking aware and then cluster explains what you know what uh well uh that is server a its responsibility uh token ranges vs vs and that that is a server B and so on there is one disadvantage obviously a driver startup takes some seconds takes a couple of seconds there is a huge Advantage obviously once application is running all operations will be significantly faster because Drive will contact uh directly the node it has to conduct because it knows knows who is responsible for what foreign data is globally distributed so uh that means as mentioned already a couple of times today you can have your data centers on multiple of different Cloud providers simultaneously working as a single cluster still despite their being deployed deployed one on Google second on Amazon third one on your own Data Center and those data centers can be everywhere in the world now I have to ask you a question so please uh get ready to answer on the YouTube chat it's not a quiz yet so you will not get the prize uh what is the biggest problem of replication we need replication because it's the one and only way to have your data available even in case of a server outage power outage Network outage but by doing replication we also create a problem for ourselves there are multiple problems but I'm curious if you could guess the biggest problem consistency hey I see a man of a culture here as well right so replication creates a problem of multiple many network operations require it more uh for them because now we have multiple servers storing this data then also disk space because replicated data if you have a replication Factor free your data will consume three times more disk space than before and that is a big problem but you know what disk space is cheap but reputation is priceless so if you cannot afford to pay two three times more for your disk drives than was the probability Cassandra is a wrong choice for you but as we speak about usually a Forbes level companies those like they can afford buying one more disk it's totally fine or maybe dozen hundreds or thousands of new disks um then performance no performance is not exactly a problem I mean like that may require uh that create some more pressure on the servers but it's not the biggest one and yeah biggest problem of uh replication is potential inconsistency so uh consistency is not the problem consistency is concerned but I still count it as a correct answer then you write an update so you change a price for an item in your uh store from 12 to 13 dollars and one of the node may not get an update and as a result we have situation when two nodes were updated and uh one uh was not so what does that mean for us this situation may lead to very serious problems as the business owner you don't want to sell your goods uh with outdated prices as a business customer you don't want your bank to store your data uh in in the in the inconsistent mode without like missing some operations right so consistency is the biggest problem potential inconsistency is the biggest problem of replication obviously that that is about any uh duplicate any distributed replicated system will you introduce a cache layer in your application you can run into exactly the same situation even if it's not distributed just the same server cache um just because you didn't invalidate your cash and cash and validation sometimes is a big pain especially for distributed systems so obviously uh Cassandra developers took it very seriously from the very beginning how Cassandra handles that one of the first there are multiple tools to handle uh this problem but first layer I want to discuss today one of my favorite ones so-called hinted handles when your application receives data it will calculate which server is responsible for this partition you have seen that already and dispatch with data servers what got this data we will have to answer okay we got it but one of the servers is down or there is a network connectivity problem and it cannot store with data it doesn't get the update and therefore does not confirm a receivable of this information Then This Server who was coordinating this request a server a coordinating a query is called a query coordinator so query coordinator notices uh what it's uh something is wrong and one guy is not answering and it will store so-called hinted handle hinted handoff will be stored persistent on these disk and then this server is recovers in that handoff will be delivered to it fully automatically and then data is done data is reconsistence is recovered but that's only one of multiple tools to control consistency in Cassandra hours are more for administration team so as you are developers we will not speak too much about that today but that thing is very important to understand again the part I love here is someone responsible for um uh Cassandra cluster or for whatever SRE site reliability engineering what it happens automatically in the morning you can wake up go to your monitoring and see what one server was down during the guide for whatever reason but now it's up and consistory consistency is restored automatically and you don't have to do anything that is totally done by the server so and that is I guess turn for my dear artem to tell us uh of some very important limitations and very important things to understand working with distributed application okay thank you Alex do we want to I think we should do the first lab okay let's do the first lap and then proceed uh with or we can do first and second life together as we wish and yeah well I thought about it that's also possible I just want to make sure that uh our attendees have some practice Yeah practice is important yeah right as soon as possible so um wait a moment I have to switch to your screen I guess yes please uh give me a moment so I will switch to your screen yes you should be good in a moment yes so let's go for Hands-On lab and and the first one is you are really really simple yeah the first one is very very simple and okay uh so I posted the in the chat you you can see the GitHub link it will bring you to this page and the first one is just simply let's create the database so that we can use it so it takes a little bit time to create a database the decoration process takes a few minutes so we will create it and then we'll go back and talk about cab serum many of you ask about consistency availability partition tolerance and we we're going to establish relationship between those three properties and but while we're doing that our database will be created so you can go to the uh create asterdb this link and you will if you need to if you already have an account then you will sign in if you don't have an account you will sign up and you can use um you use your uh for example Google account to sign up and you will get to a dashboard eventually and what you will need to do is so there are a couple of things depending on whether you participated in previous workshops or not but we will create a database with name workshops and key space with name sensor data and we will use Google cloud and and one of the regions I will show you will be available okay so if you if you don't have uh I already have workshops database here but I will create a new key space and if you don't have the workshop database you can click on create database and you can copy paste your workshops and censor data here okay copy paste or time type them in and sensor data and here you will need to select Google Cloud because this is a free plan so there are only regions available on Google Cloud there is one in North America you can select the others are locked so don't worry about that you can also if you're in Europe you can select this region in Belgium in Asia you can select in the region in India and then you just click so once you select you have a name of the database name of the key space click create database and it will be created so in my case and it will take a little bit time for it to finish the creation so in my case I already have a database and my computer is a little bit slow that's uh because we're running all these videos so I already have workshops database so I will just select it and add key space in this case sensor data and it will be created okay and and I even have the the key space already sensor data okay so this is this is this is all you need to do in this first lab just create a database and key space sensor data do it a little bit in advance because uh creation of a data may take some seconds so we better do it before we start working with data yes and then we in the next step we'll create tables and and we'll insert some data and we'll query that data so let me know if you have any questions or you're good and already done with the these simple steps foreign thank you process looks good to me and I expect yeah if you are ready please set the thumbs up in the YouTube chat I will show you how I will be the first one because my Astra is already running if you prefer to run Cassandra locally it's totally fine but we don't want to make you deploy anything today so we better stick to already deployed one by us yes so we can continue then and we will talk about the capturing and so the cap CM cap stands for consistency availability partition tolerance these are three properties three features that that this CRM um basically States a relationship between them for distributed systems so what are those features in modity availability means that the system will distributed system will give you a response which is not an error response so it's means in other words it's up time the system is not down and it's going to give you some meaningful response response rather than an error or timeout or something like that so we usually want system to be available otherwise our customer is not going to be happy right because the our website or our whatever transactional system is not available that's a that is a problem then the other property is consistency means no stale data remember we said that because we duplicate data the duplication doesn't happen like momentarily it takes a few milliseconds here and and maybe the other node is lower yeah especially when you have multiple data centers around the world where a steel speed of light problem you know yes indeed so so in that case consistency means that you you get the most recent data the data that you wrote the most recently you will also read it so you do not read the the stale data and and if you read the stale data so it basically the previous version of that of the data that sometimes can be uh a problem but sometimes it may not be such a big deal and and we will we will look at how we can tune consistency to make sure that we we always get get consistent data and partition tolerance uh uh is isability of the distributed systems to survive node failure just one note multiple nodes or maybe the whole uh Network partition like the whole data center is gone and you have the other data center so what what's going to happen in that case so guess what for the cap cerium uh um the all the distributed systems will encounter some kind of failures if you have a cluster you have many nodes so the probability that one of them is going to fail increases so in this case all uh basically all distributed systems select partition tolerance as one of the features but they cannot also cannot select all three so the capsim states that you can only have two features or the disabled system can be designed to guarantee only two of those properties partition tolerance is one what most uh systems select yeah you definitely don't want to sacrifice partition tolerance in no way it's the most important part yes so it basically if you sacrifice partition tolerance then you have um you're either working with a single node system uh like like a relational that relational databases something goes wrong it needs a consistence not available anymore so we select partition tolerance and then we select either consistency or availability so some systems are called CP systems and other systems are called AP systems so is Cassandra AP or CP Cassandra can be bossed depending how you configure consistency and and each request in Cassandra can be executed with consist so-called consistency level you can specify whether you want for example only one replica to return data for you or or you may want multiple replicas majority of them or you may even want all the replicas to return your data and then you you always get them uh most consistent data so it's called configurably consistent uh or tunably attunable consistency that that's the concept in Cassandra that allows you to for or to basically um uh change the consistency basically to to change the dial between consistency and availability so make it so if you increase consistency requirement then your availability decreases right if you okay with lower consistency requirements and your availability increases right so if you have three replicas one of them failed you can still read data from two but what if that one that failed had the most recent data right so you you have to kind of understand those those Concepts so in Cassandra every Quest every read and write insert update delete select will have a consistency level that you can specify the the to execute that request yeah we show it on the next slides in more details yes so here we have the example of uh SQL shell command consistency with which gives you the current consistency level and you can also set so the current one was Quorum and then we set it to all we change it to all so we will talk about this different consistency levels so there is any one local one two three Quorum local Quorum each Quorum and all so uh that just so so some of them are easier and said like one it means that only one replica needs to occur needs to respond to your request so it needs to acknowledge read uh it needs talk more acknowledge right or it needs to return your data uh for the read request um and then two and three two replicas Quorum is going to be majority replicas we will see some examples shortly uh local quorum it's it's a quorum for one data center which you connect it to so you you have three data centers in this example local Quorum if you connect to this data center to one of the nodes it will be coordinator then local Quorum is only concerned about uh the the Quorum with this this data center and it's not going to create you're not going to access the Azure data sets each Quorum means that each data center will have to respond a quorum of replicas will have to respond okay all means all nodes in the cluster so literally all of these notes will have to respond any um any is basically um even anyway is the best choice for you if you like Risk yeah so you cannot read with any you can write with any so when all replicas are done and you can still write uh with any and that's coordinator is basically gonna hold that data for for you will will hold it and then when replicas are up it will distribute it but again any is nothing that you want to use okay it's a very special use case not a general case like that for edge cases when you work with data what you can afford losing right uh so in this example we have three replicas replication factor three and consistency level one and we are writing data so uh in this case what it means since we have three replicas we will write to all three of them all three of them will get a copy of the same data but but we will this note which is coordinator so it will it will initially set a client connects to coordinator and then based on consistency level one and replication factor of C this container will know which nodes will store will need to store that data it will send them right requests but it will only wait for one response one acknowledgment from one of the replicas so because consistency level is set to 1. so maybe this node is the fastest to respond maybe the response in five milliseconds but the other one is response in seven the other one in eight milliseconds so it doesn't matter for the current as soon as Carnegie gets the response from one of them and it will get from others but it it doesn't care as as long as the one response is there it will confirm the right to the client okay so it happens very fast uh in case of consistency level one and and many many use cases with with large data sets with large throughput will just use consistency level one to speed up things in case of uh consistency level quorum uh we we still have three replicas here that coordinator sends data to but we need to get response from majority of them so it it will be two replicas the first two that will require respond the quickest the coordinator will get the acknowledgment and will respond to the client that the request completed and then the third will respawn as well but we don't care about his response anymore because we already got majority of responses and then in case of consistency level one all uh all replicas will have to get a response okay but uh consistency level all is is not a great consistent level to use because what happens if one of these replicas is down right the the request cannot be completed so you you basically you choose consistency completely over availability is if one of the replicas is done you will not be able to complete the request you will not be able to acknowledge it to the client so level because this level all is not a good consistency level to use in practice so um and you usually don't meet don't need to use it because you you have other ways to so if you want to ensure that you always read uh the most consistent most recent data you can simply so the concept is called immediate consistency or strong consistency you simply need to write with Quorum and read with swarm and then we will always get the most consider the most recent data that you wrote so let's look at this example this is our coordinator if you're going to write into three replicas two of them will acknowledge and then we immediately with second client immediately we're gonna read with Quorum and we will read from from only uh two of them because uh we don't need to contact LC we only need response from from two of them so this is the majority Quorum is majority so we will get response maybe from from this node and from this node and this note maybe it didn't acknowledge the write yet but this note already has the data it's the most recent one so we will be able to uh the Cardinal will be able to know which uh what what is the most recent data and it's decided based on timestamp internally okay so you can if you want to be safe you want always consistent data you you just read and write at quorum okay but if you want to be fast then maybe you you read and write at lower consistency levels right like it very depends no the most important part here to remember is what consistency level is configurable per request per each query you run and the same application can work with different data so for example your application works with bank transfers and you want those to be like very very consistent right but also your same application uses a profile pictures for customers no one will object if his profile picture will not be immediately updated on all of the uh servers at once if some customers or some other customers will see a beat outdated profile Peak so this way you can go for faster than um more consistent queries so it all depends on the data you work with yes so indeed so you decide for for your specific needs of your end requirements for your application okay uh so the next topic let's talk about a little bit more about tables and partitions we already kind of discussed the the how data it is stable but let's take a closer look um so we have the simplest concept data structure there is called a cell so cell stores a barrier uh stores your data and and um it belongs to essentially it's it's a data in some row and some column so the row is a basically consists of cells and it's related data in this case we have a sensor Network for Forest we have some sensor and have Valor for that sense okay and those the the sum of those rows that are related can be organized into partitions uh based on a partition key so in this case all rows that belong to the forest sensim Network they will be in the same partition and we will we'll talk about how to organize them into the same partition and now we also have columns right so so the the the table consists of columns and rows and rows can be organized into partitions so basically it's a partition table a partition and distributed table so in this case it's the distributed based on the sensor network name such as volcano will end up on on one no the which is different from C different from cry different from Force but for example eyes and dog here they will end up on the same not and this is done automatically as long as we we tell the the system Hotel Cassandra what our partition key is it's a network name then Cassandra is going to use murmur 3 partitioning to be able to uh decide which to to which which uh token uh so it will generate will convert the um that value to token and will know exactly the Cassandra will know exactly which node is respond responsible for the token range uh to store that token so when we Define our table we besides so we we give a name to the table we also give columns column names and data types but the most probably most difficult part here is deciding on the primary key because primary key consists of mandatory partition key which can contain one or more columns and optional clustering key okay so in this case we have clustering key which is timestamp but what is this partition key so this partition key it defines data distribution strategy so uh given a sensor uh and and then date all rows that have the same date and sensor will be stored in the same partition what does it mean it will they will end up on the same note and when you retrieve the data you will retrieve that data very efficiently because it's it's called the the concept of data locality so the data is located on the same node that node will read it quickly and give it back to you and and as we remember there will be not just one node that contains a there but possibly multiple nodes depending on the replication factors so there can be three replicas that that store the same partition okay so um so here are some more examples if we simply partition based on sensor here based on sensor here and based on uh sensor and timestamp but these examples may not necessarily be the best right so at least some of them um so um the the other concept so the the part so we said there is a partition key sensor there is clusting key timestamp what's the purpose of the class twin key classroom key uniquely identifies a row within a partition within the partition and and it also defines the Sorting order within that partition so the rows will be sorted uh either in descending or ascending order you can specify here in clustering order by uh based on that clustering column so this first example where we have the sensor has a partition key for this table is not going to work because basically we have many measurements many temperatures will be measured by that sensor there will be many rows for that sensor but um uh in this case we have a partition key sensor so there will be for that sensor that will one partition but we don't have identifier for the row so essentially we will each time we will override the the temperature so this is not a good design this design is better because time stamps are unique our sensor takes a measurement every second for example every 100 milliseconds something like that so the timestamp will be unique so we will have uh in each sensor partition will have many um roles but there there can be other things like we will not be able to filter on on dates in this example we want to have retrieve all measurements from a sensor for a given date so we are basically designing our partition key and clashing key for specific query and that's that's how data modeling is actually done we will hopefully have time to talk about it in more detail another example here uh the the sensor wireless timestamp is not going to work for our purposes because remember so the key clustering key consists of failure and timestamp the so it will be first sorted by Baler and then sorted by timestamp so sorting by value doesn't make much sense in this example and this is the the one which will work the sensor is going to be partition key date and timestamp classing key so sorting will be based on date and then on based on timestamp but timestamp is essentially a part so it it does contain the date already so it's a meaningful sorting okay what's uh what's the difference between the last one and this one is uh basically date was part of partition key here it's part of Class 10 key and that can be important because um if you if your sensor um takes measurements at a regular interval for long extended period of time you will end up with many many values many many rows in this partition right because partition is uniquely identified by sensor and everything every measurement will be stored in in that partition but here the partition for each on each new day new Partition will be created for that sensor so you can actually have you will have multiple partitions here for for this sensor so uh for for months with 30 days you will have 30 partitions for the sensor for for here for for uh 30 days you will still have one partition so the the partition size grows quickly okay so and and finally when you combine uh primary uh partition key with classic key you get the primary key which uniquely identifies at all in a table again to to summarize primary key uniquely identifies a row in a table partition key uniquely identifies a partition in a table and it serves as a uh has a definition of how data will be partitioned how this table will be partitioned and classing key uniquely identifies rows within the partition and defines ordering sorting within a partition okay yep I wanted to say a word about this slide take a look uh we discussed in the beginning what uh Cassandra using Apache cassandry in production is much more of like piloting and Airbus or a Boeing than driving a bicycle and that is one of the reasons why um the story is let's see how it works partition Keys you decide then you create the table we'll Define data distribution in the table all around the cluster clustering columns you define then you create uh call tables Define how data is physically stored sorted on disk working with Cassandra we have to remember what we can speak about thousand servers with petabytes of data so because of that any change could you please switch to the next slide so any change of uh this kind of schema is not allowed you can add some data column so you can add more columns or drop some columns uh but only so-called data columns as long as a column is mentioned in the primary key as a partition or as a clustering you cannot change anything where totally because changing partition key adding some new parts removing some parts would lead basically to reshuffling all data of a table in your cluster and that is obviously very bad idea it will make your cluster busy for weeks while not being able uh to answer your customers requests and changing a clustering key is a very bad idea as well because obviously it will lead to rewriting all data on disks which is also not possible so schema is immutable if you do something if your application changes even if you did something uh perfect in the beginning if you did even if you did everything right still your business May evolve over time and that will need to some new requirements some new queries and all the things like that so then you will need to create a new table and migrate your data you cannot simply rework the existing table add some data columns remove some data columns but you cannot change any parts of a primary key and that is one of the big limitations you need to remember that's why data modeling is so important we will speak about data modeling in the next slides but in general that is a very short introduction if you want to be an airplane pilot who knows what he is doing and safely lands and takes off and lands with all the goods and airplane intact on the planet Landing not on disaster lending you need to attend course on data modeling uh at academy.datastacks.com and great news it is free so yes like we are a little bit crazy we do great things uh for free and uh that one is the most important part of your education as nosql practicing administrator or developer then you will get when you will pass this course you can become a certified administrator or the Cassandra developer for free again because data Stacks sponsors your certification as well if you will have any questions regarding that I will drop a link in the chat you can catch me on LinkedIn and ask me any questions I will be happy to answer Adam yes so it it's important to get your your primary key rights and and if this is the first time you're hearing about partition key classic key that may not be that easy right so you you will need some time to play with with them and and and see how they work so this is your opportunity to actually create some tables and uh we will be able to you will be able to play with Cassandra uh with with uh tables their schema and and we will also add some data as well so again you can go to the same okay you can go to the same uh GitHub repo where the there are instructions for you to to create tables okay let me log in again foreign was doing today you can do it as a part of your homework if you are uh if it's not convenient for you to do it right now and send a submitted to us as a homework as explained it in the GitHub repo or following this link boom or work thank you yes so we can get started here I will just guide you here in this so you already have workshops database and you have uh sensor data as a key space so and we will uh create table called okay table called networks but first we will need to connect to that key space so I will copy this command use sensor data and you can go to cql console cql stands for Cassandra Credo language and you can do use sensor data and you will be connected to this key space in SQL sh or cql console so the next command we are going to create table Networks so looking at this table we don't have class and key we only have partition key which is the name of the network so what it means is there will be only one row per partition we cannot have multiple rows because the the we don't have the clustering key here okay so the next one we can do the described tables and we will and set essentially we'll just get the names of the table like this example Network so we will skip this we'll create two more tables sensors by Network this one has a network as partition key and sensor as a class income so if you want to efficiently retrieve all sensors in a network we need to specify network name and we will retrieve one partition with with all the rows representing each one representing a different sensor and then there is another example temperatures by sensor bed and we have sensor as a partition key timestamp as a clustering column and here why is it bad so it's explained later but essentially we talked about it already so if we if our sensor keeps getting new measurements new values then decide the we keep inserting rows into the same partition and our partition will grow uncontrollably so we will have an issue at some point we don't want to have more than 100 000 rows in that partition we will create this table anyway just for the sake of the example and we then we will um make Corrections okay so we will drop this table now and we'll recreate it so we recreated the same columns but the partition key design is different sensor and date now become partition key and that helps to manage the size of the partition essentially we split in the previous partition which was just identified as sensor we split in it for each state we will have a different partition for that sensor created okay so we drop in the table creating the new one what else will we need to do here just describe tables and we will get um the information the described specific table or described all tables okay but pretty much we created all these okay tables and we got this message that um client request time out let's describe tables and see if um the table was deleted if it still exists or not okay so it was deleted even so the the time there was a time out essentially our client didn't get the response on time but we don't have this uh temperatures by sensor bad was deleted okay and that's it for this exercise so we can continue with the next topic let me know in chat if you uh River a question I wanted to answer yes so I will switch back to my screen for a second okay of course uh just click right okay so a question was asked by uh boom I forgot the name sorry Ravi uh Sharma yes good so uh replication factor three one note is down one note is inconsistent how do I get uh not stale data how do I get consistent answer you can see my screen yeah you see my screen right uh long story short you have uh one uh you have two levers two knobs to control consistency one is replication factor which is defined when you create a key space so usually a long time ago and second lever second button is consistency level what you can decide to use per request you have a replication factor three and of those free replica servers one is down and one is inconsistent how do you get up-to-date information let's take a look at the list of consistency levels if you go with consistency level one uh there is a 50 50 chance to get most up-to-date or stale data because your query can heat uh updated server or it can hit not updated server and therefore you are in trouble because with 50 Channel you can get outdated information but that's why that's exactly why consistency level one is not really recommended it's recommended for some special use case if you want to have consistent data you can go with consistency level Quorum uh Quorum for replication Factor 3 majority means two right that means what running a query query uh query coordinator will always wait for two answers compare them and if they are matching it will return this value to you as in this case we wait for two answers and we have answer one answer consistent second inconsistent uh query coordinator will compare the data what was uh written last so what's for more stress and value return this value to you to the client so client always gets more stress and value and initiate a repair the link to the outdated node hey wherever are some updates you miss it please execute repair on this partition repair is a special mechanism what Cassandra does internally to recover consistency if inconsistency was noticed there are two kinds of repair one repair is initiated on read what you we just discussed and second repair is what your uh database administrator or system administrator schedules for Cassandra cluster and that is very important to have running repairs on a regular basis about repairs we explain all in the cassava Patrick Cassandra maintenance and operations course uh ds210 at the Academy the datastagge.com mentioned already so if you read with Forum there is no mathematical uh situation where you can run into inconsistency because you will always wait for a majority to answer the only possibility to run into inconsistency with consistency level Quorum if you've wrote data with consistency level one if you write your data with consistency level one two servers were missing the two servers were down now they are available you are asking you are making a query at the Quorum level by coincidence Wells to servers with not most up-to-date value restaurants first and then your customer get outdated information and that's exactly why we do not recommend to use consistency level one because it can be dangerous so for most of the cases read Quorum right Quorum is the best recommended way to communicate with replicated distributed data well I would also add well consistency level I believe the Netflix actually uses can in their blog they use consistency level one or local one steps like that but uh um it depends on the data yeah yeah it depends on the data so I would not say we with the Note 3 command it it just uh depends on how important it will be to read the most um recent data so so for example if you if you for example a recording user interaction with website you probably don't care about Quorum you just write and read with consistency level one another note for for Quorum think about if you have globally distributed database and application and you have data center in uh in in Asia and data center in the United States so there is a distance right if you say in Quorum then you are doing Quorum across all the replicas across both data centers so in that case um you you need to think about local Quorum and local one well but for the sake of the example local Quorum what it means so if I'm in in United States I will be always connecting to my local data center I don't need to connect to a data center in Asia because it's going to be slower so I will be using local Quorum and I will still get my data always consistent right if I'm using local Quorum free it's local quarant for rights but there is a chance that that data is replicated to Asia data center it will take a little bit longer time so if you try to read from that data center you may still get inconsistency but but then you kind of think about those types of uh uh situations as well so because you also want um uh performance right performance and availability availability in this case if data center in Asia is down I still want to be able to uh work with my data center in the United States so the customers in the United States will not be affected anyway um there is an additional question what happens if we got data from two consistent nodes if you got data from two consistent nodes then data will be matching it will be the same data if they both are consistent there will be no need to resolve right yeah the consistency and and the resolution is done based on timestamp each each value that you insert into Cassandra will have a timestamp it's it's stored there automatically uh you can access it if you want to but it's used for the resolving the inconsistencies in data yep uh so let's go further uh should I switch to your screen or realize the if you find for a first couple of slides I would like to switch you for art of data modeling obviously okay yes please yeah so I will uh say a couple of words about uh um oh okay we yeah right so we better switch to your screen right okay give me a moments right uh so you should be I think it's your screen yes live so uh we're gonna just in general touch data modeling we will not be able to to cover it in detail obviously but um if you're familiar with databases uh uh most most likely you use relational database before or you heard about it and then the relational data modeling is is different than the data model in Focus Sandra so relational databases usually designed based on requirements of what the whole Enterprise what kind of data the whole Enterprise needs to store so that data requirements are collected analyzed and then they modeled using uh well-defined relational data model normalization Theory algorithms that allow you to decompose those relations into uh better relations with which I insert normal form or some other forms so and and then only then you design an application and usually it's not one application your data for the whole Enterprise so you you will have different types of applications that you design and you just use those models so the when you design models data models right when you structure organize your data you do not take into account applications you do not into account take into account performance uh you only start looking at performance when you need to optimize certain quiz and you're creating indexes there but potentially for relational database your queries will have joins joins are expensive right so um the the the you will optimize them you will create some indexes and and you will have index-based joins and things like that but they are still still can be expensive if we're talking about really large data sets so another way to think about this whole approach is relational database is is called usually it's integration database it stores data from the whole Enterprise and and then applications simply use that data for Cassandra and most nosql databases actually the approach is different because nosql databases are application databases they're not integration databases they do not the goal is not to store all data for the Enterprise to reflect the real state of the Enterprise the goal is to support one particular application so you start with application you think about how that application what type of data you will retrieve uh in one task what type of data you will give in the next screen right uh what what data you will be available at this step you will have available this step and what kind of queries you will execute next and so on and then you design based on on that knowledge you will be able to design uh tables that are specific specifically support those queries so you design design tables to support queries so what what I showed you previously the table with Partition key with classic key it's not very meaningful and unless you know what type of query it needs to support it was designed for specific field Okay so so the you design the models like that and then you uh basically add data to your the application generates data you will bulk load some data and you you need to make sure that uh your query is efficient and they will be efficient sometimes we call this this process denormalization so we essentially we store data that will be retrieved by equity together collocated so you will store it in in the same partition so another way to think about it is uh nesting data into partition um a document databases say they embed uh multiple entities multi multiple data entities into the same document and so on but yeah if you want to learn about data modeling uh more uh Alex already mentioned we have Academy data Stacks Academy and we this we have the whole methodology described for you so there are essentially four models that you will work with the first model allows you to understand the data and this is called conceptual data model it's actually independent of of database it can be used for relational database can be used for noiseql database and we use ER diagrams and relation diagrams to work with them we also you will learn about application workflow model which is essentially allows you to identify the queries or data access patterns so data access patterns are more than just queries can be inserts deletes can be based alike transactions with multiple statements and things like that right and they will they are not randomly executed they executed by your application in certain order because you you have you have to log in first you have to show the the main screen then you go to and and to the next screen and so on and then we explain how to map those two into logical data model which is based on query driven design so you design your table space on queries query first approach and we visualize it with so-called cubicle diagrams and finally there are also there is another step optimization step where we uh now start to worry about size of the partition uh whether we need to split the partition or not what kind of data types we will use for example we will use int or we will use will we use uuid or time uid so there are quite a few things there but to give you an idea this is a very small conceptual data model which says that the user can comment on many videos and video is commented on by many users so many users may leave comments for the video so we have entity types user video we have relationship type uh comments on and we have these attribute types ID email and so on and those that underline they uniquely identify their keys user has ID that you nuclear device video has ID okay and when we analyze our application we we we know that a user will open a profile this is one thing what what do we need what kind of query do we need to support uh for that maybe we need to find comments related to Target user um using its identifier and get the most recent first so we are gonna uh do the the ordering as well and the other query maybe when the user opens video page we will find comments related to that specific video so the user can read them and they also will be ordered based on timestamp so these are two queries and they will deserve a separate uh even so in both cases we'll store comments they we will organize them either by user or by video so here is an example of these two tables in the first one comments by user we may decide that the user ID will be a partition key so this is a notation that we use to visualize those tables and then creation dates and and comment ID will be clustering columns and uh or they they will also be ordered in descending order or ascending order and comments by video table will have video ID as a partition key so essentially if we want to retrieve all comments for video we all we need is to specify video ID and retrieve the whole partition with all all these rows in this partition and they will also be ordered based on the creation date for for that comment and um and then we we can optimize so what kind of optimization we so this is physical data model now where we specified data types uad time uad another uad and text and you can see uh we don't no longer have creation dates because time uad is a special type of uad which also has time component in it so when we create comment when the user create creates comments the the comment ID is generated as a time uad and we can always extract that time component and Cassandra will actually use that time component to do the ordering for us so we saved on one column right there so here is the how those tables can be specified in in SQL and um there should be a familiar for you already so this this is partition key user ID command ID is a clustering key and we specified how how to sort it and so on and I think we don't have time to do the next Lab but uh you can probably do it as a homework yeah it's a part of her homework anyway so please do it uh good great so I will switch back to my screen thank you so much thank you Alex my pleasure boom and I'll meet this one okay so uh one thing I wanted to end regarding the uh data modeling uh as you see VCS approached with denormalization and for a long time we were taught what generalization is bad and normalization is only way to work with the database that sounds great at the University course but when you hit real when you hit real life or better to say real life hits you with real life requirements you run into the very very soon run into the situation what even with relational database you have to generalize because generalization means faster answers and uh here with non-relational database with no possibility to use joints obviously we are going to use denormalization and it is totally fine uh the only thing you better know you better understand what you are doing you better be careful with that generalization is good then you control the organization and the normalization is totally better than denormalization controls uh so we have to pay attention uh yesterday I was at uh convert conference in Frankfurt and we were talking a lot also about data modeling we met an instructor regarding data modeling plus from and we were crying on each of our shoulders like people don't pay enough attention to data modeling for nosql databases and then they run into troubles and we are trying to stop it but we not always can stop it and then they are doing some stupid things on production and everyone is unhappy and that is bad so different databases but still the same approach uh think of the workloads things of a query so you are going to run how your customer is going to run this query and design by query approach and denormalization is good absolutely this is one of the optimization techniques that is uh used by relational databases for oltp databases but it's very common the implementation techniques used for by our lab databases by data warehouses because storing larger data sets is cheap but doing the joints computation is much more expensive mm-hmm and then you are going to create a report and creation of this report takes hours because you have a lot of data and dozen of joints to execute over this data and you cannot do them at once because they simply don't fit in the memory of a machine so you have to do it group by group that's fine for all up workloads but definitely not fine but yeah even for a lot of it's too much but for oltp that's complete and acceptable so the normalization is the only answer uh good so you know what there are a couple of dozens of people who stayed before still the end and I believe I believe they deserve some prizes they totally deserve some prizes what do you think absolutely yep uh we have oh I don't remember what do we have for today I believe those are Cassandra t-shirts maybe some more I I don't remember what we have today but go on if you are on mentee already then uh good for you if you are not uh on main key yet then please jump in right now because we are starting in a minute and Kumar uh Winston thank you so much for your warm words Winston is a bit sad what you cannot join uh quiz so please join us very next week to take your chances to win our prizes let's go then it is the quiz time for intro to Apache Cassandra and we will start okay we have enough players that is great A couple of more people to join okay let's go it's quite late for many of you so I don't want to make you wait anymore so answer fast to get more points how many masternodes does Cassandra cluster need at least three per cluster free per data center enough to maintain consistency not a single one Cassandra is decentralized at the family I'm sending the link in the YouTube chats and it's hard to as well yeah thank you Aaron so time is up and right answer Cassandra does not have any Master notes and if you don't have any Master notes wherefore you cannot require some of them to be present not a single one Cassandra is decentralized that concept of a masternode does not exist right answer is not a single one good so let's go on uh show me the leaderboard try to catch up so I see some people are only joining try to catch up Uh Kevin was the fastest one and that was the right answer also tabiso Surat and Ravi gave right answers but a little bit slower so question number two and answer fast to get more points how data is being distributed in the cluster data is all data is replicated to each server data is distributed by partitions range of partitions per node the data is distributed with address locators data is distributed distributed using post mail that would be interesting to see and I see nine people are giving answers right now and most of you made it no all data is not replicated to each server skipping a big data on each server will basically ruin your business that's for sure it will be too expensive so no date is distributed by partitions uh now it was better so many people made the right answers who was the fastest Swiss time was it Kevin again Hey Kevin is fastest again good job man so question number three let's go answer fast to get more points which replication factor is recommended a one point half pre 15 42. I would really love to see your application Factor 1.5 in action that may be interesting topic yeah what do you think all right repeatedly recommended replication factor is free and one point half is uh it's something really weird I hardly can imagine that who was the fastest Slayer this time let me guess Kevin no someone to overtake him stop recording now Karen is fastest again but this time surath answer it isn't exactly the same time now Ravi Sharma is on the fourth place uh and uh tabiso and Kevin are on the first place first three places first three places getting the price so question number four answer fast to get more points what is the Astro DB what is r2db we use today it's a gateway to Our Stars it's a local and memory version of Cassandra it's the Cassandra is a service in the cloud it is a development tool what is astrody beam and time is up and most of you made the right answer technically Astra can be used as a development tool of course I mean it's a part of a development environment for you but technically Astra is a Cassandra is service in the cloud right so most of you made it but who was the fastest let me guess I maybe know the name who has the fastest internet connection and fastest fingers on the wild west wasn't care okay okay not a big surprise Kevin is fastest and tabiso and suraf are keeping second and third place with Raga Sharma trying to get even to the top three but it's not going easy this time we still have some questions and that's going to be question number five out of eight so answer fast to get more points what is a primary key what is a primary key it's the same as a partition key maybe or it is the main house key it does not apply to nosql databases or it's only identifies a row or maybe it is a column in the partition key okay now everyone has answered and time is up and most of you made it primary key uniquely identifies a row it's not the same as a partition key because primary key includes partition key but also clustering columns those are optional but those are part of a primary key so it's not the same and it's not a column in the partition key because partition key is by itself a column or a set of columns no primary key is nuclear identifier zero and includes partition key and clustering columns so there were some mistakes and maybe oh okay Ravi Aditya like I'm afraid uh that will be much harder now to get to the top three maybe maybe some of the leaders will make mistake in the upcoming questions and Kevin was fastest again stop this guy like really it was something good chat is totally quiet and everyone is busy with anything good good let's go in let us question number six and answer fast to get more points what is a partition key then it's a consecutive number applied to each new record it's a designated field in your table to partition data it's an optional table field for optional secondary partitioning it's the key to partitioning this reality from the next time is up and the right answer partition key is a designated field or fields in your table to partition data it is not a consecutive number applied to each new record distributed databases cannot afford consecutive numbers then each next insert will require agree for the cluster on what's the number is consecutive and then it will take in a couple of hours for a huge cluster right so no it's a designated field to your table partition your data so who made a mistake and who was that oh my God okay so first of all welcome adefemium uh then uh Ravi makes a mistake and tabiso makes a mistake that's quite surprisingly gives chance to vote God who was also fastest this time despite that actually only 59 points difference between third place and fourth place that means what tabiso will try to take his revenge over time to overtake World God again hey Kumar comrades and Ravi I'm sorry that happens uh yeah on our quizzes I know sorry for that so Kevin and surafa doing well and congrats for God uh congrats Kumar for joining the leaderboard top three and that is going to be question number seven so answer fast to get more points executing select query without the partition key recommended way to retrieve data right way if the data was inserted without a partition key it's a way to full cluster scan it's illegal and punishable by law like as the nosql police officer I have to say what phone answer number four is totally correct uh but yeah most of you made it good right if you don't give a partition key in your query then Therefore your cluster cannot calculate which server to ask and if you are going to ask if you have a hundreds of servers then we will have to go and ask each server if maybe it has your data it's like ordering a pizza without giving your full address just giving the house address but not giving the room number or that is kinda you know and it is as stupid as it sounds I don't know about you guys but then I ordered pizza I give a full address okay and uh so executing select query without a partition key is a very bad practice it's a way to full cluster scan don't do it better than that those two people who said it's illegal and punishable by loan I love you you are totally my people and it's not the right way if data was inserted without a partition key because you cannot insert data without specifying the partition key it will be out of token range and we will be no server to store it okay so what's going on on the leaderboard oh both Kevin and saraf made a mistake I see yes surround got excited and pushed the wrong button that's quite a plot twist but quite surprisingly those guys made a very good work before so they didn't uh so he still kept their places both Kevin and Surround but now there is a real competition because now the difference between first or three places four Thief plays a very very low difference everything can change with the last answer if a last question and congrats constant learner with the fastest answer very well done and Kevin Paulson uh congrats with your fourth place but we are not done so get ready because we are getting to that last question of the quiz ladies and gentlemen that's question number eight last question of this quiz in our Workshop is almost done so answer fast to get more points in the data modeling framework we start modeling with conceptual data model and application workflow the physical data model The Logical data model or we've copy paste from stack cover flow stake overflow is totally a great resource but can it help you with your data model for your application I would doubt that so great there are 10 answers and five answers are totally correct a V-Star data modeling with conceptual data model remember and its relationship diagram and things and application workflow so application workflow diagram those are important to us physical data model comes last after the optimization and logical data model comes second after conceptual data model and application workflow so you must be can't wait till the screenshot right let me tell you something winners will have their uh congratulations you finish it first second or third place please make a screenshot of the screen uh so we will be able to identify you because mentee is anonymous so you will be able to uh send us the screenshot don't forget to make the screenshot of the next screen and let me announce the winners five people made the right answers and Kevin saurav and vote God made the right answers what make them basically unbeatable Kevin was fastest again and we congratulate him with the first place that is a great result 6518 points that is an incredible result then Surat and vote God so Kumar congrats with your well-deserved first three places make a screenshots of the screen you will have to send them to me now uh if you are on the top three there is a very special congratulations with a price if you are on the leaderboard or if you are only visited the workshop but didn't join or with these you know what really matters is your knowledge is your skill after this Workshop you definitely will know more about how nosql databases are working about one of the most powerful of nosql databases that's for sure and as a result you can be a better engineer better developer do your job better and then in the end get better money that's quite a good price I would say a little bit more valuable than the spark we send today which is nice but not Aston Martin or Mercedes or Villa on the Mediterranean nothing like that sorry Kevin uh so thank you for joining thank you Ravi thank you Kumar thank you Kevin thank you everyone thank you isak and all our attendees it was totally great you joined us um quick survey to help us we would love your feedback because we are running workshops regularly uh what did you like the most what should we improve I will keep this window open so you can feel it even after a workshop but now let's go to the next final slides first okay that is a wrong uh Chris we nurse please contact me on LinkedIn by this link https uh https datastacks.io Alex that will be me and you will send your screenshot to me and if you have any questions about certification or Academy or other things ask me on LinkedIn now homework introduction to nosql databases uh this part uh very important homework link should be in the chat and it's also in the rep on work Link in the chat do it if you want to get your oh thank you you made it already yeah Night board thank you as well it's stupid to say thank you to bots but that's what I do all the time uh good now next thing join our Discord community at dtscs.io Discord you can ask questions about Cassandra and not only it is a great developers Community we discuss many different uh topics and we announce events there and so on and so forth subscribe make a like And subscribe on YouTube usually you ask to like your uh stream in the beginning when you have the most viewers uh but uh video in the end but still your likes are very valuable if you want to get next one subscribe our channel is pretty interesting um there are some Cassandra days with in-person trainings and in person talks from best of Cassandra experts around the world in Berlin one we did last week and they are coming for London Amsterdam Santa Clara Seattle Houston Hanoi Jakarta and Singapore like we are on the real uh Workshop spree or killing or Cassandra The Killing Spree like doing it all the time you see and four of them will be simultaneously on the same day replication factor for kinda so if you are nearby those places uh then please join if you have friends where then recommend them to attend I will be leading uh Cassandra days in London Amsterdam Hanoi Jakarta in Singapore is going to be a big big business trip and my friends will be running them in Santa Clara and Seattle and uh artem is in person will lead Cassandra dick Houston good so find out more and register at datastars.com events and thank you for attending that was a great workshop and thank you for all your questions thank you that so many warm words in the YouTube chat thank you everyone",
