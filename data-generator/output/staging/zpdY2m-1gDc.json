    "text": "[Music] hi my name is jonathan lacefield and i'm a member of data sax's product management team today we're going to review dse graph datastax enterprise graph is a real time secure highly available efficient scalable and analytics ready graph database system it is built using open source technologies such as apache tinker pop apache cassandra apache solar and apache spark that are fully integrated into a seamless graph database management system here you can see a simplified high level design of dse graph the front end is what an application or user of dsc graph interacts with it includes apache tinker pops data model which is a property graph and traversal language tinker pop gremlin as well as spark sql an extension of spark's data frame and a proprietary dse graph api the back end is comprised of apache cassandra apache solar and apache spark we essentially project a graph model onto datastax's core data engine the middle layer is a translation and integration layer it maps schema data and queries between the front end and the back end dse graph is an apache tinker pop enabled database apache tinker pop is a graph computing framework supported by dse graph and many other graph database systems apache tinker pop sets standards for structure the property graph and process the gremlin traversal a property graph is made up of three types of elements vertices which represents domain entities that is things edges that represent relationships between entities in between things and properties that represent attributes of entities and or relationships this slide illustrates a sample property graph on this graph you see the three types of property graph model elements we have vertices edges and the properties here the vertices are represented by the circles we see vertex types that is different types of vertices such as person movie genre and user you can also see the edges that represent the relationships between these vertex types that is we see a person acted in a movie so there's an actor edge a user rated a movie so we see the rated edge what's also interesting is we see self-referencing edges such as nose here we also see properties on both vertices and the edges for example the person vertex has properties such as person id and name while on our rated edge we see a property called rating which stores the value for a particular movie gremlin is a very powerful graph traversal language that can be used to express both oltp and olap processes this means you can write gremlin that touches a specific vertex and its direct neighbors in a graph and expect millisecond level responsiveness like other oltp databases and you can also write a gremlin traversal that traverses an entire graph or sub-graph with olap processing gremlin is very flexible gremlin can be very straightforward to use this example finds titles and years of movies released in 2010 or later with johnny depp as an actor this is a very efficient real-time traversal around a specific vertex representing johnny depp in addition to gremlin dse graph users also have the ability to use spark sql and other spark apis through dse graph frames this will be covered in a later section around graph analytics processing dse graph projects a property graph data model based on something called index free adjacency lists onto data stacks version of apache cassandra apache cassandra is the foundation of the entire datastax enterprise product provides dse graph with the always-on responsive and distributed capabilities that are familiar to dse users dsegraph leverages dse search based on apache solar as an integrated search and indexing engine most graph problems have a heavy search need because users need to find the spot in a graph to begin traversing dse graph uses dsc search for this purpose not to be left out dsc analytics provides dse graph with a great analytics processing engine graph data can be aggregated and analyzed through gremlin or one of the spark native apis dse analytics also provides mechanisms for users to pin graphs into memory for analytical processing purposes as mentioned previously dse graph projects a property graph model onto the integrated dse engine this magic happens in what we call the middle layer of dsc graph this is the proprietary glue layer of dse graph where we optimize the path for reads and writes in dse for graph workloads when we work with dse graph users we typically are working with one of these listed use cases some of the design patterns represented in these use cases can be applied to other domains like how a customer 360 systems design pattern can be applied to a product 360 or even a gdpr system there are a lot of natural graph problems in the world we've learned over the years that graph problems require more than just a graph database we work with users on a daily basis who are moving off of native graph database systems and onto dse graph because our users have realized that forcing a graph database onto a graph problem isn't always a best approach most graph problems need more than just a graph database they need search and analytics capabilities they need a system which is resilient and able to process hundreds of thousands or more writes per second they need a data management system that provides the right tool for the job this is dse graph a graph database that provides users with the flexibility to tackle large graph problems in real time",
