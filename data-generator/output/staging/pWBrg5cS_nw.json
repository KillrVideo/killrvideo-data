    "text": "hello everyone I'm Aaron from data stacks and today I'm going to take you through alerts and notifications with Mission Control let's go so the first thing I'm going to do is to sign in to Mission Control all right so I have my snakes and arrows cluster and I can see that it's all running okay um what I'm going to do is go down to this uh Bell down here which is the um alert button and if I click that um I get options for alert settings a new alert and then view current alerts well if I say view current alerts well there really aren't any I mean this is a test cluster nothing's going to break too much with it but I can like go to alerts and notifications here um and actually see a lot of the default alerts that uh that kind of come with uh Mission Control um so what I'm going to do is actually create a new one so let's say new alert so let's actually start down here it'll say free disk space below 5% all right and then for alert description I can say available disk space is lower than 5% on device and here I can inject the um you know know device name you know if if you have more than uh more than one drive or device available on your nodes of I'll say of node labels oh right that's got to be plural let me get that back there okay and then labels. host and then you can say boom all right um so for our alert expression uh remember that uh Mission Control leverages Prometheus so uh we can build our alert expression and conditions using the promql language so let's go ahead and just say Max um buy and then let's say host and device and then we'll say um host love the uh the auto complete here find system used ratio that's the one I want and we'll say as that's greater than 0.95 so if we've used more than 95% of our disc um I want to throw a critical alert because in Cassandra data Stacks Enterprise hcd that's really really bad you you want to make sure that you know about that all right so I will create that alert all right and you can see that our new critical alert of free dispas below 5% is indeed down here all right so now let's have a little bit of a look at notifications mission control um allows um integration with slack um and and here you know we we have a recipient setup for the the mission control team um then kind of a you know like a new recipient just to uh just kind of show how it works you know essentially you know if I wanted to say add recipient and we'll say you know this is going to be for the Cassandra support team and that's going to go to the you know pound Cassandra Das alerts Channel um so um you know how to oh I can I can notify every you know like um three like three times every hour you know I can customize that um the other thing that I can do is I can also say you know hey maybe maybe we want to add um you know the overall database team not just the Cassandra team so we'll say database team just so that they're aware and we can say pound database support um and for them you know maybe we only wna you know since since not all the database team cares cares what goes on you know with with Cassandra infrastructure so you know maybe we'll only notify them once every hour and uh and just kind of call it it that if you want to learn more about mission control and um alerts and notifications you can check out the mission control documentation uh where it has all kinds of information on the default alerts um how to modify and more of what you can do here um if you want to learn more about the about Prometheus and the uh the promql language um there's a whole bunch of documentation out here on the Prometheus site so I highly encourage you to check that out because that'll that'll help you build your own queries you know especially the uh the section they have here on query examples is uh is really useful all right and of course if you want to know and understand the metrics that are available um do check out the actual official Cassandra documentation uh because here you have a list of all of the metrics that are available that you can build your own custom alerts on for more information on Mission Control itself be sure to check out data.com products mission-control here you can find everything you need from documentation to downloads thank you and have a great day",
