because I don't want to end the broadcast by accident how about this I'm gonna stop sharing let me try to share again and let's see if that does anything thank you everybody for your patience let's see ah we can see now we fresh okay I guess oh hello in this indication a second to kind of like catch up so yay all right great I see I see Anna M and um appu w a lot of you popped up after that hello appu hello Prague hello Anna hello my Mish hello hello hello okay let's let's try that again because I'm I'm I don't think everyone is here in that very beginning so hello everyone um welcome welcome to our amazing live stream today um if you are here and you see us live please give a thumbs up or a hello in the chat wherever you are tuning in from good morning good evening and good afternoon yep Raymond the gang is all here um so we are going to be jumping in real quick let's go over this title really quickly crafting a cool language translation app with langlow so cool language translation app what is that how are we going to make it cool and Lang flow what is Lang flow what is that what what what can we do with these tools we're going to talk all about that today um my name is Melissa for those who don't know me I am a Deval engineer here at data Stacks um I love and have been really obsessing over gen content I I'm a self-proclaim tech and gen content junkie um and with me today is my amazing co-host with the very very most David Jones gelardi take by the way I got who's on chat yeah you know melroy if he knows melroy's comment the session generated by Ai and loading video message was the time it took to generate it that's very funny who knows maybe is maybe this is all right awesome well thank you Melissa I appreciate that that intro and similar to Melissa I'm also coder and a gen nerd um and developer relations engineer here at data saxs been coding a long time and and having fun uh especially in the a space so let's go ahead and get into some content um so overall what are we what are we going to tackle today right so first thing we're going to talk a little bit about the whole language translation thing and the why and the problem we're actually trying to solve um and then we're going to get into some of the tools you know Melissa mentioned langlow a minute ago um so you'll you'll learn about langlow if you don't know about it already what I can do for you and where it comes into place with this this language translation app and then we'll talk a little bit about stream IO and 11 Labs IO because both of those are kind of like major pieces of what helped make this work for me and then finally um we'll get into the app itself right Babble fish. a um and kind of have some fun with that oh by the way almost forgot we need to ask everybody so this is kind of a special what we're gonna ask now yes very important um do you you know obviously we're speaking English but that's not the um only language that folk speaks do any of you speak any other Lang languages um so put them in the chat let us know because what we're going to do is we are going to grab some of uh maybe the top ones or favorite ones I don't know but we're gonna grab some for the end and then we're gonna do something funny with this I mean how could we have a thing in a language translation app and then not talk to you in your own language so I'd like to see some languages starting to pop up Hindi perfect oh I love that one so yeah kind record some of these down Spanish Portuguese that's awesome Christian Danish Turkish German Swedish we have people from yeah all right so we're gonna keep those coming we're gonna do something fun with those later okay so you guys stick with us for that now the the you know if if you're not familiar with the babble fish um you know maybe thumbs up or whatever uh answer in the chat if anybody here is familiar with The Hitchhikers godge of the Galaxy um I am a Sci-Fi geek um I always I always have been ever since I was a kid and I I find the hitchers guide of the Galaxy is actually quite funny it's kind of like comedic sci-fi um oh I see Tamil and Hebrew and stuff like that that wonderful um Willam William that's a funny one oh which one what what was it python Ruby [Laughter] cotlin so so hit Checker's guide of the Galaxy is this kind of like comedic sci-fi and uh you know they have lots of you know various kind of like tongue and- cheek jokes in that kind of deal um one of them being my favorite of all time which is the answers of the universe is 42 and if you don't know what this means then by all means please um please go take a look at either the movie or or the book or something and that'll total sense but in there in the hihiker Guide to the Galaxy there is this there is this being this creature called the babble fish now if you think about you look at all these sci-fi kind of uh you know uh group you know shows out there and stuff like that um you know Star Wars and Star Trek and you know pretty much anything you can think of and it's kind of a Sci-Fi Trope that at some point there's this concept of a universal translator that everyone can just understand everybody else regardless of what planet they're from or anything like that so the way that hitchhiker guy of the Galaxy kind of tackles this is with this Babble fish and it is like this leech like creature that goes in your ear they like just put it in your ear it goes up in your brain it listens it can like hear and pick up on all of like the uh brain waves from the other you know uh uh creatures or you know beings around you and then it excretes out the translation in your own language right um and so the goal of this what I was actually after as I've always thought this was just such a a cool idea right could we actually create something like that and could I do it as a single Dev right um not having you know there there's already tools out there today like Google translate there's even there's even actually an earbud that you can buy that does like translation and such like that um they're not you know what's interesting though is that there there are definite limitations they're not all very real time and seamless and that kind of deal right and so like what I was after was okay as a single Dev is somebody doing this as a team how like how doable would this be with generative AI could we use generative AI to create a babble fish like app and then what you know what are the cches how well does this work things like that so with that um I got coding and that brings us into our our setup here okay so here's what I want to do oh yeah I by the way I see some folks with the 42 in the chat there so that's wonderful I know some some folks get that joke okay so the first thing did on is I mentioned that there was this tool Lang flow so let's step back for a second and kind of look at the problem space so I needed some way that I could um essentially translate any language into any other language and that's great we can do this like in a no code way but I also wanted to wrap an application around this because I wanted to make it more functional and put an app on it so I needed a tool um that would be able to both handle doing language transl with llms hence gen workflow and then something that had some ability for me to you know use an API or something um to to wrap an app around it um so that's where L flow comes into play so if you're not familiar with L Flow by the way um matter of fact you see that little link that just popped up down there at the bottom learn more about L flow L flow is a free open source tool that allows you to visually build gen workflows right and so if you're wondering what that just meant we're going to go through it here in in just a moment um one thing I do want to point out is that in L flow um whether you're using it um on hugging face or if you install it yourself or you know if you're using it in our in our service Astro or something like that if you don't have a flow already and you say this new project you have all these templates right um and these templates will kind of very quickly get you started on actually building like a full gen workflow in a no code way um this Babble fish one is really just a kind of bigger extension um of the the regular chap but it it does a b a bunch more um on the left hand side you'll see that there's all these like components and things so again allows you to visually construct together a gen workflow and this by the way is built on Lang chain so for those of you who might be familiar with Lang chain if you're not no big deal um but underneath the hood it's actually built on that so you might recognize some of the um structure yeah Sean this will be recorded and shared with you but if you are having connection issues go ahead and just re refresh your or reload your um browser tab that might help clear that up okay so when you're building a gen workflow you need at at a minimum an input and an output right you have some way that you want to send some kind of information into whatever that workflow is going to be and then some way you can get that information out and so you'll see here the first two things the first two types of components you have in link flow are both inputs and outputs um and all you do is when you want to use one OHA that's funny when you want to use one you just drag it over into the the interface here now I've already got some that I've created so what I'm going to do is bring these up I'm going to zoom in on some of these and we're going to take a look at them real quick so like I mentioned the first thing I need is some kind of input right so this is the text this chat input this is the text that I'm going to start with I'm going to say take me to your leader right um and I want to translate this text into some language now you'll notice here I have this other text input now I can make this whatever I want it could be German it could be whatever it doesn't really matter right but I'm going to start with I'm going to keep it French for now okay and this is essentially going to modify this is going to say okay well I'm going to take whatever text I have here in my input I'm going to pass it into a prompt now if you're not familiar with prompts like prompt templates when you're working with an llm a large language model like let's say it's chat gbt or mistal or anthropic or something like that and you're in their console you know you can just start talking to them but you can also prompt them right and prompts are really just instructions you're telling it this is what I want you to do so my goal here at this point was to figure out whether or not I could create a basic language translation app just with generative AI right can I do that just with generative Ai and that's what I was after so if you notice a couple things here um you'll see I have this instruction you know translate the following text into language now notice this curly brace language right so a feature in Lang flow is if you put curly braces around let me not slam into my mic like that if you put curly braces um around um a variable name like that it will expose it here as an input so you can see now I can take this modification I'm saying Hey I want my language to be French or German or whatever it is and then when I actually go ahead and I create the prompt you'll see this this here when it's rendered in it'll say translate the following text into French right right so it's a way that I can then very quickly and easily programmatically start kind of setting some of these values and then of course I have the the user yeah go ahead MSA yeah yeah no I was going to point out how you're saying David oh you went into this with the intention of building something building this translation app with solely generative AI can you kind of explain what the other like the the 180 would be from not having generative a well yeah that's actually that's really great question um so if if I didn't use gener to AI then I would probably have to research and find libraries that can do language translation now some of those things do exist right um but it it it starts getting a a little hairy right um because there are all sorts of things you have to take into consideration things like idioms things like um you know how um are you using like kind of like looser more informal text or like dictionary like formal speech or whatever things like that and this is actually why I decided to kind of take this route because I was like you know something in my experience so far with llms they might actually be really good at this there's also um providers out there like mistl who like that's one of the things that they're like like zering in on is language translation and and stuff like that right um so yeah so there there are some other capabilities and packages and stuff you could go about it but again I am a team of one um and I wanted to see what if I could do this with generative Ai and I want to see like what kind of effort would this take awesome awesome and that's pretty much what you were explaining there with the prompt how you can basically tell it like if if you go back into that prompt there how you're saying to consider these idioms and to consider casual speech and you the the llm can take this in and understand um your the instructions that you're giving it and then give you the the output that you're looking for yes that's the idea right yeah that's exactly the idea and you can see you know all these curly BRAC languages you know wherever you see that and then we have user input over here in every one of those places then it will inject the value the input value like what you see here and by the way Hugh yes I saw your comment yes thank you for the suggestion I see Hugh noticed Thea Zoom so then so then what we can do here is now we we have this prompt right now I can just feed this I can take the result of my prompt right I can then feed that into an llm like I'm doing here right so in this case you know I'll get to why you see grock with the Llama AP instant model here in a moment but you know langlow is model agnostic it doesn't care right it even has support for or llama so you can use local models as well and what this was super cool for is when I was iterating through this and kind of experimenting it allowed me and I'm GNA I'll show this to you but it allowed me to like iterate through different providers and models like very quickly because one thing I I've definitely kind of learned going through this process is that for one the various providers like anthropic compared to say chat jpt The Prompt templates are different right they don't have to be exact they don't it's not like you you have some prescriptive thing like if you don't use the template from E anthropic it won't work at all but they definitely have their own idiosyncrasies and it matters right um so the way that you create your prompt and everything like that the way you speak to it the model you use those types of things matter so L flow allows you that flexibility to kind of iterate through and then the last thing is once I have then passed that prompt into my llm then I get some kind of output right so if I go if I go ahead and play this real quick I build that I should say actually then what I'm doing is I'm saying this I'm saying I want to take me to your leader convert it into French pass it into this prompt we talked about go to our llm and give me an output so if I take a look at the message here you're going to see anybody speak French you'll see here that we have this French right so it converts this um now Leng flow has this concept of a playground so I can go in here and I can go to the playground and I can actually do this here let's see I saw um let's see I saw German earlier um and if I do the same thing I'll say take me to your leader now you're gonna see some extra stuff come out I'm focused just on the language translation part at the moment but you'll see now Christian said it's correct oh nice thank you Christian um you know but you see now that this is in German right and so what's super super cool about this is from like an application standpoint or like even before I started coding I was able to come in here and to start iterating through and kind of you know seeing what prompts make sense how can I get you know how can I massage the results and stuff to get what I'm what I'm looking for now I will point out that that is just one part of this particular flow uh if you notice if I back out there's a little bit more going on here but I'm going to gloss over that for now we will come back to that and then uh we're going to do some fun things but this right here in this no code way was the basic starting point right and here I'll do one more why not let's see uh what language should I pick this time it doesn't matter we're gonna do this a bunch of times do Hindi I saw it I saw it I saw it yeah do Hindi do H I'm gonna do take me to your leader again why not I just type it I can type take me to your Your Leader I love that okay we'll see how this goes now I have no ability to read that so Apu I'm G to rely on you to tell me if that's anywhere close um but yeah so so oh you can actually go one further this is funny um Californian Surfer so I love this one yeah this is one that I thought was super funny um because from the llm perspective it doesn't care right correct Sayre that's awesome yeah so I love this one take me to the dude who's in charge bro right you know so so the LMS they definitely you know they they they really don't care you can you can actually have a lot of fun with it and everything all right cool so so great so we have our initial flow now this was part one this was I wanted to prove out could I actually do language translation with an llm and it looks like I can right but then the next part of this is like I said I wanted to build an app around this flow right um and and be able to then you know be able to interact with some application because the end of the day I wanted you know I wanted an app that would actually just do these language translations that make it super easy so if you notice down here on the bottom right um there's this API right so um so langlow offers an a you can actually treat it a couple different ways you can treat it like an API server um that is what I'm doing here in this particular case and I'll explain some of the pros and cons um you can also just export um the whole of this flow as a Json blob um and then if you're a python user if you're doing it in Python you can just import it directly into your Python and you don't need to use langlow as an API server but in this case especially for development I found that to be super useful um but the the important thing here is does it have the capability for me to modify the inputs and the outputs right because I want to be able to programmatically control this like it's not going to be very useful right this is a great this is great to be able to get in the ground and play with but if I want it to be useful from an application standpoint I need to be able to change this chat input I need to be able to change the language I need to able to do that on the Fly and then I need to be able to read what comes out of the the end payload right um so this API allows for that now you'll see a set of options here uh we have curl right this is you can just pop this right into your terminal um I'm using the python API in this case and and something I want to point out this is generated code that is relevant to the context of the flow you're looking at so if you notice right here notice the space API URL and the flow ID that flow ID right that is the flow ID that I'm looking at so it's generating this code based off of your particular flow right and that's the same thing like all these components and things like that with these like uniquely generated names and stuff these are all the components that I have in my particular flow um so I could literally grab this code you'll see this little copy widget over here I could just copy this pop this into a python script and go right um and this will pretty much work and it will use wherever you have this deployed um as its its API server uh there is an option to do this with JavaScript as well right um you know and honestly you can actually just use it like that you see right here this guy you can just treat this as you know an an an endpoint you know here's your API endpoint it doesn't matter what language you're in so you're not limited to python or JavaScript it's just that we happen to have um explicit apis for for those two okay let's see and by the way I'm just checking to see if there's any questions or anything like that how we doing there Melissa sorry I was muted um nothing no questions right now but wanted to open the floor really quickly right there if there anything that you that um anyone is confused about or want some clarification on please feel free to leave your questions okay but I I I did have um a a comment I guess about Lang flow and just wanted to reiterate your um the the the idea that you were speaking about earlier is that you know you came in with an idea of a flow and you were mentioning that in generative AI there's an input and then there's an output and whatever goes in between is all the magic of gen right so yeah yeah yeah that that's awesome how you're able to do that visually here in in um in lenf flow and have that process but you know that can only go so far of being stuck in this playground UI as well so yes just wanted to hone in to all the viewers watching is that this is really power ful the fact that you can click that API button on the bottom and then now I can bring in this capability that I just built within linkflow and then embed it into an existing code that I want so that I can deploy it now into an actual application or make any tweaks that I wanted to um programmatically which is what David was explaining there with the um with the with what if you want to change things and that's obviously going to make it a lot more powerful so AB just wanted to H in on that all right got you yeah is by the way some questions here actually um I'm seeing them go for it yeah okay so Sean was saying oh struggle to started with llow what's the best way to troubleshoot issues or get help Sean we have a lang flow Discord that's open yes um and a lot of our team our team the Len flow team we work really closely together um so there's a community growing there so please uh join that Discord as well um I think it's present on the link flow website but we can also share that um as a resource following yes it is on if you go to low.or I believe the discord's up in the top right yep right there so if you just click that if you're not already there you should be able to go to the uh Discord there you go um Benchmark DSS says that's amazing makes it agnostic for any llm extracting the python code yep yep and um you know aside from that too to to the point of any llm um David was just showing how easy it was to kind of go through that component section on the left side and and essentially choose what llm that you want to use and iterate through different versions of the outputs and then once you've kind of felt satisfied with what output that you're getting within the llow um UI um or output within linkflow then you can then bring that into your code and then do more with it there yeah and Morton to your question about Lang Flow versus flow wise I think that's actually a great question for the Discord Channel honestly um you know because matter of fact there's somebody I'm going to point you to misba um misba is on that Discord um he is actually quite familiar with flow wise and he would be a very good person to reach out to um on on Discord um specifically to ask that question um and by the way uh I see voyex question can this workflow be coupled with zapier for any good reason you know something I I didn't really point out here is that langlow like all of this under the hood right it's all python right so for you python devs out there um even if you're not a python Dev honestly um but it's all python under the hood and you can customize these components and we do in fact have something called custom components there's even a a component called custom component that's like a boilerplate uh one for you but you can make whatever component you want um as far as your comment with like zapier I believe we actually have some zapier components in the works like right now but it almost doesn't matter like originally when I built this and I'm actually going to pop over here for a second to babble fish itself originally when I built this um one of my goals was to generate voice with my voice in any other language um and I do that with 11 Labs that's where 11 Labs comes into this and we will get to that part of it I had originally built a custom component for the 11 Labs uh API directly in langlow but it was pointed out to me that if I was ever going to deploy this that I needed to have the the sound portion coming through the browser on the front end because everything I did at originally was in Python right uh so I actually I eventually moved 11 labs to the front end um and you'll see that uh but I it it took me no time at all to actually create an 11 Labs component so you can really create custom components um pretty much for for any library or package there is a llow store though it's a community store where people are always uh putting up their own components and everything and there's all sorts of variations there's there's a jira one uh there's a Discord one there's a notion one so pretty much anything you can you can think of you could probably create a custom component for okay so here's what I want to do so we talked a little bit about um the initial flow here so we we've got this initial flow this initial language translation flow and we have an API that allows us to wrap an application around it now what I really want to point out about this API real quick is this if I go to the python APA which is what I'm using I scroll down a little bit you'll see this run flow function right and message so if I modify message right that is this value here that's this input okay and then if I want to modif the language programmatically then what I'm going to do is something called a tweak so you'll notice that I have references to um all of the various components here but let's say that I want to learn well how do I modify this programmatically right well what I'm going to do is I'm going to find my language component and by the way notice that notice how there's a generated name and then a given name like I gave it the name language I actually that is a that is something as a takeaway that even my outputs I give them names the reason why is because those names are consistent it's much easier to understand those names than it is looking at something like you know uh my bad uh looking at something like text input there we go ufu C6 right so it's definitely I would say it's kind of like a good practice to do that but if I came in here and let's say that I said Hindi okay and I put this here and I come back you'll see the tweak right there so this is telling me in code how do I make that change right and this is going to become important here in a moment that's what I'm going to show you next okay all right so here is Babble fish right so this is the uh the babble Fish app itself um right now I am set to translate English I can choose now I you know just to make it so the list wasn't crazy I just put in other in here you can put whatever you want so this is the equivalent so if I say like put in French for example I am doing the same thing as I am setting this guy right so I'm just tweaking the value is what I'm doing and then I can of course again do take me to your leader right and then you'll see this hit there it goes and then here you go you can see the French here of take me to your leader right um so this is essentially doing the same thing that we did in our app or in our in our flow but now it's just doing it in the app and just got to bring this together a little bit now I'm going to show you some code don't worry about trying to understand all the code that's not really the point um but what I do want you to see real quick is yeah this so notice right here so what I did is this code is pretty much just me implementing the python API I'm just taking this code here and I've just put it in its own llow Runner class I'm an old Java developer I cannot help doing things in an objectoriented class structure that's totally beside the point but um so I've just taken that and I've implemented it so it's the same thing this run flow right and then what happens is here's what I want you to notice right here you see this tweak right there text input ufu C6 language to speak so when I am in here in streamlet here this is actually streamlet when I'm changing this dropdown that is then modifying my language of speak variable which is then modifying The Tweak right so this is the tie-in this is how I'm then tweaking the values of what you're seeing here in this flow to make this whatever it is I I pull in for my app right and then if you look down here you see I have this run flow and the message so the message is just going to be what did I type right so at its like most basic level I can just take this code find out where my tweaks are even if I have any I may not have any copy it pop it over and now I can start modifying things programmatically and then you'll yeah you'll see some extra things going on let's um let's do this all right let me do another one real quick just Japanese is super fun I don't know if we have anybody here who can uh speak Japanese yeah any any Japanese speakers in the chat let us know now okay so this is just now the start oh go ahead go ahead Melissa oh I was just goingon to say it's really cool how even with Hindi it was a it's able to transcribe these characters as well the LM is super powerful in that way that's awesome that's that's it right there right like I found that the um the ability of the llms again I I was a developer of one here trying to do this right I don't have the resources you know of having like the the whole Google translate team or something like that right um and I found the LMS to be super super powerful and effective in doing this right um but let's let's take this one I want to talk a little bit about now let's see um let's see uh what else can we say now something something about the LMS that's actually kind of interesting and something about doing language translation as it is right let's see can I oh that one actually did an exact translation um that let's see that one did an exact translation what I wanted to do let's see if we can get a A variation okay this is so funny so this is like one of it's being awfully consistent right now but as I was going through um as I was going through my process what I noticed was depending on the llm that I used um some of them were looser with the instructions than others right and so this comes into like a really cool feature so I mentioned earlier that I was purposely using langlow in this case as an API server that I'm just I'm literally using this This Server up here live right as we're doing this so one of the really cool Fe what I can do here is let's say I want anthropic let's say I want to experiment right I can come in here and I can go okay let's go ahead and take grock llama AP out and a wire up anthropic okay so I can just do this visually now I do need you know I'm going to pick a model in this case CLA 35 sound work great now notice this API key and you're going to see these um values here um all these are are globals right so L flow has this feature that I can come in here and I can you know name something I can store credential values or just generic values and I can save that and when I do that these values are then available to all of my components all of my flows it's a really nice convenience feature um so that's I just wanted to you know call out that's where that's coming from so I had to go to anthropic and get a key just like I have to go to Gro and get a key and so on and so forth but now I can just wire it up I can just go right now I have a new model in the world right so it immediately it oh yeah yeah so this is the one I have the California Surfer in this one right yeah seeing the variations and outputs between different llms that's it's really cool yeah yeah now I can come in here and I can test out these variations um and now I'm just using a different model right now this you know my example here it's funny because like I said I've done this for a while and usually the Llama AP gives me more variations uh but this time it's actually being super consistent and I found that anthropic was actually a lot better at being very consistent with the translations and everything like that okay great so I just wanted to point that out that this allows me to kind of you know have lots of variations I can I can come in here and I can iterate um one of the things I actually did in the very beginning is instead of wiring up a different flow like this I actually had a set of different models and then I had them all going to their own outputs so I could do everything in parallel I could over the playground and then I could I could test it out I could see which ones were more accurate which ones were faster things like that um so it allowed me to iterate it allowed me to iterate pretty fast okay so now coming back over uh to babble fish here so great we're doing this with text right so I think at this point we've we've answered can we do the langu language translation with an llm can we do it with text yes but the big one was audio right and this is now where 11 Labs comes into play so um by the way if I didn't mention this about streamlet we haven't gotten into the streamlet part yet um both you know I built this in Python my focus was on the Python and the Gen parts and you know if you're coming in and maybe if you're not a JavaScript developer or somebody who's not on the front end um you know python isn't known for its very flashy front ends streamlet is a super cool uh tool stream.io um that allows you to like really quickly whip up like very usable and workable fronts so I'm using I am using streamlet here as a matter of fact I think it was this one yeah I think I used this as a base so here they already had a nice little template that I could use to create um and then what's cool about streamlet is if I pop over here you'll see all these components that we have right and if I scroll up a little bit all I have to do you'll see something like this like with st sidebar this streamlet by the way if you look at my imports you'll see streamlet is alist is St and so you'll see with st sidebar so any anything now notice you don't really see in HTML or JavaScript right but I'm able to wire up this front end pretty quickly uh so like the caption right a streamlet translation chat power bying flow and that's this guy right up here right so it's got this kind of like nice linear flow it allows me to very quickly kind of get like drop downs and uh do all sorts you can do like you know session variables all that kind of thing all right so let's have some fun then with the voice all right so the other part then is I wanted to be able to do this it's one thing to do a text translation I think that's actually super cool I can pick whatever language I can translate into another language and I can go back and forth and such like that but what happens if I wanted to speak right I think Christian is a French speaker let's go ahead and pick French and then if we say uh hello everyone in the the live stream today oh I need to share my tab hold on you're not going to hear that let me fix this real quick please hold we've learned this little let me share this again here we go Christian's still here so he can he can tell us if this is pretty accurate okay here let me get that make sure that's the right thing here let me sorry there it goes that's what I need aha here we go you should see the right thing now awesome and Christian's listening now so you're listening all right good let's see right I don't think I heard that one David I didn't hear it either that's super funny this gonna be you know I sacrificed lots of things to uh to the uh demo Gods today see what's going on here please be on our side all right how about that one Christian and and keep listening of that voice let us know if that voice sounds familiar as well should we do should we do another one should yeah oh Hugh H speaks should we do another one okay oh Japanese all right we'll do Japanese why not and I'll do this again this is going to be a good one Christian said par that's great we'll have to see we'll have to see if the Japanese one goes and Henrik I'll do a Swedish one is it just Swedish I guess we'll find out I'll say Swedish and see what happens here I not done Swedish before so this will be fun I always like the new ones hey live streaming at all all right so while we're waiting for folks to kind of let us know how that's going what's super cool about this you may have recognized the voice right or maybe maybe you recognize the voice maybe you didn't I'm not sure um but that is actually um oh that's great Christian thank you um so for the voice that is 11 Labs so if you're not familiar with 11 Labs it's they do AI generative voices and there are tons of options here um I was already using 11 labs and but the feature that I was really after was the fact that you can you can trade in on your own voice it only needs like five minutes of your own voice we also did Melissa as well um cool thank you Henrik yeah thank you I I see those coming in so like we're in 11 Labs I'm actually super impressed with them by the way their API was super straightforward right so it actually took me less effort to high in the voice and get that going um than it did to uh do any of the audio portions honestly the audio portions were a bit a bit tricky okay so Melissa how about this I'm I'm checking time and things like that seems like that's going well why don't I stop sharing and let's go ahead and see what happens when you speak to me and so so for all you who don't know Melissa speaks to goag right and so we've been having some fun seeing whether or not we could speak to each other so she's going to say some stuff to me in talag and then I will say some stuff back to her and or she's going to speak in talag and speak to me in English and then I'll see some stuff back to her in English but back to her in talik let's see how this goes right right because I I think one thing that that David was didn't get to yet for showing is that not only can you just type a uh what you are looking to translate but you can actually speak into it and also get that back so it can also uh take your actual voice as audio input and then translate that back and hopefully sound it in my voice so let's try this here if I want to translate to English and then speak in talog or Filipino um and I'll do any disclaimers if any Filipinos are watching that my talog is conversational at best so I just wanted to let you all know before anyone says anything I don't know your tal sounds great to me oh thank you thank you I'm I'm more of my dialect so my Thal is is is okay so anyway let's try this I'm G to start this how are you all doing nice and you see how it picked up the talik right like it I I'll stop that real quick oh did that stop the translation David yes it stopped it you'd have to do it again oh what are you doing well that was a new robot version of Melissa where are you going oh sorry I should stop doing that but anyway I just wanted to show a couple examples um in the in another language going into English because one thing that um we have or we've noticed when you're doing it with a um with an llm is that when we tried speaking in a different language the first time it didn't really get that you were speaking another language initially it was trying to tr transcribe it in English so it's really cool that um and David could probably expand a little bit more on this on how he did it but but you can tell the transcri the transcription um process in between this that to detect another language so it's able to get any other language and then translate that back into English and it's doing it really well um and another piece that I wanted to point out there and I'll do another translation here in a minute is that it's also um detecting any sentiment or uh idioms or casual tones that I might be saying in the other language and then putting that in a note underneath the translation as well um and I noticed this too David the comment for you is that this is great for people who might even be learning a new language um because there's a bunch of nuances with with um learning languages and the idioms and like we were talking about this with Korean how there's like casual informal formal tones that might be hard to grasp when you're maybe just reading about it but when you hear it said back to you and then have that like explanation under you how you've implemented is is a really cool tool and that's what makes this a cool translation app because it goes beyond just the you know here's what I want to say here's how you say it and that's it yeah yeah and actually a great that's a great seg way thank you Melissa for that let me um let me grab the share again yeah oh yeah yeah yeah oh sorry I I know we're kind of running a little on time so let me give it back to you here we go let me um so what I'll do is no Benchmark I have noted tried that yet so that's something to take a look at and by the way Melissa's voice doesn't have her generated voice doesn't have the same quality um specifically because we we literally just trained her voice like the other day um and thought that would be super cool where I sat down and actually trained mine properly we literally gave hers a video a promotional video yeah so I only had one tone to all the way through Benchmark that's a really good call out so there's Al there's so many ways in that um 11 Labs that you can sit down and you know I think you read certain texts to it right David um and and train it a bit better so maybe that's why we heard robot Melissa there yeah exactly so by the way so going to what Melissa was saying there real quick um and then we'll we'll wrap things up um so one of the things to her point that it came I came to realize right was exactly what she just said sometimes like I know I can speak a little French right I speaking of Spanish that a lot of times when I was translating um I could say um understand what was going on but let's say for a second um maybe there's an idiom like we're going to have to bite the bullet right does that translate right does there's some languages that may there's some that do they don't and so what it what kind of dawned on me was that it might be good to not only get the sentiment because what happens if you misunderstand like if I'm speaking to somebody who is from another culture and another language and I don't know the language well um I may need I may not identify if maybe they're angry maybe I'm on the phone and I don't see their body language or something like that or maybe I'm just missing the context and so um you'll see down here this note that she was talking about right so it's talking about like um you know bite the bullet and it'll talk about like the phrase that it gives like and why that it gave the translation it did and everything and to do that all we had to do was wire up so if I go to um the same here's the original flow right this is the original one I had but now you'll see coming off that same initial input that same text I have a language detect flow and a sentiment detect and these are just different prompts that are that are essentially saying Hey I want you to detect the language here or I want you to not only detect the sentiment but then here's the style I want you to use right and the llms are actually pretty darn good at this um and if you're also wondering why exactly did I use like four different llm providers here or different models right you can see I've got anthropic up here um with CLA 35 I've got um gr here I was actually using Gemma but I switch over to llama instant I've got open AI down here and if you're wondering why it's because I found that for different tasks different llms and different models were better or worse at them um and so as I started to kind of like go down and kind of narrow things out um that that started to really come through um and so that's where when you you see the um the detected language the sentiment and the note that's where all that is coming from right is that I have these extra these extra outputs and notice they're all named right so this all these guys if I do a full thing if I go to the playground you'll notice how every one of these gives me I get the language I get the sentiment I get the translation and I get the note and that's coming out to me in ajason Blob right that's coming out to me in this payload um yeah by the way Benchmark anthropic does do a really nice job I really like their their models honestly um and so if we were to take a look uh at there we go right here so you'll see that when I am executing against the API I have a method that I wrote called extract output message but instead of trying to iterate through um all of the various Json you know objects in that kind of deal what I do is essentially I just get the response the Json response that comes out from the API itself and then I just say hey use the com the component display name so remember I said over here that if I give these outputs I I'm giving them you know explicit names well now I can key off of those names right I can just say hey what's the comment display name and now that makes it like super easy for me to be able to pull out exactly what I need from the payload um and then this way as well if I'm in here making changes like let's pretend for a second that I I made some change and I needed to do something different the chat output and I did some custom this will now have a different ID right it's going to have a different ID if I was going off of this and I changed my flow in this way now I make get an error in my code because it's expecting something from the payload that it's not seeing but by using you know these explicit names like this then I can I can hone in directly in what I need and be consistent all righty all right so let's go ahead now I did see um we're we're kind of at the end of the uh voch did say something um really quick about the functionality um being able to automatically skip clicking the button start translating stop translating yeah yeah um we've talked about that a little bit yeah go ahead David yeah this is okay so it that's a funny observation um this was one thing so what I what I really didn't mention is underneath the Hood um streamlet has this ability to have custom components this is actually so when we're speaking into it or when we're doing that that voice translation that you hear right then I'm actually taking a bite stream right from the browser sending it over a websocket to the back end to the python code handling all the transcription and and getting the translated text out and then sending that back over to L laabs in the front end so it sounds like a lot and it kind of is but streamlet actually made that super easy and with stream components right it actually handles all the websockets and stuff for you um so this is where this comes in so what you're seeing down here is actually this this chunk um is a streamate component using um react mic uh and then the 11lb part is also using a streamlet component the reason why uh this is actually something I I want to improve I'm happy for any PR the reason why though you see um this kind of clunky I'll admit uh clunky interaction is because this is actually opening up the back end to the feed but then triggering I was having a challenge honestly of triggering correctly triggering the front end button in react um to kick right so so I you know and part of that was because of the stream Li thing I I was actually talking to Melissa about this earlier if I redid this I might just start with like a nextjs app and do it a little bit more traditionally in the way I would but I was focused on doing it with like python um and that might make that a little easier but that is something I I would love to uh resolve um okay so let's see so I did see somebody who wanted to say something in Russian so if you guys we're going to go ahead and tail it tail it off now we saw a bunch of cool languages in the beginning we've actually done a couple of them um were there any interesting on Melissa we should try before we uh before we sign off today so I saw I saw Punjabi I saw Punjabi okay yep yep and then the Russian uh accent they wanted to hear how good the Russian accent was all right let's do it let's do it and if you want feel free to give me some phrases that you think might be fun and tell me what language you want it in and we will see how well this goes now I heard Punjabi Punjabi is it Punjabi Punjabi like Punjabi I think yeah like that okay and thank you everyone for coming to the live stream today and thank you for all the fish let's see what happens here ajd live stream you're gonna have to tell me if that's anywhere close I I heard let's hear the Russian accent let's see put this Russian feel free um chat in the chat to give more uh phrases or languages that you might speak wherever you're tuning in from if you want to hear it um I mean that sounded legit I have no idea yeah that's right yeah yeah it sounds great to me but please tell us yeah appu to that point um there are uh parameters that you can tweak um when you are doing the sound generation from 11 Labs that you can try to slow it down and things like that there's all sorts of little knobs that you can tweak as a matter of fact the audio processing part of this was the hardest part of this app um you know all the rest of the stuff like everything we've talked about creating these flows wrapping the API doing the initial language translation was actually pretty pretty straightforward and easy it wasn't that hard handling the audio processing um the part that oh you can't see that the the part that sorry I did that to all of you I should have uh when it renders it resps the m so you got The Malt ones but yeah the audio processing part was actually the hardest thing um being able to filter out background noise properly being able to detect what is noise and what's a speech right and what's human speech not only that like being able to pick up when someone's speaking a language other than English all that was the hard part let's see but then to your point David about like all of those things being the hard part you got the AI stuff down what you wanted to put as an input and what you wanted to get out as an output that was easily I mean like you know Loosely using the word easily done um using Lan flow as a tool and then it gave you more time to focus on all of these other moving parts that surround the application and the whole experience so that's I thought that was really cool yep and to your point about the GitHub repo I saw that comment there Hugh here you go here's the GitHub repo or it didn't happen totally with you man um and voytech yeah I like I'm totally with you on the buttons right um this you know let's be be honest this is not something that I'm trying to publish commercially or anything it is to express an idea right um my take on it though is if feel free to go to the GitHub repo and if you want to fix that I'm happy for your PR um I very well may actually get to it myself but I'm I'm with you voytech that's not that wasn't one of my favorite Parts but yes there is the GitHub repo um this is actually real uh you know you can do whatever with it that you want um the flow that I used is also there in at repo you'll see the babble fish. a. Json so if you were to install uh Lane flow yourself all you have to do is upload that Json and you'll get the whole flow right um so have fun experimenting that and I know we're a little over time thank you everybody for uh sticking with us today and hopefully you got something out of that um with that Melissa I'll I'll hand it back over to you yeah no thank you again to everybody here who has tuned in I know we uh lost a few of you on the way but to the people who are interacting throughout the whole time thank you so much again um again it was it's been Melissa here as well as David and I hope that you got something out really cool out of this um feel free to continue tuning into to our future live streams and again thank you all so much um for watching we'll have some resources sent out to you right after this um for those who missed it or for those who missed some of the links so look out for that um but again thank you so much and have a great rest of your day bye everyone thank you everybody see you",
