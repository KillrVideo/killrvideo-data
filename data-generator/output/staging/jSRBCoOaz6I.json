  "description": "One of the most common use cases when dealing with Apache Cassandra™ are timeSeries. After introducing the concept of Time series in a few words Alice and Cedrick will analyze why Cassandra got so much traction and detail what we see at customers, what are the pitfalls and what are today’s challenges.\n\nAmanda: Welcome to this Episode of the DIstributed Datashow I am Cedrick and this is my coworker Cedrick -- all the way from Paris! This is our first DDS episode together! Hopefully, next time we film I will get to go to Paris!\n\nCedrick: Hi, i’m so glad to be here, BTW we are recording this episode from sunny Florida today. That’s awesome\n\nAmanda: I know today we wanted to discuss Time Series! Cedrick --with all his other duties as a Developer Advocate-- has also been working a lot with our customers on different time series applications. So maybe first could you remember what TimeSeries are ?\n\nCedrick: Sure. Simply put this a sequence of numerical data points, values in a successive order and this order is time. Most of natural phenomenon could be described in that way. Choose one source and measure the values over time.\nAmanda: I can think of use cases in today IT, logs, stocks, sensors, events, logs all those are time series. Ok but why Cassandra ?\n\nCedrick: Amanda, if you meet someone at an event who asked you about Apache Cassandra in 1 minute what would you say ? Personally I tell it is a distributed database that means multiple nodes. On each node 1TB of data, about 3K/tx/s/cpu. If you need more capacity add nodes, if you need more throughput add nodes. And here is think this is the key point not the data replication for resiliency. More throughput ? Tunable consistency can also help put some CL=ONE and you speed up.\n\nAmanda : Throughput is key, number of events increases exponentially, 5G will come. So with Cassandra with easy write the data at good pace. What about reading data then ? I would like to be able to graph, charts, aggregation, show trends, both co",

    "text": "welcome to this episode of the distributed data show I'm Amanda developer advocate here at data stacks and this is my coworker ceedric all the way from parents this is our first episode together and so happy that you're joining me yeah I'm stopping to be here I don't go freely down yet from data stacks this is the distributed data show so what we're here to talk about today is all about time series so ceedric along with many of his other duties have developer advocate one of the busiest developer advocate on our team he's been working with a lot with our customers with different time series use cases and applications so and so what's the pros a little bit about just what time series did we hear a lot about it but let's talk a little bit more about the real yeah sure so simply put time series is a sequence of events numerical data always the same phenomena that you we go perfect time okay that's it okay okay okay don't make me something like weather weather over time or sure weather since source anything related to you know natural phenomena okay when growing okay show swings okay okay so maybe has a time element it's a time series you do smoothly okay so so we know we don't know about what time series is but why would you use it with a magical favor oh that's a good question so when you're at the booth and some somebody come to you and ask about Itachi Kisame how do you explain that no super database in let's say one minute I do say okay patchy Cassandra is a distributed database will reach equal nodes data is distributing on the nodes that I also replicated simply put the dice distributing and on each note you can have one terabyte of data and something like 3,000 transactions per second and if you need more capacity or more for boots then you just add note and in time series what you really have is a lot of boots you get a lot of data coming from everywhere right and you have to be able to absorb this stream in real time and fast and customized we're not you shouldn't write fast data because you write that up first in memory and only then crush the darkness so focus on how 10,000 writes per second images no more and that makes a lot of sense when we're thinking about again so easy to think about IOT use things with sensors but there's gonna be many many rights for many many sensors the fact that Sandra has that amazing write throughput seems like the perfect fit while you're saying yes exactly IOT is one of the most common use case we in it right now of course IOT logging okay and of such great okay so we know about the Sandra and using it and you know the perfect view space for time series and we know about the right through foot and how amazing Sandra is at rights but we know that sometimes you have to do certain things if you want to have that good read performance as well it's all about data modeling right yeah well let's talk a little bit about data modelling for time series yeah sure um as all the use case if Cassandra everything is about that time we didn't right so you have to build your tables your data model based on your release and when you look at time series then which queries you can do right you would like to charge but you're so good like maybe to aggregate data for 1 minute 5 minute a day so we've got some hard first you have to create some tables and partition key based on the source of the data like that if you have meters and thoughts load will be distributed but at a point of time when you get too much good then going although that's a tweak to OneNote right just too much for the note right right and by its author exactly so you need to split your partition key we've some time element okay this is what we're getting oh okay and that way that that we start to flow all around the dresser there is no more key issues so you ask your data properly and evenly distribute you know meter still now what about really what about the slips right sir goons minutes well aggregations as well yes but are you gonna be able to do aggregations like the standard we know sometimes but those two words don't always really go together right now that election yeah yeah there is no magic here is when you need to insert that table then you will have me to retire tables on a tables for aggregation step okay and actually great strategy yeah when the data came you will write into its printable at the same time okay of course you can also that are the single tables and have some bad cheese like sparked you know or any tools that will aggregate on vacations that are for you but most of the time in just do so start writing new tables you know and seems like a good strategy you know eventually oh it's one query for my table yes those that don't have the same time to leave maybe other one second step you can keep the data for 30 days or maybe seven days it's fine just a graph in our series about day to day but now you have step 7 having your that down to speak you think about inflation control eyes that makes an awful like what you were saying about aggregations right you can aggravate your data maybe with something like a fatty spark then you can she saved up there it made it back into the theater auditory canal and you know some choose open source tools already filler words from Kazan are two bits ready to go tank service database nice cameras to be does okay so it's all about a gradient in itself we all know how to determine the name into tables and picture some units you aggregate per carry out of time and it does that for you but you see a greedy team right or you on top right make that okay so we talked about every agent then we have some good strategies around that that's great but again what I'm thinking about I'm series data and I'm thinking about IOT data I'm thinking the volume of data it's gonna be lots and lots of data so what are some strategies that you can do to kind of help with that especially when using Apache Cassandra yes sure for your mixing I already talked about the negative things you evenly distributed that up among the best are just to avoid y partitions or are kissing but still which time you will get a lot of data right so to be able to undo that kind of the top first idea would be to compress always accepted that on the same way that's two numerical unless you like but even when you know at the bone each time your use case which time series change for the for instance for the first 30 days then you would like to switch to analytics queries right right dimensional any season kind of things and now the good way to start with that I would be gonna want you okay and that's like some surprise product we are the spark right that can just break the data in movies to DCFS which is an implementation cover I CFS right stirring data a spark a fire okay H makes me sense to do some underneath them right absolutely so good practice is to keep maybe 30 days of data interesting enough that are to be able to perform your graph and right but other ponies that just move that could be them at that to coaster expedition right that makes sense do you have your plot data your cold data and you can do your aggregation work continuously on that cool data as well sure right and then move that in and also with your charts and graphs great well thank you see Rick I think we learned a lot about time story today and I'm really lucky with up those of you it was very nice thank you [Music]",
