  "description": "DataStax's Astra Assistants API, is a service that is API-compatible with OpenAI's new Assistants API. Users can point their AI apps to this new service by changing just a single line of code.\n\nTo try the Astra Assistants API, create your free Astra account by clicking on the link here: https://bit.ly/47eHcU3\n\nAnd follow along on how to start here: https://bit.ly/3ML1XPb\n\nAbout DataStax Developer:\nOn the DataStax Developers YouTube channel, you can find tutorials, workshops and much more to help you learn and stay updated with the latest information on Apache Cassandra©.

    "text": "hey folks like many of you last week I watched the open AI Dev days presentation uh and I was really impressed and interested uh with their new assistance API the assistance API supports things like and persistent threads persistent messages um automatic file chunking and embeddings and automatic retrieval augmenta generation and these are some things that well to require a bunch of efforts to do before last week uh so I was excited and I got the coding that night and gave it a try and I felt really productive when I was able to build an app the back end to an app in just a few minutes um so I think the team at open AI got a lot of things right with this API um and it's going to make a lot of developers very productive um and so I quickly found myself U actually building a server side implementation of the API um using our database astb which is powered by Cassandra um and also has a vector search implementation powered by J Vector also known as J Vector um and um yeah so this week we are announcing support for the open AI API as an ASV service where all the persistent parts of the API end up in your Cassandra database and you can access them like any other Cassandra table uh and then the bits that require an llm we forward over to open AI uh things like embeddings and chat completions um and then this allows us to do will allow us to do a lot of interesting things towards the future um so let me show you how you could do it if you want to point your AI application at our service um let's see so open AI has a cookbooks page where you know they teach folks how to use their apis and this specific one right here is an example for the new assistance API with the python SDK um and so what we did is we grabbed that notebook and we tweaked one line of code right so usually you create your open add client like this and we added a default header that has an astb token so that's that's the difference and then you can just leave your code as is and you're able to run it against the service and I'll try to do that now and so again so here seems like it created some it created an assistant and so that assistant gets purched to your database as a math tutor and then we can create a thread and so that thread also gets persisted to your database uh similarly with some messages and then when they create a run that actually that's the thing that calls the llm so the llm will get access to the that history of messages and give you a response uh when you pull here and so let's see them pull and get a response yeah and so you can just go through and you know follow follow any open AI tutorial um or just take your existing app and point it out at our service um a lot of things can be open a lot of interesting things can be done in the future like trying different approaches for rag in the back end uh maybe we'll open up support for different models whether they're llms or whether there yeah different models for edting or for chat completion um so it's pretty interesting stuff um so if you're building a new uh application AI application with open AI or if you've got one and you want to point it at a different service and feel free to give it a try and and we're still working on coverage and so you know here's a snapshot of all the different things that are supported by the API um if you look at some of the old um not non-persistent eal kind of API calls we just forwarded those out directly to open AI uh but the ones that actually require managing state gets get implemented in asra here uh and these exes over here are some of the ones that are missing so we've implemented 40 out of 57 points 70% so far um and we'll continue to do more um if you do hit something that's unimplemented you'll get a non-implemented exception and hopefully those will uh get smaller and smaller and go away completely when we finish reaching surface area here all right thanks for watching",
