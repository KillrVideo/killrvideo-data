    "text": "[Music] i'm going to show you how to use ip access list in astro ip access list will help you manage the different ip addresses that you want to give access to your database the first thing i want you to notice is that we have two databases test one and test two we are in the database test one in the cql console and we have access to that to run commands if you head over to settings you will see the ip access list and one of the first things you can do is restrict public access you'll see this message here notifying you that you are restricting all public access to your database this will temporarily make your database unusable until you add your ip address as you can see here in the cql console now we'll head back over to our ip access list here we can add in our ip address we'll click on add access add ip address as you can see here we can copy our current ip address in the description we'll put home ip and then click on add now as you can see our home ip address is enabled in the access list and we'll have access to astra and the cql console now we can head back over to the cql console and as you can see it's working perfectly next we're gonna check out additional features on how to add multiple ip addresses at one time so we're going to head back over to settings and we are going to delete our home ip for now we'll add it back in shortly click on add access and we're going to upload from a file we're going to select a json file and here we included three separate ip addresses click on open and you'll see the three addresses populated here three total and click on import and now you can see the addresses under managing endpoints and that all three are enabled if we head back over to the cql console you'll see that we still have access to it and finally i'm going to show you the last way to add ip addresses we're going to go back to settings and delete our current ip addresses and we're going to go back to add access and click on import from database and we are going to import from test2 which is our second database that i mentioned earlier as you can see we already have two ip addresses defined in test two click import and it will bring those over and they are enabled head over to the cql console and you'll see once again we have access i'm going to show you how to use the astra devops api in order to manage the ip access list in astra in order to do that you're going to need the application token from astra and pass it in a header in order to access the api additionally you are going to need to get a very specific url based on your request this request is get access list for a database and you can see the url here we can make these requests in postman postman is a great service that helps manage our requests as you can see i have all the requests for devops api access list here and here's our first request for git access list for a database i have the url that we got from the documentation and i inserted my database id here and i'm going to pass a header the key is authorization and the value is bearer and then the token value and now all i have to do is click send and as you can see this outputs some json and gives our address here here's the ip address a description and lets you know if it's enabled or not if you want to view that in the ui you can head over to your database you can see your endpoint here additionally you can run other requests that can add to delete update that access list so let's check out updating as you can see again we have a url this time it is a patch request if we head over to headers we can see we have our token and this time in the body we are going to pass some json and we are going to update the description of our database before it's at home ip as you can see in the ui and now it is going to say success so we're going to click send status is 200 so it was successful and if we go back to a kit access list you can see its home ip and we are going to send description now equals success let's check it in the ui description is success now you can see we have a variety of other requests that we can make and you can learn more about those in the documentation",
