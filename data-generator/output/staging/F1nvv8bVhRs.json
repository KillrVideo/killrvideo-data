  "title": "Migrate DynamoDB data to Astra DB with a Serverless Data Loader",
  "description": "Here’s how it works: \n* Register for Astra DB free plan using your github, google or email: \nhttps://astra.dev/3L1xTMM\n* Create a target database on Astra DB.\n* Navigate to the data loader page, but instead of loading a prebuilt dataset or uploading a file, provide the S3 bucket details for a DynamoDB export.\n* The instructions on the screen help you create, set permissions, and get the key / bucket information. There are also a couple of key / bucket combinations in github you can use for testing.\n* Walk through the upload screens to kick off the async job. \n* Wait for success (or error) in an email.\nEnjoy!  \n\nWe'd love your feedback, connect with us!\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\n\nAbout DataStax:\nDataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandra™.
