    "text": "okay and boom or on so anybody watching this video a yeah got us mid build there so but we're gonna get into the c-sharp repo here in just a minute yeah I was rebuilding the documentation site because I pushed some changes last week we've made a bunch of changes to how the killer video project works and so I realized that we hadn't actually updated all the docs to match what we had done so yeah okay so it is running the build so in a second here we'll actually be able to see updated documentation so it so I did just take a minute or two to start huh yeah it was like the same thing yeah I've noticed that with Travis - sometimes takes far longer than I would expect it to oh no the traumas picked up pretty fast it was actually that I hadn't I don't know how to say it I hadn't I hadn't done a push that worked in such a way that it was picked up by Travis okay so I did things in a different way I had actually created a separate branch mm-hmm but it doesn't look like I actually did it yeah I guess I just didn't really deliver it the way I thought I did it so anyway this build is running it's regenerating documentation that'll be updated we can go look at in a minute because I actually here I'll show you what it looks like right now okay so the doc site looks like this you can go into the docs and you can see the high-level architecture overview and see how it's got a CD and registrate ER and stuff built in here mm-hmm we've we've removed that in the recent versions I like so that lovely picture yeah as a cedric special that logo is to die for - yeah well that's good that's that was a little contribution from you I think yeah right no it's yeah I think you can compare and contrast like appear the friendly yeah video I think should-should absolutely like do compare and contrast and this is more of like keeping in the name of killer video which sort of sounds like a slasher flick yeah yeah that's good as well posted to the chat like link it looks like a finished building I wonder if how long it'll take to update that's a good question it will come back in a second it looks good it looks like the build finished so in any case well I want to see this I want to see this updated architecture diagram okay there's the old architecture diagram I think I have a new one here oh that's kind of an awful way to look at it isn't it roll with it there's no @cd here anymore everybody knows each other by well-known names like Webb and generator studio and back-end that works all right so that's how everybody locates each other so we're not we don't have a service discovery mechanism anymore except the thing is oh there we go updated all right the doc suite then I didn't break it the Java and Python and node implementations of the service layer Micra service tier mm-hmm those have all been updated to reflect the lack of at seediness is that a word that's seediness that's pretty good and now the C sharp is the only service the implementation of the service here that has not been updated yet to this so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna make those updates to kill a video C sharp forked from the original excellent repo that we created so like we're just going to get rolling with this cool so that didn't take very long that's good it's that it's down it's there um question number one for you yeah when you're working with a c-sharp project do you prefer Visual Studio or via scope as a chart of both ways when I was playing around with it yeah I didn't get very far before the stream I got to the point of loading up my project and I had a way easier time doing it in visual studio than envious code but this is not my comfort zone yeah Visual Studio is super powerful and very clearly built to do net stuff however I also haven't used Windows for a long long long time so I don't have access to visual studio I do use Visual Studio code a little bit to do c-sharp yeah especially if it's kind of more of a legacy dotnet version that I have to do a weird build for something like that but since I'm doing most of my dotnet dev on Linux or Mac these days mm-hmm I tend to use JetBrains writer because it gives me all of the autocomplete and intellisense refactorings refactor to class objects move to file all that type of functionality yeah that I like in Visual Studio but it gives it to me on any platform so I can use it on Mac or Linux so then all I got to do is install dotnet core and then run JetBrains writer and it takes care of most of that I will say though that the weird discrepancies between using the the CLI versus JetBrains writer versus visual studio to create projects they all create projects in slightly different ways depending on the versions which can be super frustrating they generally will open each other's projects like if it's up to date dot net to two or three oh stuff but being that it's slightly different makes it super frustrating if you have to if you have any like dependency conflicts or something like that the way it's written into one or the other types of dependency files can be frustrating so with all of that said I generally use JetBrains writer so let me I don't have that is that a licensed tool you do but you could get you can get it for 30 days for free yeah yeah so we may end up going down that road let me show you what I did with Visual Studio I got the Community Edition a visual student yeah so there's I keep forgetting that this exists for Mac okay partly because I don't think that's gonna work I have feelings about them naming it Visual Studio when it's really the old it's it's the IDE that existed before visual studio but they renamed it Visual Studio but it does nothing like Visual Studio on Windows okay so it thought that it had a project but then that didn't actually find the product so yeah this is this is part of the issue of net world how did it know because I actually deleted the directory that had the project file in it and now it thinks that it has a project I'm not sure about that um it should always have a master solution or master project that has all the projects in it so if it didn't have one most of these I des forced build one an attempt to like determine what was in the project based on the folder structures and stuff and the files in the folder structures okay this actually looks correct so this looks pretty much like what I was looking at last time so I hadn't made any code changes I was just at the point of trying to live at the project in that IDE so I come in here and I'm already seeing 39 update these on packages that looks fun and exciting we we could I'm so tall builds as is right says packages restored successfully mm-hmm and then doesn't know the updates if I press run you did do it it shouldn't do anything bad mmm think this allows me it's building yeah it's building so this is keep in mind killer video c-sharp last commit was on August 30 2018 that's right so we've been a little bit remiss in updating this yeah okay said I lost unity confidence between different versions of the same dependent assembly oh that's funny that the auto-generate binding redirects property to true in the project file that's a pretty good message although I'm not sure I know what it means well that's it's just a warning at this point it's a warning yeah oh okay the thing that's so I don't know why this is part of the build I know what causes this could not the cop could not copy the file dot env because it was not found' isn't it right there in the you know this is showing that it doesn't exist yeah but it's right oh yeah found that fact so the reason that it doesn't exist is well yes we can look at it here there's the readme where did the readme go oh it's probably is there like a show hidden files somewhere this is another thing that the editors often do from for for.net stuff is they'll hide files they don't know what to do with really why would I why would I want to hide my that's a good question yeah writer does that to it like I have to show all the hidden files to actually see everything hmm [Music] any friends out there that have insights okay so here I'm just gonna that's right it's the getting started page aha didn't tell you you go to you okay yeah I forgot about that okay so Mike reservist is box getting started with okay there you go so you have to run this set up docker file which does a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that a docker vo yeah ah so it there this script the these are part of the instructions that we're actually going to be redoing as part of this but to run the c-sharp version it says clone the repo then runs set up doctor enough that that creates an and B file with some environment variables we're actually going to be getting rid of most of those fireman burials but I'm enough to figure out the build these buildings start to change them so that they're not dependent on this dot me and v5 right so now it exists and now it might actually run you might this button again instead actually runs all right I guess it's running cool so it just starts up that what is it like four or five containers yeah so what I didn't actually do is yeah that's right what I'm supposed to do here is I can't this is still right so this is not gonna do anything yet I guess I'll stop this if so have nothing running in docker right now pulling a DSE image wonder what version of DSC this is running off of this is probably pretty old stuff yeah I would imagine okay so here's the yeah Mille it's um yeah starting older versions of all the infrastructure of web generator studio oh my goodness that's right okay so it's actually broken into compose files so the other one isn't live it's just showing some of the ways that we used to set things up that are now kind of antiquated and not very usable and we actually had our docker compose configuration broken across two files which isn't necessarily bad but it's not intuitive where the other pieces buried way down in the subdirectory okay so it's running DSC six dot oh so that's the image that it was taking forever to pull so I'm gonna run docker composed of SD I don't bring up all the surrounding pieces of the environment thank the TV this is all good for structure that's a new register registrate err to perform our service discovery or service registry functionality i'm DSE node studio generator DAC config that loads the schema and the web application so those are all of them running so now if I come in and run this thing if this thing has been left in a working state then it should all just run and connect up so let's see it is connecting to that Cee and then after DC is finished running finished starting up then the configuration container will find it lo topa schema and then attempt four of six Wow I think site manager Baroque so the idea of what we need to update our the packages and then change it to the new deployment style will that leave most of these script files in place well that's part of what I want to get rid of as well okay so let's see is this das you know it up and running yet cuz that that should inherently fix some problems that I just noted which is the create environment won't run on Linux on newer versions of Debian and abouttwo because it doesn't have if config and it uses if config rewind I guess addresses and such oh my goodness yes so there's gonna be some stuff that well what I may want to do is just like go in here and tag with some to use even just as a outlining what the work is yeah as we kind of notice though some things so you rerun this guy yeah it seems like Jesus leash it's still well maybe not it looks like it just finished creating the let's look at the DST configuration oh no it's insured the graph is created that looks like yeah doesn't even look like it's connecting properly so it exited reading note addresses from got CD cannot cannot connection to DSE after six attempts exiting just out of curiosity I'm not gonna dive too far down this hole but good so we do have other services we've hard-coded in the previous configuration we were actually hard coding to use this 10.0 that's 75-dollar one as the IP address range of the deployed services so a few there's more about me and me see this oh yeah killer video host IP and dr. pious at this and then that's what everything is being advertised on so to zero that's 25 that one you look in here killer kids to the video services huh do you see server 81 82 sounds like a rock song from the rush DC server 81 82 yeah yeah right or a van Halen yeah I'm like this is server 90 42 that's funny I wonder if that's actually what the I bet it's not finding it an entry a net CD because that doesn't sound like the right name of the resource hmm so I'm trying to figure out my thought was I would just try to get it running as is but it didn't actually seem to run as is yeah he's not a I was expecting interesting anyone SERP do you see server anyway okay I'm just gonna go down see what's here all right yeah so there is an actual IP address listed here Allu you know we want 90 42 because that's the actual Cassandra port yeah that says yeah so this says that there's a Cassandra server that you could find it 10.0 that 70.5 got one Dutch or port 90 42 I can't really see from here is it say what it's looking for reading nodes yeah let's look up sir at CDs service discovery where is it service name so I think the configuration BSC bootstrap data sex enterprise service discovery config' keys at sidi cassandra key okay yep so yeah there is some weird configuration thing in here where it's my thought so this the c-sharp services are trying to look up a service named Cassandra in @cd and there is something else entirely being registered so like there is no Cassandra is not I don't think being registered in here wait maybe it is hey maybe I'm wrong okay so oh look no it should be finding something so I wonder why it isn't it actually is it should be finding that IP address and connecting to I'm not sure why it's not working but I guess this is all code that we're gonna rewrite it anyway yeah that makes sense Oh weird so I'm just opening the code project with you that brains writer and looking at individual studio code right now and yeah JetBrains writer has to open it based on the solution file okay that's located in the source directory which makes it kind of odd for a c-sharp project oh really yeah I know I see why we did it because we had it like it's just mapped similar to like the Java and the other projects we have but it the IDE doesn't find it it has to it has to go find the solution file and then sure I actually put it on the I'm gonna put it on the twitch screen real quick yeah go for it and just show everybody so there's there's what I get in Ryder and if I click on the show all the files button it's just it's offset by one so I'm not sure if it sees all of the folders and everything that it needs to all the projects were there so just just for quick reference now back to Jeff's screen nice ok so I'm just trying to list out things that we need to do to get this updated obviously the new configuration is no longer gonna use that CD right whole service discovery package it might go away or I don't know if we would hard code the names of some things that it needs to talk to you mm-hmm trying to sure about that that from a code perspective that's mostly and then the any dependence on this killer video docker IP and killer video host IP yeah that's only use one place in the source looks like so that's at least good environment file source I'll fall back oh wow this is interesting is this why it failed when I didn't have a doggie in me file it could have yeah because it says return new configuration builder add add a memory environment files this is really interesting so this was actually set up as a coding project where you could run the services here in the IDE you would run the supporting infrastructure in docker containers like everything else every the entire rest of killer video will be running in docker containers and then you'd be running the services here in the IDE and the same docker env file that the application was the docker containers were depending on the application was reading environment variables out of this as well right and [Music] it seems a little a little unorthodox I guess cuz this is not conducive to running in docker yeah if you were I don't see that any effort had been made to run this and docker by the way so that's part of the tasking actually yeah there's no docker file in here right there is yeah that's yet another thing well uh in in in the defense of the time period way we had way long time ago dotnet didn't really run and docker that long ago it so it's only a recent thing that that really became feasible okay because of the weird like I think we had some I think ceedric fixed this like a year ago matter of fact but there were some weird dependencies on the version of.net that basically required us to have a Windows server somewhere or or more specifically the iis server on Windows somewhere and I think it was like just three just three years ago that Microsoft really started kind of pushing their support and then it was just like a year or two ago that it got to a point where you could even hopefully run Windows as a container so that's probably why there's no intent here for it to have run in docker but we could change that now because we're in dotnet core yes gives us that full cross plat capability ok got it so hmm yeah there's a little bit of a chicken and egg thing here let's see yeah write this down I don't know if I should maybe like make an issue and issues for this and get on get on github or just take some notes in the readme it appears we don't have issues listed on github do yeah we want to turn those on so we could list this for this repo you mean yeah I didn't know if we maybe like we want to keep it under the parent one but I don't know it's always kind of nice to be able to link issue numbers and commits and stuff from the local repo so can I do that here in the project settings yeah somewhere in there hmm at least I'll say at least the last time that I seem to remember looking and when you clicked on options it was just like a short list of options right yeah there's the template thing and then hey there's sponsorships we get sponsors paying us to support our killer video videos okay new issue cool one one arbitrary thing actually you know what you you add that one I'm gonna add this other one okay just a little a little random one that I found actually I wonder if I wrote this down with that in my blog yeah that's me well there's one of the knees oh yeah just right out myself a good recipe here for this that's good enough for one example right now okay so I'm gonna create that issue um did you so which one did you create update readme with license information sort of like 20 nights that's good yeah and I got one more coming - that's that's kind of what the topic area so don't create the same one it's it's a bill for versioning and build stuff okay does it have to do with updating packages nope okay it will polish it'll polymorphically inherent from that object context though any anybody that's not a huge oop fan will will probably just have screamed at me what's the latest Mac OS version um Mojave or do you mean like fine number what Mojave is good enough that's was ten dot 14.6 yeah cool okay so I got that we should build a docker file for this so that's some work all right we gots pretty self-explanatory hmm that's weird since there are four open and zero clothes number two three four and five right where's she number one hmm maybe it's created and deleted or something no no that is weird hmm yeah maybe it was a cancel if you reach your research yeah bah if you refresh you'll see I did yeah yeah I bills for expat services an execution okay oh yes it kind of folds into the container too like I wrote at the bottom basically if we figured out what we're gonna containerize it with we should just containerize it with that OS like alpine or something and sure it'd run with it um yeah it's not what we wanted to use I would think so something something like that that should I edit this yeah sure it was thinking like alpine and then we'll add the dotnet bits to it and there's probably a dotnet I'm gonna look on docker hub real quick thingy because I bet there's a there's an Alpine dotnet image out there that's of yeah semi reasonable size okay got it so I think job one here is not the docker file stuff because that comes downstream once we have this thing actually running obviously right we need some version of the source code running so probably we need to start tackling the sed removal and I am NOT up on very well on all the libraries in here I just know that we need to replace the set CD stuff and then I need to kind of figure out all the places this is called from and I don't know if we want to create a class which kind of represents the configurator configuration this is interesting okay there's a command-line arguments which I'm not sure that we're doing anything I just posted in the in the twitch chat a link to the docker hub page where it has the official images for dotnet core and asp.net core so one of those we would do we might even do like a two-phase build of the image because then we can get just the image with just the pure simple runtime that we need and then just our bill binaries for the runtime I don't know out I can I can definitely run with that more - okay so I feel like I've found the mother lode here host configuration factory house configuration yeah okay and so it's got basically all of these configuration values that are represented in here in some way and it looks like if I understand what this killer video configuration it's a killer video configuration namespace and it's listing out configuration keys so these are the names of all of configurable but it's the name that I key value pairs I guess right so this is all its defining its kind of like static variables like all the all the keys these are all the names of the configuration values that this program supports is this a typical dotnet way of doing things mmm idiomatic for I would say 5050 because this is somewhat dotnet II in the sense that it has the constants declared in a static class and then there's a factory being built yeah from the context of some building enterprise applications with enterprise design patterns but there has been a number of additional things written about simplifying and reducing the amount of overhead that a pattern has in this yeah this does look a little bit not I'm not trying to be too critical but it does look a little bit more heavyweight yeah and it is pretty common to see pretty heavyweight stuff in enterprise applications yeah because you'd have this stuff and then you'd have like something that would probably read in from a vault 500 additional parameters that the developer didn't even know about but had to take account of and then you'd probably have like a whole bunch of folders with domain objects and all that kind of jazz right okay yeah so part of me is just trying to understand this code yeah it's it's returning an eye configuration yeah that that part is the standard dotnet way to deal with like environment variables local yeah big files and that kind of stuff it's it's kind of it tends to be somewhere between Java ish and almost JSON ish to some degree because it will take in some pretty dynamic configuration but usually it's looking for key pairs or key values stick some in a dictionary object usually or something like that so this environment but environment file source is apparently a thing yeah then I guess must know to look for D&D files on the path because I don't see anywhere where it actually says what the file name is yeah because it says add that right and then below there's the other add memory option this is mappings manager yeah environment file provider mappings it's the dictionary and back in that other file that you were looking at so says add that and then oh so it's passing those two key values there as the oh it's passing those in as they well the keys or is it doing some type of replacement on that upper case variable no it's I think it's string it's an environment file source yeah I don't actually know where that Oh value Oh environment file provider so that must be a thing yeah oh that's this okay here is this is an environment but oh here we go we kept it okay so this all needs to work in quite a different way yeah so exci I guess so one of the funny thing here is I don't know that I see anywhere I see that we can get some of the values to find from this environment file right of them are actually looks like literally being defined here in memory I got a deep use I suppose there's something coming after this that will allow them to be overwritten yeah late think enabled broadcast port support etsy deport oh there's the ad environment variables killer video there we go for sport everything yeah and or at the command-line yeah that's the heck of it wow this is like a powerhouse of configurability yeah that is that is c-sharp nets trademark okay okay so just thinking this through these are basically like default values yeah I don't know what is interesting is we have these um config keys right that we have well-known names defined for some of our configuration values and then some of them are just hard coded here and I don't know why yeah I don't know why some of it's done that way and some of it is not well that does seem weird because those config keys are just all those constant variables all those names of above all right yeah so and they're like right why things didn't add es c namespace GS e key spacecraft name username password but then down here DSC enabled whether you use when it still services it's still a static string I mean they're functionally the same because they're the map to the other thing but I understand why some are put in as an as an object property of that static object config keys versus just written in as a magic string just curious okay so I wonder if ceedric would know that I think he's worked on this part yeah there are some we can see some evidence of places that he's worked on this code so I'm a they bring him in as well it's a conversation but I think we can certainly begin to change some of this stuff up in terms of what is being loaded from the environment versus interesting that really means ad environment variables I guess that's the preface of the variable names that would be my hunch like it needs to be cool or yeah it's gonna it's it's gonna add everything to the environment that begins with killer video but what what Valley is it gonna be like literally like how to refuse it after Explorer yeah yeah the full name I suppose I suppose every dance so yeah this is just this is gonna have to be to rework it's gonna be a little bit different something interesting though that I just saw DSC enabled which is this is whether to use DSC implementations of services we've just been talking about adding in feature flag to the Java implementation to swap out implementations so that if you run this against like a clustering constellation that does not yet have the searching graph we're closed right that it would swap so this is effectively it's not quite a feature flag but it's a toggle mm-hm so this that's that's kind of cool that the c-sharp code already has that yeah so if the graph workload is not available in your cluster it's not gonna try to do that right that's pretty cool that is pretty cool hmm okay so I basically need to get all of the service the very first thing is get all this the service discovery to reference the correct change the config file uses if they actually represent the configurable things that we need change the code that uses those config guys to do things right bypass this ed CTE stuff probably delete it sounds about right and I have to rework the docker files the docker compose files I probably have to do all of that before it will actually run mm-hm I think so hmm should we file an issue for those things to do those things too let's look yeah cuz we're running out of time here and we covered all the issues I guess it depends on whether or not you think that I think that the updating the configuration values is kind of part of this yeah I think we should make them all the same - like if we're gonna do constants new constants otherwise declare a Miss static burg not static but magic string string mappings one or the other yeah okay yeah I think that's all handled as part of that one issue I just I just happened to look and notice that part of your headphones are disappeared into the background yeah I don't have a perfect green screen I'll have to order that I'm surprised mine's actually working as well as it is zooms green screen tech is pretty awesome because all my lights are on right now and it usually messes it up Oh lights just went off still looking at right yellow that's okay I feel like this is mostly art this one that you created for the adding the builds yeah where will we run into that like when is that I must have is that a must-have before we can build the doctor file um the well it's kind of a I think we should get the docker file working first because it's gonna dictate how we would build it on whatever platform you're trying to develop against it on okay so I think we should get the docker file deal working first yeah or at least before that I mean we need to we need to get some of the configuration stuff figured out so it will build but then basically like we need to get the build working then probably get @cd yanked out and/or then get the docker for the bill does work in the sense that we were able to run the application the application starts up it compiles and starts up well way to say and did it or did it take the old bill deck oh yeah cuz it did the setup and to set up built itself a file yeah it ran so in it okay right I'm services and that CD couldn't find what it was looking for right wouldn't connect or something and then crapped out yeah so I guess from a build perspective the order would definitely be we could start pulling the SCD stuff out now and we could also do a build just to get the stuff even as it is working in the docker file excuse me and building appropriately cross plat oh my one other questions for you yeah it sounds like we could work some of this independently in parallel and then what about update packages in project so I'll tell you what I'll go ahead and and if you want to assign them that that's fine I'll go ahead and I'll knock out the license and start upgrading the packages I'll check into like what's gonna break what's not gonna break and get some of those done here okay and cuz also some of that will be involved in making sure it works across plat so I'll I'll work on getting those updated and make sure that they will actually build depend the regardless of what ide or whatever you try to build it with so that and the license i go ahead and knock out and then we can have what was you wanted to do we could do another session on friday was it yeah yeah we'll use we can do that okay listen yeah let's do that and then there's another thing so i'm gonna work on this one yeah and i think if we if we do those two things and then we could we could get a docker file built pretty easily and once that's done then we should be able to get it across platen and pretty easily or at least figure out what our pain points are and once the pain points are figured out we can just like list them and knock them out real quick okay so let's leave let's leave this the other ones unassigned yeah that looks good okay perfect awesome got codes to do Oh guys time to awesome well hopefully that was a that was insightful for us we now know what we need to work on so yeah cool and uh I'll also get us I'll get us scheduled on the twitch channel so that we have an event listed and stuff and all that good jazz oh yeah sounds good cheerio alright see ya",
