    "text": "we're coming you guys from strata we're here with this new roommate so spirit can you introduce yourself I'm a solutions engineer atmosphere opinion for two years of working very closely with data stacks and other partners in the data services space so we've really looking forward to announcing and partnering with you further to help data stacks be a first-class experience on top of you cos that's great so we've been partners with mesosphere since 2014 we've been coming to these conferences for years what are some of the trends that you're seeing this year I think the biggest buzzword of this year has been just intelligence in one form of the other machine learning artificial intelligence and machine intelligence it's it's quite the theme for the conference here yeah I completely agree so we released our GA integration this past week with masoner's here we really sat at base s con and we did that developing against the partner SDK so can you tell us a little bit more about just real s promise and who's using it yeah so DTS Commons is this new software development kit that we've wrote and it's been in the works for quite a while now the whole goal for this was to enable partners such as data stacks and confluent and other vendors to be able to produce their distributed data services very easily on top of DCOs stateful services have been very very hard to get right especially when they're running sort of in containers and what the SDK does is make a lot of the challenges that users and developers will typically bucketeer very very easy to handle so you really focus on describing to DCOs what data stacks leads from the infrastructure and the SDK makes a lot of that integration very very easy for you so we here as you can we think well I can build that do you see customers taking on the SDK themselves to build their own frameworks or do you see them more wanting the consumption of the partners we definitely would like to scare customers away from writing their own frameworks today maybe over the course of a couple of years as the SDK ventures you might encourage customers to do it I think the biggest value that a vendor or partner adds to this equation is best practices how would you best run your software on top of a platform like gcos and that's the the more important reason for us trying to discourage customers and end-users from writing a framework day one as more and more examples come out some of these frameworks are actually open sourced so people look at examples so once we have enough of a community around it or enough examples production great examples we might imply reduce our story to write their own customers that are coming to VCOs and ask us what are you really looking for they are looking for a common platform upon which they can deploy all of the new generation applications that integrate with new generation applications all on the same infrastructure regardless of whether it's on Ram on over or bare-metal in the cloud they want a consistent user experience they don't want to have to worry about installations and upgrades and configuration changes and that's one of the core reasons to lose a platform like this us and write a framework atop DCOs so that you can actually take advantage of all of this and constructions you can write for you so a consistent set of a/b is that allow you to do both installation and upgrades and configuration changes so we're really saying kind of to transfer customers our customers that are asking for this integration the persist though like you said they want they want to offer their own language they want to they want to take advantage improve the efficiency of all the resources in their data centers to offer their own marketplace their own cloud it's a great story for operators but there's a big story there for developers - it's your developers that used to have to make requests to wait for a new cluster that wait for the glue and tooling to put these pieces together it's the six minutes now you roll out your your TSE cluster and you roll out your coffee queue they're exposed you can see each other and you can be developing within you know yes thank you very much it's it is really awesome and you know we've heard from customers forever who are like who who sit waiting for washing machines or even physical infrastructure to speed up to handle these lots of data services in the past and with a fungible platform like DC us you don't have to worry about individual silo clusters anymore you don't have to have a dedicated coffee cluster you don't have a dedicated the standard bluster you just tell may service and ease us what do you really want to do admit your today yeah so the the other one that we're seeing is those who honor of replicate an application stack so they build this application stack they have their dev and test environment they're ready to go and then they need to deploy this uniformly across the globe right and so DCOs get to this ability to really push button that employment build it once you deploy it as many times as you need and you know that it's exactly the same uniform and running exactly what your plan yeah and though that's one of the big goals for us with the catalogs our app store equivalent on top of this us even bender so even a regular users who want to publish an application and don't have to worry about you know tailoring it to a custom in a cloud platform or any the sort of infrastructure platform in general you don't have to worry about that you just publish it once it just works everybody let's make it right so that's that's really good for vendors and users in the end this is one consistent experience no matter where they're running that's awesome so if you want to learn more about detours comments about the DSC framework and integrations with mesosphere we did a talk last week at bases pond we'll make that available in the show notes here fishing thanks so much for joining us today hope the rest of your conference goes well thank you",
