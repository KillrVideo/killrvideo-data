joining this Workshop this is the second week we're doing application developer boot camp and today we are going to talk about data modeling designing efficient data models for your application okay this is the second week and uh the last last week we had the uh introduction to nosql databases introduction to Apache Cassandra and next week there will be the third and final week of the workshop where we will build an application with a nosql database backend in particular Apache Cassandra okay and I participated last week as well with Alex my name is attemption.com and I work for data Stacks uh my interests include data modeling data quality data warehousing data analytics I work with a number of Open Source Technologies you can see some of them here including Apache Cassandra Apache spark Apache Tinker pop I also work with almost any type of database imaginable starting from relational and nosql and data warehouses and so on and I also authored Cassandra data model in methodology and we are going to talk about it today and today with me uh Aaron Lloyds Aaron could you say a couple of words hey everyone um I hope you can uh can all hear me okay um I think I'm coming through all right from what I can tell but uh anyway hi yes I'm Aaron pletz I'm a developer Advocate with uh with data Stacks as well um yeah you know uh I'm a database engineer by uh by trade you know I've worked on um you know a lot of uh large-scale uh Cassandra deployments at uh you know a few different um you know like Fortune 50 Enterprises um I'm also an author written a couple of books um occasionally I I still do write um you know the you know an article or two on uh Cassandra or you know whatever else where we happen to be using over here um so yeah that's that's basically that's basically it about me um so yeah happy to be here and uh yeah looking forward to uh taking everyone through some great material yeah thank you so today we're gonna focus on a lot of Hands-On and you will not need to install anything we will have uh GitHub repository with uh information on different uh labs and demos and homework we will give you a link soon and we will also use git pods to run those labs and that should be pretty easy as as long as you have GitHub account you should be able to log into gitpod and and use our labs they are step by step you will not need to copy paste anything if you don't if you don't want to so you will be able to just run through different steps and execute commands and see how they work in real database real no SQL database and for to simplify things for for database we are using uh Astra DB which is built on Apache Cassandra this is cloud database database as a service in the cloud so it's easy to um start you can get the three node cluster without with just a simple clicks of a few buttons there and and you will be able to access it using cql clients and so on foreign so today our agenda includes we're gonna still review some data storage content that we talked about last time we will talk about key definition uh something you will be secure data types we'll talk in more detail about them data modeling and optimization techniques so we do have a lot of content and probably we will not be able to cover everything and and but for sure we should be able to cover the first four and we will focus most most attention on hand zones and you can get some skills of actually using the database and running those commands and the first topic uh Aaron is gonna talk about let's see how uh our shift in screen sharing works out here huh and I think we're okay so far all right so yeah as uh Arthur mentioned I'm gonna take us through this uh this first section here on uh talking about data storage as well as uh you know and part of that is you know distribution and organization um so let's see here yeah I I have to I have to say rigs I really like oh yeah by the way Riggs is on is like the the third missing head but um I I really like how our our bubbles kind of line up with uh you know the the fancy new uh branding Graphics that's that's pretty cool actually all right I digress okay uh you know data distribution a little bit about um you know how how Cassandra Works um you know in the the architecture behind it you know it's essentially when we're talking about Cassandra uh we're talking about um a cluster or many nodes which which work together as I'm sure many of you know um and each of these nodes you know contains like uh like a subset of the data you know no one node contains every row at least not in a at least not in a large cluster um and they can all they all talk to each other you know for um you know they pass around what we call gossip that um you know lets each node kind of know the status of the other nodes um and this is really really important because it's what kind of leads to Cassandra really having no single point of failure in that any node can handle a read or write operation um and it's also very very easy to scale it in that sense for both reads and writes um and really when it comes down to it is that um you know if you you know if there's like a hardware failure or an instance failure something you happen to lose a node um the application doesn't skip a beat for the most part it can find another node to talk to um like like I said any node can really be a coordinator and handle um how to handle a database operation so so you know I I know there are a lot of you know preconceived notions out there about about nosql and what people think of when they when they hear nosql but Cassandra is actually a partitioned rose store um and it it stores data you know organized in in tables just like um you know many other databases which I'm I'm sure folks are familiar with um now when it when it comes to that table structure um you know what it's important to keep in mind you know how those tables are keyed because that really determines a well two things it determines a where in the cluster those rows are stored and B the order in which that data is going to come back when you query um those partitions so here you know we have our sensors by Network table you know kind of kind of thinking about a um you know like an iot type of a temperature sensor Network um you know so we we have you know a few we have we have two sensors out in the forest on that Network and there are two sensors underneath uh simple enough and you know if you want to query all sensors for a network that's that's really easy to do um so the cool thing is that those those rows for Forest are stored together on the same node so if if I were to go and uh you know look at how the data in that table gets distributed Acro you know around the cluster you know I can see that both of my rows for the forest if you can oh you can't really see my mouse can't oh you kind of can okay you can see it's it's up here on this topmost node you can see that the two Forest sensors are are stored together um likewise the C and the car sensors are stored together as well um and we'll get into a little more detail on on how on how the um you know the partition key uh it gets um gets like organized onto a certain node um which we can talk about right now actually because if you think about it uh the the way that data distribution in Cassandra and uh Astra DB as well works is that um each node is responsible for like a range of tokens or or token numbers and the idea is that when you run a hash on that partition key it comes back with a number which tells Cassandra which node that data row belongs on or that partition belongs on um so in this case as you can see we're going to take that partition key of forest and we're going to run a hashing function on it and we're going to come back with a token number of 59. um really the the numbers are are much bigger you know we're just kind of showing 0 through 99 just to kind of keep things simple here but the actual range of values is like plus or minus 2 to the 64th power so it's it's actually quite a uh quite a large range of um unique tokens that are that are possible with Cassandra um so anyway in this case if you look it's the the purple node on the bottom is the one that's responsible for the range of 50 to 66 so that's where the token of forest 459 would kind of fall into play there now also with Cassandra um we have this uh this idea of replicating data um because if a node goes down we want the cluster to you know still be able to move along and still process operations so a common a common way to achieve that is by setting a replication factor and the most common replication factor is three and that means that there are three replicas of each row of data out there so if um you know the purple node is responsible for oh plus your eggs is responsible for um you know uh tokens 50 through 66 well that means that their primary token range is going to be on that purple node but there's also a neighboring node calculation that comes into play in terms of figuring out where the secondary and tertiary uh token ranges are as well so in this case the orange node and the black node are also going to be responsible for storing the data related to that Forest partition and in this way data gets like spread and distributed across the cluster all right now let's move on to a little bit about data organization you know I I talked a little bit about how Cassandra is a partition row store and um you know about how you're storing um you're storing data in tables something you know a lot of us are familiar with from other databases as well um but Cassandra has all of these structures which which kind of help keep things organized so um the the uh the top most um like logical uh organization bit is is known as a key space and essentially a key space is is really just a way to keep tables organized so key spaces contain tables tables of course are where we have our columns and where we have our keys and then ultimately our our rows as well now a special part of the um of the key or primary key in Cassandra is called is a part that's known as the partition key which we've talked a little bit about so far but really that partition key is the piece of the primary key that that tells Cassandra which node um that CL that um that particular row is going to be on and um you know in in this way um you know you can you can see how a table can actually be distributed across you know across multiple machine instances um now if we were going to create a key space now of course for those of you who have used Astra you know that creating a key space is a different operation um but for it's easier actually but for Cassandra um creating a key space it's it's pretty simple it's just with this syntax um so if we were going to create a key space to store tables relating to you know again temperature sensor data we could create that key space called sensor data um and we're going to use a replication um strategy of network topology strategy and the reason Network topology strategy is important is because that's the one that allows us to specify multiple data centers so if it's important for our application to serve data in multiple regions like in this case you know we we we're designating three replicas to us West one and then five out to um you know EU Central one now again typically you'd um you'd probably want to do a replication factor of three in both this example is just showing five as a way to illustrate that that that replication Factor can be set differently depending on which which data center you're uh you're working with now if we're going to create a table um simply put you know you'd be you'd either be using a key space or you could designate that keyspace name first but it'd be a create table and then you know your sensor data sensors by Network um and then inside of it you would you would specify each of the columns along with the columns data type as well as the primary key definition now in this case for our primary key definition you know we have two columns that we're designating as Keys now that first one is our partition key and you can see it has an extra set of parens around it just so that you could have a composite partition key if you really wanted to or not in this case but that's why those parens are there um and the second key is what's known as the clustering key clustering keys are important because they actually determine how that data gets stored on disk and the the order that it's in um which is also the same order that it's red back it back off of when um when there's a read operation um so that clustering key is actually important in determining again kind of the sort direction or sort order of of the data that's returned at least for that partition oh I think I jumped back on accident all right well hey I think we're at our first lab um we're first Hands-On Hands-On exercise here so for this one we're essentially going to go out and uh create our Astra database instance um as well as create our token and hopefully save that off somewhere so that's uh that's that's going to be our point yeah in the chat you should should see the link for the GitHub yep yep so if I go to the uh the GitHub here and I'm looking at the readme um our first Hands-On is this section number four right here uh which is this create your astrodb instance um and it has a um has a button here that I'm pretty sure takes you right to um right to Astra all right um so I already have a Aster account so I'm actually going to go to the bottom here and say sign in instead of sign up um and you know we we do offer single sign-on for those who haven't used it before so you can use either like your GitHub or just your regular Google account to um to activate that single sign-on so I always use my uh my Google account so I'll go ahead and sign on with that all right excuse me it's taking a second to load here um actually you know what why don't I um foreign oh okay can you hear us now I hear I hear us I I think we're all right oh man very silly how long yeah how long were we out for the silence screams that's pretty funny um did anyone did anyone hear anything about um you know how to um how to um build a new database should I go through that again logging into Astro was the last thing Roger that okay okay you know what we'll we'll just go ahead and um we'll we'll walk through this one more time so I'll do this hit this create database button right here in the middle and this time I'm going to say workshops three although as artem noted um let's let's let's make sure that um you know that you're you're uh you're using workshops without a number on the end um all right so I'm going to use that sensor data key space name which again is uh right here in the readme I'm going to make sure I'm selecting Google Cloud um and I'm in North America and the one free region I have here that doesn't have a lock symbol is this Monks Corner South Carolina so that's what I'm going to select um and yes I'm on the free plan so let's do a create database okay oh you know what that time it didn't uh it didn't pop up with a um a new token that's interesting well again I'll say this that um the the tote this is what I was saying when we realized we uh you know didn't have sound um that um the token that gets created by default does not have enough permissions for what we need to do today um so we're actually going to create one right now so I'm going to go to oh let's see here I think I just need to go back to databases and um yeah here we go so if you're back at your main database screen um you can see that I have my workshops database here and it is active I can click these three dots way over here on the left and I'll get a small menu that pops up um and this middle option here is generate a token so I will go ahead and click that now I want my role and of course you open this up and you get just a a ton of different roles that you could choose from I'm going to pick database administrator because we are going to be creating some tables today um as well as some types I think so it will help to uh to have that permission so I'll say database administrator and I'll go ahead and say generate token all right so now you notice I I have my token details right here I could copy and paste these individually with these little icons here but I'm just going to say download token details um and I'll as you can see it did actually you know show up down here as a CSV file so I'm going to go ahead and hang on to that for later because we will need those to other labs you will use that token to be able to connect to Astra DB to your database using a client not going through the website but using a separate client that's right that's right okay well hey artem I think that brings us back to you for uh talking a little bit more in detail about keys yes so and and uh we already talked about keys where we'll talk about them again because this is one of the most important aspects of Designing schema for a table so if you understand how to design primary key partition key question key you will you will be halfway done with data modeling essentially and and then the data model itself can be a process that takes many more steps than just designing the key so primary key why primary key is so important because it defines how data will be stored and we said that primary kick consists of partition key and partition key is always required so it's mandatory key that you have to specify and it can optionally contain the the primary key can optionally contain definition for clustering key so question key is optional partition key we said that it used to distribute data over nodes in the cluster the the partition key will the values will be hashed converted to tokens and then each node knows which tokens they handle so that's primarily purpose is to distribute and of course we want to distribute uniformly we don't want to have two small partitions two large partitions we don't want to have nodes where there are so many partitions and some other notes with just one or a few partitions right so we want to kind of uniform distribution across nodes so designing partition key is important um uh and and the question key which is optional is going to Define data uniqueness and ordering within the partition what does it mean So within the partition you may have multiple rows and they all have the same partition key but you want to make sure that you can refer to those rows uh one by one to uniquely identify any of those rows so you will need additional key which is called clustering key and then um besides that automatically Cassandra is gonna order those rows within the partition based on the class and key so default ordering will be ascending but it can be changed to descending so here is the definition of the temperatures by sensor table we have partition key here which is composite partition key consisting of sensor and date two columns and timestamp is a clustering key and we do change the default ordering of timestamp to descending which means that the latest measurements from this particular sensor on a particular date will be at the top of the partition and we can actually retrieve that for example we can retrieve from that partition limit one and we will get the latest measurement limit 3 will get the latest three measurements so that's pretty useful okay besides that be important to understand is that primary key defines how data is retrieved so you can only retrieve data based on how you define your partition key so when you partition and clustering key so when you define in primary key you're thinking about how you're going to use a table how you're gonna query the table so for this example that we have sensor date as a partition key timestamp as a clustering key we have the following uh patterns okay we we for example we cannot select from this table where sensor equals something because we have to specify the complete partition key to retrieve data from this table so we cannot retrieve based on just sensor ID based on partial partition key we cannot do inequality on any partition key columns so we cannot say greater than we cannot say where sensor equals something and date is greater than something we cannot do that so for partition key it's only equality so when you're designing your tables and primary key before you even design that you need to know how you're going to use it how you're going to create it how are you going to retrieve that data so you need to specifically have that equality inequality and then based on that you will Design the the primary key and we will talk in more detail about that so what is what is possible for this particular definition to retrieve data you can retrieve based on sensor equal something and date equals something you can also add timestamp into the picture so and time step is equal equal something or it's greater than some so if it's say if you say equal something then you basically have all valers defined values for all primary key columns and that means you're going to retrieve one row but if you have if you say time step is greater than something you can potentially retrieve subset of rows right so storing and retrieving and another important part about primary key is that once you define it you create your table you load data into that table it's not possible to change it because the data itself is organized based on that key definition it's partitioned across nodes it's sorted in the partitions so it's it's difficult to change it and and essentially the if you decide that you need to change it that okay this table has uh either for example the the partitioning is not uniform enough or maybe it doesn't support your videos that you you want to be be able to execute so it's basically uh creatability of a table is also affected by primary key then you will have to create a new table with primary key that you want and then you have to copy the data from the original table to the new table and drop the original table so it's no it can be expensive operation you can think about it if you already have your data in in the database we have uh terabytes of data loaded then transferring that data may take a little bit of time so two important Concepts that I want you to understand very well today So based on the uh partition key and clustering key based on the essentially if the classroom key is defined or not you can designate table so you can Define them or you can call them single tables with single partitions and tables with a single row partition tables with multi row partitions so in this example we have tables with singular partitions and how do we create them is these are tables that do not have class 10 key they only have partition key defined as part of the primary key so in the first one we simply store users and and we uh identify them by a partition and identify them by email so these in in this case I can remove move the parenthesis around one of the parentheses around the email so I can just have table definition that looks just like relational tables in indeed it will be will be just the same idea as relational table so there will be not much difference the only difference is that it's distributed in the cluster right the on the Storage level but logically it's just a table with email as primary key and partition key so imagine you insert in a user with email a you will insert that user into one partition right because that partition is defined the partition a we insert in a user with a different email B you will insert that user into a different partition B now if you decide to insert another assert user with still email a you will basically will like similar to like you overwrite in the the first user that you already inserted with with email a so partitions here can only store one row one single row so the the this is important and this is uh something that you're going to pay this table in in the exercise or in the the lab that follows this section and the other type of tables the tables with multiple partitions and most of the time you will have these types of tables we'll have clusting key there you will have multiple rows in a partition why is that because that's how you're gonna create your data most likely you will have some tables where you retrieve users by email but maybe if you retrieve users at a particular location in a particular City then you will need City to be partition key and you will need email to be clusting column or class 10 key so here's a lot of ratings that be ratings that user leaves ratings by user table name and and the user in the partition key but within that partition the email will be partitioned in that partition there will be multiple rows each one is going to have unique title and year which is identifier for the movie and there will be rating there so we'll have multiple movies nested in that partition nested in that partition um that will have different ratings so in this case the the email is here is a simple partition key um the clustering key is composite clustering key and we have compound primary key consisting of two keys right in the second Table ratings by movie we have any air as a partition key so each movie will have a separate partition but then there will be emails of the users who left the rating and the value of the ratings So within partition you will have multiple rows recording those ratings and different users left for that movie so here we have composite partition key and we have a simple clustering key and compound primary key okay so for the second lab you will work with you will actually create those tables and see how they work see what types of piece you will be able to execute over then over those tables okay and you'll also need your uh your token for this so make sure you have it handy yes and so and I don't have the token for that database that you created so I will create a token one more time so you can see how it's done so this is the section 5 of our readme file and there are two links here okay so this is the uh the first link open in new tab and what happens here is you will need to log in in into git pods in my case I'm already signed in for that you can use your GitHub account if you don't have git GitHub account you may have to create it really quickly and then you will wait a little bit of time okay it's gonna load the project it's gonna load and you will see the um instructions okay so things happening things happening and uh now you see the instructions on the left and terminal on the right okay and so you can use the either local deployment of a patch Center for that part basically what you will do there will be Cassandra installed for you and you will be able to use it but once you close this window once you close the this workspace everything will be gone so instead we will use asteroid B connect to it you will see and then for that we will need the token right so I will go back to to ask ADB website okay go to databases again so if you did not create a token this is a time to do that and I'm gonna use the workshops database a generator token don't share your token with anyone else and you will it's it's a secret information you will be able to access the database um so I will choose uh database administrator role generate token and you can either download it with I will copy it and and leave it somewhere in a text file separately so you don't need client ID and client Secret at this time these are like like user and password you will just need token in this case so I copied it and um let me save it okay so the next step I'm gonna go back to my gitbot click start with asterdb and the information here you can read more about table single propertitions multi row partitions but we already talked about it essentially so there is syntax um for the K table statement and we look about some of those things like the types again but here at in step three you are able to start executing um commands in the terminal so I'm gonna click Astra setup what it's going to do it's going to install the Astra CLI so it's a client that is able to connect to to Astra database in the cloud okay and that database is Workshop database that that we created and that that you created looking for so I need to copy paste this token the first time I copy paste something I will need to allow it okay and now I am connected to my database in the cloud so I can list my databases there there are two of them I can create then and I should create we are going to use for this lab we're going to use different key space the same database but different key space database can have multiple key spaces done we created key space we can at least all key spaces in our workshops database okay you can see there are two of them now the the sensor data that we created before and we're gonna use it again later today and this new space where we will equate it with tables with singular partitions now the last command here is to clear this terminal screen and start cql sh cql shell okay so now we will be able to execute uh cqo commands and at this point you should be able to so we just did this simple setup at this point you should be able to recognize these stable users with email I'm gonna show you this first step and you can proceed on your own so I'm going to create this table users insert some data and then the only query that this table supports right now is selecting from users where email is something okay that's the only efficient video okay then I can retrieve one specific user even so I inserted two different users Joe and Jen I can see them but this query that selects everything is not an efficient query we don't run it in production because it it will have to reach all the nodes potentially and and retrieve data from all the nodes to the class so that this will be expensive feed if you have a large table all right so the only Equity that it supports is efficient retrievable by email and at this point I would like you to if you have any questions uh with setup or you already was able to do the same thing that I'm showing you but at this point I want you to try to work with other tables yeah if anyone has any issues feel free to uh you know drop a note in the chat okay so movies another table that you've seen in the slides but there are also some exercises for you can you create a table that stores genre information adventure and what it is description so you can try creating this table in the terminal and you should use tab for auto completion just a uh you know quick quick check in the pulse of the room um if anyone's uh like I said having trouble feel free to uh mention the chat but um also if you're you're actually come going along in the exercises and things are working out well you know feel free to um to add a a thumbs up or something as well yes or maybe even just which Step I own will be helpful right right okay well hey Michael it's good to know that uh you're following along as best you can there and you can always do these exercises after the workshop because they will still be available this this environment is free um the gitbot environment and and those links I still will be there in GitHub yeah that is always a question that we get asked um in almost every Workshop without fail but yes the um the live video we're doing now will be a video that is around forever that you'll be able to replay later kind of at your leisure so so no pressure nothing all right artem I think we could probably move in okay here so the second exercise or the second part of this lab is the for tables with multiple partitions and exactly the same story here you you will start the git pod and you will be able to execute commands and see how those tables work so I will do a few in the beginning for you yeah just a reminder this is actually um I'm pretty sure this is a new get pod environment so you'll need to re-enter your your token again with um with asterisk setup just a heads up indeed yes indeed so you will need your token um start with Astrid B skip the explanation this time we will still set up the CLI so we're able to connect I can skip some commands but I will create new key space and start SQL sh it's a nice client is running in gitbot and is connecting connected to your database cluster running in the cloud in particular in Google Cloud that's where we created it okay so we have Table ratings but you by user let's let's create this table insert several what four rows but the question is how many partitions and you can probably answer we have two so it signs email is a is a partition key we have two different emails so we have two partitions each partition has two rows in it so to retrieve one row in a multi Row from a multi row partition you will have to to set the email title and year so basically uh all Columns of the primary key so when we say email equals jaw title equals Alice in Wonderland year 2010 then we get this one row retrieved from one partition this is super efficiently that's how that's how you want your access part patterns to be right so no matter how much data you have you may have millions billions trillions of rows in that table but if you hit even one row using this access pattern you know partition key you know question key this query is going to be super efficient now you can if you only specify email which is partition key you will receive the whole partition so rows in that partition in our case we only have two this is also very efficient access pattern the only time when it becomes less efficient and is if you have very very large partition if you have billions of rows or actually hundreds of thousands of rows in that partition then you will have uh a little you will have a Slowdown because one node will have to retrieve that data into memory and send it to the client right so but with two rows with 10 rows with thousand rows this is extremely efficient pattern so if you want to retrieve all the ratings that one specific key we can use this query to do so and of course we can select everything this is very inefficient access pattern we should not be using it in production because it leaves all the data from the table which could be a huge amount of data okay similar idea for the next Table ratings by movie so we're creating the we can create a table insert the same exactly the same ratings but this time the same data is organized by title here as a partition key and email as a class 10 key so we can retrieve one row by again specifying all three columns in the primary key and we can retrieve one partition and we will get two ratings for this movie we have a rating given by gen and radian given by jaw okay so this is how this is a main difference between these two types of tables right so if you want to retrieve just one row maybe you you can use table with singular operation you know that you will retrieve data multiple rows then you need to Define table to retrieve data for um to to be able to store multiple rows in the same partition okay uh so let us know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed and we'll give you a couple of minutes and then we'll continue and while you're doing that for those two uh either finish or just listen in I'm gonna talk about foreign so when you use multi-rawal partitions this is this is when this is when um you basically have uh uh some entities related so to some other entities for example or you have like one too many or many too many relationships between different objects and you want to for example uh users who rated a movie for example so you do you have a relationship between those users and a movie or you want to retrieve all accounts that you have in a bank checking account saving account and so on as you have multiple accounts belonging to one person so if you want to achieve all the account information at the same time you want to Nest that information into one partition for that particular user okay singular partitions usually when you create entities objects by their key by their unique identifier multi-row partitions is when you create relationships how different objects that are related to one object okay like attendees of a conference for a given conference I will list all the attendees so I will list I will Nest all the presentations in that conference okay so we finished the um these two exercises two labs and we can go back to okay you can go back to the slides and let's talk about a few more things related to the Keys and related to partitions okay so rules for good partitioning and there are there are three of them so something that you need to say about when you're creating tables even even the uh so when when you're creating uh those defining those uh Keys you usually think about uh how you're going to retrieve the data what what type of queries you will be able to execute right whether you need to Nest borrows in a partition or will find with just one row in a partition but also um you will so this is the first rule store to get together what you retrieve together okay so if you're going to have a query that says show temperature Evolution over time for specific Center on specific date all right then you can uh you can specif you you can have your uh key defined like that it will have the I'm sorry okay switch to it quickly so sensor ID will be particular and uh timestamp will be clustering key okay but um why the first one is not gonna work that way because it's the temperature Evolution right temperature Evolution over time so this is a date but you will have the um multiple time stamps on that date maybe timestamp is the the measurement is generated every second so you'll have many time stamp on that date so if you define like this you will have to specify both sensor and timestamp to retrieve one row but you need to get the evolution you need to get multiple values multiple rows so you you better Nest those multiple rows in one partition but this is not the best not the final solution here we will explain why why is because you also don't you want to avoid big partitions so you don't want so in this definition that seems to be fine but the problem here is that if you're going to collect your data for months or uh for a year for multiple years you will keep growing that partition so it's not limited uh how many measurements will be inserted there so you'll keep growing and over time your partition may become too large and too large we're talking about 100K 100 000 values in a partition and and um 100 megabytes of of Wars of data in the partition but in reality you want those numbers to be uh lower maybe divided by 10 if you want things to be very efficient so the solution here is to introduce additional column into partition key in this case this is date column so basically on every single day you will start a new Partition for that sensor so you will only collect measurements for for that Center on that date into that partition okay and then you next day you start a new Partition so that that way you limit the growth of the partition to one day and maybe one day is is fine depending on how often how often you take the measurements if the sir only takes one measurement per day then it does make sense to split it by date you may split it by year for example so instead of date you will introduce here and so on so this is a second row we have big partition the third Rule and the final is that we don't want to have hot part partitions hot partitions means that there will be too many requests coming either read or write requests coming to to those specific partitions and we designate them as hard partitions why is it a problem because those partitions are handled by specific nodes and and there may be several replicas so those nodes will become very busy because everybody is looking to access partitions stored on those nodes one example of hot partition the partition that could potentially be had is this definition so synthetically and with respect to um uh big partitions and with respect to storing things together it's fine but with respect to being a hot partition it's not because look at the we partitioned based on date and then sensor and time step is a clustering key so when if we partition based on date then every day all from all the sensors all the measurements will be going to one partition okay we'll be going to one partition so um it definitely violates the uh the rule of avoiding hot partitions because on that specific day there will be only a few replicas that handle this partition that we'll be getting the request next day there will be potentially three other replicas that get in request requests for that day so you're not Distributing uh work uniformly ammonia cluster so much better is this definition where date and sensor uh will be partition key and you can in this case whether it's data sensor sensor date it doesn't matter you can switch the ordering in the partition key not so much in clustering key if you have two columns interesting key switching there order will also change how you can query your table and how the data will be ordered within the partition so that's switching order within partition key is fine but not within clustering key okay oh yeah there was a yeah before we get into the homework there was a question earlier um from Rafael K about asking can you have secondary keys for a table um which I assume is like like secondary indexes and yes you know Cassandra and Astra do offer secondary indexes I mean they aren't efficient but you know in my answer in the chat was that yeah they're they're useful for smaller like like Corner cases you know think about it for it's it's it's a way to to by convenience you know it's it's not something you'd want to really run a lot of though um but yeah art artem I would love to hear hear your your take on that as well you know if you had something additional to add there yeah um so I'm not most likely this is about indexes they are the um the the other way to interpret secondary Keys as like uh in the relation database you can specify a candidate right by saying that that something unique uh you cannot do that uh no candidate key so there is only one primary key there is no uniqueness or other Integrity constraints defined on other columns but in terms of yeah in terms of secondary indexes they are there they are available there for convenience not exactly for performance right um and um maybe that's one of the topics is if we have time we we cover that topic in in good detail in the optimization um section so at the end we will skip something maybe if we don't have much time left we will skip uh other optimizations but we will talk about secondary indexes because it's very important I think yep yep okay do you have any other questions I I think we're okay yeah I think we're gonna move on to the homework yeah for the homework you can do it on your own if you want um this one is not going to be uh We're Not Gonna grade it you will not submit it but the second homework you will be able to submit if you want to get a badge uh but the the this first homework is a little bit more advanced even so there are not many steps there to do but uh this is something you can you can see on your own um and and we will continue to the next topic so Aaron we're gonna talk about cql data let me uh get my screen share ready and then all right so yep as Arta mentioned you know we're going to just cover you know a real quick review on on cql data types um as you can see there are uh there are a lot of them um you know you have kind of your um you know your standard ones of like um you know um integer of like you know your numeric types like integers as well as like um you know your your floats and doubles um there's also you know instead of um fixed Precision floating Point types we also have a a variable Precision uh decimal type as well which is again what you should be using for for something like where you absolutely care about an accurate value you know like anything with currency it's always always a good idea to use that um you know a lot of times on on stack Overflow I'll see questions about um hey is there any difference between like varcar and and text and I'll actually know there there really isn't they they both come out to like uh like a Java type of a of like a string um you know uh time uod and uuid most languages I've I've seen um just have a a single uuid type um I know that's how it's handled in Java and that whether you create a A time-based uuid or a um a random type four uid like like everyone's you know kind of used to like a good I I think is what Microsoft calls it but um you know they're all stored in the in the same like uuid type but Cassandra does kind of split those out to type one and type 4 uuids so that's that's an important um difference to to call out as well um let's see here if I I go on to the the next slide here um you know you'll you'll notice that Cassandra also has the collection types available um again you know Cassandra's written on Java so it does a good job of exposing like a lot of the the uh the similar collection types which which Java relies on um such as like sets and lists and Maps um again depending on your on your language you know um you may those May map to different things um like I think in Python a map matches to like uh like a dictionary if if I remember right um you know but uh Additionally you know inside of Cassandra you can also create uh user-defined types as well um and this is this is really useful and the the example I was going to give was address and it's it's funny that this is the slide that artem had for it shows address you know so a lot of times you know when you have you know like um like customers for e-commerce you know they may have multiple addresses so you could have a list of type address and that way your customer could have like a mailing address a shipping address a billing address you know anything that um that might be a little bit different or any reason that they uh they might have multiple addresses that would be a way that you could you could help track those as well um and of course too you know uh Cassandra also has Tuple types you know for those of you familiar with tuples it's like uh like a just an ordered comma separated list of values you know typically it's like you know two or three but um yeah you can also use Tuple types as well um as well as um you know your own your own custom types as well although it's that's a little trickier on the implementation side so that's that's not something that we we recommend people pursue if they're they're not um you know not another like advanced level but um yeah foreign so now we have uh homework number two of um of working with types um artem were we gonna spend a lot of time on this or is this something that they can do later on do you think yeah that this is basic this is basically homework we are not going to spend much time here the only thing you need to know where to find it it's in the same get happy but the same readme file so um for this second homework if you complete it and submit um via Google form you you you will be able to get a verifiable batch um that you um participated the section seven here um and I think the badge oh look at that we even have a picture of the badge there just so that uh you know you know what you're you know what you can earn there all right well artem I think that goes back to you for data modeling yes um so this is uh um the main section probably of this presentation it uh may include some little bit more advanced concepts but but hopefully I mean the you don't need to understand everything but hopefully you will get a few things from this uh this section so we'll talk about normalization versus denominization uh this is by itself we're gonna just briefly touch it uh and and why it's useful for Cassandra and for null SQL databases um uh if you're familiar with with normalization in relational databases so memorization is defined in relational databases specifically to um structure those uh tables in the relational database such that we avoid certain anomalies uh and and those are called in relation database like update and anomaly delete anomaly and insert so it's essentially what we want to make sure when we're designing relational tables we want to make sure that they Do Not Duplicate data too much and there are normal forms defined they are based on functional dependencies within the table uh dynamization C is is um if you if you haven't touched it before then you will find out that it's a lot of mass there and specific algories to decompose those relations and all of that so here is an example since simpler example here that we have two tables one employees another one departments and this so employees has key or primary key and and this is relational tables right the uh I ID is a key here and a uniquely identifies each employer there is a first name last name but then there is a department ID which references so this is also key it's called foreign key in the relational database and it's been basically a reference to a key in another table so this one and this one the reference to this row this key Department ID table departments so this way you know hey my mouth is too sensitive sometimes so this way you know that uh Edgar Cayman boys they both uh work or they belong to engineering department but by looking at this key you also know that a second key Alan Turing belongs to Mass Department okay so this is how it works and you can guess that this relationship is um a one too many or one to many or many to one depending which direction you read so each department has many employees or many employees can belong to uh one Department okay so this is basically uh one to many uh in case of many to many the key of employees will be um but we don't want to go into that so this if you know the numbers HC you may recognize as a certain normal form uh for this table employees uh and if you want to find out um which for example which uh department does add their codes belong to then you will have to do the join between these two tables you will retrieve role for based on for example ID of Elder code and then you will have to get the Department entity and join it with these table department so that you can know that it's engineering department so it involves a join right in relational databases Cassandra doesn't have joints and many nosql databases many distributed databases don't have joints because they are very expensive you have to get data from from different tables from different nodes in the cluster and then somewhere you have to perform the join and only then return to the client so most of the time there are distributed SQL engines uh and and as well for example spark spark SQL that will allow you to do that but that's not real time that's not something that you're gonna return to the user uh in a few milliseconds sometimes those joints can be expensive and they can take seconds and sometimes sometimes hours right so um that's not really oltp database so what happens with the normalization it's the opposite process you don't want to normalize to avoid duplicates and set you actually duplicate data so you avoid joints and you Nest the data into the tables so if you want to retrieve now in this table employees we have the we added Department engineering right here to this table and it's still in the previous in in the other table department so in this case we actually if you look at this table this is suddenly this is no longer a third normal form this is I think second normal form table um and and the benefit of this table is that now if I want to know which department does Edgar code belong to I can retrieve it from one table I don't need to do a join very efficient right uh the problem what's the the problem is that we are going to have those anomalies that referred in relational databases where if we change the name of the depart departments instead of engineering we say computer engine or something else then we will have to suddenly update this value engineering not just in these stable departments but in every row of the table employees right so that can be um a little bit more expensive to do and that can be um that that can involve human error there is more likelihood of a human error forgetting to update something but this is how nosql database this work and again another important distinction between relational and nosql databases is why they work like that why there are it's of course it's efficiency right you you want to avoid join and you want to retrieve data very fast even so you have to have some trade-offs so relational versus no SQL schema so one important thing to understand is relational database is an integration database so what it means is that you have an Enterprise with different departments different functions and there will be um uh uh one database usually one database that stores data for different functions okay so there will be delivery department there will be ordering Department there will be suppliers all of that in one database right and and we see that in relational databases we see that in data warehouses so that data will Define the schema okay in relational database and then you will build multiple applications over that schema you will do joins you will do what's necessary so your applications do not affect schema they simply build them based on the schema somebody else usually defines that database designer administrator Define that schema it's normalized it um stores everything they nicely based on mathematical optimization C and all of that but the problem the applications will have to join there will be different applications for different functions different application for ordering different application for delivering different applications for suppliers so um but this is the what is integration database is and if you have a large Enterprise with a lot of data and it's Global the relational database is not going to be able to deliver this for you that's why we have no SQL databases that are designed very differently the schema for this databases is defined both on data and applications so it's an application database nosql database each instance each key space you create is probably for a different application and you define tables there with respect to both needing to store certain data but also be able to retrieve that data based on queries that are needed for that application so the schema is designed based on those things so you can see the distinction only one app here versus multiple apps that access this schema but here you focus on one app and different functions will have different different databases different key spaces potentially okay so that's a big distinction now uh going to the the data modeling methodology right so schema is schema design is one thing is when you define the table create table this is these are the columns these are the data types these are the primary key partition key classing keys for that table but data modeling is much more than that and we will of course not be able to touch that but just for your understanding you you start your data modeling by looking at data requirements what do you need to store right identifying how that data what type of objects entities and how they relate it so you identify how the data will be used in in an application so those are your access patterns those may be inserts maybe complex transactions maybe uh that certainly queries maybe some other things like batches and all of that so once you have that you and so this is data and application together at that point you will be able to organize and structure your data and design the database schema so database schema is is almost the last step the very last step will be scheme optimization thinking about well can I replace this table with just an index on a different table can I replace this with materialize view what happens if I need if I have concurrent access to this should I use lightweight transactions do I need to split partition because it's it's potentially going to be too large so you analyze and you optimize the optimization is the next topic and we will probably be able to touch at least indexes I hope so all these will affect completeness of your data model so you store everything that you need consistency a accuracy and also data access will you be able to execute certain queries or not that will be defined by data modeling that you do will you please be efficient will they scale right when once you load now you testing with uh 100 rows but once you load billion rows will you still get the same performance assuming of course you increase the number of nodes in the cluster but will they that data be nicely distributed across those nodes and you only get the very specific partition to answer that feeling so there are four data modeling principles the first one is know your data and and by that of course you you will okay I will have users I will have orders uh what people frequently Overlook is keys and cardinality constraints because they will be very important when you design your your primary keys for the tables so what what uniquely identifies entity and uh what what what is the relation what cardinality relationship between two different entity types right how many times user can rate the same movie is it once or is it 10 or is it multiple times right so all of that if so if it's once then then the the primary key of that of a table that captures that relationship will be different than if it's multiple times and then you have to say it's multiple times and you have to add timestamp of that rating and and make it part of your key so those are important things know your quiz like we said that the queries will drive the the schema design because you need to uh tables to support specific queries next data Nest data is universal concept uh among SQL databases um and and sometimes we call it denormalization sometimes other databases call them aggregation um sometimes people say what you store what you need to retrieve together you store together but essentially we need to Nest rows in the same partition to be able to retrieve those roles efficiently right and how do we Nest data in in Cassandra is using those tables with multi-row partitions using clustering columns that's one nesting mechanism another nesting mechanism would be the set and least and and the map uh the the data types that we we've seen just recently but those those data types of for very small uh data sets so you don't want to have more than 100 values in in the list or set while with clustering columns we you can Nest thousands of rows into the same partition and the last one very simple it's it's better to duplicate data to try to do a join you can still do an application join if you wish so you can retrieve something from one table get the ID of the analytics from the next table in your application but that's that's not the most efficient access pattern the the most efficient access pattern is you want to touch one partition in one query so you need to design those partitions those tables to be able to do that so um till uh to formalize this whole process right we um need to understand the data and this is done with conceptual data model I will show you an example uh entity relation diagram uh to identify access patterns we can formalize so we we can have a document called application workflow model where you will see the different queries or potentially complex updates maybe deletes and so on and and you will see how they depend because depends what is the order of execution based on dependencies between different tasks in your application so this is what you do before even you start creating tables and then once you once you have those two things you understand the data you understand how it will be used you can map that into first schema applying the create your first approach and you get the logical data model and you will see tribute code diagram as a way to represent it and then once you do that the final step is when you optimize and you get the physical data model that now can be instantiated in CTO Cassandra query language and you can now create it in the database so let's look at those steps the first two understand data identify experiment conceptual data model application workflow model how they work so this example of conceptual data model that we want to create we want to be able to support for our sensor data and we will actually create in the next Lab you will create those uh the scheme for this new database but now we design scheme this schema how we design it right so we um conceptually we have networks that have uh sensors and each Network can have many sensors each sensor belongs to exactly one network sensor records many temperature it takes many temperature measurements and each measurement belongs to exactly is recorded by exactly one sensor now there are attributes that describe uh Network for example name description region number of sensors and name is underlined here as a key attribute so it uniquely identifies Network for sensor it's ID but also there is a location with latitude and language longitude uh so it's it's basically composite attribute uh and and the sensor has multiple can have multiple characteristics so multi-value attribute and the um the measurement temperature measurement is identified by both timestamp so that's why it's not underlined by solid line so it's a partial key and ID of the sensor so this is called in entity relationship a mod model this is called weak entity type and sensor is a strong LED type because weakened type doesn't have enough attributes to form a key so this is very precise definition of of my data of course I can write it down just a bunch of a text how I understand the data but instead if I have this I cannot make a mistake I know how to read this I cannot make any mistake everything here is has enough information for me to do my data modeling tasks the second important model is application workflow diagram this one is super simple because simply you think about so what what my application will do well first once you log in for example or you will show all sensor networks to do that you will have to access database and find information about all networks and you want to order by names so this is the first PD so this is the first access pattern after that the user in your application may decide to either display a heat map for a network or maybe display all sensors in a network the second one is more complex query let's look at the third one so Simplicity find information about all sensors in a specific and specified Network so and then the next task and the next task so we have very simple workflow for for this presentation but that's the idea you you see which queries your application will need at different steps so these are tasks or application steps and you see which queries they need to be able to function and then you also know well to execute queries here you will have information retrieved from query one so you have this flow dependence so uh so once you have these all networks here and then you need to select all sensors for a network you know that you will be getting specific Network a name or ID from the previous task so again you can put it in words or you can put it on diagram and and that's something that you can uh the diagram is going to be much more precise and easier to to read so logical data model given those two more models application and and data a conceptual data model then uh there are some rules you can use to map so if you look at the conceptual data models uh the conceptual data model there are two rules that are related that you can use to derive tables from that these are now tables in Cassandra and and for application for application there are three rules so the first webinaril says that entity and relationship types map two tables that's that's very very simple that's what and and of course the attributes of entity and relationship types will map to columns right but how do they map uh if you in your query you have a quality search attribute so you say it might be I want to retrieve sensors for a given Network so network is a quality search right network has to be equal to something that Network attribute is gonna map to uh beginning or Columns of the primary key it will form partition key completely or maybe there will be if if you have many of those equal to search attributes you you can have a choice so all of them become partition key some of them become partition key in a quality search attributes will become plastic out because inequality is the only uh only supported on clustering columns and ordering attributes will also or become personal encounters or they only supported on um the the ordering is only supported on clustering columns finally and this rule is frequently for God and I said they told in the in the beginning that keys are super important and cardinality is super important so once you design based on the equity everything you still need to remember from your conceptual data model will will will is this still give me unique entities or relationships will will um so you need to make sure that the keys you identified on the conceptual data model will be preserved in your in your primary key design okay so let's see how it works on one simple example uh so I have these uh sexual data model you've seen before and the degree find row measurements for a given location and a date time range order by timestamp okay so I will be finding measurements this this is the temperatures right right uh a given location so location is here this is sensor so I need to cover all of these right and and the the location application is equality date time range so it's inequality so this timestamp is going to be become a clustering column as you may already know so the first mapping rule I'm gonna pretty temperatures based on the sensor location so this is what I'm gonna have I'm gonna add latitude longitudes timestamp failure so attributes from all of these basically um uh uh from both entities any types the second rule equality so I'm gonna have location fixed to some balers so they these two will become a partition key right so these two will be first they will form the beginning of primary key in our case it makes sense to make them both partition key the node is key uh and then the next Rule and I'm gonna have inequality on my timestamp so timestamp becomes class and column and right now it's by default order it order it in ascending order and then I'm gonna order by timestamp this is rule four and ordering by timestamp it has to be clusting column it's already plus same column but I need to descending order so I will change the ordering uh to descending order final step what makes do it so maybe I so many people I've seen common error people start here and they forget that to check whether this is enough to to form the primary key that will also preserve uniqueness of that relationship essentially this is relationship words right we retrieve in temperatures recorded recorded by sensor at specific location temperatures recorded by sensor application so um the that where traversing kind of traversing the key is sensor ID Plus timestamp that's what uniquely going to identify the the the this uh one particular measurement so um I still need to add a complete rule file I still need to add sensor to preserve that uniqueness that's how I design table this is not the simplest table um but um it's a good illustration What it may take and then you do it for all the all the tables and you get logical data model that looks like this this is called logical data model or represented by chibat co-diagram we have actual tables with Partition key classing key Define ordering as needed and we still have those access patterns that we can later Express in cqo the next step is up is to optimize there are many important optimization that that you you uh you may apply such as partition size whether you use batches or not indexes sometimes it makes sense to use index sometimes in most cases it does not materialize views they are great but there are some problems with them as well what to do with Concan data access thumb stops is a tombstones is a separate topic separate treatment because they are handled a little bit differently in Cassandra than in in other databases okay and then once you apply those optimizations you will be able to uh design the physical level code diagram or physical data model so what changed here we did add data types right we did add data types but we also in green we show some columns that were changed introduced so what happened here what happened here um so the first PD wants us to retrieve all the networks so we want to retrieve all of them from a single partition so which partition is that we basically introduced a bucket dummy column with value all for example and there will be only one partition and then we nested all the networks in that partition assuming we don't have millions of networks we're going to have dozens maybe in this application so so dozens of rows nested in one partition before what we had before is is we simply had name as a partition key so which means if we want all of them we will have to select all from the table potentially ask every node to give us data now we only ask one node or a set of replica nodes to give us just one single partition very efficient and for the temperatures by sensor for this table we did uh as well we did we did bucketing so because there will be uh so to get all the temperatures across uh uh all sensors for a network the partitions can be very very big can become very big so we introduced weak as a to to a partition key and this allows us to limit the size of the partition and retrieve it more efficiently and we also um the query to within this did not discuss but it p is based on the date hour so we also made introduce this column instead of timestamp I believe anyway at that point once you optimize your schema you know that it's going to perform efficiently it's correct it's efficient um so logical data model was about correctness physical data model about efficiency now you can Define your tables in SQL and I'm gonna know I'm not gonna spend much time here because you will have the the next lap you will actually create those tables in Astrid B so another way to look at this data modeling methodology versus relational data modeling methodology so relational databases have one too it's well defined as well so it also has conceptual data model which is independent of database actually the same conceptual data model can be used in both relational and nosql there are rules to map it to relations then there is anonymization C is that maps that or decomposes those relations into smaller relations with specific normal forms and then physical optimization concerns efficiency is this is where queries are involved okay at this step of physical optimization the big difference for Cassandra data modeling methodology is the queries will be here in the very beginning along with conceptual day model so uh it's in a way it's it's very it's different it's important to understand this major difference but in a way it's actually simpler there is no normalization Theory you don't worry about that you worry about supporting queries and and the correlational databases even after you normalize you do a lot of work to normalize it then then you yeah some piece unknown very well so you will have to either create some additional indexes or maybe denormalize so you will undo your normalization to to to uh make those queries more efficient okay uh and before we do the next Lab there is also a demo a quick demo that um that uses KDM data modeling tool um so it's kdm.cash.com again you can find the information on GitHub so this is demo you don't have to do it you can just watch but if you want to repeat it you are able to repeat it so um in my case um so how it works I can Define conceptual data model if I want to and I can specify queries I can can generate tables automatically so we have something well defined to make it right user movie user watches movie and then you should be able to connect them so user can watch many movies and a movie can be watched by many users as well okay we can have some attributes oops something simple so user ID and so I definitely need so I the first thing I did cardinalities entities relationship cardinalities now I need to make sure I have all the IDS and and movie will be um title in a year title and a year okay and I will designate them as keys and there are many features here I'm gonna just show some simple ones so this is very simple data model let me add some non-key attribute user uh May so and the query I want to ask is find me names of users who watched a specific movie okay so think about table that you need to create names of users who watched a specific movie hey um and I'm not even trying to create the table yet I want to define the the query itself so Second Step access pattern I will say this is what I'm looking for find name of the user and this is what I have I have a title of the movie and year of w and of course there are many more things ordering and everything else so it can be more complex but I'm gonna generate logical data model for this one PD and this is these are choices these are four tables I can select now you can think about which one is the best given title title year or year title so this doesn't matter which one I probably probably like this one title year better just for human readability you can also do clusting columns and I don't care about them uh this one is is more efficient for me given one specific movie I want to repeat one um uh one partition for names of the users who watch that but you can see the ID was added there automatically and all of that so let's generate the physical one uh change the name if you like change the data types if you like the year for example will be int uh the ID may be ID okay and generate SQL so this is the table definition right this is a table definition um so this is this is how it's done and um um the you can load the data model that that we already defined for the sensor data so so it's the link is on the website yeah that is really cool um I I can I can see how that would totally be useful in um just just up in um you know generating tables optimized for a specific query like that and just just getting the cql that's that's awesome yeah and especially in the beginning you can you can if you only learning the how to do it it's it's not easy to just it's easy to make any mistakes uh not uh specifically the uniqueness I've seen I mean this is common for people who have uh uh experience working with casan may not be that may not be that easy to model data right right yeah that is definitely the the hardest part of uh of kind of putting this all together that's for sure yeah so this pretty defined project is what you've seen already right and it has all those queries four queries and uh you can generate logical data models select what you need generate physical data model generate SQL so with a few clicks right so what was the most difficult part the most difficult part was this one right and the second the most most difficult was defining your queries correctly uh everything else was done for you so it's it's if you even if you design in yourself if you're not sure this is a tool you can verify your design whether it's it's right or not okay so and with that we have uh one more lab one more lab yep Juan Mo lab and this is the Lab 3 sensor data modeling so let's uh let's go to this section 9 of the readme file start gitbot and we will need the um token but this time we are going to use the sensor data key space so you will actually create those tables that we just talked about how to design them you will create them and you will create them and you will see that how those queries actually work why they efficient and all of that okay so let's well it didn't want to start let me see uh well we do have known uh problem let me stop it uh that it in rare cases I don't know what's the percentage it may not the layout may not do the correcting because of the um it's it's hard to get the time in there within the game yeah yeah the difference yeah that's the second time it started but the layout was not right right okay this time it worked I was gonna say that's looking better already yeah so let me get my token okay so start with swdb again same thing set up CLI and provide your token okay connected let's list the database databases we have two of them nothing changed okay oh token provided is invalid did I copy the wrong token or was it just give me a second sometimes even an extra space could be a problem yep just a reminder folks this is live [Laughter] yes there we go oh yeah much better yeah so maybe first time I copied my token was was maybe extra space and it didn't work so um we're creating the sensor data key space unless we already have it and we already have it so it should say that it always the database exists the key space already exists so we are ready to use it let's start the cqlsh and go to the next step so this is our table Network table temperatures by Network sensor by Network and so on I will just create all of them you've seen Stables before tables I can oh application timed out okay yeah sometimes that happens on skin schema operations I did click multiple times or something so let me describe tables I have four tables I wanted to create I created them and I'm going to insert data using the cql script which is by a bunch of insert statements into those tables not you can check what do I have I have two Networks networks in the networks table so they are called the forest net and Hannah net and I have these rows in my temperatures by Network so these are hourly Aggregates average temperature for each hour I do have more data so these are all my sensors are three three sensors in forestnet two sensors in volcanonet and these are the raw measurements For Those sensors okay and then you can go through the design of each of those queries that we talked about so how do you retrieve all your networks from one partition remember we we have this bucket with value all we accessing just a single partition and retrieving both of them in the next one we need to find hourly average temperatures for every sensor in network forestnet and given date range Within and that that date range is within specific week so um and there is ordering involved so this one is more complex we have network with specific week this is part of the partition key and we have date and Earth so that's what we will do uh the um the range on data and ours this second one is a little bit more complex because the date range covers two weeks two weeks so I will look at solution two so what you can do is you can specify in and you specify two weeks and in this case accessing two partitions less efficient than one partition but that's what they have to do because we we did the we split the partition base based on week done um so an easy one get all the sensors in the network that should be super easy you understand and the last one is getting measurements for particular sense answer on a particular date and ordering by time timestamp so sensor equals something again the reason we are able to execute this quiz is because we designed our tables specifically for these queries and of course we understood the data to be able to do that and we are at the end of this section so the next section is going to be uh about optimization so we are able to design the correct schema uh but uh we will also need to optimize that schema for performance so just a quick quick uh a summary of what you learned today so this is the most important part uh we finished it and we will still I think we'll have time to talk about indexes briefly and then we'll wrap up so the key takeaways for data modeling principles know your data know your queries Nest data duplicate data we talked about that most efficient access pattern is when you access one partition your query only touches one partition or maybe a few partitions if you if you had to split partition maybe a few partitions okay so that's important and then uh the primary key defines unit device distribution and defines how you can create that credibility so you need to remember that and the methodology we we talked about it it may be new to you and seem challenging and complex but it's actually not more complex if you then relational data modeling so if you if you had training if you took database database course in University on relation basis and you you did the minimization city you know that uh that that well that one is more the relational database data modeling is more complex because it's integration database and you're talking about here we just focusing on one applications one application much simpler at KDM we used KDM this is the tool that is available for you for free that you can play with and for the optimization techniques Aaron do you want to talk about indexes yeah I know we have a few sections under optimization techniques but I think I'll just jump to um jump right to the the indexing and materialize views section um just it looks like we've got three minutes here to go but we'll we'll kind of um you know still try to provide some value at least on on indexing itself here um so the the idea with um with indexing and oh sorry what oh yeah I could go in slideshow mode shouldn't I all right so the idea with um you know uh data or indexing in a distributed databases that um you know they're they're really kind of two approaches you can take um you can actually create a table to function as an index you know so like a lookup table um and the and these are what's known as like distributed indexes and their their advantage is is that they're highly scalable um seal actually still be able to um to like solve queries in a minimum amount of hops um through the cluster local indexes on the other hand are are technically not um you know we have some additional options you know for uh for building out building out secondary indexes in the Cassandra um you just have your typical secondary indexes we also have SS table attached uh secondary indexes as well as storage attached secondary indexes as well um see the the main thing though to understand is is really kind of how these indexes or or secondary indexes work um so the thing is is that when I'm querying on a column that has a secondary index there's no hash that's happening on that column which means that there's that Cassandra doesn't know right at least at least at the onset of the query when we start figuring out the the pattern the access pattern is that it doesn't know which node has the data it's looking for so it kind of has to go to each one of these nodes and check the the index on the table to see whether or not it has that data so that node you're going to kind of takes on that role of coordinator and of looking at the rest of the cluster you know so if you remember before when when artem talked about um you know some operations are better on smaller clusters versus larger the larger your cluster gets the slower those secondary indexes are going to perform just because of um of those lookups that they're they're going to have to make um so that that that's really that's that's really what kind of happens when when you do a query with Cassandra or Aster that's not optimized um as well as it should be um for storage attached indexes um you know um it really is the the best available you get you get your faster rights they they take up less uh less space on disk um you can actually use multiple indexes in one query so that is kind of um it's kind of an advantage on convenience there as well um but you know your reads can be um you know a little on the expensive side you know similar limitations to to what we just mentioned with uh with secondary indexes and of course again it's more about convenience rather than than performance but um you actually can create it the cql is is available there on screen um you can see you just have to kind of mention that that uh storage attach index class um when you create it and it it should take care of that for you now as far as like when to use a secondary index um you know it it really is it really is like use case dependent um you know if you're looking at like a real-time transactional query you know you're you're bringing in rows from like a large multi-partition or multi-row partition so you already have your primary key defined and you're really just adding that index in there as a way to like quickly find something inside a partition that's actually a really good use case um but when you're looking at like the expensive analytical query you know you're pulling back a large number of rows you know you're reading multiple partitions and again multiple partitions means you're reading from multiple nodes and that's that's not going to be efficient um and maybe you've indexed like a low cardinality column you know there's going to be a lot of values a lot of rows that it has to check that it has to verify um and then it has to bring all of that data back to that one coordinator node that has to manage it on its on its um you know putting that result set together and then sending that back uh back to the application um so that can get um you know that can be a little tough but um you know when you're using something like like a middle of the road cardinality it's not it's not terrible I guess is uh is what we're saying here in terms of uh you know how to do an analytical query um if you have a small cluster you know we've mentioned this a couple of times like three to ten nodes with rf3 ah using an index that's that's not too bad when you're talking like um you know 30 to 100 nodes yeah that's that's going to take some time to uh to go ahead and and pull each one of those um I kind of mentioned before about using an index in in one of the questions I was asked in the chat like if it's a one-off corner case if it's something that's not going to be run often hey that's a that's a good use case for it it's something that that yeah maybe you do it like once a day once every other day or whatever you don't really want to build a table for it uh yeah a secondary index query isn't so bad um and also using it with limit is a good idea too you know especially of one that can potentially bring back a lot of rows you know cutting that off at like five or ten rows or whatever is certainly a better option than than letting it run through and pull a thousand rows back um and and just remember too that it's it's convenience over performance you know it's it's weighing out how much work do you want to do to create a new table and keep that table in sync you know kind of with the rest of them um versus how how much performance is that worth to you so that's a like I said it's really use case dependent it's it's about kind of evaluating what your um you know what your current needs are and and going from there oh sure um how can we look at the execution plan for a cql query whether it's using a sequential scan or an index scan well you know one thing you can do inside of cql shell is to actually you do um you can actually turn on tracing inside of cql shell and what will happen is you'll get back like like kind of a step-by-step breakdown of each of each um like in like individual like part of the part of the query that it has to put together and you'll even see the IP addresses of the other nodes that it has to interact with and work with um so you can really kind of kind of Trace that literally you can kind of Trace its steps through the cluster while it puts that result set together and brings it back to you so yeah that's actually uh actually a very good question there um our dumb I think that's the last yeah and then we go to materialized views I I think we're out of time for that so we probably want to uh want to skip to the end huh uh yes sure do you want to take over so yeah okay yeah so what's next of course next week we have the third workshop and that one will be uh specifically to design the application to write a code I believe there will be Java and Python and JavaScript so you will be able to access so now you have you created this sensor data database loaded some data now you will be able to access it from your application uh and um of course for to continue learning about data modeling you can do the homework so uh the GitHub repo the readme contains instructions how to submit that that homework and get the badge uh if you inclined to do so but also we have so the example of sensor data modeling came from this data model by example learning series and there are six more examples and and those examples are actually more some of them are more advanced so you can learn even more and including they use some of them use in indexes some of them use materialize use some use batches and and uh you can learn about those features as well for homework we we do ask you to do the time series data modeling again it's the instruction in the instructions for the for the homework finally if you want to learn even more you can read couple of blog posts that can get you started on uh can improve your understanding of data modeling and including the the how to design data model for iot and there is a specific problem there uh and and five different models I discussed the advantages and disadvantages so that's a useful exercise to understand Disney again there are materialized views there are indexes used there and so on stay in touch we have Discord where you can ask questions we have Academy with video courses we have workshops one of them you're in right now and we have YouTube channel with all kinds of uh topics covered there in in our video materials it's not only workshops there are many other uh demos how to's and and tutorials that you can find there and with that we complete this workshop and we have thank you for staying with us till the end and and hope it was used visible and hope you will come next week thank you very much everyone have a good day thank you and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming gifted with powers from the goddess of Cassandra who grew those Powers until she can multiply it will move with Limitless speed and unmasked hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness
