architects and many other people working on to make cassandra cloud deployments easy and today with you three very special characters to help you with those deployments and we spend a lot of time getting ready for this today so we are very happy to see you here if you can see us if you can hear us please set the thumbs up on the youtube chat and we will know we can start we are going to cover a lot of interesting topics today [Music] and but my site looks like scream is perfectly healthy so let's start this time is very precious we today we will discuss something about deploying apache cassandra distributed database in the cloud a little bit of introduction of course then a very important point distributed data problem distributed data is not easy and aaron will explain you how it works and why it works with spain how to do it right then cassandra in the public cloud that's we'll be discussing more about the kubernetes how do you run your data in kubernetes with rex and finally cassandra in the public cloud but as a manager database is a service solution with me and i'm a little bit curious about you guys maybe you would introduce yourself a little bit [Music] hey aaron yeah so could you please introduce yourself yeah that's a very interesting one so uh rex could you please introduce yourself [Music] [Music] uh wait a second i'm sorry wait a second let me check a thing could you please say a word something wait a second wait a second wait a second and that is interesting let me check something um rex could you say a word please oh that looks better now aaron could you please say something again oh hey i'm aaron uh product manager data sex how about amazing fix it so something really weird happened to this setup and you know what aaron you did a great job uh introducing yourself but i'm very sorry looks like only rex and me were able to hear you so now you have to do it again now i have to do it again oh yeah i hope you enjoy speaking about yourself that's okay hey i'm aaron i'm a product manager at datastax um i spent the last few years working at uh target in the us uh leading their uh their nosql engineering team um yeah so you so yeah i spent uh a lot of time standing up several thousand cassandra nodes um and also i you know i've written a couple of books on cassandra and i i do spend um a fair amount of my free time over at uh stack overflow so if you've ever asked for help but and uh the cassandra tag on stackoverflow odds are i've i've helped you out there so hey excited for our venture today for sure thank you okay rex now you know what to do but at least now people will hear you thank you perfect and and go by rags it's always fun when technology kind of works but doesn't work right but but i um i like kubernetes because again you know with kubernetes you can just go to any cloud that you want right you know makes it very easy i work as a developer advocate for data stacks and essentially i'm going to talk about our efforts and kubernetes which is called kate sandra and and we'll talk about that you know including a multi-region data center demo uh during the talk uh really excited about that glad to be here right so um and before we start uh you know during this workshop you are supposed to ask questions and we will answer but now we won't ask a couple of questions to you so we will know you better and that's all so alex do we want to uh let everybody know that this is not our typical two-hour workshop it's like a one-hour session right yes yes you see at datastax developers we run hundreds maybe thousands of different different events this one is going to be shorter than normal and it's more about to be what you normally call webinar but we will still make it exciting and hope you will like it and it's not the traditional data stacks developers to hours workshop so you will have more free time in the end not as you normally would have ah anything else now how do you answer our questions you answer our questions using mendy and if you have been at any of our workshops before you know what to do but if you didn't i will help you menti is a special software we use to get your answers i've just pasted a link on the youtube chat so you can join or better you can use your mobile phone to go to mendy.com and enter this code 62846650 or just scan the qr code next to our ads and that's how you get there in the beginning you just answer three simple questions but don't quit and even if you don't want to answer our questions still jump in and answer them because in the end we play a game and we will ask your questions now those will have right and wrong answers and if you give right right answers fast enough you get your prizes from data starts that's amazing so go to mendy.com and enter the quote six two eight four six six five zero it's right on the screen and qr code or scan the qr code next to our heads uh um asks is it going to be hands-on that's more of a webinar than workshop so it's not hands-on but still a lot of fun and let's go now i want to see how many people join at us and it looks like many people join at 20 already so if you want to be familiar with minty and raise your chances to win prizes from data stacks in the end then jump in now because i start to ask questions and that's a question number one what's your experience with apache cassandra are you a beginner experience set or already a master with a huge knowledge watch out for those masters right well lots of beginners on today like to see that yeah that's amazing and we don't have too much experience with developers or administrators but that's fine what matters is what you still can participate learn and become better developers become better engineers and do something new and be a better version of yourself that's what matters okay so let's move on my next question not because we really need this information but we are just very very curious where are you from we know what we have attendees from all over the world so we have many dozens of attendees already from i see united states i see brazil mostly probably united kingdom hey india amazing more and more people from the united states and is that canada or steel u.s sorry i cannot recognize i'm located in germany but originally i'm from saint petersburg russia and it's so cool to see the dots all around the world huh yeah right yeah right where are you like guys where are you located oh i'm out of minneapolis minneapolis okay that's quite cool and uh rex uh where are you currently i'm in boston but i didn't put in my uh location yet i'm gonna put it in a little bit okay but i'm i'm i'm really curious there is one south africa right uh not much in australia and new zealand but uh i guess that's like a you know midnight or something like that right yeah right right but it's so nice to see people around the world it is in someone brazil as well that's really cool cool okay by the way it's a secret but we are already getting ready for cassandra day brazil and we are going to have like 16 hours of different content for nosql beginners and experienced people as well so subscribe to this channel right under our heads you will have a subscribe button and my last question to set up so we will proceed then to the slides is are you certified apache cassandra developer or administrator yes or no and according to the previous questions i already know what to expect uh yeah that's quite obvious yeah so take a look there is a very important information what really can change your career and then maybe even life now there is a quite unique program data stack sponsors your education for apache cassandra one of the most powerful databases in the world so you can get your courses uh and get ready for the certification for free and now because you the twister workshop you attended this webinar sorry you get the special voucher to pass the certification exam again for free normal cost 150 so you can become a certified apache cassandra developer developer or administrator absolutely for free and that's a really unique chance we will discuss how do you do it in the end okay i see there are two certified developers or administrators and that is cool but guys who are on the right side uh don't uh be too sad or disappointed about that you have no need chance to get that for free and that was it for our questions and we can roll and take a sandwich to a cloud and that's going to be our employees with the distributed data problem hey aaron are you sharing your screen already a second so i'm ready to switch to yours and [Music] yep just a second and start oh no that looks like a picture of rags oh no wait it it did come through okay that sounds good so uh here's where i have to admit um i went into presentation mode but i see rags i don't see i don't i don't see the uh the agenda slide that everyone else does uh agenda slide is at the moment from uh comes from my screen but uh give me a moment i'm checking how it goes are you sure you are sharing the right screen because mostly probably you are sharing from screen not so much anymore here let me um let me readjust some things here yes please just share the desktop that might be the easiest there we go yep you know what sorry having some technical difficulties here that happens all right you know what i'm gonna i think this will work better if i put it over here and then do a present now if i go back to skype and say share and now i can pick that okay that looks much better oh excellent give me a moment that should be shared screen okay so just one moment yeah so we can see your screen and you can start technology yeah yeah i guess we weren't hired on our ability to work skype right anyway so um one thing i wanted to talk about um just making sure everyone can hear me okay right yes yes good sound good sound good all right so one of the things i wanted to talk about today is um you know what this effort of taking cassandra to the cloud is um i wanted to discuss the problem we're trying to solve the distributed data problem as i call it is essentially like there are many applications and services that enterprises are running all over the world and across multiple geographic regions is is the key there and data needs to be close to the application it needs to be highly available and it um it needs to be needs to be consistent well you know in the cassandra world we like to say eventually consistent but you know consistent uh nonetheless so the solution we present to you of course is you know as is the subject of uh of this uh webinar is apache cassandra it's a distributed row store a top-level apache project has been for about a decade now uh and the current uh general generally available release is uh 401 so why would we pick cassandra to solve this problem well it's ultimately about design choices made in cassandra around high availability as well as as well as data center awareness you know if you look at this this example cassandra cluster that i have laid out here you know we have you know i think it's it's six nodes in each data center so 12 node cluster it is spread across both uh like a hypothetical west and east data center and it shows that a couple of the nodes have this red x over them and i put that there to illustrate that um cassandra's designed to handle failures um and and a lot of its design choices go into that that idea that um failures can and will happen at any time um another interesting designation is that all nodes are peers there's no primary secondary failover type of scenario with with cassandra any node can handle a read or write operation um and and that actually helps it um be able to remain highly highly available yep you know uh there is uh that's uh so interesting even after a full training intro to cassandra i do on the regular basis to many people still some of the attendees cannot get the idea of decentralized masterless database and in the end of the two hours workshop completely dedicated to a cassandra fundamentals i ask a question how many masternodes does cassandra need and there are always people answering free free per data center enough to maintain consistency and so on that's funny there are no masternodes in cassandra cassandra's decentralized no single points of failure and that's really cool architecture sorry but it just like i want our attendees today to get it yep yep and you know that that brings up a good point too alex and that one of the the common um you know kind of uh misunderstandings that i see is uh folks will will mistake a seed node as something that's similar to like a primary node you know and it i think it's important to call it too that that yeah seed nodes are just it's just a way for the application to discover the cluster it's nothing really more than that yes all right so of course you know we'll get to um there are different ways to run apache cassandra uh first is the you know free and open source apache cassandra product project um which you know in addition to everything else i've mentioned so far it's it's designed to run on commodity hardware um you know as as recently as like five or six years ago you know enterprises at least the one i worked at would stand up these huge database servers of like 24 core 256 gigs of ram multiple terabytes for drives you don't you really don't need that for for cassandra um cassandra will run just fine as a cluster of like four to eight cpu you know yeah cpus per node um a terabyte maybe even less of a of data storage and then um you know ram is as low as um like 32 gigabytes and in fact you know i've actually built most of my nodes and when i when we were at target on on 16 gigabytes so it can be done um like i said building on building on commodity hardware um i also wanted to talk a little bit about uh kate sandra which is again another free and open source uh cassandra implementation it's cassandra essentially designed to run on kubernetes which is really really cool you know because that means you can run it on you know the kubernetes engine that's on google or on azure or on amazon um you could even run it on your own on-prem kubernetes uh cluster if you have one um so it it really makes it so that uh you know it takes that kubernetes paradigm where it abstracts the hardware away from the application or away from the operator in that case too um so so it's a very very good uh good way to run cassandra in the cloud especially in the newer kubernetes-like environments that are out there and then lastly different way to run cassandra we have data stacks astra db it's a serverless cloud native and uh you know you can run cassandra out in the cloud with no painful devops that's that seems to be one thing we hear a lot of with uh with with cassandra is that hey it's a great database but the the operations can be can be a little painful um with with astro we we focus on that and allow you to focus on on you know your application and what makes your business money all right i would say what this steal of this pain still presents but now it's not yours now it's ours that's a good way to put it alex all right so why the public cloud um believe it or not in 2021 there are many enterprises that um that may not fully be in the cloud yet you know the cloud is still a new thing to them maybe they're still running a lot of uh on-prem bare metal i mean that that does happen um the idea with the public cloud is that this helps get your data closer to your customers and closer to your applications um you know a great example that that we've been talking through here is uh is netflix you know how netflix was one of the um one of the first companies to run cassandra in the cloud at a large scale they had one of the largest clusters for the longest time and um you know the thing with netflix is that allows for the same data to be shared in multiple geographic locations um as well as um you know putting that data close to where the applications themselves are running you know so when you're watching netflix from your home you're hitting like a like a regional you know netflix netflix client that's uh that's out in the cloud and while it's making data calls locally to that to that same region um it would be it would be very very it would bring in a lot of latency you know if we had uh you're you're running you know netflix in germany alex and that you're making a uh a data call back to uh california just uh you know just to watch a movie you know that wouldn't be uh wouldn't be very efficient at all so so that that's the idea is uh you know getting in the public cloud gets enterprises closer to their customers and that's ultimately what uh what we want all right and lastly here i just have a diagram on um you know typically what cassandra looks like in the public cloud um you know again i have a theoretical uh west dc and east dc you know your applications in this case applications written in java or go are are running in the same regions as your uh as your databases and if you look below on the on the diagram you know you can see that um cassandra is spread across both of the data centers and um it's the same data that's being replicated in both the east and the west it's just being shared with the applications locally so that the applications don't have to jump from coast to coast whenever they want to get data it's a far more latency free way to um to have your data in the cloud all right well uh alex do i transfer back to you now uh not really but before that i want to just say a word about netflix i like netflix as a service i'm actually a subscriber to and i like netflix as one of the biggest cassandra users because they have uh netflix is one of the hugest services on the planet and they have dozens of thousands of dedicated cassandra servers quite powerful deployment and moreover we have uh flexible deployment so they can spawn more servers if they expect a new release of a new series of games of thrones or something like that but they can downgrade downshift if they don't need so many servers like now like every and everyone is busy on the work i hope you don't watch netflix on your work guys then but uh those two reasons are great and netflix are great yes but there is one more thing i liked the most netflix is not just cassandra user netflix is a famous cassandra developer and committer so despite many people say what there is a datastax behind apache cassandra that's not perfectly right apache cassandra is managed by apache software foundation non-commercial non-profit open source organization and data and cassandra is baked by many famous committers netflix instagram apple and many others are working together developing apache cassandra even though in the real life they may be a competitors but they develop an open source together that's what i like in this world yeah yep okay so uh i believe uh next slides for uh kate sandra uh i can do or uh rex uh can do like uh doesn't matter to me okay if you want to do the slides and then do the uh i can i can queue in for the uh video good uh so uh will you share your screen with the slides or i will switch slides for you yeah you can switch slides for me if you don't mind of course so uh then give me a moment and we are in the very beginning slide kubernetes plus cassandra equals kizundra okay so so uh i think um you know there was uh quite a bit of talk about astra and how it makes um you know your maintenance just go away right you know somebody else you know is going to worry um is going to take care of the problem for you um on the contrary uh you know there may be some installations where you want more control uh for several different reasons could be for compliance reasons could be for other reasons um then what you can do is uh you can use case sandra which is essentially kubernetes plus cassandra but because here you know we have put it on kubernetes you can you can really take it on any cloud that you want right uh whether you're doing it on gke whether you're doing it on eks whether you're doing it on aks you know in fact i've installed cassandra on any of the clouds and they they you know because of the power of communities it makes it you know very simple to be able to do that right um if you want on-prem that that you can do that as well so because there are there are certain instances where they just don't want to go to the cloud yet and and again because of communities you could you could uh actually do that next slide please alex here we go so um you know like i said uh i probably talked about a lot of these already um you know you can even install it in on a local cluster uh and uh alex you and i are doing a workshop later this month right for you know actually in a week right exactly in a week and we're going to be doing it for kubecon and cloudnativecon where you can install it either on a local local cluster or like a kubernetes provider like siwo or or you can do it on any of the clouds i think again uh with kubernetes it makes it a lot easier right so you can really deploy it anywhere that's kind of the message behind that slide next slide please ready yes yeah so so what we're going to see uh you know in a moment is a demonstration of cassandra on a multi-region data center i mean still till recently it was not you know easy to do this i mean you could do this and there are some manual steps to to actually get this going but actually we are coming up with a new operator called the kate sander operator and i'm going to talk about that in the demo which makes it a lot easier for you to install and does the networking magic you know to essentially make cassandra talk to each other and for those of you who have already used cassandra you know that it's based on what are called a seed nodes and as long as they can connect um you know you can you can really form a multi-region data center so let's so let's do the video now um alex if you don't mind yes sure so now there is a little demon and we will get back to the discussion right afterwards so please take a look at uh rakhavan uh scheduling things on kubernetes for kate syndrome hello and welcome to this brief demo of multi-region cassandra based around kate sandra which is basically cassandra and communities as you already know cassandra is immune to the failures in fart zone and keeps on taking we are taking this one step further with multiple regions this walkthrough or demo is based in gke but the idea as with anything kubernetes that it's actually going to be multi-cloud this will be a little bit forward looking and is based on the idea of how the cache kubernetes operator is going to be replaced by the kate sandra kubernetes operator but we also show how it's working today there are a few details like networking sharing secrets etc that need to be done manually and i'll kind of walk through that as we go along so the idea is really that the cassandra scene nodes in the multiple regions are able to talk to each other um via some networking magic and really most clouds enable this with the concept of vpcs so let's get into this a bit the idea is that cassandra is going to be spread over multiple regions and to make the install seamless so to make this happen we have a cat sandra operator um that essentially is going to install um kate sandra on multiple regions or you know multiple clusters in multiple regions and then you know a way to talk to each other so this slide talks about how the networking is enabled and how the category operator enables the respective data centers to talk to each other or respective clusters to talk to each other this like kind of puts it all together which talks about the kate sandra operator and also the cache operator which is not going away and is still being used to install cassandra on the respective clusters [Music] so this is kind of the high level overview of what we are going to see in action today remember we don't have the kate sander operator yet but we're going to leverage the cache operator and i'm going to show you some steps that i had to do manually to enable this to happen so with that let's dig in and let's look at the demo so the first thing i'm going to do is look at the different clusters i have access to and you can see here that you know i have two central one and west one both of them have kit sandra installed on it okay so let's do a quick check on the pods okay and you'll see here the different components uh that are running here okay so let's quickly switch to vest okay which is the other cluster and kind of do the same command as well okay we look at the different parts and you can see here prometheus you know stargate um and the data centers itself which are running um on the other cluster okay so how did it you know i enabled this is let's take a quick look at the values.yaml file that i used in the install and that kind of gives you an overview of how these respective data centers were installed so you can see here there are two data centers and the critical part here is the seeds so what i did was took the seeds from the first cluster and plugged it into the second cluster and that's pretty much all that you need to do um so you can see here dc1 is central one and dc2 is west west one and the two are able to talk to each other via these seats the networking is another aspect that we'll have to get into so to look at the net networking let's look at the clusters again okay and this is more of a console view and this is the first cluster right and the most important thing here is that it's running on a particular network called rns network right and you'll if you dig into this a little further okay you can see here that actually is um has access to the uh subnet that the other you know standard cluster is using so so essentially that's how the two are able to talk to each other in in one kind of a virtual network so to say right um so if i go back to my kubernetes cluster right and uh look at the second cluster okay you can see that it's using that um that same subnet uh and is on the same network as the first cluster and that's how kind of the networking happens and all of this is explained in in one of the resources that i'm going to point to in a second so that's it for the demo um one one last thing that i probably want to show here is the data centers in action so what i'm doing is i'm running the node tool and and hopefully if everything is working right you should see um that um you know they are they're running so to do that i first have to set my cube context so i'm going to go back to i have to set it to central one and now what i can do is i can run the same new tool and like i said you know if everything is working fine you should see these two data centers up and running so you can see here dc1 and dc2 dc1 is central one and dc2 is west west one and they're basically talking through the c notes um so that's it for the demo i just want to point to some of the resources if you want to do it yourself uh the blog kind of goes through more details uh but if you're interested in a more over general overview of kate sandra we have a workshop at kubecon but we also have some recordings uh that you can kind of look through it's available on kate sandra workshop on github and then of course if you want more um information in case center itself including being able to install it in multiple clouds or being able to install it locally you can go to katesandra.io and with that said thank you very much for watching this brief demo okay so that was very that was very interesting you know uh now i have to switch to your shared screen right yes uh for give me a moment right we see your screen perfect so um thanks and welcome back uh you you saw the uh actual multi-region cluster in action uh and and what i will show here is you know how you can deploy some applications i've already deployed the application in the interest of time uh but i'll show the same you know a little bit of the same thing in action again okay you can see here i'm running a node tool and i'm looking at the status and you can see that there are the two data centers dc1 and dc2 and i've already installed a a application called pet clinic i know there were some questions about kubernetes what it is and all that basically it's a container orchestration platform and what i'm going to do is i'm going to install a application or i just installed an application called pet clinic and i set up what is called as ingress which is you know essentially a way to access those parts okay and all that i'm going to do to access the application is you know just invoke the the appropriate ingress ip now of course i'm using ip here ideally in a production kind of environment you would set up the ingress in such a way that you have a domain name and all that but but you know just for simplicity this is the uh you know the spring pet clinic and essentially what this is doing is it's connecting to the database the gate standard database and and getting the uh information about pets and again uh like i said before we're going to have a workshop we will go more into detail in this uh in this you know particular webinar i just wanted to kind of give you an overview and how you deployed this you know in a cassandra cluster is pretty straightforward all that i did was you know use the aml file and deploy it uh into the kate standard cluster and and it makes the connection to the cassandra database uh and and you know gets all the information um so that's that's it really from for my demo um and um the only thing only other thing i wanted to show was uh show how these two are connected basically this is uh the central one and the west one and that's the one that you saw in action one data center on west one and the other one in central one and essentially i created those two and connected them together that's pretty much it thank you great so i'm going to switch back to a presentation right yes uh so uh aaron it's your turn right you wanted to say something about that yeah you know regs called out that um you know this is where you know the cassandra yama file is really where where the magic happens for uh for for getting that uh getting getting the deployment out there um and one thing i wanted to do is kind of compare and contrast a little bit of of how you specify the um you know the multi-data center aspects you know with uh kate sandra as well as cass sandra now of course you know um reg showed a deployment in oh i'm trying to remember it was like it was like central and east correct is that right central band and west one right uh yeah central one and west one yeah okay um really though i mean you can call the data centers whatever you want regs went with you know dc1 and dc2 um but you know you you can absolutely you know make them so they they kind of mirror what those um with what the geographic locations are as well um anyway or you could do it based on workloads you know so let's say you're running um yeah you know like analytics workload in one and something else in the other you could yeah you're right make it a little bit more meaningful this was just a you know demonstration right so yeah yeah and that that's a that's a good call out uh regs too in that you know there are i i have seen deployments where it'll have like you know an east data center a west data center and then like a spark data center that may be in like the east or the west but it's it's logically its own um logically its own data center yep all right alex if you jump to the next slide please yes sure yep so the uh the main thing i wanted to call out here is that um you know when you look at how you configure um [Music] you configure you know multi-data center awareness inside of cassandra instead of kate sandra um it's it's very very similar so you know i'm sure you're all familiar with you know setting things like um you know your your end point snitch um well actually you know we did have a fair amount of beginners on so so maybe maybe you're not typically um you want to make sure you're using a um a geographically aware or data center aware snitch and the gossiping property file snitch will do that um in the cassandra rack dc properties file is where you'll go ahead and make sure that um like your data center name is specified and your your rack is specified um the data center name typically lines up with the with the region from the cloud provider um and then the rack typically lines up with like what's what's known as the availability zone inside the inside the cloud provider um and i think the main the main difference here that we're looking at from kate sandra is that in kate sander you don't have to worry about um about configuring the endpoint snitch that's something that i believe has abstracted away with kate sandra's design and you just need to worry about specifying your data centers i mean that's a that's a great leading to the question that kusto shalom machiloni you know asked and kusto if you don't mind giving me a thumbs up if i tried your pronunciation let me know but but you know i think his question is relevant to use kate sandra do i really have to be a guru on kubernetes or basics will do basics will absolutely do if you know how to do a helm install which is what we leverage for the most part right then you're good to install you know most of the components that we have and it's going to do like what um you know i don't know is mentioning it'll do the magic of kind of these snitch nodes or whatever you don't need to worry about any of that it'll happen you know under the hood um so you don't need to be a master in communities if you know how to do a helm install if you can run cube cuddle you know if you're a system administrator you can do that but if you're a developer all that you need to do is you know have that ingress and if you use the you know the uh the uh ip of the load balancer then you're good to go yep i would add a point on that so our guys because kate sandra is mostly developed by data stocks it's an open source project you can use it for free you can contribute to it and we will be very happy about that uh so we did a great job making it easy to use and that's indeed one of the simplest way to have cassandra and also all the required third-party tools for backups monitoring management repairs and so on and so forth to manage it with ease but sorry there is a point i have to a very important point i have to mention if you want to deploy it for testing development staging purposes it's completely fine but if you go into production with kubernetes with no strong kubernetes knowledge you can fail and that's not about cassandra that's about kubernetes kubernetes is quite complicated technology it was developed by google but it doesn't look like google.com they just put your query and push the search button kubernetes is not like that kubernetes is a very complex tool so you have to be careful running kubernetes on production and take a certification or at least get some preparational trainings before you go live and then go to downtime you don't understand why and your clients are unhappy so to avoid that you first have to learn kubernetes is a big thing you know the advantage to alex is that you can certainly use the uh the the google kubernetes engine that's uh that's out there with with gcp as well as amazon's kubernetes engine azure's kubernetes engine that way you don't have to worry about admining it but but you're right you know running it on prem yourself is certainly a challenge sometimes yeah and and to add to alex uh i think uh data stacks does offer support for kate sander as well right so so you know so to a certain degree you can you can get some help on that too yep okay next slide then yes okay yeah really all i was gonna say on this slide is um you know when you go ahead and you create a key space inside of uh inside of cassandra and you're you're working in a cluster that's uh that's geographically aware um is just is just make sure that you you specify your data centers with the uh corresponding replication factor um and case does matter you know make sure that you you match case you match the exact spelling um see seen several issues out on stack overflow where where folks don't have those matching and then wonder why they get uh no host available when when trying to do a reader or write and well that's that's gonna be why so and i think that's it alex i think you can jump to the next slide and then great i think it's all about you yes okay so uh astra db in the public cloud we discussed apache cassandra apache cassandra is great but you have to take care of a lot of maintenance and operations we discussed at kate sandra it's an open source project so we put a lot of energy and a lot of efforts to make it the to be kubernetes native so you can run it on kubernetes much easier v faster than without us and it's still open source is free i mean like i love data stacks then next option if you still want to have the full cassandra power but don't ready to invest your time efforts into maintaining the database into maintaining the infrastructure for the database astrodb is going to be the perfect match for you what is uh astrodybin so astrodb is a cassandra as a service or better to say database uh based on the apache cassandra to begin to be as a service so it's an uh as a fundamentals it uses open source apache cassandra vive some tweaks and hints then it has an additional layer to give you even more than plain cassandra can give and and then some tools and ways to communicate with that to make um any any kind of things you want to do with your database easier and as said it's a database as a service so all the maintenance and operations are on us not on you so as a foundation we have cassandra and that's right when we deploy and run cassandra on google cloud microsoft azure or amazon web services on your choice like i mean that on your church when working with cassandra you still can use cassandra query language and normal cassandra drivers but in some cases you want to have a simpler access sometimes you just want to make an http rest request and store your document and then get it back without even thinking of a database and this is also possible uh so there is a special layer you can or may not use if you don't like it that's uh known as stargate.io stargate is a special project developed again by datastax but it's open source so you can use it for free and develop it as well which gives you ability to work with cassandra and harness all the power of a cassandra using document api like with using rest api like normal rest api using graphql and that's just a special extension you can take it you can skip it but that's a very cool thing if you want to have multiple ways to access your data in the database so think like very uh things would simplify it a lot and above of that we suggest very nice user interface and many base web-based developer tools for you to simplify development with stargate over cassandra what's very important for us astrodb is free to use for small workloads so if you have if you are just studying if you're a student and don't ready to pay for don't want to run and maintain your own database because it's quite a lot of work and but you want to use a database you have some of your own projects those are not earning money yet you can completely use astrodb for free you don't pay a cent you don't even give your credit card and then the consumption grows still even for small production workloads it still will be free you start to pay for us to db only when you have more than 30 millions of reads per month or uh 4.5 millions of writes per month or more than 40 gigabytes of data monthly and 40 gigabytes of data in a database that's quite a lot i'm not talking about movies or pictures but the database stored information astra is serverless it means what you don't care how many servers we need to store your data and dispatch your data it is um our headache and if we need more data if you need more servers to dispatch your data or store it we will add more servers if we your database is small and you don't need so much we will therefore uh downscale it and it's perfectly fine so it always stays available highly available by way but you pay as you go that what mattress for most if you consume not a lot you don't pay at all if you consume a little bit more you paid something but not too much and then uh that's what's called serverless flexibility and i like it obviously as we discussed that no operations operations are our headache here at data stacks we probably what do they say alex yeah friends don't let friends administer cassandra right well well well it very depends on your database i mean astrodb is not like one size fits all exactly uh but yes yes uh for many many for most of the use cases you want professionals like us manage uh cassandra for you that's for sure so yeah i'm very agree with you uh it provides stargate api by default stargate is an open source so you can use stargate with normal apache cassandra deployment but in astrodb you don't again have to run configure maintain update stargate it's all on us cassandra is a global scale so everywhere you have amazon web services or google cloud or azure your cassandra may be running as a part of faster db deployment it has all the required enterprise security steps all the private links all the encrypted connections and so on and so forth it has zero lock-in for oaws gcp or azure uh so in it's fully compatible with open source apache cassandra because well it is cassandra in the core and um a very nice user interface you will see in a moment on the live demo so you don't need to be a guru of console of green on the black terminals and so on we do it for you and you just push the buttons in your browser so main features of astra for us for you as a customer so those points are not delivered or wrote and written by me but by one of our customers astra allows you to focus on the feature but not on the database you should care of your customers not of your databases but of course if your database is down then your customers are unhappy focus on what matter uh to your project 10 toward serverless because serverless is the flexibility payment flexibility and scalability uh for what matters time is very valuable and your developers time is valuable the most your developers should work on doing something useful for your clients not uh working more with the database with serverless you can build faster and you can scale faster and adventure house asks is it pass or sas so it's a database as a service which technically belongs to software as a service not platform as a service so awards are cheap show me the code and let's work a little bit with astrodb in the very last few minutes it's going to be very short now give me a moment to switch all right so our idea of working with astra is very simple you go to astra.datastax.com and you have to create an account but you do not specify your credit card we won't ask for your credit card as long as we don't uh as long as you don't have production workloads my current plan as you can see is free and that's a perfect match then i will need to create a database for our application we are going to run and i will push the create database button and first thing i have to do is i have to give a database name and second i have to do is to specify the key space name that's for initial setting for your configuration and then something interesting comes in as i said it's platform agnostic and we can run our google cloud or amazon web services or microsoft azure on your choice and then i say on your choice i really mean that so now you guys please jump in back to main team and tell me which uh cloud provider should we choose for our astro db deployment today which cloud provider do you like the most aws okay that's the first voice azure three two one a six to two okay that's a but take a look no one chooses gcp that's quite sad yeah you know what yeah right i am a certified google cloud professional architect and that kind of disappoints me like come on one more voice for gcp it's still it lost obviously so we already see what aws has won uh but okay i know alex i used gcp for years and i loved it you know to be honest yeah yeah you know what what i want to highlight here we don't care if you like more av ews or gcp or azure by the way thank you for the second vote on gcp uh what we care is give you their flexibility and power to decide that's what matters so ladies and gentlemen i believe it's like the decision is done aws obviously and don't forget vote using dot mendy.com not using youtube chat okay for vote it's not so important aws has won already but uh during the quiz to win the prizes you do want to answer our questions on mendy not on youtube chat because in youtube chat you have no chances to win swag from data stacks good so okay that's an in you know what i will make a screenshot because that's quite interesting i didn't expect such a huge difference i will make a screenshot that's good okay so i will proceed with aws as you just as you wish i switched to amazon web services now we have to pick the region by default on my free plan i will you i will deploy a single region database but on more advanced plans of course you can use multi-region database deployments and that is quite cool thing so we can go with that i will this time it i will make it easier especially for our uh friends from uh north america let's say i will pick oregon why not no north virginia i was there so i just like a friendly reminder to myself about north virginia i want to visit again i will push the create database button and we go with north virginia on aws that's going to be quite interesting now let me launch my application and so meantime i know there was a question from vishal um do you want to take that uh aaron question about ssl um i was just looking at that i can't find any any specific um all-inclusive documentation on cassandra spring boot ssl i did find a blog post on code gravity that goes through the basics of how to do it i'll i'll post that here maybe that'll that'll help out but um and definitely like i said you know we are very close to uh coming up with an implementation for grpc um you know that's about 95 99 something like that right alex uh and and it should it should be out soon uh that's really the the correct way of doing cloud native um with the security yes good so meanwhile i launched my test application to show you how easy it to go and work with astra so the only configuration we have to do is we have to use a configuration file from astrodb i will show you in a moment and our application hopefully is ready to run already so give me a moment to check yes okay so uh benefit alex is there any way you can increase the font maybe i don't know if anybody else i can try okay looks better i think so take a look normally normally then you go uh for the database you have to install it you have to take care of the servers you run you have to take care of the database to run and as cassandra is distributed decentralized database that implies what you have at least three servers or maybe three hundreds or maybe three thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands like apple has for cassandra viv cassandra and with astra take a look i just pushed the button and my database is already running and it's available to these applications so let's let's take a look i am on my databases i want to see if my newly created database is active and it is active already so i'm switching to this nosql database that's a astra dashboard astra dashboard for cassandra in this case so astrodb and streaming is coming so soon you will have not only database in the cloud but also apache pulsar streaming in the cloud but now we work on cassandra okay so i have my database with the availability online i can add a region but we will stick to single region for now because i don't want to switch to pay as you go plan no i'm kidding of course it's yeah that's a good idea anyway i am a data stacks employee so company covers it for me but what i want to show you is really how easy it to launch there is a tab i can take a look on the current health of a cluster there will be all the grafana dashboards showing what's with status is it's fine how many come requests i have whatever requests whatever right latency and so on and so forth there is a console i can work with a database directly we will get back to it in a few minutes some settings but what matter most for me is the connect tab so for connect tab i'm going to connect for example there are many ways to work with cassandra and astro of course i will choose python first i will need a special configuration file here it's uh we're just going to store it here so i will download this secure connect bundle it's on my downloads good next thing to connect i will use to specify username password and key space so username in my case because i'm using uh api token will be just token and it will be for you the same then i have to create a token for my application to be able to work with the database i go to the organization settings and i go to token management i'm going to create a new token i will create database administrator which is quite powerful but that's a simple demo so i believe that will be enough and i have here token i will use so i paste this token as a password and finally i have to specify the key space i've created so it was just nosql now i have to choose this file secure connect no sql zip boom and i can test connection so alex again for those of you who are wondering you know um what what alex is doing you know he's he's going pretty fast with this but but you guys can attend the workshop and and kind of walk through this we go in a little bit more relaxed space there where you can um kind of go through this step by step and you will have instructions for step by step you know what it's a webinar we are covering three huge topics we are covering apache cassandra we uh cover kate sandra the cover stargate and astro so four actually huge technologies very powerful technologies uh within one hour so that's of course a very overview level very high level overview i would say but we have content about astra about cassandra about kate sandra about stargate dedicated to our workshops hands-on workshops where you put your hands on and push for buttons and run it all with our help and those workshops are available for free did i told you did i tell you i like data stacks yes i do so test successful and that means we can save these data okay first time it fails that's a application issue i have to fix but finally database credentials are saved and what is that that's getting started with astra demo astra db very reminds us a lot about the stars so this application is the control center for the how it's called space rockets and now i'm going to launch a new journey with uh this control center control tower if you want and i need to know now two things uh aaron what would you suggest to give a name to our spacecraft can i suggest okay spacecraft will be a milky way but when we need a journey summary so where are we going then as rex gave the spacecraft name now you aaron has to give the journey summary where are we going oh let's go to the moon moon okay moon um okay sounds good uh journey to the moon sounds amazing so i hope you're ready i'm ready as well a little bit nervous but i'm hitting the lounge button and that's the main engine start and liftoff and that stars starts we see how this application uh gets the temperature and speed and pressure and current spacecraft location generated by this application i'm sorry guys we don't launch a real spacecraft for this webinar it would be too expensive even for data stacks but sounds like a good plan for the future so those values are for real generate our application you see running yeah maybe we can partner with spacex or something like that uh open source rockets that sounds good that sounds good we have to make it okay and we are getting close to the landing and that is done spacecraft milky way with journey id well quite a lucha a huge id with many of reeds and rights reached the moon successfully so now we can switch back to the database management tool we can switch back to astra pick my database hey there my computer is too busy with all the streaming things yes and i can switch back to my database you see we see there are some read requests write requests and so on so we can proceed to a health tab and find out what there are some new information about our cluster statuses requests combine it request a rows zero we don't have any requests well done what's of right latency what's the right size distribution and so on but what really matters for me is to use this can sandra query language console so now i can use the key space nosql i can describe tables and there are all our measures so pressure over time speed over time journey catalog location over time and temperature over time recorded by this demo application which just launched a milky way for us so we can easily get all the information about the temperatures for example uh select all from space oh of course sorry from space route temperature oops temperature over time and here we go so all data is here and that looks like we just create a database and access it in less than a minute basically and we didn't do anything to install it it's install it already and that's completely for free for all of your projects so ladies and gentlemen i find that quite uh exciting and hope you like it too that's pretty yeah i think i think gorilla skills says uh that's the fastest moon landing he has ever seen yeah you see we at data stocks are using quite advanced technologies i would say and and i think the question here was was was that doing bulk rights or was that individual right i believe that they're individual rights um yeah yeah yep uh boom uh now i believe we are done with the demon we can make so late if you want but i just want to proceed to the next slide or you know what our slides are over that means we are ready to play the game and send you some prizes and don't worry if you live somewhere in the not so central places we ship worldwide we shipped some goods we shipped some price to siberia to india to africa so we definitely can reach you data stocks can reach you always okay so um it is done and uh quiz time so let's get back to main team everyone hey take a look now free voices for gcp i feel better now yeah gcp got a little more love yes we should we should do a race of all the three right and see who who does the fastest moon landing oh yeah that's a good point that's a good point indeed okay so um quiz take cassandra to the cloud now ladies and gentlemen get ready for wikis i will ask questions you will answer them first you have to give the right answers if you give wrong answer you don't get your points for that don't don't look at the slide right yeah because yeah right and uh second uh if you you have to answer faster because the sooner you answer more chances for you to so you get more um points and higher which ends for you to win the prizes and meanwhile there is a great question from vasily zeluk hopefully i pronounced your name right right do you expect astra to be a silver bullet for both demon sessions and broad workloads where enterprises should invest to get most from austria in broad so now that's a very big question and we don't have really time to answer it in details so let's play quiz and i will get back to your question afterwards yeah i'll i'll answer in the chat you know what aaron you can answer in the chat but during that piece no one will read the chat everyone will just play the game everybody is focused on the mentee yeah right right and now last hint from our professionals regarding the quiz youtube has a little delay like one second two seconds but as a high speed game you better watch your menu and focus more on men team than on them [Music] youtube okay youtube stream right okay so we have uh 26 people on uh mentee i believe i gave you enough time so now we are going to start and that is quiz final ending quiz of take casunder to a cloud webinar and we start so answer fast to get more points what is astra what disaster is a good question it's a gateway to a stars it's a local in memory version of abuja cassandra it's cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a development tool everything's got something to do with the stars right yeah i mean of course of course couldn't go wrong there yeah okay so this one was easy astra or better to say astrodb is a cassandra as a service in the cloud there are also astro streaming but today we speak about astra as a database as you said so right answer is cassandra is a service in the cloud and 22 of you made it right but who was the fastest one and we see what lucas made the best work answering past with 938 points he gets to the first place but take a look there is another droid with just four points difference and with 10 points difference which still very small difference there's a shanker and vasil get it to a poor place it's just a fast question so let's take a look how it goes later question number two answer fast to get more points what is stargate i hope you paid attention then you can answer what is a stargate is it a new mario game is it a tv show is it a data gateway to give you rest and graphql apis on cassandra or is it a gateway to the stars i'm still gonna go with stars with stars but looks like not every only one person agreed with you but a notice tv show technically was also the right answer so one who answered stargate is a tv show was right but of course the main thing for us today is a data gateway data api layer uh on top of the apache cassandra open source one and what's going to change on the leaderboard who was fastest this time looks like vasily was the fastest jumping directly to the second place yeah that's good lucas keeps the first one and shanker gets to prefer so game goes on let's take a look what's going after the question number three so answer fast to get more points what is kate sandra uh cassandra vivin integrated data lake maria db on kubernetes deployment tool kubernetes native cassandra with built-in operation tools a sister of kate and sandra so what is kate sandra everyone has voted and right answers definitely kubernetes native cassandra we've built in adoration tools it's not mariadb and definitely not a cassandra within the integrated data lake case sandra is a kubernetes native apache cassandra sounds good let's move on but who made a mistake there were some mistakes was it some one of our leaders was it someone from the leaderboard looks like nope all of the leaders made it this time there are no mistakes on top lucas was the fastest again as it was on the dust question keeping it's so close right yeah keeping it the first one but yeah vasily has just like 20 points difference that's a couple of milliseconds so there is a strong competition for the first place and alan acosta made it to the third place so lucas wassil and alan are on top of the leaderboard let's take a look what goes next question number four answer fast to get more points which one is managed solution apache cassandra astro db kate sondra which one is managed solution [Music] you need to be a little bit into the cloud to understand the question i hope you do but we will see on the results and most of you made it astrodb is a managed solution because some provider like data structs in this case manages astrodb for you apache cassandra you manage yourself and cascade sandra you manage yourself you may have a manager kubernetes underneath but it's still uh for vipkid sandra you manage kate sandra and cassandra as it is and with astrodb we take care of your headache and that's amazing so let me see the leaderboard there must be some mistakes no take a look leaders made it again no mistake on the leaderboard and gunjan was the fastest jumping on the seventh place but well still seventh and only top three places will get the prizes so lucas alan acosta who overtake vasil as a look and vg is on the fourth place getting ready to jump in into the top three so ladies and gentlemen that is incredible fun a couple of questions right yeah yeah see if anyone can overthrow lucas here he's really firing on all cylinders yeah yeah lucas is on fire that's for real that's question number five and we are getting close and we are like already in there are getting close to the finish so let's take a look you know what to do transfer fast to get more points which option is better for your own kubernetes cluster kate sandra apache cassandra astrodybean you are answering faster and faster everyone now a couple of more words were those voices and we can close this everyone has voted and that was easy which option is better or more convenient to run on your own kubernetes cluster of course it's kate sandra especially designed to run on your own kubernetes cluster you can run plain apache cassandra on your kubernetes cluster but it will definitely imply more work that's for sure and with astro dbm you can use uh astro service provider in kubernetes and it will be very easy to connect but technically astra won't run on your own kubernetes cluster that's why kate sandra is the right answer so astra still can be very useful in this case that's for sure okay now i'm bit worried there are eight mistakes who made those mistakes all the leaders gave the right answers that's interesting now who was the fastest this time it was hayagriva getting or getting to a leaderboard which is already quite cool then there are many dozens of people participating but top looks oh no dopes there is a new people lucas and alan keeping the first and second place but vg made it to a top three overtaking tanat and vasilisiluk very good lady very good ladies and gentlemen and that is very last question on the go ah i know like i i can't make it i just cannot push the button i'm too worried for our leaders who will made a mistake and who will be the fastest is this gonna be the toughest question that's for attendees to judge i don't think it's really tough but we will see on the results it's a question number 6 everyone 6 out of 6 and we go you know what to do answer fast to get more points you don't use kubernetes and ready to handle a complex deployment what do you choose [Music] apache cassandra kate sandra astrodb that is interesting point okay [Music] okay that's quite interesting question on your attention because if you do not use kubernetes and you want to handle a complex deployment and take all their headaches and all the issues and all the maintenance operations over the cluster then if you don't want to use database as a service cassandra can be a very good choice for you because as a manager solution or not it's still one of the most powerful databases in the world and that's for you to decide which way you would prefer do you think i have to switch to leaderboard yeah let's see it i think it has to right i'm just i just i just can't push a button but okay if you insist [Music] i will push it virtually okay that was it now there are going to be some changes oh but not not really not many changes uh lucas alan acosta and vg still made it to the top free despite all the complex questions we made for you that is a great job now if you are on top three positions lucas allen and dg make a screenshot of your screen with your place first place second place third place make a screenshot of your uh [Music] split and send it to me to my linkedin i'm sending the link right now in the chat that is good and uh don't forget to attach your screenshot okay i will need your address to send your prizes and we congratulate you you free made an incredible job and we have a very own time i also want to say a word for those who are on the leaderboard but didn't make it to a top free don't be sad or disappointed about it first of all you're still on the leaderboard out of quite a lot of people that's a great result and second even thoroughs we didn't make it to the top 10 we run workshops webinars and other educational events um multiple times per week it's called data stacks developers youtube channel and now if you still give us after actually more than one hour you just must push the like button and subscribe button right under all of us and enjoy our next workshop where you will have a gain chance chances to win some prizes so alex do we want to take a few questions that are already there since we have a little bit of time or of course of course so so one of the questions that i want to get back to is do you expect astra to be a silver bullet for both demo sessions and production workloads where enterprises should invest to get the most from astra in production right um and i think one of the many questions actually kind of brought it out right there is really no silver bullet right and we know that in the software engineering field really there is nothing like a silver bullet because there's always pros and cons um so with respect to astra um you know i think uh let's say you know i want to be in a version that i want to control i want total control over that or something then like the last minute we said maybe you want to install cassandra apache cassandra yourself and kind of maintain that yourself because you want to be able to kind of stay with it you have your own process to do that and all that that's fine uh but on the contrary um you know if you if you want none of that maintenance nightmare right then astra is easy easy to use right uh it's very easy to get started uh we have uh attendees who come to our workshops routinely who say you know i can't even believe this is so easy to get started right so it's great to get started but again you know somewhere in between lies uh the complexity for kate sandra where you have to manage a kubernetes cluster and like what alex said you know kubernetes has gotten a lot simpler but it's still pretty complex to maintain right so so i think there is really no silver bullet um you know it's a great question uh and and what you would do is kind of lay out the requirements and based on that um you know you would you would do the appropriate thing that makes sense right uh okay yeah i i'm completely with you on that there is no silver bullet if someone uh tells you what this one is the perfect database or this one is a perfect solution one size fits all don't trust him or her because they are trying to sell something to you they just want your money and we give you multiple ways to go with the same powerful technology but utilize it in the way which fits you the best not your neighbor not your friend because they may have their own requirements and about the complexity you have seen the demo of the wrecks of kate sandra and uk you've seen the demo of astra uh by me rex made a huge job but you know what he spent actually i believe hundreds thousands of hours before that working with kubernetes learning how it works uh getting knowledge deeper and so on and so forth you've seen what like before straight's way much easier you just click a couple of buttons and you have your blaster runnings guys is that um you know the last place where i work where i um i i did use kubernetes a lot we had a kubernetes team that took over running that underlying infrastructure um so i never really had to worry about configuring or running kubernetes myself but i could run whatever i wanted on top of it so yes yes boom good now there are some questions in the chat i want to answer but in a moment first we have to proceed with the next part with the next step your path to the certification as i said before data stock sponsors your education and data stocks sponsor your certification so putting some energy into that and learning at the data stacks academy you can become a certified apache cassandra developer certified apache cassandra administrator or certified apache cassandra on kubernetes administrator we currently offer free certifications you will be much more qualified in no sql databases cassandra is one of the most powerful databases in the world and you're definitely going to be able to get better place a better job maybe a better salary i hope because usually certified experts get better salaries there are two main steps first three main steps first get the voucher and i'm sending my link to the chat right here so this is the form you have to feel to get your voucher for apache cassandra certification each voucher gives you two attempts uh then at this moment of course you are not ready to run cassandra uh except of maybe astra but even with astra it's better to understand how it works internally how do you use cassandra query language and so on and so forth so your main place uh to learn uh e and it is free will be academy.datastax.com and i'm putting https and i'm putting link to a chat and uh if your courses uh taken there is a special path for developers and special path for administrators so pick the path with youtube you can take the exam using the voucher you will get when you fill this form and don't wait for too long because form will be closed in an hour or something like that and that was it now it's the questions time [Music] yeah i suppose we've been doing a pretty good job of keeping up with the question someone did say where do we find the hands-on workshops i'm sending the link right now i'm send i'm sending the link right now excellent i was gonna say if you just look at the channel um you should see when they're when they're coming up i think we do have a a list of um like upcoming uh workshops so the most important workshop which will make a very good takeoff for you uh for cassandra uh the link is in the chat right now hands-on workshop but we do more and we have more interesting topics so i will put next link data stocks oops sorry tax.com workshops or shops i will send the link oops did the what okay there is a typo of course so that's a very important link and
