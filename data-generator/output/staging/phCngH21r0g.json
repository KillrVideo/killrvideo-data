  "title": "Performance Heaven with Intel Optane + DSE with Donnie Roberson | Ep. 107 Distributed Data Show",
  "description": "Donnie Roberson of the DataStax Partner team joins the show to talk about the amazing performance results observed in running DataStax Enterprise 6 on Intel's latest generation hardware including the Xeon processors and Optane DCPMM, and when and where you might be able to get your hands on this technology. \n\nHighlights:\n0:00 - Jeff welcomes Donnie to the show and gets distracted by the drone races in the Accelerate expo hall. \n1:54 - Donnie came to Cassandra from the Hadoop world and worked on the DataStax support team before making a move into into partner management and working on cool projects like the DataStax Docker images.\n2:57 - The DSE 6.0 release in 2018 introduced a Thread Per Core architecture to allocate token ranges to specific cores within each Cassandra node.\n4:17 - Intel has recently come out with the newest generation Xeon processors and Optane DCPMM. These two technologies are \"a match made in performance heaven\". \n5:08 - Intel gave DataStax access to a private lab with 4 machines with this new hardware - 364GB RAM, 80 core Intel 2nd generation scalable processors, 2 Optane DCPMM 1.2 GB drives per machine. \n5:51 - The workloads tested included 90% reads / 10% writes, 50% reads / 50% writes, 10% reads / 90% writes. On the write heavy test they observed 448 K ops/s (112 K ops/s per node). This is 2x performance over current NVMe drives. Read heavy workloads saw up to 5x performance impovement, with sub millisecond latencies.\n7:18 - This hardware is available from Intel now, it will also be coming to Google Cloud Platform within the next couple of quarters.\n8:11 - Jeff starts making up architectures on the fly involving Intel, GCP and DataStax Constellation.\n9:10 - The highlight of the Accelerate conference for Donnie is the opportunity to meet Cassandra users and DataStax customers.",

    "text": "hey it's Jeff carpenter developer advocate here at data sacks live here in the accelerate expo hall with Donnie Roberson no tea implied or intended just like no tea and plight or Intendant and Jeff's name I'm just kidding that's right it's not Robertson and it's not carpenter yes carpenter yes right that's good at straight people from data stacks this is the distributed data show um and even flying drones back here yeah and see this in the background did we talk about this you had about the drunk about the awesome drone flying I don't know if you can see the drones in air oh no we had in the net yeah we're offering everybody attending here at accelerate the opportunity to fly drones through a drone racing course and as a prize you get bragging rights with your company and you also get this really cool poster that I could have brought over here you should have we didn't plan on talking about that I'm just like squirrel drones this is the stuff that happens um but why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself I mean I know who you are but for our viewers out there who is Donnie what are you doing you mean all our viewers don't know who I am okay well this is going alright so I work on the technology partners team here in data stacks I work with our alliance partners and some of our strategic partners such as Intel which we'll talk about here in a few minutes okay cool cool okay pretty much like anything cool that someone is doing on top of or alongside or in some cases underneath Cassandra data sacks Enterprise you have a hand in it somewhere I get to look at it first I'm a little bit jealous yes I get to play with some really cool hardware before a lot of people even get to see it okay nice so how did you even get into this this world you know stupid databases and then partner management on top of that well I initially come from the Hadoop world so I I was doing a little bit of hive and HBase and I wanted to dig more into no sequel the basis so I heard about this database called Apache Cassandra and I started taking a look at it thought it was really cold and I heard about this company called data stacks and said I need it to go there okay and so I came to work and data stacks two and a half years ago where I initially started on the support team and started offering free labor to the partner team right and they decided that I needed to join their team right and you might hear a partner team and you might think like this is a bit more like I'm marketing and it's not like you were most often beating the crap can I say that out of something like and you were pretty instrumental in our docker rollout of docker images so anyway it's a guess pretty cool stuff but I know that what you're really excited about right now is this Intel partnership and some of the stuff we're doing in there so tell me a little bit about what's going on and maybe a little background improvement in the data sex Enterprise that enable it and all this kind of snow okay so to give you a little bit of background we got a step back in time to April of last year when we released the se 6.0 okay all right uh it was a once in a seven year rewrite as Jonathan Ellis said right so we added rates per core so this actually assigns each token range a single thread that thread okay within a node within an open range spread across the whole cluster but then with a given node within its range then you're subdividing that further to a single thread okay and then we assigned that thread to a specific core yeah okay and we added a few other enhancements to you know async processes along with some of the storage enhancements so that's kind of the background on the performance improvements that we made to DSE and not in itself was like two to three acts performance improvements on reads and writes open DSC correct right okay but there's more there is more so who would know a year later Intel would come out with their second generation Xeon scalable processors okay we're talking hardware - yeah we're talking hardware and their new obtained DCP mmm which stands for data center persistent memory that we can use that's storage so it's lightning fast storage right and you heard that right yes and when we say lightning fast we mean lightning fast so if you take Intel's improvements to their hardware right on top of our improvements to performance within DSC it's a match made in performance heaven so yeah talk that through for me I believe you but okay give me more okay so in Intel actually gave us access to a private private lab okay four nodes these were monster machines 364 gigs of ram 80 core intel second-generation scalable process okay and we we got to you know play with it and see what DSE could do on this hardwood oh can I forget to say it there there were two Intel obtained DCP mm 1.2 gigabyte modules in these machines okay so those are your drives those are our drives yeah so we tested three different workloads a 90/10 which is 90% writes 10% reads then we did a 50-50 workload which Peaks for itself and then a 1090 workload okay read heavy yeah read heavy workloads on the right heavy workloads we saw this throughput is amazing four hundred and forty eight thousand ops per second on a four node cluster four node that's a hundred and twelve thousand OS % per node her no oh okay and that was 2x performance over the nvme drives that Intel provided for us to benchmark against okay that's like the status quo to the exactly prior to now yes yeah yeah okay so when we hit the read heavy workloads we saw up to a 5x improvement and throughput and we saw latency sub-millisecond latency which was you know amazing and another game-changing actually yes and Intel actually publishes that using octane you can get nanosecond latencies yes nanoseconds okay well yeah I mean why not if it's all kind of like on the chip they're together yeah exactly okay so I want this how do I get it because it's not like I can run out and do this right now or can I I mean like what's the availability timeframe for this you can if you have the money to drop on the hardware yeah you can go out and purchase this hardware from Intel and and servers now okay what about I'm a public cloud customer when's this gonna be coming available like you know to a cloud near me okay funny that you say that so Intel and Google have partnered and they will be offering the second generation scalable Xeon processors and the octane devices in GCP with an upcoming offering in the next couple of quarters okay so anybody and everybody will have access to this hardware to see they're bringing it to the masses okay I'm imagining just the mind is boggling with like I'm inventing architectures in my head right now like okay my data tier I'm just gonna run it on this new solution and then I scale in my app tier above that and we can have fun with this yes we can have lots of fun with it and I'm looking forward to actually getting my hands on that hardware in GCP just just to do some plain as well right right of course everyone's gonna want to know the magic combination of the attacks constellation our Cassandra as a service offering that we just announced this week plus what's the improvements to the core most of you know the core DSE plus the improvements the hardware improvements from the Intel I mean who knows when this will all be available as one package but the markets gonna want it yeah I'm looking forward to it just like everybody else out out there and BBS land it's looking to have play with this as well if you can't tell I'm super excited about DDS land that's perfect yeah it's so cool so anything else exciting about the conference or stuff you're looking forward to this week ah just meeting all of these customers and Cassandra users it's great that we've gotten the gang back together in three years right since the since the last event of this magnitude so yes exactly cool well super exciting week thanks for joining us on the show thank you very much young see you around look I'm flattered own with you in a little bit okay sounds great cool okay see you next time",
