    "text": "sorry that was basically all my knowledge so this session will be kept in english uh hope next year we will do it again with some updated questions in portuguese as well but for now we will go for the english version anyway the exam is in english certification isn't in english so you need to know at least how to read the questions hope it will be fine for you and we are starting right now how are you doing is everything fine [Music] please write in the youtube chat if you can see me if you can hear me and we will start stream looks good on my side everything cloud and clear and green so i want to know what you can hear me well too and meanwhile let's start so uh my name is alex wolvichsniff i'm developer advocate lead at data stacks basically my job is to make developers successful via apache cassandra because it's not a simple technology maybe you know already it's extremely powerful but on the scale from a bicycle and to an airplane like boeing or airbus it's very much on the boeing scale right so you need to know some things one of the problems companies [Music] meet then they start to use cassandra is what there is not enough qualified cassandra developers in the world because companies like apple companies like netflix are vacuuming the job market attracting everyone they can find and with their salaries it's quite easy for them to work on the market and like then all the other companies are like how do we find any cassandra enabled developer or administrator short answer is they don't even have to because data stacks offers those trainings for free you will see soon in the resources part uh what you can use to get your tradings and they available for free now next thing is then uh what um you can do for that you can stay with us you can learn cassandra you can get your certification for free and then that will be a very good reason for you to get a better job or get a better salary find more interesting project and so on and so forth and that's what i do i help developers to succeed on this way and i love my job all the materials for this training this certification preparation trainings are available on github via github.com datastax academy workshop cassandra certification two words about apache cassandra but i believe as you are attending cassandra day brazil you already know what is it at least in some basics at least in some fundamentals right uh nosql distributed decentralized database what makes it more powerful than others but also more complex it's ready for big data for petabytes of data for data of any scale you may need to handle it provides the highest availability geographical distribution incredible read and also right performance zero downtime and it's vendor independent it's controlled by apache software foundation non-profit non-commercial organization cassandra scales horizontally not vertically and it scales linearly so the more nodes you add higher firepower you have or higher volume you have and that is great also cassandra is distributed everywhere cassandra trademark is multiple data center deployments over the world the if all of them are active there is nothing like masternode in cassandra terminology but what matters for us is what there is in cassandra um every node is active and you can write to every node every node is able to handle any request also cassandra is a hybrid cloud and multicloud solution so you can work across multiple clouds in ones or you can work using for example amazon web services and your own on-premises data center simultaneously adding data centers or just adding new nodes is a zero downtime totally automated prod process as a developer why should you care about the certification short answer is because cassandra is a very cool technology to solve uh high scale problems for big companies cassandra was originally developed in facebook to solve facebook sites project problems and um we did this uh photo uh a couple of years three years already go well you know time flies three years ago the data stacks accelerate conference in maryland united states and me or some of my colleagues i did this photo too for the scope and scale of cassandra and apple because there are some incredible numbers millions and millions of millions of queries per second hundreds petabytes of data and so on if you want to work on the big scale projects in the companies like netflix or instagram that's definitely very promising technology to learn cassandra is one of the most top paid databases in the world somewhere in top three of well-paid databases one of the most interesting cassandra users and also developers is netflix because for netflix basically every cassandra is everything it's a primary source of trough with dozens of millions of operations per second on a single most active cluster and they have hundreds of clusters so that's also very interesting use case and netflix guys are totally amazing we have a dedicated talk um cassandra at netflix very new one it was done on cassandra day india some months ago we also organized cassandra de india and netflix cloud uh principal architect is an indian guy uh so um he did an incredible report on how do they use cassandra and net netflix and i totally recommend watching this one data stocks dot io cassandra at netflix it's very interesting one now uh what comes next let me check yeah amount of data only grows and grows and grows and grows so if you uh want to stay on top of these trends then you definitely need to know how to use technologies what are capable to handle data of any size and that's definitely this one which certification should i get that is a great question uh there are two primary certifications one for administrator one for developer and that is interesting point a normal price of a certification is somewhere around 150 united states dollars but uh as uh we with a voucher we give you the 100 discount this voucher actually gives you two attempts so if you are primary a developer but you would be interested also learning on the operations with cassandra and you would like to have two certificates it's totally doable if you will succeed if you will pass the developer exam from the first attempt you will still have a second attempt left right so you can go for administrator certification that also will work and this way you can get both but obviously for developers who recommend developer certification for operations we recommend administrator certification that's going to be quite obvious what resources do i have to get ready for vest certification story is simple there are a few first and most important place for me in person my favorite site regarding all the cassandra trainings is obviously data starts academy academy.datastarts.com it's a free trading online trainings so you don't pay for a registration for courses they are free there you have administrator learning path and developer learning path accordingly to the one you need to take and each of them includes three courses one important thing i would mention there is a data modeling course which is included into the developer path but not included into the admin path what i would definitely recommend to take it both for admins and developers without proper understanding of the data modeling it's not going to be easy to make this success happen with cassandra data model done wrong is the easiest way to fail and if you want don't want it to happen you better pay attention to data modeling okay now all the explanations about uh what are the rules what's the process of a certification it's all explained at here datastax.com certifications so everything explain it then and also after this workshop you after this training you obviously will have a better understanding of how it all works uh two more resources we have discord server where you can ask questions uh some from someone who has passed the certification already it's available on data starts dot io discord and if you prefer more of a stack overflow or forum kind of experience this place will be community.datastax.com which may be very helpful for you to get ready too asking questions reading questions maybe a bit later answering questions also very good one now finally uh for those who prefer book books uh there is a cassand of a definitive guide written by my colleague jeff carpenter and his friend evan hewitt and uh thanks to the collaboration of o'reilly and datastax o'reilly publisher's house this book is available for you for free in the uh as an e-paper i mean it's not a printed book it's a e-book but it's available for free and there are no trees cut off to publish it so you know it's kind of a win-win-win solution you get your training for free and forests are safe so that's totally great that sounds totally great to me now a few more questions a few more points what you may need as i said the root thing to understand the core thing to understand about cassandra is a proper data modeling and we created a slash a special thing uh data modeling by example it's available on datastax.com learn data modeling by data modeling by example and that's important to know that's kind of secret but i will share with you what samples from these data modeling by example training i use it uh straightforwardly in the exam so if you want to be really ready for the exam you totally must visit this place and walk through that samples as we explain them they were developed by a artem chibako a phd also our colleague who invented develop a data modeling methodology for apache cassandra and he really knows what he's doing so uh their scenarios will be very helpful to you to get ready now how to get ready process is very simple uh first go to the academy.datas.com you can use site materials like book or like what for me primary places the academy you pick the path what's most important for you like admin or developer that is good as soon as your learning path is complete you write an email to academy at datastax.com justin in any form like i completed this course that's my email i use it to register at the academy please send me the voucher you will get your voucher if there are any questions or anything or you cannot reach academy just to have a plan b i always prefer to have plan b that's linked to my profile on linkedin so you can reach me on linkedin ask your questions by the way i will be happy to answer and if you need anything to get better ready for the exam contact me as well then prepare for the exam read through that certification rules of course but we will discuss them briefly actually right now so that is a real exam proctored exam you have to follow the rules uh if proctor thinks you are cheating he can he or she can interrupt the exam of course it's not happen out of a blue you first get warned and so on so i will share my experience with you but first regarding the rules first this is a closed book exam so no reference materials uh no um cheat sheets no nothing is allowed only you your brain and your laptop i mean like only the exam window you are not allowed to switch to any another thing to avoid cheating of course we want this certificate to be available so people will know what owners of this certificate i really know what they're doing and sadly we've encountered some cheating before so our rules are quite strict on this exam sorry but that's good for you if you are not a cheater then you will just get benefits out of that um live proctor will watch you uh through the exam so you will need that camera uh facing you so uh he will be he or she will be able to see you one more thing by the way a proctor will ask you to show you to show him or her the room you are located in to check if there are anyone in the room maybe to give you some hints and i was not ready for that so my room was totally messy and it wasn't actually very it didn't feel good to show such a messy room uh i was not ready for that so if you are going to take the exam don't forget to clean it up yeah uh okay good exam area should be clear of any paper device or other materials no programs no browser windows can be opened during exam and it will be a required part um as a preparation for the exam to install a special software watching what you are not switching windows and so on and so forth of course no screenshots photography any other means of copying of the materials are not allowed of course so rules say you will need a small mirror like a handheld mirror uh so you can show the background of what you have to a proctor but in my case i was just asking to turn the webcam to left to right so it's not a big deal if you have multiple mirrors you have to switch them off so for example i have a primary display and i have laptop i had to switch off the primary display and use only my laptop then proctor will uh can make uh some notifications report some incidents uh make sure you follow your guidelines now don't be too worried about that it's totally fine if you uh get a notification i got one two or maybe three during the exam first of all you are not allowed to eat or drink during the exam by the way exam is quite long so be ready what uh you have enough uh water and food before the exam you are not allowed to drink or eat during the exam i forgot about that so i got my notification by itself it's not a big deal don't worry everyone is getting them second notification i got was because when i think really a lot i start to talk to myself and you are not allowed to talk during the exam because some cheaters use it to wait to pass their questions to someone helping them so you are not allowed to talk during exam uh that sounds like quite a lot of rules but you know what at least you don't have to travel to the closest certification center and take it in person you can do it from home so this benefit is quite more than just a strict requirement of not talking during the exam yeah and of course you will need and some password or something like government issued id the photon driving license maybe passport whatever works in your country as a government-issued identificator uh if expiration date is viewable now you can request postponement of the exam it's fine exam requires 90 minutes in the duration and you will need mostly probably most of them there are quite a lot of questions a timer is displayed an example and you know when the exam will be over if you have any kind of a network outage or power outage you will have 20 minutes to access the exam back and you will not know those questions will answer it right or wrong you will only get the result passed or not passed good a demo of this process you can find at the data stacks academy data stack certification online course third course shows uh you how it goes how it works so you can see it closer when i passed when i took my certification it was not available it was not created yet so i didn't have such great materials good uh take your exam step four you take your exam using a certification on the metal.com you will get a link when you get a voucher you will also get a link to sign up where you use this voucher so you don't have to make screenshots or anything you will be good and basically take the exam and you have the best of the best um if you paid enough attention and learned well enough you will pass it like i'm totally sure okay now a thing we are going to do right now is the demo exam first i have to ask you a couple of questions and then we will proceed to the exam but first i want to understand something about you i introduced myself now it's your turn please let's go to mention open mendy.com using the qr code close to me or just going to maintain.com and enter the code 19122018 it's on the screen enter the code and i will see what uh i will be able to ask you questions i will paste the code in the youtube chat one nine one two two zero one eight boom so please use this code on mention.com you can use your mobile phone or anything whatever you prefer and let me ask you a couple of questions just scanning the qr code will work as well one two three we have to go on okay i see there are some people joining already thank you for joining please jump in the more of a merrier and it's totally unanimous so you don't have to put any of your data how much experience do you have with relational databases okay we have some people already with some experience that is great let me show if you need a qr code let me show you a qr code again i don't know if you need it if you don't or if you do let me know uh i will show it again okay so we have few people join it thank you for that and i see we can we may have some more attendees please jump in then next question how much experience do you have with apache cassandra never used it less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years okay so that's quite cool we have people the cassandra experience that is nice thank you for much uh thank you so much for joining now if you don't have any solid experience with cassandra that's totally fine that's how that how we make you successful with cassandra using our courses if you experience it already i still suggest you to refresh your knowledge maybe not taking the wall cassandra course but at least taking data modeling course because it's like the very important one there are many people even experienced one who misunderstood cassandra data modeling i met them many times good what's what are your favorite database management systems uh are you each is cassandra your true favorite or are there any more uh database management systems you prefer the most maybe you fan of a it's totally fine i like you you are not ashamed to admit that or maybe you prefer microsoft sql server now that's the moment you can be ashamed no no i'm kidding of course so personally for me cassandra is my favorite for the big scale problems for the global applications i like flexibility of that's of course cool uh monkey doesn't scale so well for them rights but if you don't have uh too much loaded application then it also may be a good choice and postgres postgres is always good as long as you can afford it so your data fits into a single machine good i said oh no for jay amazing yes very cool one uh oracle cassandra posgras good thank you for your answers so now we can proceed with the uh demo of the exam you will answer i will ask questions you will answer them using painting it's not a real exam but you will see what's the level of knowledge you have so we get to the exam now uh first we start with the questions of the ds 201 course uh it's for both administrators and developers so whatever path you take you need to know the answers and i'm going to start this one in a second yeah okay so it's no question number one we get to get back enter just check that out give me a moment right now here we go so first question uh consider sql statements create table roller cluster name park rating primary key name and following insert statements how many rows will the runner cluster table have after executing all of those sql statements i will turn on them some music music won't play during the exam but now i think it will be fine if music is too loud write me message on youtube chat so we will see how it goes so what's the story how many rows these table will have after executing those four and search statements i cannot see how much time left so if anyone would send me a message on the youtube chat what time is over or i will see i can switch to maintain but it will you know what i will join you on maintain and when i will see what how much time left i think we are done there is not so much time so the code is oops yeah time is over most of you gave the answer c which is correct answer so what was well done one two one one nine one two two zero one eight good now i'm with you and i can see then the time is over good so we know the answer but why this answer is right by c so free is the right answer for you that must be easy already we know what first and fourth inserts use the same primary key to make house and absurd and as a result only three rows are created it's both millennium force millennium force name name and name is a primary key so as a result it will have millennium force 0.7 absurd well well well well let's go when uh secure developer and administrator exam consider the secure statement create table so okay i will start call countdown and we will get back to the screen consider the secure statement create a recreate table we again execute four insert values what's the result of executing all those sequence statements will be the table with one partition two partitions three partitions or four partitions obviously that's a question on the understanding of the partitioning and answer is quite obvious must be quite obvious if you have understanding of how a partition key works okay i think i know the answer by the way if everyone in menchie will give the answer then menti will be stopped earlier so if you are waiting for something to push for button don't wait it's a test exam not a real one so don't be afraid to make a mistake oh bye [Music] i okay loading result so it was correct answer correct answer is the table with four partitions partition key consists of artist and title so each insert will have an unique artist title pair so there are no absurds and we have four partitions as a result now let me see your answers and looks like a mistake and take a look uh that's important point i want to highlight take a look because of those parentheses we see what the first argument of a primary key will be artist and title not like artists partition key and title is the primary column uh each clustering code no they both are partitioned as a result beatles yesterday because it's letter b abba french synandre yesterday that's quite easy it's going to be a table with four partitions very well so i'm starting and next question [Music] question number three and let's get there developer and administrator exams consider the secure statement create table cars model make year color cost primary key mate model your color which of the full link is a valid query for the cars table okay i think i know what answer and what will be your answer also very interesting to me which of the follower following is a valid query for the cars table the secret is secret for beginners experienced cassandra users know that for sure what you cannot execute just random queries uh on your cassandra table you need to know you have to design your tables properly based on the queries you are going to execute so which of the following is a valid query for the cars table we are almost done with this question and i gave the right answer hope you too yeah not bad so take a look that's a very interesting story answer c is correct feature for following is a valid query now take a look that's easy to fail to see first you always have to specify all parts of a partition key in your query so partition key consists of make and model obviously answer a is wrong because it has only make and answer b is wrong too because it has here color but doesn't have make a model at all but now answer c and d they both have make and model how come then answer c is correct and answer d is wrong take a look in cassandra partition keys define their data will be allocated how data will be allocated over the cluster and clustering columns define how data will be stored physically on disk because they define sorting a sorting order with a partition that gives one unexpected outcome uh you can specify in your very clustering columns you can skip them it's totally fine but what's the limitation if you're going to use uh clustering column in your query which has predecessors some previous clustering clustering columns you always must specify them too in this case year is the first very first clustering column so the search query we've specified a year is totally valid you can do that it will work for mustang 1969 great car if you ask me then it will work like ford mustang 69 all good color is not specified we are good but last player last query uses color without specifying gear and then this missing here it's bad it's wrong a data cannot be found based on that so you have to specify in this case here and then color so there are two options first you have to skip color at all or second you have to specify here or maybe you will need an index to make these uh column searchable also but indexes in cassandra is a bit special story okay so let me see how many of you made it oops good very good now we ask our leaderboard so nice maverick gave free right answers but a good result croc 2 and sakura 1. well well well well we are starting next question question number four so let's go for the question number four create table employees create table employees by department they are very similar just the difference is the partition key begin batch insert to employee employees insert into employees by department so far so good then apply batch which is a valid statement about this batch single partition can be applied single partition can not be applied multipartition can be applied multi partition can not be applied time is ticking it's sticking right okay it's not taking care of sorry i should flaunt it count down first so what's going to be your answer what's going to be your answer is it's a single partition batch or multi-partition budget can it be applied or cannot be applied what's right about this situation hey you see how we are using generalization and that's pretty important to understand because well denormalization is the key to success some people were taught uh viva told in the universities we were told in on the choruses like or whatever you learn it what normalization is good and then normalization is bad but the world real world real life is not a star wars movie you know uh you uh it's not like light side of before it's dark side of the forest it's not like that actually as the good engineer you need to know both normalization and generalization understand when to apply them normalization is great as long as you can afford it but the normalization is slow on read time and you know what customers hate to wait if your customers are waiting for too long they will switch to your competitor and you don't want it right me neither so uh the normalization we will have to execute multiple writes but it's fine because with cassandra i can easily execute them in parallel and the problem of the joints is what in most of the cases joints joints can be executed only consecutively so one by one by one next next next next but there is no way to run them in parallel and as a result that's not going to be fast oh i gave a correct answer good so let's see what was the correct answer it's a multi-partition batch what can be applied first how come it's a multi-partition budget very easy it uses two different tables and obviously partition cannot be crosstable so if you work with two different tables you will work with at least two different partitions right there is no way to have one partition in multiple tables at once no way so it's a multi-partition budget simple then can it be applied or cannot there is nothing wrong with the statement so it's correct it's all good so as long as your key space is selected in the beginning of this survivors gray table create table begin but you will be good well well well well well well okay looks like there are some people doing mistakes but that's again don't worry we have you cover it we have free courses for you and even a free book for you book is great by the way also much recommended so question number five developer and administrator exams you needed to know it for the buff consider the table definition viva primary key and meet it great table reviews by restaurant blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we know what restaurant review are neatly identified by a combination of a name city and a review restaurant preview are retrieved from a table using combination of a name and ct and we also know what the table has multi-row partitions [Music] what primary key does this table have it's a very good question oh i have to give the answer too oops and i have to think a bit [Music] time flies but you still have some moments to answer okay looks like time is over right oh yeah time is over hey there are now more of us that's amazing so most of you gave the right answer answer b correct so why answer b is correct let's take a look thereafter you a few things in those statements you really need to understand restaurant review each review is uniquely identified by a name of a review name of a restaurant city where it's located and reviewer it gives us enough information to understand the primary key which is mostly probably going to be name ctn reviewer right then restaurant reviews are reviewed from the table using combination of a name and city notice what reviewer is unemitted that means what our partition key is definitely or name or ct or both of them maybe and now we know what it has a multi-role partition so obviously if it has multiple partitions it means what primary what partition key is not equal to uh primary key and then let's see what name and ct is the better option when just name reviewer or name reviewer or review name because we are going to retrieve data using only name cd and reviewer will work as a clustering column correct answer is answer b well well well well well well so most of you made it right and that's great actually let's move on i'm launching the question number six so consider the table definition and sql query create table teams name wins losses ties then select all from teams by wins where wins equals four at this point you can ask me why do we create table teams but read from teams by means answer is later which materialized view definition can be used to support the query you see that's a question about materialized views materialized views now considered experimental uh but still maybe in some scenarios very good solution and definitely um something to know how it works although as in general case in general case for most of us scenarios i would recommend to be very careful with materialized views there are some limitations to consider so uh old plane old-school den normalization may be a better choice than my materialized view but still which materialized view definition can be used to support blackberry now let me think to answer [Music] i think i know what answered hey i get the correct answer let's take a look okay now distribution was a little bit bigger uh okay but and uh it looks like only i gave the right answer okay uh happens that's a true you see it's good you're passing a training exam uh it's a mistake but now you will know why so let's go forward take a look uh first thing we need to know notice what uh in the query we do select all from teams by wins by means equals four we query data only using wins that means what we always have to give all the parts of a partition key partition key therefore e and we are giving only wins what is a partition key means of course so partition key name doesn't punch partition key name doesn't much okay means name sounds better vince name sounds better now what's the difference between answers d and b they are basically equivalent except one and only one thing here we say is not now and name is not null in our grade materializer to use definition take a look you cannot have nulls in the primary key so when you create a materializer view you must specify uh what you cannot you will not pull any null values into their materialized use it will just not work uh the nulls and not allowed them so when you need to have there some real data that's why answer d is correct well now what's the leaderboard first of all a great uh for the newcomers great job uh okay looks like i got to the first place but you know that's fine i worked with cassandra for quite some time so it totally makes sense and i already posted this certification right you know now and cp and sakura share three thousand points free right answers and tiger baby joining presently so i believe it was the first answer and mili also joined it very recently ah there are still plenty of questions to answer so question number seven let's take a look at it question number seven and that is a developer exam so that's a question for developers not administrators but still better to know consider the table definition and the sql query create table restaurants by city select all from restaurants by city the city sydney and cuisine sukshin and we know what now we are doing a mistake because with specified cd partition key not bad but when we query by cuisine which is not a part of a primary key therefore we cannot search on that technically we can with a secondary index so that's complex question if you didn't use secondary indexes you won't be able to answer it first probably but still let's try to guess which secondary index can be used to support the query and there are four options [Music] okay this one is easy if you know how it works i will explain it in a moment so i hope you're glad you've joined already while you are thinking i will made a little notice on the secondary indexes in general still the best way to work with cassandra using old plane then normalization secondary indexes have strong have some strong limitations secondary indexes are mostly limited to the partition you are using and if you go through multiple partitions that will not work and um there are some improvements in this field for example uh storage attached to secondary indexes as a stable attached secondary index is developed by apple some years ago now a storage attached index is developed by data stocks some time ago last year basically but still secondary index have some strong limitations you need to know so answer a is correct of a very simple thing a b c and d are incorrect because indexes and multiple columns are not supported that's it but notice how this index works it works only because i specify the partition and then i can use index so if i wouldn't specifies it it still will not work because indexes are attached to all partitions good so what about the okay guys i'm sorry looks like yeah i again was the only one who gave the right answer okay that happens let's go to the next question question number eight here we go this one looks much simpler which statement pattern describes verb clause in a query where clauses must reference all the fields of the partition key where clauses must reference all the fields of the clustering key where clauses must reference all the fields of a primary key where clauses must reference all the fields of a partition key and clustering ok this one is simple you can answer that even if you have no experience with cassandra but attended first and second workshops of the cassandra d brazil then you will be able to answer these questions to answer this question so [Music] time is almost over question is simple don't look for any tricks and just simple as it is and okay i guessed it right well not really guessed let's take a look oops yeah right very simple very close must reference all the parts or the fields of a partition key if it's one or more you have to specify all of them things like clustering key primary key are not required at all so it's very simple now let me see how was it hey much better this time much better this time i see someone answer it c and d c c must reference all the fields of the primary key means partition and clustering clustering are optional and d is basically the same all the fields of a partition key correct and clustering key not correct they are optional so let's start the next question question number nine and here we go developer and administrator exams consider the sql statement create type name create table people which insert statement can be used to insert a rule in the people table this question is on the knowledge of a user udt user types in cassandra you can create your own user-defined type in this case we create type name first last both text and then we just use these type in your table name type name then you have to insert data then how exactly you are doing that this is also a very simple answer if you know how it works and if you don't you will have to guess but i will give you no hints no hints except only one cassandra is a big friend of jason i shouldn't be doing that but that's not a real exam so i'm not too sad too if my hint if my tip was enough for you to guess answer then that's great i will feel great about that but if it's not well then it's not a real exam so time is almost over and okay i gave the correct answer this time quite surprised now let's see correct answer is a insert into people id name email values uuid then some json then some email now take a look what is it it's just a normal plain json and cassandra perfectly supports it so when working with udt you use json simple as that then you don't need anything like name uber no that will not work this one is obviously wrong because this way you suggest id name email but give one two three four different arguments and this one is not json at all it's just wrong so right answer is a now let me see who made it yeah someone made it right this time not only meme but some people have chosen b and d if you didn't use uh before udt when you just don't know it's totally fine that's how you get ready for the exam right good so let me launch next oh leaderboard right so hey batman moving forward getting close to tiger baby good sakura and cp are both on the four correct answers that is good and ted join it recently and don't have points yet that's okay so let's move on and let me start next question so question number 10 and here we go consider the sql statement create table emails by user insert in the inserting the update select what's the result of executing those secure statements now i will stay quiet because i have to read the statements to give the answer [Music] [Music] okay i think i know answer this is a trap this question is really great and if you do not know the answer it will be really easy to fail if you don't understand how some fields work okay time is over now i want to see the results okay no many of you made it i actually expected some fail and more fails because it's a tricky question but most of you made it right and that's for good answer c is wrong answer b is right but usually i see on this question mistake what people pick answer a so let me see the outcome again c is wrong let me explain it why c is wrong take a look the primary key consists of username and email and here we insert username email username email to different emails it leads us what we have two rows in these um partition when we update something set uh nicknames and description blah blah blah um but that doesn't change anything select we'll have to return two rows so obviously a and b are the right answer and c and d are wrong because we query for all the rows of a partition dc one two three four simple as that now i still want to explain why answer a is wrong because actually it is the question of the static fields understanding take a look we run this update here emails by user for the username dc1234 emaildavidgmail.com set nickname davey description school and here we see david gmail.com davey school so this row updated and that is right but what's wrong here what looks wrong here as long as you don't understand static fields how come what nickname or david datastyle.com has nicknamed davey although it was created on the datastax.com with a date why answer a is wrong and the story is very simple now take a look the nickname field has a property static and static is the quite unique uh thing very important to understand and many scenarios it may be very convenient to use it may save you a lot of place a lot of uh i don't know disk space a lot of efforts and so on but we need to understand how it works static fields are shared across all their partition so it's enough to change the static property of a single row and all the other rows of the same partition will get it updated it's very convenient for example uh for some operations on the denormalized table where you have some property duplicated for example i don't know an address or all the goods in an order like we are buying something on amazon and then we have some goods and those goats needs to have the address we have address and the goods for the normalization purposes but when someone changes this address and we don't want to change uh to update or like it manually for all the rows it's enough for us to update address for one single line and it will be applied to all of the lines maybe it's not the best example but i hope i explained to you how static field works that's very important to understand well not bad not bad at all usually i see more mistakes on this question now question number 11 let's take a look that's architecture exams on the course of ds201 consider two data centers in the diagram tokyo one one in tokyo japan and one in paris france tokyo dc has six nodes two failed four acting a replication factor of three and paris dc has four nodes one failed reactive and the replication factor of green what is a valid statement about a read request made at consistency level of a local quorum to a coordinator node that in the paris dc so this node receives this query request will be handled in data center paris dc and will fail request will be handled in data center paris dc and will succeed the request will be retried in data center tokyodc and will fail will fail the request or yeah a request will be rewritten data centered to accuracy and will succeed that is obviously a question on the understanding of the local quorum and consistency levels in general and that is actually very simple question time is almost over loading results yes i gave a right answer that's quite cool but let me see what about you oh my god that's a great job now everyone answer gave the right answer great job team thank you so looks like guys doing workshops did a good job today and yesterday good so request will be handled in data center parisi and will succeed why take a look we have the same data replication factor free in tokyo and replication factor 3 in paris and we execute a query on let's first take a look at the quorum quorum means majority majority for replication factor three is true right like that's quite obvious then in the parent dc we have four servers and there are two scenarios our data located on those three xyz servers when all replica servers on our dc are available for this piece of data we are requesting and um we can execute this query evenly for consistency level all and still get the answer right there is a second scenario our data is stored on the server dave w and two of those doesn't matter if it will be x y or y z no difference if that also will work it means what we can not execute with query on the consistency level all but still we can execute his query on consistency level quorum and that's all what we need to know regarding perisdc what about the tokyo dc again there are two scenarios our data is stored on those three nodes for example or those frame when we can execute up to all then our data can be stored on those f a b when we have one replica node down but still two up so all will not work but quorum will work and final scenario we a third option we have our data on abc or bcd in this case the only way for us to successfully execute query is to use consistency level one [Music] or for write any if it's right but it's read so yeah read request right so uh quorum will fail in tokyo dc in some potential scenarios but right now does that really matter no doesn't matter even if the tokyo dc is completely wiped out uh i don't know destroy it by a monster [Music] kidnapped by aliens whatever still we do a local quorum or whatever it's deceived and periscy is not so much on fire only one note is down it can be even planet upgrade uh so it's maybe not necessarily some power outage network outage maybe a planet restart schedule it will start our cluster still available for local quorum for paris this for tokyo dc it may be different but the query coordinator was z so this server got the query so simple as that now yeah it was easy for you so you made a great job well well question number 12 architecture exams consider those secure creases at what elapsed time is the data persisted so what if you survive an unexpected note shut down 690 milliseconds 1834 microseconds 2193 microseconds 2966 microseconds [Music] [Music] okay i know the answer you must be busy reading so i have a hint for these kind of questions there are plenty of them but i will give it to you as soon as you will first answer all of you uh yay i gave the right answer good to know i still remember something now let me see how it goes for you yeah most of you made it one mistake let's take a look so first thing you need to understand about those questions there are two traps you can fall into so you have to be very careful first in some cases secured race locks can be quite big both in down in vertical and in horizontal so you may need to scroll above to the right and to the bottom to get to the whole situation that's important to understand so you don't miss a half of blocks second thing you really need to understand source ip in some scenarios there will be multiple nodes collaborating and questions on the reading of a multiple secular traces from multiple sources at once as a part of a single query right so when you have to understand what timings will be different for different nodes and you need to make no mistake on that getting it together because logs are written simultaneously in parallel so now answering the question at what elapsed time is data persist so it will survive an unexpected notes and not shut down some of you know already what cassandra uses so call it right ahead law or commit lock and as soon as data gets to the node it will be as soon as possible added to the commit lock and only then really process and commit lock is persistent so as soon as data is written to commit lock even the note shutdown doesn't matter it's not scary because as soon as node recovers commit lock will be replayed and data will be recovered easily so take a look timestamp zero secure query started to being executed temp stamp three two eight parsing the statement uh timestamp 690 preparing statement uh timing 1834 determining replicas for limitation so we are finding replica servers our replica servers what has to be affected then as its coordinator it's uh well it will happen on each node but anyway appending to commit lock 2 193 and only then adding to mem table request complete so on two nine one three source elapsed time the query will be persisted already it's not yet in mm table it's not yet inserted string table but it's already persistent uh so node will survive restart with this data kept that's important to understand so good job those who gave this answer my respect let's move on question number 13. let's scroll to question number 13. okay i explained it how is replication factor configured in the sunbra bird cluster where key space per reparation per node hey this one is the easiest one you must know it already especially even if you have no experience with cassandra in this case you know it for sure but even if you don't you must have visited a workshop yesterday and we did that we discussed that so must be not a big deal let me check meanwhile maybe you have some questions [Music] okay time is almost over so i hope you gave my answer already all those questions this one is the easiest one i think so obviously replication factor is configured per key space and strategy is configured 30 space and i would also add her key space and per data center but it's not a part of this question hey so okay most of you made it right it's not configured per node that for sure it's configured turkey space per uh data center now we are getting to administrator questions so uh maybe some of you uh developers it will be harder for you to answer but again don't afraid to fail that's a training grounds if you fail on the training grounds that's good it means you are learning something so that's a perfect place to fail it's much better than to fail on production right so let's go i guess we will see a leaderboard now right so who made it better now i see ted made 3 000 points and simba 2000 so okay cp is we don't count me i know those questions and answers for her but cp is on the first place sakura and batman are on the second attack a little bit lower and simply in tiger baby a little bit behind but again don't worry you know what we aren't dispatching uh ferraris or apartments villas for your first places it's just a training exam so don't take it too close i like the competition good so next questions question number 14 let's take a look what are two options for inter node encryption in cassandra chose to client node rec enabled bc in the real exam you will have to pick two answers main t we use today does not support multiple answers multiple choice questions so it will be enough to pick any single right answer it will be already counted as the right answer so don't worry don't take too close with chose to just try to guess a single one you will need to know both uh on the exam but take a look it's an administrator exam if you are taking a developer exam you will not meet this question good so oh i have to answer i'm sticking [Music] yes i gave the right answer so let's take a look story is simple it's an inter node encryption so encryption of a data transfer between different nodes answer a is obviously wrong client is not involved in the internet encryption then node will be a quite a weird answer for inter node encryption like should it be somehow inside node no not not really enabled is also a wrong answer if there is even a hint of chose 2. and then finally rec and dc don't forget network topology nodes are into the racks racks are into the dc very easy to remember available options are all known at the rec level at the dc level very simple good so uh most of you made the right answers very well then when we go for question number 15. so which configuration file is used to set garbage collection properties for poor cassandra poor operations people they have to remember it all right like developer questions are so much better i'm totally sure then uh answers are cassandra yama gvm options cassandra f.s.h gc dot options by the way as long as i remember answer will be different for cassandra version 4 but that exam based on cassandra version 3 because cassandra version 4 was released on the recipe we worked to deliver exams for cassandra version 4 of course but still it's recommended to pass the exam best certification because development of the exam for cassandra version 4 will take some time and it's not going to happen next week let's say for next month hopefully this year hopefully it's here if you don't know you can throw a dice or maybe a coin but there are four options so it will be harder a bit harder to make it with the coins but as we are i.t guys and coin basically can be in zero and one just two fronts of the two flows of the coin will give us two bits zero one two four here must be good even with a coin we can easily count even with a single coin we can easily count to four hey i gave the correct answer so correct answer is gvm options cassandra runs in gvm therefore garbage collection properties are configured via gbm specific things so was it hard for you no hey maybe there are no developers are the only administrators here how did you do it oh man okay that's something i didn't expect i didn't expect at all question 16. so let's go to question 16. consider a table definition and how a single row is stored in an om table and two access tables on a cassandra node create table data in mam table data in first as a stable data in second sustainable what are the current values for this row it's a very good question now i need to think a little bit because i don't remember okay i hope i did it i don't want to fail right in front of all of you now you know my nickname and the quiz hey correct answer now i'm happy well well well well well hey you cannot be serious you are doing great people okay then maybe there is nothing to explain here right you already know all the answers data for the row may and mostly probably will be spread across multiple mm table and ss tables because cassandra is a column family database so that's very interesting to see how data is scored id timestamp score timestamp but it in mem table we don't even have test value why because it wasn't updated recently by time was updated so here we see with the timestamp what's the oldest value and how it was changing as we consider one single row then id value is never changing because it's a primary key things can change a test and score and then they can see what originally when we it was just inserted well mostly probably test was english and score was 48 we see it by the oldest timestamp when we see what it was updated both test and score with a new timestamp all together both test and score were updated at the same moment of the time mostly probably it's a single update right when we see a mem table we have only score at leads the latest uh timestamp and wherever we have id 11 well that's always like that score will be 75 and when we have to peak uh test value from the most fresh right this is a stable keeps uh stale data so it will be cleaned up during the compaction and this one keeps the right data we can judge by return stamp write answer b and you made it just perfectly like that's a great job well leaderboard who made it will be anyone able to overtake cpe now you see cp is still on the first place but batman gets closer and closer and ted is right behind batman okay and simply sakura getting better well well well well well well so we see we have few questions left we are almost done so question number 17. what is a valid statement about a coordinator node handling query at the consistency level 3 a coordinator node sensed read direct read requests to all replicas b coordinator node centered red direct read request to free reference c coordinator node sends a background repair request free replicas d coordinator node sends the direct read request to one replica and digest request to two replicas that's also a good question for the understanding of the cassandra behavior and some optimizations applied to this behavior so what is a valid statement about a query coordinator handling query at consistency level three frankly speaking question doesn't describe all potential situations but we still can't judge by the questions gathering missing information [Music] if it would be on me i would extend question a little bit to be more clear but still together question and answers there are enough information so let me see how you made it okay that is a funny distribution uh well well well well well well okay looks like i was the only one who gave the right answer take a look take a look that's important to understand question answer c is wrong coordinator note will send a read repair request to a replicas in the scenario of digest mismatch so see in theory may happen but to two replicas because at least one will be considered as an edl and therefore c is wrong a and b there is no principal difference between them all replicas free replicas we consider we have video replicas in this case but what is important for us is the option d the story is cassandra is what big data rating and then you work with big data you have to be ready for what for big data such a surprise right [Music] so cassandra is very well optimized for big data query results can be very huge sometimes to avoid passing redundant data flow from all three nodes um just taking network capacity for nothing because in the most of the cases data will be exactly the same coordinator node sends a read request to one replica which tends to be faster and digest request for two replicas so two one replica will be asked to give me data and two replicas will be asked give me digest of the data digest of the data is kind of hash it will be a very short even if the wall value is huge digest always be sure and together with the data in the read request replica will return digest as well then query cardinator compares digests and returns uh data based upon that if the digests are matching then these data what was read it will be immediately returned to a client and we are done digests are matching all nodes store the same data now if digests are not matching there are two potential scenarios one we have got still most up-to-date value in this case this value will this data will be returned to a client but query coordinator will initiate the ground repair on the fountain consistency and final option curb option if digests are not matching and still looks like we have got a stale data so a real data new data store at one of those nodes what we asked for a digest but not for the real value in this case obviously new data redirect read request will be executed to those node which keeps most up-to-date data this data will be returned to a customer to the client and again as you could guess the ground repair will be initiated of course this scenario takes longer time because we have to reread right value from the proper replica node most up-to-date node because digest we cannot return digest to a customer simple as that so that's an optimistic look and not look really but optimistic behavior in most of the cases it helps us to get most up-to-date value very very very quickly saving the time on the data transfer within the cluster uh and in some pessimistic scenarios what and normally rarely uh we will get we still will get most up-to-date value with a proper consistency level of course uh but in some scenarios it may lead to a slower answer if your data is inconsistent that means what you if you if you often get this situation it should be controlled by a monitoring for the cluster if you often get this uh situation then something is wrong with a cluster and you have to take it seriously maybe network is lagging maybe something else there are multiple possible reasons but you have to take it closer okay so i gave you the answer already it's explained good so we are almost done just a couple of more questions question number 18 administrator exams what is a valid statement about a write made at consistency level local forum against the key space for replication factor of three coordinator node will send the write to one node combinator node will send the right to two nodes coordinator node will send verb right to a free node a continuation node will send for rights to all nodes of a cluster by the all nodes here we mean all notes of the classroom that's that's quite funny but there are plenty of people doing mistake here [Music] time flies and we are almost done we are very very close to results yeah yeah i made the right answer let me see how you did okay right answer was answer c we have a couple of mistakes let's see what's wrong that's very good guys what you fail at this question now we will fix this missing knowledge very often misunderstanding of cassandra uh if you made a mistake don't worry there are plenty of people with you in this group but we will take you out and learn you what was wrong so you will not make this mistake again very people with a very many people misunderstand what is a consistency level does consistency level defines how many servers have to store the data no no replication factor decides how many nodes store the data consistency level decides how many acknowledgements or how many confirmations we are waiting for before delivering answer to a client what kind of answer if you read the data then the date he asked for if we store the data we deliver the confirmation what that to date was uh store it right if you write the data with a replication factor free doesn't matter what's the size of a data center of a cluster it still means what uh where in the current data center we have three replica servers when you send an update change data add a new value add a new row how many servers will need to store this data for replication function 3. of course free it doesn't depend on consistence level at all at all totally completely then cartonator note if it's not a replica note right it will send right to three notes simple as that and if the coordinator node is a one of replica nodes then it will send rights to two nodes because it needs the replica already so data was delivered so the right answer is c coordinator node will always attempt to write to all of the nodes specified in the replication factor to all of the replicas it does not depend on the consistency level you can specify and you can specify any consistency level any quorum local quorum each quorum whatever forum all one two three all of them will be notified always consistency level here is uh just uh how many acknowledgements we will wait for before answering to a client what data was stored simple as that well well well well well well what's the leaderboard looks like batman and ted may he made the best answers and hey they take a look batman is just one right answer behind the cp and ted is just one answer behind batman with simba is very close nice so competition goes on and i'm launching two last questions those about data modeling those are for developers although i still strongly recommend to take a developer moduling course even for the administrators so ladies and gentlemen question number 19. consider a chibako diagram what captures a physical data model or investment of a portfolio data scary chibako diagram what is the primary key and clustering order of a table trades by asd and there are a few options looks scary right i will explain you i will give you some help you will know it's not so scary it's not as scary as it looks like i don't see answers so i honestly pick the right one after reading and analyzing i will give you some hints but first you have to answer that's the 19 that's a question 19 out of 20 and i gave the right answer and what about you yeah most of you made it very well so it's answer number d and answer c is wrong but it's quite close actually so first of all let me give you a hint a two hints what will really help you with the exam all of those kind of questions are based on the datastax.com learn slash data modeling by example so i do recommend to invest your time it will be the best investment investment in yourselves are always the best right everything can fail but you you are the best you will not so go to this slash learn slash data model by example ping me i will send you a link if you can't find it and read through those samples it's just one of them directly so you will find it investment portfolio data it will help you to understand what is it all about that's the first thing second hint you need to know those uh diagrams physical data model logical data model as well are quite scary they are big it's not the biggest of them there are some bigger tables but most of the questions are only about one and one only table traders by asd in this case traders by account symbol trade uh symbol their freight id right asd it means what you out of those six tables you can ignore this one this one this one this one and this one and focus only on this one looks like we just cut off most of the tables most data on this table you don't have to read through that all and focus only on this one now it's obviously a knowledge on knowing of chibako notation but connotation is your way to describe cassandra tables in this case physical data model uh in some solid clear conscient uh explanation way to explain and what we see that's a table name that's a list of columns there's um data types and then they say k means k partition key and c means clustering column and arrow describes sorting order so first two answers are wrong because it's account straight in symbol or account data in symbol and we have order is important account symbol trait id so a correct answer is c or d account symbol trade id accountable trade id so we have to focus on those arrows and then we see here trade id descending but ascending is not defined and d defined symbol ascending create id descending right answer is d so simple as that that's the right answer d is the right answer plus string keys matter but uh you did a really good job most of you made the right answer and the mistake was actually very close to the right one good job for quite short time and my dear people that's going to be the final question of this training and thank you so much for joining me and it was quite cool time together so your last chance to earn 1000 points or maybe not two and we start countdown data modeling ds220 consider the application workflow diagram for an investment portfolio application it features three queries show workflows so investment account of a user display position in an account display account trade history an application workflow before cloud diagram uh describes all those workflows and also some optional workflows question is which access pattern are evaluated before application can evaluate q32 and there are four options oh i still have to answer [Music] [Music] oh [Music] okay yes okay i gave a correct answer i don't see your results yet but let's be it's a final question and we are nearly perfectly on time uh so you will see in a moment application workflow diagram is a very important tool of data modeling methodology you need to understand that and application workflow diagram defines use cases queries and their dependencies and uh very important for us to understand what can we just go and out of the blue execute query q32 let's find query q32 that is it find all trades for an account and date range order by trade date descending can they execute these uh query without any previous queries being executed let's think date range order by trade date do we need is that a real dependency no customer defines date range in the application customer pushes the button so we get information from the application we don't need anything for it but before that find all trades for an account we need to know the account if uh and we obviously have a lot of accounts can we execute just q32 no we don't know the account that means what this query has a dependency yes queries workflows also have a dependencies not just your npm packages right but all the hours too so free to has a dependency and we need to know an account now we also have a diverse dependencies like q32 is um just the case of q3 in general feel free find all trades for an account [Music] and this arrow shows us what we have a dependency on q1 show investment account of a user and that is the beginning of a workflow dependency why because when user logs in we know user id right user gives keys an identifier then we can execute q1 show investment account of a user by user id find information about all investment account of a user as soon as user is logged in we can execute q1 and when we know list of the accounts of a user and user clicks on the account we know account id and then we can display account trade history therefore any of the q3 like from three one three two and blah blah blah three five has a dependency on q one only right answer is a q y eq one is the entry point we do not depend on q two and of course we do not depend on itself q3 right answer is q1 so right answer is a now let me see looks like it was a little bit harder so most of you gave the answer d let me see the q1 you free you free one i believe you guessed already i believe you guessed already uh you see what this uh q32 does not depend on free one find all trades for an account nope only on q1 well well well well you know what um that was alex washington developer advocate lead data starts doing my favorite job helping you to get ready for the certification i kindly asked you when you will go and take the certification and pass the exam write me on linkedin so i know i will know what you passed my certification uh with my help it always makes me proud you know i will give you a link to my linkedin in a second oops alex boom it's on the youtube chat i'm always happy to have more friends on internet and we announce new events there from time to time now last thing before i tell you goodbye so leaderboard who did the best job oh will batman get to the cp and simba that's amazing okay so don't look at me i know this content but cp and batman share the first place with nine right answers and uh there is i forgot the name of this uh nice teddy bear and simba made it with seven and six right answers i believe some of you join up not in the very beginning so maybe uh missed the thing you did the great job learning today uh we will have a thank you and goodbye in the room number one in few minutes and all in all we are done thank you so much for coming it was our first cassandra day brazil don't forget to share the news don't forget to share the videos and you know what we have some time before the next cassandra day brazil will happen that means what you have time to get educated get certified start working with cassandra that matters for me a lot because i want you right you to be a speaker at the next cassandra day in brazil that's going to be exciting thank you for coming that was alex walsh in the main team you will be able to give us some feedback if you liked it what you did most like what you didn't like regarding the points there were 20 questions passing exam grade is 17 so if you took 14 000 points you are done you are good but questions were from different exams from administrator from developer so it's not a real great now quick survey to help us i will keep this window open so you can give your feedback even when the training is done then the work is over what should be improved for the future trainings and what did you like the most uh we are just happy when people write thank you awesome and so on uh if you are not happy with something throw it in as well and again abrigado uh our training for today is over and jump to the first room there will be some last words oh maybe there will be some interesting information i bet they will thank you for coming you are the best [Music] i'm trying to remember how to say goodbye in portuguese yeah i still remember some see you again great job today thank you [Music] you",
