you good evening wherever you are ah surah hi nice to see you so i think the sound check is good it's all good just can you guys give me a thumbs up if you can hear us well please yeah no eco and anything hi hi everyone oh great energy in the chat already yes okay so and the count is growing every second very good okay so um let's start while people can keep joining so welcome to today's workshop introduction to machine learning um with apache cassandra and apache spark let me jump to the next slide just to check that there are no strange things here okay so this is all right um so again uh welcome everybody let's bring back the energy so i'm silly clint then i'm leading the developer advocacy team at datastax uh so i'm a trainer public speaker developer coder so today we will be together two hours live session full of hands-on okay so don't expect a level of marketing ish we are here to code together and do stuff you will do stuff with us um so yeah pretty exciting to be to be there with you uh you have my coordinates on the top right hand corner you can invite me on twitter linkedin would be a p2 of you in my network yeah and as for me i'm stefano nice to meet you same for me here i'd be glad to connect to you i'm a developer in particular i use python and javascript and i like apache cassandra and distributed systems so today we are going to speak about machine learning and how cassandra and spark are very good tools for that and we think a good shout out to all of the team because today it's the two of us but behind the scenes there is a lot of work to deliver such nice material and such nice workshops to you and we have to thank the whole team here you go thank you team yeah we will yeah some folks in the chat as well helping i'm sure someone would join in the chat as well and um so very briefly a bit of information before we start uh you are watching us on youtube unless we are in the future and you are watching us as a recording on youtube still on youtube so hello uh future people watching us in case youtube has trouble which very rarely can happen uh you will find us on twitch and we will give you the coordinates i see there is a someone saying hi old physicist so i get you are a fellow physicist hi nice to see other physicists around yes i i am guilty to be a physicist a theoretical physicist in particular you saw that in the slide so back to us um we like these workshops to be a lot uh interactive which means there are spaces for questions and in particular of course we have the youtube chat here but the youtube chat is for let's say questions related to the very moment we are speaking and anyway it will disappear when the workshop is over so please do join us on discord you see here the link maybe we can ask nightbot to give us the coordinate please join us on discord so we can keep the discussion going which is not only about machine learning not only about cassandra but everything developed developers and means and everything so we cover a wide range of topics um that's not the end of the interactivity because we are also having games and online surveys with you interactively in particular we are using mentimeter so in a second we are going to give you the coordinates to join us for the questions okay so and send us up to the end because in the end we will play a game using that mentee and if you answer correctly with the good uh responses we will ship you swag to your location for free so you know stay focused learn with us and play the game at the end yeah very well said uh i already gave the link to start joining mendy in okay so uh we we told you it will be packed of enzone and you don't have to install anything so you will we will use database um called astradb we will explain you what it is we will use a git pod which is an id in the cloud and we will also you will have all the materials available for free on github and that means all the slides all the ends on you can reproduce the exercises after the session okay everything's free uh for you uh and uh yeah so let's let's do it nothing to install all web-based yeah so you will see in the chat in a second also the link to github but that's for later so you don't don't rush to open it stay with us i'm giving that just you will have to open quite easily yeah uh so github and we will run everything in gitpod you will see soon what gitpod is it's i have to say a very cool technology everything in your browser and the third piece of technology we're using today is astrodb which is well it is a database built on cassandra more on that later so let's uh go on so we don't repeat ourselves but astradb will be providing data storage for later and everything online as a service easy to use with one click okay so um time to move to the goodies because we don't give a badge of attendance just if you attend this workshop but there is a small homework at the end a small assignment which is hands-on so we will have to touch the code and do stuff and if you if you submit this we will be happy to review it and give you a nice batch which is the one you see here in the slide it's a kind of open api standard badge you can put it on link it in brag about it so yeah could be reused later yeah by the way this is one of many badges that we have one per workshop and i know there are collectors out there so i don't know do we have a pricing for those who manage all but maybe now overall we have about 30 sessions so same format live so if you like the format the experience the energy consider to subscribe each time you can earn one of these badges so going over the recordings that you find on this channel covering a lot of topics java python javascript front end we cover a lot um yeah if you want to chase after those badges you know go go to cut yeah gotta catch them all yeah okay so i think it's time for a bit of uh interactivity now so uh please if you didn't do that yet open a tab or your phone go to mendy.com and enter this code and let me reiterate okay okay so i i have to switch tabs here so now we will ask you a few question with mentee it's not the game it's just for you to get used to mentee seeing that it's the live session see uh here and just random question let me make ourselves a bit smaller so we have a bit more space for the quiz slides uh you can also scan this qr code to jump in and let's see at the moment we are waiting for people to join so let me switch again to this so maybe let's see a bit more we wait for another minute or so for okay so for people to join the quiz okay yeah we'll wait yeah just a few seconds for everyone to join uh and after all this housekeeping we can dig into it yeah so just a few seconds okay um we we are now just asking you a couple of questions to get to know our audience better if i manage to okay so before starting just a few questions to get to know you better um let's see first where are you from so where are you connecting with us from i see someone more or less in the way of the north pole maybe there's svalbard there or the norwegian islands or independent island i don't know crazy formerly norwegian uk spain or portugal india as well so it's it must be pretty late for you so thank you for coming yes someone even more to the north i bet you you're not just wearing a t-shirt if you're there especially if you're outside canada yeah wow everywhere that's very cool brexit very funny and moon all right okay okay so next question next question is what's your experience with machine learning so are you like what is machine learning or maybe i know the concepts i see some experience i use it at work very good oh we also have an ai participating hoping to learn something more that's great what is machine learning yeah okay so we have representatives from all uh answers i think of course today is an introduction more focused on practice at that so don't expect loads of you know linear algebra or mathematics just like big lectures uh expect more hands-on practice so we will be introducing uh the general ideas a bit how the algorithm a few algorithms work and we will then run them interactively you will be running them interactively so very much hands-on focused so thank you for the answers another question do you use cassandra and or astrodb i know what it is that's great i use it now and then my daily life depends on it that's great to hear you know what is cassandra you will get an answer later [Music] okay uh you know cedric there is a bunch of people whose daily life depends on cassandra so that's let's not screw up oh yeah no no that would be fine it's uh you know resilient always on it will be fine yeah you will be highly available i see ah hi aaron there's aaron in the chat yeah good okay so okay let's do we miss the question very important question i like to ask this every time python scripts or interactive notebooks this is a how do you say um um divisive question you know how to say that um it sparkles discussions every time you know whether scripts or notebooks that are pros and cons and what about you stefano what do you like well i am for scripts all the time because i i have a personal uh preference for coding that keeps the structure of the code and does not let you jump back and forth at will but of course i have to agree that depends on the task is the the the considerate answer and today for example what we will do is better done with notebooks so yeah at the end one has to be honest with themselves okay so thank you for the answers uh stay tuned to mendy because we will come back later with more questions and with the quiz so keep the tab keep the phone uh connected whatever and maybe it's time to jump back to our presentation and go okay so a slight show okay okay so today's agenda as you see is very full and we have a general introduction about machine learning then we will set up we will guide you through setting up your environment then we will quickly survey what are the tools of the trade so what technologies are going to be used today and then we will speak a specific algorithms clustering algorithms inference algorithms and others and then we will close and wrap up with some conclusion and of course the quiz okay the game yes the swag game and the swag the prizes okay so first chapter maybe i try to make myself a bit louder i get this feedback so okay okay so machine learning cedric do you want to take from here for yeah sure let we we can yeah we can go no break fairly quickly with machine learning i think but you know let's go um you know each time we introduce a new concept we put back the wikipedia definition if you will uh but you know it's kind of a meme because if you read that it's just super complex not super easy to follow um and you know a colleague of us find a way straight to the point finishing i think you can show it now there we go yeah there is so yeah machine learning in a way just a science of drawing circle maybe bar chart as well and coloring them okay so we will use some algorithm to help us do some decisions based on the data and this is what we wanted to represent on the next slide with this diagram moving from uh data just waiting i do have a delay on my end probably due to youtube yeah just yeah next slide yeah here we go so machine learning is a scientific way to process raw data using algorithm to make better decisions all right so this is exactly what i said oh look at that alex is in the chat hi alex i have no magic just billions rows of data in two buckets of mathematics and voila so really start from the data we need to make some decisions so classification clustering regression recommendation so we will pick the proper algorithm train this algorithm against the data to build what we call a model and then to thanks to this model we will be able to do those decisions so what we call project predict so the in this huge scope of machine learning you can find multiple types of algorithm multiple type of learning multiple approach so the first approach is called the supervised learning you know what you are doing right so you have the knowledge of the output so the algorithm the model will learn with the expert i will show you what an apple look like again and again and again show you a lot of pictures each time showing you there is an apple there is no apple and when you when the algorithm learned it will be able to detect apple or cats in any image so that's probably the most famous one supervised one you you really know what you expect so you train your model and just the model will repeat just what you ask for the second kind of learning is the other way around unsupervised learning so now this time you don't have the knowledge of the output you want the algorithm to organize the output sort predict what should be the output it's self-guiding the algorithm will find the group the classification the cluster if you wish you don't have to label the data as an input this is the algorithm to find what things look like and group them if this is what you want to do and today we will see five algorithm altogether and some would be classified as supervised others unsupervised um you know it's pretty obvious to tutorials what you do either you provide the input or not okay so let's see what are those algorithms there are a lot oh yeah a lot of them and uh you know it's it's probably not even close to what you can find so um my goal is not here to read them all and you know it's just really really a subset but there are new algorithm every day and you as a developer a data scientist if you wish i mean 90 of people here what you would like to know is a what is the use case what i try to achieve and what are the existing algorithm i can leverage on very very few people will actually go and invent new algorithms it's kind of a research field i would say now yeah very specialized even okay so let's try to organize those algorithm if we wish on the next slide yeah so entry point i have no idea what i'm doing but still i know if i do have input or not right if i do have input um i will go into the supervised learning category find a family of algorithms classification regressions if i don't know the output and i want to use unsupervised learning same here you see a couple of uh scenario some scenarios are considered to be semi-supervised so i guess you provide only a stop portion of of the input or you do have a two two passes on the algorithm and only on the second pass you will provide data and also another family called the reinforcement learning based on uh the the output of your first pass you will keep uh improving your model but for today the scope will be supervised and supervised and especially those five algorithms that you see on screen classification regression clustering association dimension reduction and we pick one of each okay here the purpose is to show you in two hours how much you can do uh the extension of all the the capabilities so we we picked the naive bayes random forest camin fb growth and collaboration collaborative filtering one notebook for each of those okay so let me come to another very important point i would say how to tell the quality of a model once you have it which is exactly your question oh no no no so you choose one of the algorithm you provide uh your data as input you train your model and you get what we call a data model something like an engine that we will keep reusing on new data to do your decision to do your prediction and the question is how good is your data model how accurate the prediction could be and um this quality uh characteristic is not an easy one you know it's not that easy to define what it is so here on the next slide yeah that's the final year you can go here i uh we provide you very very simple like on 100 people so we we evaluating how much uh have a very bad cancer malignant tumor and um who are healthy who are just bending tumor and there are four type of outputs you can have you know like true positive you um the algorithm tell us it's a malignant tumor um okay and it's a true positive it can be a a true negative so the the model uh predict benin it could be a false positive so the model predicts that it's malignant but it's not and it could be a false negative and that's the worse because you are stating that the guy is does not have a malignant tumor and still it does okay so tp true positive fp fourth positive fn force negative and tn a true negative uh we can show them as here a four box uh table or also here with this circle depending on the matrix we will show you you can use one or the other and now let's see the three i mean uh we will show you three there are even more but let's talk about the three main engine just just a remark uh the the form of the table on the left is in a sense uh the best way to express because it can be generalized to models where the outcome is non-binary so that maybe there are three different outcomes you can have a three by three matrix which is called confusion matrix and qualitatively you can imagine that a better model is the one with higher counts on the diagonal and lower counts of diagonal because every every count that that goes off the diagonal means that the model and the reality have a mismatch so ideally you want your model to give a confusion matrix that is only diagonal zeros everywhere else and in the case of these yes no models which is very common uh there are other ways to express it like these venn diagrams and that's great okay so i go to the next slide yeah so first definition is what we call accuracy so the definition is really you you um like as a numerator the correct prediction so the true positive plus the true negative so something that you do great divided by this the sum of all the prediction okay so let's play a game so in the chat who will be this one here to give me what is the accuracy of our current model based on the formula we told you it will be interactive let's see so what is the accuracy of this model how many correct predictions are there okay [Music] okay i think we have a winner yeah i think we have yes multiple times so i think you can you can switch to the next slice solution yes so reception is here so the accuracy is uh everything's correct so true positive plus true negative divided by everything so everything now is 100 in our simplified model and one was correct true positive one true a negative 90. so the accuracy is 91. so you might expect wow 91 91 percent that's just an amazing uh model right yes we will save the world with that well the issue is um if you look at the force negative we kind of we do have an issue here because nine people get the very bad diagnostic you know they are very sick and we were not really able to predict that so let's see if on the data model we we have others metric that we should look at so i'll go to the next slide the point is that a model accuracy is how often the model gets it right but that's really i mean imagine there is a very rare uh case of bad tumor so a model that always says no will be already very good in this metric just says always no because the the positive is very uncommon so it's all good right as an extreme case that's why there are other metrics for example precision yeah so precision and you know better is ready to use the the formula here uh count the true positive out of all the positive so true positive tp divided by all the positives so true positive and false positive so it's assess how your positive answer are right if you are too positive or not so same question here can you compute the precision of this model i put back the numbers here uh 1 1 8 90. yeah so i see answers are coming in zero five zero five so yes exactly and it's not as good right 50 now so you can throw a coin and get the same precision yeah so this model is not as good as these seems to be in this sense it is as good as random right so precision answers the question how often a positive by the model is really a positive and this happens half of the time that's really not so good yes and the last but not least and uh in this medicine diagnostic i've read that is probably the the one that should be the most uh uh look at it's called the recall so this time uh the the recall will identify the positive out of all the real positives so true positive divided by true positive and false negative so that's how how good your algorithm behave here yeah so recall says how many of the really positive are found what is the fraction of the really positive that are actually found and this is a number is low then your model does not do the one thing that is it's supposed to do yes okay so very good it's the answers and one over nine that's correct yes that's that's correct okay so um so to be fair when you do have this model uh that's better to compute all these these metrics um that um um precision and recall tends to be opposite you know the the better the precision can can be the the recoil is getting a bit less less good by design so there are a fourth metric you know not really detail here called f1 where you combine recall and precision just to reduce the effect that precision and recall go very far one of each other but yeah when you have your data model assess the quality using those those metrics yeah so let's say that accuracy is probably not very useful in general especially when there is a big skew between positives and negatives in in the real world so that does not capture what you probably want to capture then you might ask yourself what is the right metric the answer is it depends because uh in general probably i would not i would go uh for precision out of all of them but it depends uh in this case of the tumor you probably want to focus on recall because it's what you want to avoid is to skip a positive and not detect it so that's the most important thing but it depends on the case let's say you have let's say you have a data set of your customers and you want to reach some of them for interview for extended interviews and you want to single out customers with a pattern that signals they are in a big company let's say you send them some gifts and everything so probably in that case you want to make sure you're not wasting gifts to small company customers and if you just skip one of those big customers no big deal so in in that case you want to more you want to go more for a precision then recall and that's really why it depends on on the situation you you want to analyze then as cedric says there are composite metrics that try to balance them these various metrics and that's not the end of the story indeed um quantifying the the goodness of a model is a science in itself there is something called area under the curve auc and that's a bit of a more complicated metric that tries to measure how better than randomness your model does under variation of thresholds in measuring so you need a parameter to to to change that's when it's available is probably the the most refined way but that's a bit too mathematical for today so we we gloss over and we go to another very important point okay um another yeah things to to consider you know before going to the those implemented is uh the fitting of your audioview model so could be underfeeded so here you have three diagrams and uh through a regression you try to find the a path that's come you know the the closest to to all those points and you can be underfitted so um not enough precision you can see that the distance between your your line and the points is not the greatest so not a model i will trust a good fit is that in middle balance you know your lines tips to you know stick to the points uh but have still a natural behavior overfitted is probably you maybe train your model too much is to stuck to your data work very well with your data set but then if you try to predict a behavior against new data because it's overfitted you might have some weird behavior you know better have these average like robust and good than these overfitted that will work well with the trained data but not new data yeah overfitting is nasty and it is when the model stops learning what you want it to learn and just learns to the the quirks the precise rows in your own training set so the precise very pros that you give the model for training and it learns to mimic them very well but then in real life it just fails we will see ways to keep this under control uh in in a few slides but first okay let's do something else for a little while yeah stop the talking and start looking at the architecture the the technologies that power today and maybe your bright future in machine learning okay all right um you know i i can go quickly so um um you know in a lot of uh another case you train your data model using some static file use csv file you extract data coming from somewhere and train your data on that um today we will use directly the oltp database called apache kasana so you know already organizing the data are stable very fitted for scarce scarce data and very large amount of data so um you know fit very well these training so that will be a web-based database and for uh i mean the the machine learning that would be the goal tools that's everybody using right so jupiter notebooks using some python with the python library spark and to help the the interaction with the astra database we have created a couple of script so all these cli sql s sql sh so cassandra language shell and ds bulk will not very be visible for you that will be script running under the hood but just for you to know they are there they will be used to load the data in the database or set up things yeah and of course if you are curious you can inspect the the scripts in the repo and find out all the internals it's a repo so you can look at it okay okay so let's have a look first at the data layer yeah which means cassandra right oh yeah oh yeah so you know you might not know but you know here we are on data stacks developer channel and data stacks is really supportive about the open source uh nosql database called apache cassandra so we provide support for that so what's cool with cassandra so it's a nosql distributed database a big data ready you need more capacity or throughput simply add new nodes uh it will scale linearly there is a dedicated read and write performance per node and so you can scale the data is replicated among multiple nodes even multiple region so you can lose any of the data it's any of the nodes it's not a big deal the database will self ill data could be geographic we could be distributed geographically like that you have your data very close to your app your interactive you're interacting with the node close to you and cassandra will replicate the data synchronously up to the other nodes it's open source uh apache license so vendor agnostic so yeah we are using only open source technology today yeah so for example well i can imagine some of our attendees are asking themselves wait should i install a big super mega database over several machines just for playing a bit with data today uh later later there will be the answer the answer is no it's all ready but uh we have a few slides on uh how yes so yeah the this slide quickly so uh as i told you already in cassandra the data is organized as stable so you know pretty nice to to train a model um you can have very very large amount of data in a single table so again very good to have a lot of data to train but it's not magic with so many rows in a table those rows will be distributed among the notes so next slide just showing you that even in this kind of 20 record table the data is distributing among those nodes and the those are are grouped by what we call the partition key here it is in bold on the schema so based on the value on the first column data will be grouped there so if you can design your table in a way that will fit your will fit your model you will be good so probably as a partition key you would like to get your target vector right the value of the target vector just to have the same data set that will predict the same output in the same node eventually but you know generally speaking when we talk about casanova we say you need to design your table that fits your queries your request and you group together what you're supposed to retrieve together also a neat thing it's it's kind of almost free to add a new column on the contrary of you know relational so very good for scarce model so we told you it's it's scale and we put that slide that stefano show to you just to to see that the famous guy in the in the field or the guy like apple netflix uh huawei alibaba and those have thousands and thousands of node in their cluster so 30 million operations per second so good to train but also probably also good to predict with such low latency or ltp database and so much data so even your online data set could be used to predict yeah a lot of data so you have to install all of these today on your machine to do the practice machine learning tasks of today no no no no no no so um cassandra especially because it's a distributed system you know it can take some time to install but here we have your cover we have a [Music] cloud service called astra that will run custom graph for us today okay and there there is a free tier you register for free and you can you can you know have up to you know 40 million requests per month without any uh issue you get all the credits to do so okay so i see a question by a man there is nothing to install today you will do everything from your browser yep in a second i will guide you through uh all of it the only thing you have to create your your database instance in astra and then you're good to go yes okay so okay let's move uh yeah i think maybe we can yeah you have the the pdf uh just oh the pdf and all the slide exercises are on github uh you know keep thinking about that uh so here we just put back some yeah that's cool uh astra service is cool because you know super easy to start uh running for free um and you know you don't have to install anything yeah and it can be very well used with machine learning tasks as the data storage behind that but maybe we can move on to the hands-on and we start with the first part of today's hands-on which is creating the database okay so um you see the link in in the chat in the youtube chat okay so there is thank you cedric there is a link to go and register your database maybe i can quickly show you so if you click on the link to register the database you will see a sim a window similar to this one to to sign up and create your account you can use github google or username password to just create your free account no no nothing else asked other than your login and once you are in yes i will show you in a second while you fill this i will just show you that we also have a repository here which is uh well this is your reference point for anything especially if you are on your on on your own later and you want to do the practice or go back to review what happens and everything so you see there are uh links to the the the full steps that we are doing today plus more because you see slides um reference to other exactly if you feel lost that's where you need to go if you watch the week i'll do the recording just pause the video go there and do at your own pace maybe at some point we will be a bit fast you know cannot follow and do the step at the same time with us uh totally fine those are free and you know you can come back later to complete if you feel it's moving too fast probably just stop what you are doing and you know just getting the most of the live session asking question and you know going back to do the homework anyway where you will have a lot of time yes so there's no precise deadline for submitting the homework anyway to create the astrodb you can also click this orange button and maybe i can i better show you of course i already do have a an account so let me so when you sign in you will be asked a few questions it will only be there once okay just yeah for us to know um who's using that service and and okay so now i'm logging in and this dashboard you see is similar to the one you see after logging in except of course i already do have two databases because i do my my secret stuff already but that's secondary um okay so veri i see your questions i will be there in a second but i want to be giving clear explanations for everyone whether you just created your account or you already have an astro account you can create a database either because you already see the create database prompt or you can click this button create database here or create serverless database here and on the right that's the same okay so all these instructions are in the github repository because when you create a database you will be asked a few details of the this database and you see it's all here database name key space and regions now bear with me i'm creating my database and i will call it workshops i'm creating a key space within this database a key space well let's say it's a group of tables so it's a bit more but let's say it's a it's a group of tables and we call it machine underscore learning then we have to decide uh where in the world this database will be hosted because that will live in the cloud managed by astra db uh i suggest you to stick to the google cloud which is available to the free plan then choose whatever is close to you or whatever you prefer so i'm in europe so i'll go for this one you see some of the regions are uh have to be unlocked that's because we are on the free plan yeah big picture with those if no locker yeah yeah no no lock no padlock sign next to your region so database name workshops key space name machine learning and then you choose whatever region is available to you within gcp possibly and now i click create database now the the cool thing is that this is now being created for you you just have to wait a couple of minutes or so while the database is being created and you see here you can track the status of the creation which would take two three minutes most but in the meantime something very important happens while the database is being uh finalized you will be given these very important token you see well you probably don't see because it's all dots so let me make it visible this token is your way to go to get in your database because since it's in the cloud you need some uh security in place and this is the credential you will use to connect so let me copy this token and you can also download it sorry yes for security reason this token will be shown to you right now enough after all later you can create new tokens if you wish but you know for this one make sure you copy paste on notepad notebook not bad somewhere on your machine or just download the the csv that clicking download token details you will have to copy paste client id and client secret yes so i you see i've copied my token well i i probably would save it to a file but this is for today's demo so i copied my token here in a notepad whatever and i'll keep it ready for later in the meantime my database is active that's great uh if you don't save it a month you will make sure you have copied it somewhere else because it will not be accessing you will not be able to see the token any anymore you will create a new one when you need but you better save it and or store it somewhere somewhere under your control because it's a secret not to be shared okay so you can now go to database it's active yes nice it's been okay maybe we can ask in the chat to give a thumbs up if your database is active and if you manage to get your database and your token just to make sure everyone is with us this is also you know as the database take a minute to start it's also good to start by the database and then start the rest of the tools yeah so where to find the tokens the tokens florian you should be you should have seen them when you were creating the database in case you nice because you get to your database they don't have you don't have the tokens uh maybe we can give you instructions to create a token uh let me go for them very quickly while we wait because we have a wiki called awesome astra with also yeah information on how to create a token on an existing section yeah i shared the instructions a few moments before but yeah thank you if you need to create a new token this is appreciated so i see a lot of people have their database and i think we can nice move on okay so you have a database empty for of course there's nothing yet there uh not for long you have your database and you have your token now what happens now you need well we start the setup or maybe we we get the bundle let's do things in the right order we need another piece of information to connect to the database from the code and we need something called a secure bundle this is file that we you will give to the drivers to talk to cassandra to astrodb this is the file containing information such as proxy information certificates and stuff you just don't care you just give this file to the drivers and it will know how to use it to establish the connection to get this file you see i'm in the dashboard of my workshops database here you see these tabs here head to the tab called connect here the third one so i'm clicking on the connect tab here so and what you see now is a is a page with information on the very many ways to connect to your database and use it now the only thing we are interested in now is in the connect app choose whatever python you see connect using a driver here you go to python and this is the page about the various ways to have python speak to your database what we need is the bundle so you see this blue button here download bundle and there we go so i'm doing that again i am in the the dashboard for my workshop database look for the tab called connect and look for the python connection here in the various ways to connect now this page will give you the chance to download bundle there we go you click to this and you get you see maybe it's too small to see but it's called secureconnectworkshops.zip luckily i have i already have my file browser here and maybe i can try to make it bigger there's no way i i'm not i don't know how to do but here you see the file i downloaded a very small but it's called secureconnectworkshops.zip we will use it in a second let's go back to the repo for step 5. said that we covered this part also now in this demo right we in in this part of the demo we go up to having uh the jupiter up and running um um yes let's do that maybe yeah that's the best you download the zip and you will use the zip immediately yes i think that's best okay so uh it's time to start your git pod but you know we have a few slides on github so maybe we can wait a second at this point to give time everyone to get their bundle we do have a few slides on git but we do we do have a few slides on which is what i want thinking okay should we show those those those slides give everyone time to make sure they have the database the bundle and the token i'll go back to the slides before we do the gitpod part so yes we put back a few slides to give everyone the time to proceed to these steps so something about the tools that we will use today let me also uh start to florian if we you know now we have some some some wiki and we uh we explained step by step how to do x y and z okay so sorry just a thing there is a recurring question what do you do after getting the zip file you don't unzip it you keep it as a zip as a single file as a single archive and you keep it there we will be uploading it in a second to github just keep it there for later okay yes so yeah so when you downloaded the zip you are you catch up just wait we will keep going in a moment okay so next oh um next slide i think and move on yeah so it's coming right so you don't have to install anything and that's due to the magic of a tool called git pod gitpod is vs code in the cloud for free you can go gitbo.io and you can have there and open a git pod environments against any github repo and start coding right there and in git pod you find java python go and even more tools and speaking of more tools if you go to next slide what we need today is so that's that's the gitpod slide so ready to code it's not only to do what we will do today but you can totally it can be your new id if you wish it's really vs code in the cloud so moving on yeah oh all right so we need jupiter notebooks so jupiter notebook the easiest way to have it is to run it as a docker container and get what in git pod you already have docker docker compose ready for you to go so docker just very another view of docker on next slide that's really a nunging to run you application in a box when you execute docker run something if a docker image exists the docker image will be downloaded and will run on your machine so it's a great way to try anything without installing um the the component so you know as a developer as a data engineering this is really something that you should consider even on your own laptop it's always easy to try xyz using docker yes docker is a live changer okay all right so and we are starting a docker image jupiter notebooks in this image python is already there spark is already there and pip is already there so you will see in the notebook that we will execute python code and the reason is docker container contains everything we need and this is how you will execute python code it will fill magic so it's not just python code inside jupiter inside docker inside github on your browser so that's that's the docker image that was created by the jupiter team ready with everything ready there for use with a bunch of scientific computing and machine learning stuff as well and i think we tweaked it a bit just to have a few more dependencies for some python uh yeah the drivers to connect to but you know very very few stuff okay so well maybe i can go on from here so uh after all this magic i see matthew is amazed at this setup and you will see how seamless it is if we get to running it so on on top of all these we are using python python is a programming language i bet some of you have heard of it already it's it's now there for a lot of years it's been growing like crazy it's become the almost the standard machine learning language i would say there are a lot of there is a very big ecosystem especially for machine learning ai tools but only not only that yeah it is a scripting language that has become a real grown-up language year after year we are now at uh version 3 10 i think 3 11 maybe already out not sure anyway uh yeah so you see here a sample of python it's very readable and it has a quirk particular indentation is part of the syntax which is funny to non-pythonistas and it feels so natural if you get used to it okay so um we will see python at work later so maybe we just move on uh i mentioned that python has a very big ecosystem especially when it comes to uh managing data and pandas is an example of that so i'll go very quickly on that but pandas is one of the python libraries i was mentioning and it is it is a library to manipulate data tables let's say rows by columns kind of things and in a very seamless way pandas is a is designed to make it to make these boring tasks of you know juggling data wrangling data easier and it also it is also able to work in place to work with pointers so it's pretty fast also that so yes for today uh the data that will be loaded will be loaded as table matrix if we will so the term that we use is read data frame because this data frame object comes with some manipulation of those um data set yes so um the let's say the most important structure in pandas is the data frame which is basically a table with names on the columns if you want and filled with data in inside in it you see here an example we will use them later that's not the end of it because we also have p spark what is p spark well p spark is a python binding for the underlying spark engine what is spark i think cedric mentioned that already spark yeah just go ahead now just just in the comments so sparky is edition engine so spark is a galaxy of small pieces we will use today is spark ml so smart machine learning all the algorithm that we will show you you won't have to implement them of course we will just import the the algorithm as a function and use it with proper parameters so and you will see how easy it is to integrate with python so pi spark spark ml will do the magic for us today yeah even though spark is written in scala originally but uh due to its popularity uh bindings for major languages have been created and pspark is one of them so it's we will see at work later there is another very important package well another couple of them very quickly numpy is a package for scientific computations in python so it does a lot of fancy mathematical things to our data especially for numbers but it actually does more in particular it is very good at working in a vectorized way so you have let's say you have 1000 numbers and you want to apply the same operation to all of them and get a new list of 1000 numbers numpy is for you and the good thing is that the engine is written in compiled languages so i think it's a mixture of c and assembly maybe also which makes it very fast so faster than of course what you would get with pure python numpy is used a lot and it's very powerful especially paired with uh scikit-learn so sklearn is an open source tool for uh well let's say machine learning uh tasks in in a broad sense so it does a lot of machine learning uh algorithms it does a lot of data transformation for you so it is again a very high level uh package built on top of all the goodies within python and not only that and it is irreplaceable companion if you want to tackle machine learning in python there is a detail that maybe you will you will see in the notebooks but we mentioned that pandas has data frame which are its representation of tables of data pspark also has its own version of data frames which have basically the same interface but they are an abstraction over distributed data living within the spark distributed computing context of course but from the outside they look more or less the same which is very cool okay um i think we are ready to go uh back it was a lot of tools to present but you know now it's behind us let's use them yes so maybe i better jump back to the repository because now it's finally time to open git pod i think some of you have uh done that already but now look at this part maybe this very important github git pod button is better put in the chat please to open gitpod you should right click or whatever [Music] contacts click you want and do open in new tab so we can keep the readme open you know if you open a new tab and you go to this new tab you will see git pod starting so what does this starting do a lot of things actually it creates a machine a virtual machine for you in the cloud it clones our repository with everything and it starts a bunch of stuff so this is the magic behind the scenes that you see here happening basically within this gitbot instance which is your in general it is an ide and a virtual machine for now today we want to use it just as a machine to run our engine basically um in this moment within git pod you probably see in your mach in your in your git for the tab you will see the same as you see here by the way you might have been asked to authenticate before starting gitpod you can use um you can use your gitlab or git hub credentials just to give your identity and have this start which editor to choose that's really relevant to the point that i am closing to getting started today so we are not using that as we speak git pod is frantically so my image my github virtual machine is frantically building my docker image to start the full goodies that you saw before so docker within docker there is uh the spark engine and also jupiter and also the dependencies python and everything ready to use now give it another half a minute or so and you will be asked something by the prompt here you see this is this is an ide in the cloud with a file editor on the left sorry a file explorer on the left an editor on the top and a terminal like you have any bash terminal on the bottom at the moment the terminal is still running some stuff and i think we are done almost done you see something is happening not do not worry much about the details i think in a few seconds this step will be done yeah i know it takes two minutes and more but you see there is a lot going on if you are curious look at the internals and you will be amazed okay here we are i try to make this a bit bigger even though maybe that goes a bit against so okay you see now the script that we created for you is asking to insert some of your information for connecting to astra and you remember the token this is the time i go back to my notebook i find you see client id this string is my client id and i'm going to paste it here ctrl v should work i paste it here and i just hit enter now enter client secret same thing go to your token and get the secret so you see this is called the client secret and it is the full string this one a bit longer and you can go here and paste it here by the way if you do something wrong in the git pod in the github repository there are instructions to reset and redo it so don't don't worry too much okay now there is a very important step the bundle high please drag and drop the bundle to jupyter secure connect okay so i go retrieve my file explorer here you see the secure connect workshops actually you can just drop drag it here to jupyter and then to secure connect directory and if you just drag and drop it it will be uploaded to your gitpod okay so you see it's just a drag and drop from your local computer file viewer over to the browser here you you drop it here in the left panel the file explorer okay so press enter when ready i think i'm ready uh probably i'm not but oh no okay this is okay no no big deal okay so after that i am asked to confirm the location of this bundle it's all right and i can press enter to confirm key space name machine learning in case you gave it a different key space name it's now it's the moment to write your keyspace name okay you know stefano uh maybe we can pause here a bit you know for some people um gitbot can take a one minute even a few minutes to start and if you go and do all the steps there they could be a bit lost yes that's a good that's right so um so we give a bit of time for all github to start and it might uh take well in my case it took a couple of minutes or so to start it might take a bit more the important thing is that when all the setup is done all of the automated the provisioning of the of the docker part is set up you will see this astra db configuration and there will be a prompt to enter your client id and your client secret you just paste the values from your token the one you got to create in your database after that you will have to copy your secure bundle that you should have downloaded back from astra you copy your secure bundle here and by copy i mean you drag and drop the file from your file explorer over to here secure connect jupiter secure connect you copy the zip file and you can press enter and resume this setup which will basically just be confirm the zip file and confirm the key space name this is it this is all the information required and we just wait till another minute or so but i just show you what happens in the meantime the script goes on by itself and it actually does a lot of things because it creates tables and populates those tables with the data with the rows needed for the machine learning tasks later so you'll see a lot of output such as oh i imported so and so rows over to this table i imported so and so rows over to this other table and so on that will take maybe one minute and a half two minutes okay yes so maybe i go again so the the part where you have to do something is this part i highlight here you enter the token client id the token client secret and then you will have to drag and drop your secure connect bundle zip file from your machine from your computer over to gitpod which is your virtual machine in the cloud and virtual editor in the cloud okay i see there are some errors yeah just to provide the path of the of the secure bundle that's very strange you know file not found i do not see the the name of the zip file there yeah probably this is a missing secure bundle zip yeah because you know you see you see stefano screen uh at some point he say enter secure connect bundle location uh but he did not really or anything because the the file name was was fine yes that should be the default location that has been detected if you drag and dropped your zip file um okay okay i see someone got to the opening part yeah okay so maybe we can so okay i might as well okay yeah it's it's just uh yeah roof um jupiter login okay so i see some some managed to get everything running okay i think we should go on to copy the client token you mean from from so to copy the client token you mean from astra i think i selected the full thing or maybe there is a clipboard yeah there should be a clipboard icon okay so the easy thing is to copy the token information as your database has been created because then you just happen to have it there for for copying otherwise you have to go to create a token yourself in at the second time as a separate operation uh i think i will just i don't know set it maybe we okay so if if paste does not work in git pod you you can try control v if this doesn't work you can try yeah so this is i know it's a git for the problem if that if control v does not work the first time you might have some running message on the navigation bar and in just asking you to allow to paste uh inside git git someone suggest ctrl shift v that might work actually this depends on the combination of your operating system and your browser so we know it's a bit different but if ctrl b does not work maybe ctrl shift b or right click yeah so in my case right click does not work i'm on firefox and windows by the way but this is really couldn't seem to paste in safari chrome works well well this is that's funny okay okay so matthew thank you for this max seem to unzip the bundle automatically that's weird okay i suggest we go on and we sadly give instructions for for those having problems you see there is a yeah i i you know uh also you know got the issue so if you i don't know did not correctly enter the client id or client secret or the secure bundle you can always um execute setup.sh just to re-enter the internet if you if you have some problem with the setup of your database credentials and similar here there's a small set of instructions on which script does what so you can look at them and restart them manually but now i think it's time to move on a bit for those who already got to the point of having the environment working so yes and then as bastard was liking how was asking how to open the notebook yes so the notebook is supposed in principle to open itself in a new tab but i guess everyone has a pop-up blocker so uh you see please check your pop-up blocker in my case i can just go here options and unblock these url but in the worst case you see there is a target url printed at the end of the script you can just take this copy and open manually in a new tab and there you go so you see there is key space should be machine underscore learning if you if you were sticking to the instructions otherwise this depends on what key space you entered when you created your database probably is machine learning okay um okay so one way or the other let's assume you managed to open the tab containing your notebook so now to reiterate yeah i'm helping as much as i can so yeah thank you sir yeah i think this part depends really control v and stuff it depends on your particular setup your operating system your browser so it's very hard to to get everyone to give everyone the help but of course we will be please contact us later or look closely at the instruction or just scrap your your git pod and restart it again from scratch we will be happy to help each and one every one of you so at the moment i'll go forward to show what comes next which is the cool part so this is the notebook interface running and using the server which is running within docker which is running within gitpod which is running which is visible in your browser everything clear very good so to unlock access to jupyter you need a password and i wrote it wrong yes so the password is luckily found in the instructions and it is ml rules so i paste these here just ml rules is the password once you enter the password you can finally see the very fam i guess familiar to many of you jupiter interface ah finally we are here and we can actually have a look at all these notebooks but before doing that i think we can spend a little time on the algorithms just for you to know what they are and which use cases they cover okay so i think this part we will be doing as an overview setting what do you think 20 now yeah yeah yeah google so in machine learning especially when it comes to supervised learning there is a very standard procedure i would say which starts from the raw data and goes all the way to having the final model that you will like to use in production so you see there are a few steps outlined here but maybe i'll just uh skip to just go to the the sequence of them so the first thing is you have some raw data let's say you collect data out there in the wild and they are probably not in the format you need and maybe there are a few odd entries there are a few nulls here and there there are irregularities in the format on and all these real life things so a first task usually seen as a very boring task is cleaning cleaning the data changing its formulation changing the format reshuffling and maybe getting rid of unwanted rows such as new results or stuff like that so let's say the cleaning is the step from the raw data to having a cleanly prepared data set ready to be used to train your machine learning models in particular one speaks of features and labels basically features are a neat way to present the input data so every item you want to let's say classify will have a set of features usually numbers maybe they are arranged in a in a vector in a list of some kind one per row one per item and you have labels labels are the thing that the machine learning model is supposed to guess correctly but of course in your in initial training data you will have labels to train the model now you do a very important thing you split the data now let's see let's say the most important thing is to split between training and testing that's because if you you remember overfitting overfitting is when your model starts to learn the precise rows you are giving it training and it doesn't learn the problem anymore just learns to behave correctly with these input that's not good because then it's a useless model so to make sure you avoid this problem you divide your input set in two parts so that you train it with the part of the data and you test it with an independent part an independent set of input rows so if you have overfitting you will see a very good performance on the training data but then a very bad performance on the test data and then you know it's overfitting and it's not good so this is a way to keep overfitting under control then in the in the best practice you will also split uh you will split the input data in three parts that's in particular uh so the the validating set being the new part and that's in particular when you have uh when you want to choose between different models so you let's say you train the models on the training set then you use the validating set to compare the performance of the various models once you decide your your your best model you stick with that one and you retrain it more with with the with the full training and validating and then use the testing set to to evaluate the performance final the final answer for the model now the important thing is that these three or two parts of the splitting are independent they are they do not overlap otherwise you are sort of defeating the point of the train test split and you are at risk of overfitting okay uh well i think i spoke um to about all this yes now a small intermezzo when you say when you hear training the machine you might think of a machine in the gym uh that's just for fun that's because a few days ago a nice machine learning model was released to the public and the fact is that this image was created by the model starting from a text input so i put a metallic cyborg in a gym and i got this image back so this is a pretty funny you can play with it i share the link you know it's pretty easy you you might need to retry me all the time before getting your request through yeah but you can put whatever you like i mean i i saw stefano and you know ask for a frog on a skateboard in a river and that stuff was quite amazing so it is not infinitely powerful but it's still funny and of course well this is an advanced state of the art research kind of machine learning this is not what we are going to do today but it's funny so back to back to us so validating to tune and to compare the the various models and then with the testing set you do the final assessment of uh the the the performance of your model by evaluating the metrics we were talking about before so recall precision and so on okay so you have your model and now you want to go to the final to use the model everything that you have seen so far was done let's say by a data scientist in the back of their house with their laptop or whatever kind of resources they had but now that the model is done that's probably where production usage starts so this final model is going to be deployed somewhere in production and it will be constantly receiving new data in the form of features and you will be it will be giving out predictions in the form of labels so this step is called prediction and that's not necessarily something about the future but it's prediction because the model does not know the actual labels it just tries to guess them and hopefully it will do it will do that correctly most of the time according to your metrics so the final model will just have input as features and will it will be giving out labels maybe with some probabilities associated to it depends on the model okay so that's it for uh maybe i said if we can skip that yes this is what i want yeah i propose to skip that that demo um let me copy paste that that url for everyone as well if they want to but uh yeah okay so um the first model we are going to run is k-means well maybe i will just show the demo just to as a way oh yeah so okay means is a clustering algorithm what what is a clustering algorithm you have a set of points which might be a set of entries in a list let's say you have customers and you have numbers associated to each customer so your features might be time spent in the shop and the amount paid and maybe i don't know how many aisles they visited during the shop whatever and you want to group you want to find groups of similar users more mathematically you have points in a in a space let's say a two-dimensional space like here and you want to find groups of points that are next to each other so for example in this case you have points and you give the algorithm as input the number of groups or clusters you want to get so that's very important it is it is an unsupervised algorithm you do not give labels you just give the bunch of points to the algorithm and you ask it please find groups of points that are close to each other and in this case uh so basically what happens so this is the demo cedric has put the the link to the the algorithm starts by placing these these initial seats arbitrarily randomly and somewhere in in the in the plane and then with a number of iterations the points move in a way that minimizes the the skew that let's say every point moves in a direction where uh every point moves iteration after iteration in um so that it is more in the middle in the center of mass of its point in the middle point of its of its points and eventually there will be nothing to do anymore and this will be the final answer but you see the final thing so if i start with a different placement of the seats the final result is again the same that's because i'm [Music] that's because the algorithm works very well but still there are two uh two limits of two limitations of this algorithm one is that you have to provide the number of clusters you want to get so if you look at if you look at this distribution okay now try just look at the small points to my eye this is naturally four groups so if i ask for three clusters then i will get a purple one a blue one but then this red one will be really just two clusters put together and this is something the algorithm does not know so if i want if i ask for a fourth cluster maybe it might be that the algorithm captures what seems natural to me like this but there is also a hidden dependency on the initial location of the seeds so if you start like this you see it will be not the optimal choice so the algorithm has converged and i found four clusters but this is a bit of an unnatural choice so there is the the risk of getting stuck in a local minimum so to speak and and to to uh not to capture the most natural grouping that being said this algorithm is in general very powerful and it has a lot of applications in real life such as this grouping customers depending on their shopping pattern or whatever that's why the first demo here the first algorithm we are going to run is k-means clustering and to do that you just go back to your jupyter notebook here and you click on 1k means if you click on this it you will see the jupyter interface so for those who do not know this yet you are running python code so you're running code but in a in a step-by-step way so okay except don't mind the the titles and the images but the point is that you have python code plus some called the so-called magic commands like this one and they are grouped in cells you see there is a cell with a bunch of imports we prepared a cell that does some initialization of secrets reading some secret file there is a cell that creates this session object and so on so instead of being a single long script it is a group of cells each cell has python code and to execute so we can run the the code cell by cell and we can stop in the middle and inspect variables we can go back and rerun a previous cell and all that so it's what is called interactive computing at its fullest so it's more uh it's more than a ripple no okay so how do you execute the cells this is important click on click on the cell and you do shift enter like i just did if you go to the first cell and hit shift enter you will see that there will be an asterisk here in in the square brackets on the left during the time the cell is executing and then it will just bear a number which is the sequential number the cells have been executed okay i clicked in k means on jupiter and i get an error message not found that's pretty weird to loop i think for some reason you might have stumbled upon a weird git pod environment because that's not the first time you see something strange maybe at this point the best thing would be to scrap your git pot and recreate it from scratch hoping for better luck because it's really strange this message right yeah message not fun on clicking a notebook that's i mean if if this page gives you this listing and you can click on it then it's the file is supposed to exist otherwise that's very weird okay and i don't think there are any permission involved to read those files shouldn't be okay the other works perfectly that's strange okay okay oh that just just this one all right okay so maybe you can uh yes it is okay to run the notebooks inside i am running them inside but uh okay sorry you mean inside the mini browser of git but that's a bit yes uh yeah so the the point is at the very end of each notebook you see an instruction to stop uh the spark and also when you exit one scenario you should stop yes before stopping you should stop completely any every notebook before opening the other because gitbot has limited resources but and it's not your power it's the power of it so you know even if you are working on the ipad or something you still have the same power as everybody else it's on the server side yeah okay so um okay so maybe i switch back to demo mode keep less real estate on screen okay so let me go through the cells and execute them okay so import for those familiar with python these are just imports of a lot of things in particular uh pi spark machine learning stuff and also a cassandra driver to connect to astra db and other secondary things there is also a tool we made to show a data frame to show the first lines and there is also a tool to see the structure of cassandra tables but those are secondary in a sense now the next cell just reads the secrets file that was created during setup and makes available uh the the information that we will be later used to to reach the data on your database so if i shift enter this one this will just very quickly be executed now um a funny thing of notebooks is that while you execute you can you can insert new cells anywhere so if you're not editing it now you see i'm i have a cursor here i if i hit escape i am in no non editing mode and i can add a new cell by pressing b and in this new cell i can quickly check i write the name of a variable hit enter and i will get an output so like this easy so this is why interactive computing is very good when it comes to you know interactively executing code so i i have to admit okay so back to us uh this is i'm not going to inspect every line of the code because we are more focused on the general usage but this is how you connect to cassandra to astrodb in particular uh we are passing the credentials to to this cluster and then to this connect method to get back a session object this session variable will contain will contain access to cassandra base as a check we can execute this row this uh cell here which does a connectivity test it just uses the connection to read a standard table and it will print if everything works it will print an output like this one connect it to cluster at data center and this is just to check that we are actually speaking to to our database then you set the session to work in a particular key space which is our machine learning key space and then if you want to look you remember the scripts at the beginning that were creating a bunch of tables and putting data in them so one of the tables is called social media and this cell will give me and if we give me a printout of how the table is structured well so briefly speaking there are a bunch of columns all of them are numbers so and and each so this table contains a data set about social media posts including how many uh reactions how many said reactions how many times the the social item was shared and so on so these are all numbers plus of course there is a status id which is just an unique identifier for every row and then there is a social type which can take the the value of video or [Music] text or post video or image i don't remember picture of video here so the goal is to use k-means clustering to try and tell apart pictures and videos just by looking at the numbers this is an experiment will it work will it not work how with which accuracy these are the questions right so in the process of creating a model and testing it these are the typical questions you are going to ask yourself and now the important part you remember that this container this docker container offers spark available for you this is how you create a spark session within python so this is using pi spark and it does a bunch of stuff in particular it has to provide connection information to reach cassandra and this is how you do that again this is using the same connect bundle client id and client secret we used to directly connect to the database but this time these are passed over to spark session and once the spark session is created we can use the spy spark method to tell dear spark read an object of type cassandra table which which has this name and lives in this key space and please load it and then if i hit enter this execution will take a few seconds because it has to create all the stuff but the important thing is that this is happening through spark now in a real environment you would have maybe 20 spark machines 20 spark workers running in parallel and reading chunks of your database tables from several servers and doing all the things behind your back up to getting your final number this count here now in this case we are playing with a smaller scale spark which is a single executor but still we are using spark uh so this is the idiomatic way you would read the table even in in a gi gigantic spark cluster okay so we know we have so many rows for social media now there are a bunch of show commands like this one you see uh this is a sample of the spark data frame that basically mimics the same structure as a cassandra table photo video photo photo photo and so on okay well this is nothing so important but we need a way to convert social type from a string to a number because machine learning models usually work with numbers and to do that we have ready-made tools so a string indexer sorry yeah string indexer is such an object that will be able to automatically make the conversion so i just run this part we create a string indexer and we apply it to creating a new column and this is it you see from social type the column label has been added to my data frame to my spark data frame and 0 and one mean photon video so the machine learning model will as usual will work with numbers uh okay so maybe this is irrelevant now you see every show the f takes some time that's because every show the f will be retriggering execution of a spark command uh now if you are working if you are just training probably you would not use all of those show the f and your execution will be a single spark pipeline that would be as fast as possible but today we are here to show stuff how it works okay so um this is a command to group the rows by social type and get the counts of them so we know we have so many video posts and so many photo posts okay then uh remember we are doing an exploratory study so to speak so we can use pandas and it's plotting facilities to get a nice drawing so here you see we have a number of likes on the x-axis and number of comments on the y-axis and we have we replace we scatter plot the points and we have the luxury of having the the label even though this is just a clustering algorithm so we can color them in two different colors uh having i don't remember i think pictures are the yellow and the no no no that's the other way around picture posts are the purple one and yellow are the video ones so there is probably some kind of pattern now the question is ah here yellow is video okay now the question is will k-means algorithm be able to to find the two clusters corresponding to video pictures remember that k means does not know about labels this is something that we keep as a secret for ourselves so this is again a step of taking we we decide to work in the likes comments space so in the plane and this this assembler this vector assembler is a facility from pi spark machine learning tools that just takes two different columns and make them into a column with a vector an array of two items so this is not something very profound but very useful but now this is the important part you see now we create a model of type k means clustering we set the number of cluster to two and we set a random seed that will be used to place the initial positions and these is where you fit you fit the model on your training data so it will key it will take these points as an input and try to find two exactly two clusters let's see then while it runs it will be just a few seconds while it runs you see we also take make predictions so we apply the model to the data itself and we we can compare the prediction to the label you see zero zero one zero this is a wrong prediction you see this is a false negative in the parlance we saw before but of course this is just a sample of five lines five rows secretly we know which posts are pictures and which posts are videos so we can do a first assessment of how close to each other than counters are you see the prediction column gives a lot of zeros and just a few ones while the social type which is the real thing the label is more balanced which means that probably the model is not so good after all so we can comp we can do a similar plot as this one this this plot used as color map the real thing right the very the real fact whether it was pictures or videos let's see the same plot using prediction for the color map so using the result of the clustering let's see these is the two clusters you see this is not very good so k-means was not really the tool to use for this data and i think the reason is probably well it's not these points are not in two cl to close pack the groups separate from each other this is just a series of tales of points starting from zero zero onward so being able to tell them apart is sure possible but probably k-means is not the best tool so k-means is more able at finding groups when they are clearly separated or maybe maybe one can choose different different uh features other than number of likes and number of comments okay so let's skip this sample usage you can play with that just for your fun but the important thing is we created trained and basically tested okay means clustering algorithm you know it turns out this will this was probably not the best algorithm for the data at hand this happens this is why usually data science is a iterative process you have to try several models in many cases you have to tune them maybe automate tuning automate the search for parameters and again and again until you find a satisfactory result okay so now this is very important for everyone how do you close cleanly close this notebook to save resources for the next one you see this spark stop cell here okay shift enter now the spark session is closed resources are being freed and the final thing you got file menu and close and halt where halt means that you also close yes the notebook you also close the underlying server side of the notebook so the engine keeping the the python runtime running okay so this was the first i think we are really much running out of time so maybe we can run what about random forest as a classification which is the topic for the homework yeah i mean yeah let's of absolutely cover what is nina so let's cover random forest of course you are invited to play with the other ones and also to look in the slides because there is much more information there are so now sorry yeah what is knife with notebooks is is really uh you find there are a lot of text so you see the result and the results are explained as text so you can do that notated every step is described and also you should cross this information with the slides to get a better idea what's going on let me open random forest this is a classification algorithm um something weird is happening of course yeah i see you know i know what happened this happened oh you eat the time out of skip yes so maybe i should resume this again okay which will not work [Music] because this will just stuck here so now i see the not found error you know oh because it was to be because it will not restart the pull stock it will not restart the docker compose stuck but it is still here in the stop state i wonder what's happening so now i now i see where the problem lies for to loop as well so you have this is stuck into the stopping state which is that's nasty i can't seem to and exit stopping state for some reason timeout open workspace but it will not work [Music] no there we are but yeah who knows so during the time it's starting up maybe just showing the random forest slide yeah okay let's go to random forest which is here yes so run them for us could be used both for classification and regression uh it's based on decision tree so this is where the forest name came from so there are some simplified algorithm just to do decision tree that will uh you know build those decision tree as an example the issue with those three are they are over fitted now they will work very well with the with the data sets uh but then when you run the training set it's overfitted so to avoid that offer overfitted so the first things and next slide the first thing we are doing is uh splitting the data set so we are creating something called bootstrapped dataset so we will take a chunk of records and you know be a subpart of your data set then we will only select a subset of the features so let's say your your your data set the mode you know the data that you have have i don't know a lot of columns so the columns are called the features you will find you will design a subset of features randomly picked and then for each one so uh randomly choose dataset bootstrap did randomly picked the subset of features and you run the decision tree yeah with that you will get a multiple decision tree that you can you know execute get multiple results what you do at the end is aggregate those results doing an average just to get to get the result so it's called uh so bootstrap data sets and aggregating is also called uh bagging so maybe the demo yeah so the point is that you you get more solid against overfitting by asking a few three a few different trees to do the same task of classification and then you take the average if it's numbers or the the mode if it's a a category label but the point is to sit on the whole forest instead of a single tree and every tree is just a bunch of yes no questions more or less so it's an explicit yes no tree that is created by by the the algorithm looking at the data and finding the best questions that make you get uh to an a yes no answer or whatever it is the labeling you want to classify and this is all done by the by the algorithm of course now let's see if we managed to make this work you see this is now starting again but i'm sure this is there already and i just have to do this that should be enough yeah compose d i think we are good to go with this trick and that should be it okay so yeah because even if gitbot will close your workspace uh you still have a state and you can come back and then so it's a git pod stops your machine after some number of minutes but it will not delete it until one week or two weeks after it goes dormant so i was lucky enough to be able to restart just the container that should already have everything ready okay so let's see this random forest algorithm at work now well i will just gloss over the imports again we are here trying to read the same secrets from the end file for connecting to cassandra i'm creating the session to reach the database and this is actually just as a way to have a look at this table because there is a table called wines and guess what it contains a lot of information over the chemist chemical contents of every wine there are a few uh thousands of wines each one is a has different densities quantity of sulfur ph sugar content whatever a bunch of numbers but we also have a quality a number from 0 to 10 given by expert wine tasting experts whatever like cedric is for example yeah you know that's blasphemer to me to evaluate the quality of a vine wine using a machine yes even just reducing to a number might be tricky anyway for the sake of the of this algorithm let's assume let's ask ourselves is it possible to just estimate the quality of a wine by starting from this bunch of numbers so we will basically try a classification method where the inputs are all of these features chemical properties of the wine and the output would be the quality of course we now have the quality because this is the label set for this supervised learning method but our goal is to have a model a random forest model able to estimate this quality without knowing it for new wines of course and to do that again we will use spark ml so this is nothing different than before we are just opening the spark session and using that to read the cassandra table called wines as we saw before this yndf this data frame is a spark data frame representation of the table and it has this number of rows so a few more than 5 000 different wines each one with the quality so this is just out of our choice we filter out low quality wines because we want a model uh focusing on good wines six upward and we have a new data frame with uh of course you see quality is six six six there are seven eights and stuff like that and all of the features now again with this vector assembler i just uh make it so alcohol chlorides citric acid and so on instead of being columns become a single column with a list of numbers and this number this list this column will be called features then okay let's run it because it's easier to show than to explain okay you see besides all of these columns we just have features which is for every wine there is a vector containing 12.5035 which is just this number here collected like this we also asked the machine learning the pi spark ml tools to make this quality into a number from zero upward so it will basically be quality minus six you see six here is converted to a zero in the label so at the end the model will be trained with features and label columns and that's it and it will be able hopefully to guess label given a new features every other column was just an intermediate step for the machine learning model and let's run it well first let's split very important point one of the tools from machine learning tools is random split which just says i just get my my 6 000 rows split into 80 and 20 into parts that we call train and test ready to use so we will train the model with 80 of the rows and use the remaining independent 20 to test how the model performs and this is where the fitting is done so you see i create an object called random forest classifier this is this is a machine learning object offered by the p spark the pi spark library you just have to tell it how what is the column with the labels what is the column with the features and how many trees to place in your forest how many different trees to create and how many trees will be asked when it's time to do a prediction to get the average or in this case probably the the me the the mode okay so with this single line we ask spark to do the training in a distributed way so that could be also over billions of rows in principle if you have enough machines which is very cool so for the homeworks you know not spoiling on anything but designing how many trees you want designing what is the subset you want to do would be some uh parameter you would play with to increase your uh accuracy and precision absolutely okay so you see this is where we fit the model and we directly apply the model to the test data set and we get this prediction data frame and this is it there are 700 so predictions and you see we secretly know the labels of them so one one zero zero this column here label and we can compare it with prediction well this one becomes a zero so that's not very very accurate but let's okay we this is just the same thing with a bit less clutter by the way every predictions come with a list of probabilities associated to each category zero one two and so forth luckily the pi spark libraries also offer facilities to measure metrics so we want to measure the accuracy and this we do easily with this ready-made tool so we can just run this cell we will use this evaluator object to get the accuracy the accuracy is 0.74 okay whatever it is that means you remember accuracy that means more or less that 74 percent of the cases are guessed right maybe in the case of wine this is the best metric after all so we do not give a a different value to getting too high or too low quality for some reason that would be the best metrics to use so there is no yes no situation with a lot of knowing about in a small set of yes like in the in the cancer example okay so this is the final answer of the model and here you see how you would use this model well actually over a single line so that's a bit uh funny if you want because usually if you are using pi spark machine learning tools you probably want to run it on a very large data set as well even when you are predicting on your input but anyway this is how you would do that so you would create uh artificial spark data frame out of this single row if you want and just run again model transform as you did with the test okay okay so these is this is the result of running the model after training let me close the spark session to conserve resources and close the notebook okay so i have to confirm exiting of course there are other very interesting models here for you to try out at this point and i think we can wrap up and go back to the slides for the last part or maybe we can directly go to the quiz yeah i think we okay i hope you are still connected to mentee let me give you the coordinates again go to mendy.com and enter two five six one zero four zero two it's in the chat it's here on this slide and let me open this menu so we are online let me again okay quiz this time okay so please join us again if you didn't already this time there will be a few questions on what we saw so far you have to be fast because the fastest get more points and after you win you will be given some nice data stack swag so get your fingers ready and be correct and fast okay so let's wait for a few more people to join maybe i can show the qr code again for joining yeah i see in the chat that some sometimes the notebook trouble comes up because notebook invites you to run in a random order the cells if you want and sometimes it works sometimes it's it's good with notebooks to be able to go back change a thing and rerun a part of the of the code and all that but sometimes yeah sometimes you're just tempted to jump ahead and then you miss a single variable that you had to set or you know uh it's very easy to be taken away by the freedom of notebooks which might be too much sometimes okay okay so let's see let's start with the quiz okay what do you think we start with the quiz shall i play some music well let's just yeah we we don't want to be too late but at the same time for all the folks that was there with us took two hours let's wait one more minute for everyone to add a chance or a few seconds i put back the mentee code and uh yeah okay it's yeah 1008 so let's go let's go okay okay so with the quiz first question okay a lot of people are joining okay so first question answer past to get more points apache cassandra is a fast in-memory database specialized in machine learning or maybe it is a distributed computation engine it is a distributed highly resilient database or it is the back end for the notebooks so what is apache cassandra by the way uh look at mendy and not at youtube for the answers because youtube is a bit a few seconds delayed so you will get not real-time answers okay so correct 21 people gave it the right answer it is a highly resilient distributed database let's see let's have a look at the dashboard and the leaderboard okay so man seems to have a plan leading by the fastest wow okay yes okay so number two and give him number three all right but there are a lot of questions still to go so let's move forward question number two answer fast to get more points apache spark is a fasting memory database specialized in machine learning or maybe it is the distributed computation engine or it is a distributed database or it is the backend for your notebooks you see same answers different questions so what is apache spark and your answer is time's up yes it is distributed computation engine 21 right answers again very good let's see and now the leaderboard is little bit changed i think so let's see matt kevin and santiago on top okay and bastaba is question today question number three okay so a labeled data set is used in supervised machine learning unsupervised machine learning deep neural networks or field paleontology you were inspired by these questions i like guild paleontology okay so label data set supervised machine learning very good yeah it's not wrong that it's it can be used for deep neural networks but of course this is what what uh this is a characteristic this is what distinguishes supervised from unsupervised so the right answer was supervised machine learning 30 correct answers and let's see the timing and whether there are changes in the leaderboard this time so prices will go to the first three at the end of the quiz yes and to everyone else our congratulations anyway question number four answer fast get points okay so what uh what did we use today cassandra spark and high spark and jungle or maybe node.js and react or fightspark and jupiter or maybe cobble and web assembly let's see did we use cobble by sparking jupiter someone funny answered cobble and wave awesomely i can't believe you did it for real that you must be kidding even though kobold is pretty cool not only because you can take out the b and getting cool but also because it is still powering the most important banking infrastructure in the world i understand so there are it is a critical piece of infrastructure what runs on cobble okay so um vry fastest but still the first three in the leaderboard are still there question number five an important step in training is storing the model to file or the train test data split or maybe repeating training on different computers or when you train it's better to keep you hydrated which is important i have to say don't forget the picture of the cyborg in the gym and train test data split very good of course storing the model to file after training is probably what you want to do for using them later repeating on different computers is really not so important maybe it's more repeating on different random seeds maybe but splitting training and testing is by far the most important thing you can do and most of you gave the right answer and the leaderboard is ah bastabora is climbing and still mad kevin and talia are leading and it's time for question number six let's see answer fast and correct precision versus accuracy oh wow two terms for the same thing or you should always minimize both and in most cases focus on accuracy or in most cases focus on precision that's a bit subjective of course but in most cases focus on precision no yeah i i just want to comment that that the second option is really doesn't make sense because you you probably do not want to minimize precision neither accuracy maybe you might want to maximize them but minimize really does not work okay so yeah for precision in many cases is the preferable metric more than accuracy of course that's depends on the model and on your goal what you want to do with the model but still ah matt santiago and viraj now very good but still i think this last question will make it possible to jump over in the leaderboard and let's start with the last question answer fast okay the output of a model on new input is association estimation prediction or witchcraft now i think the most important here is being fast because it's probably easy to get the correct answer but you have to be faster than your opponents let's see [Music] and prediction is correct witchcraft nobody did that okay so let's see let's see who was the fastest avishak but that's not enough and we have a winner matt and virai and santiago second and third congratulations to all of you but in particular congratulations to matt biraj and santiago who will be receiving their swag now very important thing is a very important thing is take a screenshot of your screen with the many winning screen not not a screenshot of the youtube a screenshot of your own device or tab whatever where you are playing so you can later give that to us and claim your swag so very important very very important i can give you a link here in the youtube chat uh maybe i'll keep this open a second so congratulations to the winners take a screenshot and go to this link here workshop swap fill the form and we will get in touch with you very soon okay so i hope you took your screenshots because now i want to sorry i want to move the mentee to this point to collect and maybe we will leave this open to collect feedback and suggestions for the next workshop or the next time we do this one i'm sure a suggestion would be trim down some parts and get to the practice yes i agree in the meantime quick information about the homework so the homework is described in details in the readme in the github repository and there are some a bunch of a couple actually for questions about theory followed by an assignment in particular go back to the random forest and try to make it work better by tweaking some parameters by looking in the documentation what parameters are there to choose and yeah so you will have a look if you get stuck of course you can get back to us we are there on discord because the youtube chat is going to disappear very soon and there we go so this chord um please join us on the discord channel because this is where the discussion goes on you see there are channels to to speak about various topics workshops but not only that also development and so on and this is where you will find us later after this workshop is is over and no to to submit the homework do you have a google form so you will just have to fill some questions do a screenshot upload the description in the google form validated yes many a lot of time ago we used github for the for the submissions but that was a bit not optimal because you had to give us your email address for us to together and that was public so maybe better to have something where that is not open to the public because you might want to keep your email address private that's yeah that's one of also we can make the form uh retriable if you miss because to pass and get the badge i mean you need to have uh 70 of the question right i think yeah okay so um last point is we have a youtube channel we probably you probably know that but please subscribe because we keep publishing and and cool new stuff and having new workshops so you might be interested in what we do and i think yeah we will come back to weekly cadence in two weeks uh so same same time same same days on wednesdays uh two hours stream covering a lot of topics okay so there's a question by aman at the beginning of the workshop there was a quiz well it was more a survey to know our audience with questions such as what is your experience with python and stuff like that so the quiz for the swag was only at the end of the workshop so this is the one we just had okay i think that's all of it for today is there yeah keep in touch uh ask the question and discord even if you watch the recording right now we will be happy to answer your questions there is no bad question and all the materials are on github hope you enjoyed the interactivity it was a lot of content maybe too much today but you know we are coming back every week and we will uh you know make it better yes and uh of course the material is there in the github repo for you to do all of it by yourself so all the notebooks are there you can run them inspect them tweak them play with them and of course we are there for answers and discussion on on discord so please get in touch and we are looking forward to your homework submissions we have a bunch of badges here and we are ready to you know give them out i think with that we are all done it's 21 past so it's high time we close and
