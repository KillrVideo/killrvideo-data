thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you I found someone new now I have more room no more formats to change [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign well hello everyone um I'm hoping coming through okay here all right um so hey let's uh let's go ahead and get started with the workshop then um yeah let's see here let me let me get my uh my phone here where I can keep a uh keep an eye on the chat all right oh hey ADI can you be a little more specific about which link isn't working for you uh I can't tell if it's the the Discord one or there's something else there maybe I I checked out the Discord link as far as I can tell that uh that should work um anyway uh for those of you who are who are joining hey welcome uh welcome to data Stacks developers and uh today we're going to do a Hands-On Workshop of building a full stack application with Cassandra and uh react.js um yeah the um so so this is this is actually a new format that that we're going to try we are just gonna run today's workshop for a half hour um that that's it so I'm going to kind of go through the material rather quickly here but um hopefully it shouldn't take much because because really the um you know there isn't a whole lot to the uh the the application itself you know in in terms of uh in in terms of the code so so yeah just realizing that um I should get a couple of other things ready here quick hold on just a second hey there we go and I want to do one more thing foreign actually it's a good idea to get my water bottle out of the way so that that I can see that'd be that'd be awesome right there it is okay okay okay now we're good all right so let's get back to the slides um so you know for those of you who um who may not know me uh my name is Aaron fletz I'm a developer Advocate with uh data Stacks uh I have my three-time Cassandra MVP you know I've done some uh some work in database engineering um for a few Fortune 50 uh Enterprises and a couple of startups along the way I am the host of the Apache Cassandra Corner podcast so hey if you've got a great story about Cassandra please reach out to me I'd love to help you tell that story to everyone um also I've worked as an author on a couple of books and um actually I have one coming out in uh September but uh yeah we'll we'll talk about that another time all right so one question that we've been asking ourselves here at uh here at datastacks is um is how do we make developing for Cassandra easier um because ultimately you know we want to make sure that that you folks who are who are the developers are getting the tools that you need sorry my my head's moving around here I'm trying to find the uh the right dead center of the the talking bubble and I I think I finally got it oh hey I see a question in the chat um babajide babajide I apologize if I didn't pronounce that correctly um we will not be using spring boot today um and actually I'll uh I'll get to our Tech stack in just a bit but anyway so one of the one of the things that we've been looking at is how to make developing applications on Cassandra easier and um oh sorry got ahead of myself there and and the idea is is hey we want to build some things kind of around and in the uh Cassandra ecosystem that kind of help you folks out to kind of kind of help you you know lessen that learning curve of uh Cassandra and be more productive faster that's that's really what we're looking at here um so so for those of you who are in the uh in the workshop who may be new to Apache Cassandra um I have this this slide here as well as the next one of what is Apache Cassandra well essentially it is a no sequel distributed database that's designed to be big data ready distributed it's it's built to um you know to handle both read and write performance um as it scales linearly um and what linear scalability means is um you know if you establish that you know you excuse me that you can get a certain level of throughput with like say you know 15 nodes in a cluster that you know that if you need to double your throughput you need to you need to double the number of nodes in the cluster and that'll scale in nearly there won't be any any loss there or any um you know any other any other well there was another word I was thinking about for loss but I I can't come to it right now but anyway so that kind of makes scaling a little bit easier at least Computing out the amount of resources you need um Cassandra approaches the uh the high availability eventual consistency Paradigm for data um it's also you know um has a little little degree of uh self-healing as well so that if a node goes down um the neighboring nodes will actually kind of maintain um any rights that that came in and um you know kind of help that node recover its consistency once it comes back up probably my favorite thing about Cassandra the thing that I feel it really does the best is uh geographic distribution you know you can um you can deploy Cassandra to a data center like on the east coast and on the west coast and maybe Central Europe and you can do a right to any one of those and it'll replicate that right around all three data centers that way your rights can happen anywhere yet your reads are localized and preventing your customers or your users from having to jump across the pond to um to hit a data center so and of course Cassandra is platform and vendor independent um you know you can run it on you know all Linux distributions uh the hardware you can run it on is pretty variable you know um people run it on bare metal on openstack on virtualbox um anywhere out in the cloud I I don't recommend this but I've I've seen folks even run Cassandra on Raspberry Pi's before so it definitely definitely can be done all right so who uses Cassandra well there are some big names out there who do I'm I'm sure you recognize uh some of these Brands as they're as they're coming across here um there's there are many many big um big uh companies out there that that use it that aren't on this list and uh actually are probably on this list somewhere um there actually are quite a bit of um quite a bit of Enterprises out there you know that are that are running Cassandra at extremely large scale um you know the uh the ones we showed before of like you know Disney plus and Netflix and you know maybe some of the ones that weren't there like like apple are doing things at very large scale and um and actually helping us you know kind of Drive um a lot of the new development that's happening on happening on Apache Cassandra and and really bring us into that that next realm of database technology so a little bit of a detour of what is asterdb again for those of you who are new to data Stacks Developers um Astrid B is our Cassandra in the cloud um so essentially it's a it's a cloud native version of Cassandra that that we've built that we support that is across all three major clouds um so you kind of get the the benefit of um you know the network of whichever cloud provider you're using whether it's Google or Azure or um you know awkws um and actually we we have customers that do hybrid Cloud replication or multi-cloud replication as well um so that's something that Astra is very very versatile for um the cool thing with Astra is it has a very very robust free tier um if you're running a small project or if you're a student and you just want to try it out you can do so without entering any payment information and you know you could even run a fairly small project out there continuously and not you know surpass the bounds of the resources that we offer for free so Astra is definitely pretty cool and it makes standing up Cassandra so easy to do that that's what we're going to use for today's Workshop all right oh of course I just totally talked through my uh my next slide here without um without actually looking at it so my apologies on that um I suppose the only thing that I failed to mention here is the no touch scalability um so that if you are a subscriber for astrodv and you do have you know access to those more more resources you know we can detect when your cluster is kind of reaching a critical mass on resources and auto scale and give you more um as you need it so that's something that's something worth mentioning okay so for today what are we building well we're going to build a simple application um with react on top of Cassandra um essentially we're going to build a application that will track nerd holidays and you know I always find this to be be a little fun um you know so so we can track things like um you know Pi Day Talk Like a Pirate Day Rush 2112 Day Star Wars day and many many others um so that that's what we're going to be dealing with uh today all right uh for those of you who have worked with uh react before um this will probably look familiar to you and it's actually in the instructions in the git repo as well but we do have some dependencies that we're going to use today excuse me the uh we're gonna use the um the free tier of data grid from um from mui um and I forget what the the mui stands for to be to be exact um but uh we're also going to use the axios library which is going to allow us to make a rest call and pull back our data without having to worry about a driver so that's going to be that's going to be really cool material UI hey thanks Mahesh all right so again our Tech stack looks just like this you know we we're going to have a react.js app and it's going to connect to um asterdb using rest um so how is it how is it going to do that well you'll notice this little thing on top called Stargate oh again I got ahead of myself we'll talk about Stargate in just a second uh before we get there though this is the data model that we're going to use you know once we go ahead and create our database and um you know enter our key space which key Space is really just a logical structure that lets you hold tables in in Cassandra we're going to create a new table called nerd holidays and it'll have uh properties of like um like year bucket to help us do some partitioning event date and each holiday will have an ID and of course the name all right ah here we go so how can we connect using rest well we're going to do that using a project called Stargate um Stargate is something that we originally built and designed to um you know to work with Astra but we've actually split it out and open sourced it so you can stand it up in front of you know regular Apache Cassandra and really it can be extended out to other databases as well um but this offers several different apis that allow you to talk to your Astra or Cassandra database such as you know graphql you know we have a document API if you're you're used to dealing with like flexible schema rest API which we'll use today um as well as grpc which is Google's a remote procedure call Api all right so really the way that Stargate works I'm just kind of looking at the time here and realizing that if I'm shooting for a half hour or we're half done so I'm a uh I may step up the pace here just a little bit um so anyway so Stargate essentially what it is is it you know it's uh it's an app that you know you stand up um you have things out there like uh like load balancers for it and essentially it takes requests and forwards them on to uh to your Cassandra cluster one thing that you can look at and those of you who have used Astra before know is that you do have access to the Swagger UI or rest API and essentially what that's going to do is give you um a whole bunch of different endpoints that you can hit and pull data back easily uh with your with your application so this is what we're going to be using today all right well good you know I I mentioned I was going to be I was a little uh you know nervous about the time and well here we are Hands-On so let's give this a shot here um the GitHub repo for today and actually I think if um you're in the chat you can just do a um an exclamation point or a bang GitHub and it should give you this this uh address um oh you know what I'd better make sure that works because now that I look at that I'm not convinced that's correct we have a different um oh yeah we just have a um different structure for the um for the URLs here yeah you know what oh okay the one the one that's coming through from uh from bang GitHub is correct um it is this Workshop Dash nerd Dash holidays um at datastacks Dev repo is is what you want here yeah I must have uh I must have had this left over from my other one so let me let me fix my presentation live here Workshop Dash as you can see I've uh got a few things running all at once here no I didn't want to do that well that's okay there we go well that's somewhat better that's okay all right um so here's the um here's the repo it's this uh let me just make sure that um yeah I'm making use of my available desktop here all right so the uh the readme here does has have some things that that should help you out um there is a link here for Astra so I'm going to start by clicking that all right so if you've never signed into Astra before this is where you can do single sign-on with your GitHub or with your Google account um I am going to sign in with Google and this is taking a little bit here okay there we go you know I wonder how much of this is uh me trying to do 20 things at once on my laptop and uh it's just uh it's just making everything slow um oh by the way something new and asked her to be that I can talk about while this uh while this all loads up here is um we do now offer Vector search um and for those of you who um who have done you know some AIML you know utilizing Vector search as well as um a NS or approximate nearest neighbors um that's actually something you can you can search for and have on your tables in in Astra DB right now so uh so that's that's pretty seriously cool um in fact the next Workshop I do and if in a few weeks or in another month I'm trying to remember when it is but um but that's going to be about with an example that I've done to the vector search all right so I'm going to click the create database button over here I'm going to call this um my nerd Workshop we'll just do that oh and I forgot the D now it's not important you know the uh the name of the database isn't really uh isn't really that big a deal let me just double check something here of how I want to name my key space okay so my key space name is going to be live underscore coding um and this is something that that you should probably set as your as your key space as well uh my provider for my database will be Google Google Cloud um that's where we get with the the free tier and if you look here in under region most of these regions are are locked but I'm in the U.S so I'm going to stay in Us East one and I'm going to pick Monks Corner South Carolina that's our what we offer is our free data center and I will say create database all right that is going to take a little bit of time to come up um so while that's coming up I'm going to jump back to the um back to um the GitHub repo here on the readme and just kind of talk through some of this essentially what we're going to do once that comes up is um we're going to do this use live coding command um in cql and what that's going to do is switch us over to our live coding key space we're also going to paste in this table definition and that'll build our nerd holidays table now there's all this data here um that we could copy and paste but you know I've seen I've had it hit or miss you know success wise with um with doing that um so we're actually going to you know I've I've forked this repo of course and um inside of it here is this nerd holidays CSV file I'm going to just drag that in uh in Astra and show you how to uh how to import data that way but the other thing we should do while the database is coming up is let's click on this open in gitpod button here um so I'm going to right click here and say open a new tab because I still want my um my repo my git repo open here and what gitpod is gitpod is a virtual development environment um it's uh it's going to ask you to sign in with your GitHub account if you haven't already and I have so I'll just say yep continue open workspace um and essentially what this is going to do is bring up a session of vs code out in the cloud using our um our Workshop nerd holidays uh git repo and that's going to allow us to uh to build up a lot of the application so um this is also going to take uh you know just a few minutes to uh to spin up here so while this is happening I'm going to jump back to Astra and just see how my how my database is coming along oh hey look at that it is active oh come on come on well maybe I need to uh to refresh here huh well I apologize folks this is taking a little bit of time here well the good news is that my gitpod is building you know this is about being efficient right you know running two things that that tend to take a while at the same time that's uh you know that'll that'll help foreign all right come on come on hey there we go I have my nerd Workshop database here so I'm going to click on this all right so one thing that um that I'll need to do here um let me click over on the three dots oh no that's that's not right maybe I can go back here to my database list and now click on the three dots hey there we go um we will need to generate a token to connect with a database so from my main database dashboard here I can see all of them that I have I'm going to click on the three dots there by nerd Workshop and I'm going to say generate a new token all right so the um all I'm going to say is uh database administrator and then I'm just going to say generate hmm you know that didn't seem to do anything let's try that again hey there we go much better all right um I'm going to uh copy my token here um the the client ID in secret um with the way that we're accessing the database we won't need that we will just need the token but it's also a good idea too if you want to download the token details because once you leave this screen you will not uh will not be able to come back here again anyway so now that I have the token let me go ahead and uh jump back to my nerd holidays database here and I'm going to say cql console all right and uh for those of you who have used Cassandra before this is actually going to start up a version of cql shell out in the cloud okay so if I remember right my keyspace name is live underscore coding use live actually it should tab complete oh tab completion outstanding okay next um let me go and grab my table definition here and copy that and then we'll go back to here I will paste my table definition all right outstanding um now let me go back to nerd Workshop over here and I can click this load data button okay so now I'm going to select a file and let me go ahead and oh nope there we go workspace and this is in my um I think I just called it on my local here yeah nerd holidays react and I'm gonna grab this nerdholidays.csv and that's going to load excellent um let's say next this will bring us up to uh you know kind of help match up a um help match things up here with uh with what we've just done so our table is nerd underscore holidays so I'm gonna do that um I'm going to say yep you're oh let me double check our um yup intent text and uuid right there we go and we'll make this a uuid for those of you don't know uid is a a Type 4 uuid in in Cassandra I mean you can tell because it has that that four leading in the uh the third part of it here um one thing you'll see too is that in Cassandra we also use time uids which is a type 1 uid all right so here I'm going to specify um your bucket as my partitioning key and then for clustering columns we're going to go with event date and ID just like that all right Target database nerd Workshop keyspace live coding okay and finish okay um so this is actually kicked off an import job so um you know we'll get in we'll get an email when that completes while we're waiting on that let's jump back over to um get pod and in gitpod you can see that my environment has indeed built up so let's uh maybe increase the font here a little bit just to make it easier for all of you at home to uh see what's going on um the first thing I'm going to do here well let's see instead of assuming why don't I go back and uh and look at the instructions here all right ah yes so what we're going to do is there's this EnV sample file um and we're going to move it we're just basically going to rename it dot EnV that is going to be um yeah and then we can build up our environment file which um you know the react.js code will read out of so let's do that and if I paste here I should get a pop-up asking if I want to allow that um just a little safety precaution you can you know go ahead and say yes please allow that um and then I should be able to click on dot EnV y there we are okay so I need my dbid which is right here and it has a little handy little copy thing that you can you can click on let's paste that in Oh and it also brought along the dash one we don't want that okay next let's look for my region which is Us East one I'm also going to copy that there and uh you don't need to worry about saving and gitpod it uh it saves implicitly so no worries on that and then I'm going to add my token right here as well um quick mental note but um when you're when you're working with um environment variables and in react um with the uh with the way that I've done it here to pull it in from the using the process Library I think is what it is um the applications need to start with um uh react underscore app on underscore before you uh before you get to anything else um okay so now that we have that um oh you know what I don't think we need to do the dependency install if I remember right I built that into gitpod so we should all be okay here um but before we go ahead and uh and try start let's um let's take a look at the source so the oh sorry the app JS is what we want here and this is a simple uh Javascript file there's uh there's not much to it let me bring up the font a little bit more here oh and that just makes my uh my window's smaller well okay this should this should be all right maybe I'll resize this back over here um okay but simply put um I created this um if you if you look in the readme it was created using um uh I'm trying to remember how this all works now but it's like create it's like NP is it npx create um I forget maybe someone who's done a lot of um ah with create react app yep there it is there it is so uh that's that's how we get like a lot of this boilerplate of uh you know the app.js with app.css we're going to build it using a component um and I've created a form component I've imported that in um and I have a have a uh form tag here to actually pull that all in um and of course then we're doing an export uh default for app on the uh on the bottom here as well all right so really the only other thing we need to look at is this form Js um this is really where a lot of this happens um so you can see that we're importing from react you know we want we want States um you know I've been asked why why I've done this as a component with a component and the idea is that with a component in react it's it's a lot easier to manage and work with State when you need to um in this we actually are passing State around a little bit in terms of um you know what we enter in our UI to what gets sent into the rest call to displaying what hap what comes back from the uh from the response so just made it easier to work with all of that um here's what here are dependencies for um you know the uh material UI grid and as well as axios you know we have a simple Constructor here where we we set up um you know a year because that's going to be our input we're going to say that we want um nerd holidays for 2023. uh the event data is what's going to come back from the response um and then since our our form is going to have you know like a year input and a submit you know we want to have we want to be able to handle that submit um and when it does you know here's where we build up our um our header for our call uh this is where we're pulling in the token you know from the environment from that dot EnV file um this axios get right here is where we have the database ID and the database region and then we build our URL and our call for this um live underscore coding there's our key space nerd underscore holidays there's our table um and then we're adding year as a parameter in the URL as well as passing our header so that's something we uh something we want to do as well all right um let's see oh yeah and here's where we you know render render the grid itself Define its columns um our return is where we actually build our form so we have this on submit here's our our submit Handler there's also a year change Handler um and that's that's really about it um okay so Let's uh let's let's check something out here let's let's make sure that we have we have data in this table so I'm going to go back to uh cql shell quick oh hey and I see someone in the chat asking link to data Stacks I assume that's Astra so if I say bang Astra hopefully that does a yeah a nightbot uh link for uh for Astra there we go okay so let me do use live coding I'm going to say desk tables and let's just do a select star from nerd holidays oh and there's nothing in there well that's unfortunate yeah I suppose that's the problem with um yeah with uh using the uh the load data as it kind of happens um on its own in its own time so you know what let's pull in a uh subset of nerd holidays maybe maybe starting with the ones that haven't happened yet so maybe I'll just try that and we'll paste that in here and just see how far we get oh did I not really copy that hey okay let's try this again there we go now let's try that hey there we go a bunch of inserts all right so now I can do a select star from um nerd holidays there we go you know I have some nerd holidays out there um so now let's work our way back over to here and I believe we just need to do a npm start and with any luck if we um put in our token and everything correctly um this should work all right so if I go up here and say 20 23 and then query oh look at that we have we have nerd holidays coming back starting with International Beer day on August 4th you know I'm pretty excited about that one um IBM PC day on the 12th and our Talk Like a Pirate Day on September 19th um funny story about Talk Like a Pirate Day but um I I once had a manager uh when I was at Granger who um after we really took Talk Like a Pirate Day over the edge one year he um took a vacation day on Talk Like a Pirate Day for like the next four years so that was really uh really a win on our part all right so I see some folks having having issues with um use live coding oh yeah yeah live Dash coding isn't the key space name it's live underscore coding oh and that link to Astra didn't work really hmm that's that's a little strange all right let me try let me see if I can if I can jump in the chat here and maybe say https Astra Dot datastacks.com oh and yours works perfect well that's that's good at least it's working for somebody let me just make sure this works yes it does okay and let me hit enter with that um for those of you who uh who might be having having issues um you know stepping through this um don't worry this is um this is this recording will actually be out there so you'll be able to um you'll be able to come back um Japanese you have a question about did we manually enter the data um I did actually yes oh that was how I kind of got around to having to wait for the data load um aqif is asking what's the value of your astrodb region in the dot EnV file um my region is actually U.S well let's let's see here because I I copied it right from my um my database list oh yeah if I go to nerd Workshop yeah us-east1 so that might be different for you if you chose like a different um you know um Yeah Yeah a different uh region to work with um anyway let's um let's go back to the presentation here I'm only 10 minutes over so that's that's not terrible when we're trying a new format right and um let's go ahead and uh just just kind of finish out the slides there there really isn't a um isn't a whole lot left oh yeah Sammy you know you were um you mentioned exactly what some people have asked me about um using a functional component instead of a class component um and you're right that is that is something that um you know I'm thinking about making an update to this and doing it that way um but again you know like like I said using the class component I felt made it easier to work with work with State and pass things around um on the other hand you know re react is uh not my forte I actually kind of learned it to uh to to build this app so um so yeah that's it's definitely something you know I'm not the final Authority on it that is that is for sure if you can find a better way to do it rock on all right so let's uh jump to the next slide here um So eventually this this comes back to um to what we're trying to do at data sex the questions we're asking about how do we make the developer experience easier and the thing is is that you know developers just don't want to have to learn a new query language every time they work with a database they don't want to have to grab a new driver every time they want to work with a different database you know what they want are feature-rich databases to so that they can write simple code and then that makes happy developers and happy developers are really all we want I mean because that's a good thing right yeah you know some somebody else the other day on Twitter they're like you know what's the most uh what's the most common language used in programming and I answered uh profanity and that's usually because you know as as devs there's a there's a fair amount of of consternation that uh that comes with our comes with our profession all right hey here's some additional info and like I said this will all be available in the uh their recording that'll be that'll be out there in just a little bit um if you if uh you're on this channel of course hey great data Stacks developers data Stacks devs um please uh click that uh subscribe link um and that way you can be a part of our community get notices when we put new videos up and actually you know you can look through uh the history of videos we've done there's lots of cool stuff out there um helping you solve a wide variety of problems we have some great use cases out there as well um just yeah just take a look um for those of you interested in um open source Stargate um it is out there actually in the uh in GitHub um in the Stargate org just slash Stargate it's uh super easy to find if you want to check out that um astra.datastacks.com most of you are able to find your way out to Astra um and then hey like I said I I learned uh react just to be able to kind of build this sample application um for those of you who have found a vishwas on code volusion he has a great playlist um for just beginner tutorials on react.js um like I said that that's what I used and I was able to to build this after watching about 16 videos but you know nonetheless I I got there and um you know this is the uh this is the finished product so you know
