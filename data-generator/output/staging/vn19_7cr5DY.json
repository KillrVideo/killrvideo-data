    "text": "hi and thanks for joining us still today I wanted to talk to you about some of the new developer features that are coming in Cassandra 5 and some they're coming a little bit after five Lanes we want to talk about four areas today now you're going to hear a lot all day about these new industry-leading transaction supports fire Accord we want to also talk about new reliable schema modifications via a feature called transactional metadata which is very closely related to transactions then finally some great new secondary index support in Cassandra via storage attach indexes and lastly a very new in progress compelling Json data API delivered via the Stargate open source project so let's start with transactions this is listed on the Cassandra of Wiki site as cep it's Andrew enhancement proposal 15. now I've been told there's someone else called Aaron Aaron Platz and he today is also going to talk about transactions make sure you watch that for all of the details we'll just touch on three small areas now firstly a chord is going to give us faster lightweight transactions in cql this is a plugable configuration change lightweight transactions are when you do insert if not exists or update with an if condition and currently they use a paxos algorithm they can be changed to use Accord brings a new capability as well multi-partition transactions so this is going across multiple partitions in one table or even across multiple tables and with that it allows for conditional updates and rollback something we've never had before next and as I said related to the work for Accord is transactional metadata there's cep 21 now there's a lot in this that is around operations improved node membership and token management but also it dramatically improves the reliability of schema changes you may not be aware but it's possible to have race conditions in schema modifications where say for example a user-defined data type is being dropped at the same time a table has been created that relies on it that can result in your cluster not be able to restart so we replace that get rid of that problem by using a new linear linearizable process to manage schema propagation rather than the gossip system which we use inside Cassandra to propagate the information such as node availability its load and the ports that it can be reached on now what this means for the developer is that your create table statements are now reliable create table and any other type of schema modification they're reliable you don't have to worry about them running concurrently so if you've got an application that wants to start up and create some schemas of tables or use defined types you can do that perhaps concurrently with different areas of your application creating those schema objects and not have to worry about it actually working it will work next we have storage detached indexes Sai so this is Cassandra enhancement proposal seven and as you can see that's a very low number we've been really wanting to get this in for quite a while what this brings is very efficient both in performance and storage secondary indexes and some new Advanced querying techniques and these indexes are very efficient at having multiple columns indexed in the same table and to do that the indexes share information so if I index column A and column B there's some commonality there that we share and if you look on the Cassandra Wiki at cep7 you'll see some great charts that explain how adding extra indexes does not linearly add more data that we have to store on disk has very fast performance there's constant Time Performance for matches on numeric data and it has very fast text query performance as it uses a try data structure now for developers what this means now is you can construct where clauses that are using Expressions on columns that are not part of your primary key you can join those expressions together with and and Sai will use multiple indexes and then intersect the results to give incredible performance let's look at some examples on the left here we've got a pretty basic table it just has an integer as the primary key and then some information about cyclists and on the right here we're creating various indexes on it using Sai we're creating index on last name and Country which are strings on age which is a number and on date and with Sai we can now run efficient queries that look like this we can query by the last name or by the age is less than 23 we can join those together as I said so that we get multiple indexes used in the query execution so age is less than 23 and country is Great Britain and we can do date range queries for when they signed up and registered now all of this without having to worry about lacking that information into your primary key or storing multiple tables so that you can read it back in the way that you want to this is a game changer for how you do data modeling in Cassandra lastly these the Json API that's delivered via the Stargate open source project so for this project we looked at the Mongoose JavaScript library which is an object document model and we use this as a great example of the requirements that JavaScript developers and really any developer in any language needs as to what people want a document API to do so we built an API that provides that functionality initially from Mongoose but it's an API so we can add more libraries more languages more Frameworks as we go it provides schema free storage of Json data with filtering and Tran and queries that we'll look at in just a minute and server-side modifications which is one of the expectations that Mongoose and other document libraries have in common and together this Rich set of functionality supports most or or almost all of the Mongoose use cases out there allowing developers to switch their Mongoose JavaScript based applications with just a configuration change now there's a talk today with Valeria as he goes through that process and explains more about mongoose but this is a Cassandra talk this part so let's look at how we do this in Cassandra we're pushing some data modeling as we see in a few slides we've found some things that we think will also enhance the Cassandra experience for you so on the left here we have a table we call this process super trading so we are taking your document shredding and storing it in different collections based on the query techniques that we know we need to support then leveraging those Sai indexes on the collection types so that we can look them up later on so if you look at exist keys that is a set of all of the Json powers that you can look up in your document and we build an Sai index on that so we can look to see if things exist let's look at some examples at the top here is the command syntax that the API understands this is also the command syntax that Mongoose will create via a library called M query and it's really a command syntax that a lot of document-based libraries create this one here we want to find one record the first one by any order one document sorry A lot of the time with Cassandra so I'll say record sometimes filtering where the username is a Morton and we can see this builds a Cassandra query where we look up into the map where username equals a Morton limit one pretty simple the next type of query says find me all the documents where the human field is defined and we don't care about the value we just want to know it's defined so this is where we use this exist Keys set and leverage Sai to look up and say where human is one of the members of the exist key set the get all the cql rows from there and then we reconstruct the documents a little bit more complex here this query says find me all the documents where Fav numbers array contains both 11 and 22. and so here we're again constructing a query leveraging Sai and saying where array contains they have numbers and we just have a little encoding there as to how we say 11 and it contains 22. so let's get a lot more complex this is a query that says go and update all of the documents you can find where items is an array and it contains both information that the person bought a black BMW and they have extended warranty of five years note that these are two different data types in the array there's a Json object and the Json string now what we're telling the Json API here is when you find that add to the items array gap insurance five years as a string if it does not already exist the cql that we construct for that is a select as we saw before to pull out documents that have the property of the in the array and then once we update things we are running cql update with our old friend lightweight transactions currently powered by paxos with Cassandra 5 Lands powered by a chord to make sure that we're doing this in a strong consistent way as we've gone through this process we've built on the Sai and we've identified a couple of areas where we think it would be great to expand the functionality in Cassandra will be good for cql developers it'll be good for people who use the new Json API the first category of changes here is adding more operations to SAI against Maps so less than grade then also adding the ability to do not contains for the keys of maps and sets and adding or to the C to our where Clause so please keep an eye on the Cassandra of Wiki for the cep for that the second the more ambitious is sorting so using Sai index to provide a global sort order at query time and then being able to access that in the cql order by clause and together with that you're probably also going to want to have offset and limit so if you'd like to know more follow along with the Stargate IO project at Stargate dot AO for the latest news and get a downloadable demonstration of this new features thank you",
