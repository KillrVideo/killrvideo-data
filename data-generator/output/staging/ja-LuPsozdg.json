    "text": "hey it's Jeff carpenter I'm live here at strata wit and then vinegar ball from impetus are you guys how are you yeah good to see you with you so how's the strata going for you so far very busy I mean we're all know obviously overwhelmed with how all the space is grown yeah tremendous interest from the enterprise ecosystem there's a lot of real customers a lot of senior executives here and particularly for me I think the whole appeal of spar as a general purpose data processing platform is really validated in just processing machine learning ETL all of it okay got it okay so your with embedded technologies and you have a product so that you're dealing with here stream analytics yeah right so tell me a little bit about it yeah so I'm within Finnish technologies and we've been a big data a size and it's 10 plus years now ok and my product stream analytics is one of our first transitions from being a pure services company to a product and services company nice ok there's a lot of conversations most of all conversations are that they are led by our product now ok and stream analytics particularly has a great synergy with data stacks because it works directly on DSes bar so stream analytics is integrated with DSS bar okay so all data stacks customers can now use screen analytics as an interface for building out spark applications both batch and three names on the DSC platform okay you tell me a little bit about what the product looks like it's very I think it's very very cool because you're basically trying to eliminate some of that coding effort that integration that you would have to do yourself right yeah exactly so when people have to build out spark Johnny the Java or Scala code on Spa it's it's still tedious there are few people who can do that well but the majority of the market can't do that paragraph so in our on our platform you get into a nice visual tool where all of the connectors the processors the analytics modules all our widgets that you can this dragon drop dragon and rock configure Kevin minutes you can actually have a fully functional spark application you can even test it on the same platform before you deploy and then you deploy and then there's monitoring and DevOps to do with that also we do whatever okay so you know further than on top of an open-source spark cluster or a DAC cluster or case in the in the case of beta stacks it will be on a dlc spark on PLC platform okay although stream analytics overall is compatible with any flavor of spark okay okay so who's the competition for this is it are we talking about the streaming technologies are you going against ETL vendors like yeah we would overlap worked with people who are doing modern ETL layer integration as well as analytics and machine level okay our Knox part and that's two different markets and two different spaces so we do if we do overlap with all the vendors that would do that yeah and you chose spark as the engine that you were gonna run on top of why was that choice of spark what about storm or Apache fleeing so we stream analytics actually started with storm okay as in your event stream processing engine we then added spark streaming and the market really pulled for spark batch processing as well so we're now storm and spark and we're still waiting for the market to catch in catch up with blink I think it is beginning we're seeing potential absolutely yeah and the beauty of our platform is is a multi engine platform we're not stuck with one technology will quite help enterprises to be agnostic of the individual right and that is one of the themes that has been emerging here is that idea of we use a bunch of different technologies we want them to interplay well together we don't want to lock into any one particular thing so we're gonna have a suite of things that we integrate together so this is another component of future-proof easy to use platform to get use cases develop deployed fast right so you're kind of speaking of this evolving landscape how do you keep up with all this technology that's evolving similarly we keep a close track with our partnerships with depended all the distribution vendors right so we keep a watch on the Apache a space itself and where the distribution when there's all the you know in data stacks can order a hot box map or all of all of these major vendors what does their roadmap Exeter's and we would be closely aligned with that because the market is aligned with the major distributions including data size right it's a great relationship with between data stacks and particularly the stream analytics platform as impetus we've been implementing Cassandra as a solution company since since before even data stacks existed oh that's right yeah you free cheat the rip tonneau era exactly right so we've been Cassandra implementer Cassandra expert we've written books on Cassandra as well so we love the technology and now that it's enterprise-grade with PSC we'll which spark and solar and all that built in it's even better so there are a lot of real customers of ours who are common DC and similar digs customers right okay I do have one more techie question for you so what are the most popular data transformations that you see your customers needing and doing so in in our platform we got essentially time window based processing time window based processing unique count joins number of we use and we've also abstracted the spark individual spark api's into higher level functions like filter or enrichment and do alerting okay so pretty much all of the major spark api as we do bring up the other UI possible okay well it's been such a great pleasure to talk to you this afternoon is out here generate show great week look forward to doing a lot of business together and nothing goes enterprise customers",
