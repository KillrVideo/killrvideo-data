    "text": "[Music] today i'm going to introduce you to this ecommerce application and show you how it uses the blockchain and astra db by the end of this video you will be able to run a simple e-commerce app based on next js that leverages astrodb for storing product information and click stream data and metamask to execute smart contracts deployed on a rink b blockchain in this diagram you can see how a blockchain application would function with or without astra we will use the blockchain because it's going to serve as an immutable store for our transaction data for asterdb we'll leverage speed availability and scaling for our product and click stream data so now let's get our app up and running we'll head over to our terminal we'll say yarn dev and this will get our application running on localhost 3000 and as you can see in this application we have a metamask wallet connected we're displaying a variety of different products and they have different statuses and we have the ability to create a product before we get started we're going to have to take care of a few setup tasks we are going to download and install the metamask wallet browser extension in the wallet we're going to set up the rink b test net we're going to create two different accounts in metamask a buyer account and seller account we'll fund the metamask wallet by using the rink b faucet and finally we'll set up astradb we'll create a database add some tables and populate the tables with data if you don't already have a wallet go ahead and create one now at metamask.io in order to do that we're going to click on download we have a chrome browser so we're going to click on install meta mask for chrome and add the extension once the extension is added a page from metamask will pop up and now you can click on get started if you already have a wallet you can use your secret recovery phrase here to import that wallet into metamask otherwise we're going to create a wallet and then click on i agree we are going to create a password if you haven't used a cryptocurrency wallet before i highly suggest watching this video on how to set up your recovery phrase and here's the last step with your secret recovery phrase and we'll click next next we're going to have to connect to our test networks it's a pretty simple process you're going to get started by clicking the drop down under ethereum mainnet and click on show hide test networks from there we're going to click show test networks to on we'll navigate back to our wallet click the drop down once again and click on rink b test network next up we'll create our buyer and our seller account it's fairly straightforward click the drop down click on create account we'll type in buyer and then click create and now we'll do the same process for seller one more time and then click on create account as you can see these wallets are already funded with test tokens your wallet will be empty so you're going to have to go over to the rink b faucet in order to fund the accounts and now here we are at the faucet we will be able to get 0.5 test ethereum into our account if we log in to this application and then we'll just have to click the drop down copy our seller address and then we'll enter in that wallet address and click on send me eth it will take just a few minutes for the transaction to confirm on the blockchain and then you'll see the test eth in your wallet once you have the funds in your wallet you're going to want to split them between your accounts to run the application so we're going to copy our buyer address go over to the seller address click on send we'll paste that address and we'll send half of the funds to the buyer address and once again we'll just have to wait for that to confirm and then we can get started with our demo now that the transaction is confirmed you can see that the buyer wallet has 0.25 more eth at this stage each of your wallets should have roughly 0.258 and then you're ready to get started with astra now we can get started by creating a database we're going to use astra in order to store product information and our click stream data so let's get started by clicking create database from there we'll enter our database name called crypto and then our key space name ecommerce we're going to select a region so we'll head over to google cloud click on north america and select the available free region and then we'll click on create database and from there we'll just have to wait for a few minutes for it to be provisioned now our database is active you can see we have a variety of information here such as read request write request storage consumed and data transfer it also includes your region information your data center id and your key spaces and now in the cql console we're going to be adding some tables and inserting our data first we'll navigate to our key space named e-commerce and then we'll be copying and pasting some create table statements from our readme file here is our first table catalog this will be storing our product information and then we have our second table activity stream this will store user clicks in our application now we just want to confirm that the tables were created correctly we'll say describe tables and you can see the name of both of our tables here and now we'll populate our tables with some data we'll copy over some insert statements from the readme and we'll paste them here these statements will add our product information to our product table in order to view that in the counsel we'll use a select statement we'll select all from our catalog table and you can see all that product information has been inserted into our table and now let's check out our activity stream table by using another select statement select all from activity stream here you can see it's empty but we'll be inserting the wallet address timestamp action and product id we'll be using post requests in order to add this data as the user walks through the buying and selling process so the next step will be connecting our application to our astra db in order to do that we're going to have to create an application token we're going to click on the drop down organization settings token management and here we can create our token we're going to click the drop down on select role choose admin user and then generate token now you can see your token details your client id client secret and token you can download those token details to save them for later but for our purposes we're just going to need that token value so we'll copy it here and put it in our env file to get started we're going to click on the connect meta mask button in the top right this will pull up our metamask wallet here we can select our buyer and seller account click on next connect and it will pull up our store in metamask you're going to want to make sure that you're in the seller wallet so let's navigate to that and now you're ready to go with creating a product so in this application we're going to use api calls to interact with astra you can see all our products here which we get from our catalog table so let's get started with creating a product we're going to click on the create product button and then we're going to add our title price description and an image and then click on add to draft you can find all this product information in the readme but feel free to choose any product that you would like so we're adding the title price description and now we're going to add an image click on next and then click on add to draft and now you can see all that product information is stored on this product page within the card and we will copy down our product id we'll be using that in our select statement here in just a second and now let's head over to the cql console to view that product information we are going to navigate to that key space by running use ecommerce once within that key space we'll run a select statement where the product id is equal to that product id that we just copied and once we run that select statement we'll be able to view the product information here and that confirms that our new product was added to our catalog table now let's head back over to our application we'll click on ds commerce to go to our main page and you can see that our scenery painting is now available with all the rest of the products we interact with our database and are able to display all this information and add new products because we're making api calls directly to astra i'm going to highlight one of those in this next step here and here you can see our add product to draft function inside this function we're going to be making a post request to the route api products product draft and we're passing that product information that we filled out in the previous form and here you can see the route that we configured for the api call if the request method is equal to post we will call our add draft function which will take in a name description price uid and account and now let's take a look at how this function actually works in this function we'll be using the node.js client we'll be using that client to make a post request the url that we'll make a request to will end in our key space name and our table name and we'll be passing that product information to the catalog table and just a reminder this is where we saw that product information in that table in our process nft function we're going to use a post request to track our user clicks in the buying process here you can see if the operation is equal to list nft then we'll be making a post request and in that request we'll be passing a timestamp wallet address product id and action message and then at the end of this demo we'll be able to head back over to the cql console to view our clicks in the activity stream table before we start the demo i want to give you a high level overview of what's happening with the smart contract we have two accounts a buyer account and a seller account between those accounts will live a third party escrow account that will collect fees it's going to start off with the seller listing the product when the seller lists the product for sale they're also going to have to include an escrow fee this escrow fee is 25 the price of the product the buyer will now bid on the product in order to do that they'll be sending the price of the product and an escrow fee to the escrow account next the seller will ship the product once the seller ships the product to the buyer the escrow account will release the fee back to the seller the last step will include the buyer confirming receipt of the product upon that confirmation the escrow account will release the remaining funds it will send back the escrow fee to the buyer and to the seller it will send back the price of the product now let's check out how this looks in code head over to our nft solidity file and then we'll take a look at a few of these functions you can see we have a seller listing at nft the buyer placing a bid on the nft the seller shipping in nft and finally the buyer receiving nfd spend some time looking at this file to get a better understanding of how the smart contract actually works all right we're going to get started by listing our nft from our seller account as you can see now we have our seller just in our wallet and that's what we're currently connected as in the store so you can see this product will be sold by our seller account and next we're going to click on list as nft this will bring up our metamask contract as i discussed previously you can see here we have our escrow fee of .0025 ethereum now we'll click on confirm and now we'll have to wait roughly a minute for the transaction to get confirmed on the blockchain and now that it's confirmed let's take a look at a few of the details we are sending .0025 eth from our seller address to the escrow account we can also view the details of the transaction on the block explorer and here's a more detailed breakdown you can see our seller account transacted with our escrow account 4.0025 eth and that we've listed our token here now we'll head back to our product page after refreshing the page we can see the status is now updated to listed now the bid on nft button is available we'll head back over to our wallet and we'll change to our buyer account because the buyer is going to be placing a bid and then we'll go ahead and click on bid on nfd and now we can see in this contract it is 4.0125 each 0.01 is the price of the product and .0025 is the escrow fee and we can go ahead and click on confirm and this will bring us back to our application and once again we're just going to have to wait for the contract to get executed on the blockchain now let's click on the contract and we'll check out the details the buyer account will be sending to the escrow account for a value of 0.0125 each now back on our product page we can see that the status is updated to bot the option to ship the nft is now available once again we're going to change over to our seller account we'll do that in metamask here and we'll click on ship nft and then we will confirm the transaction the only price that you'll pay is the gas fee and we'll just have to wait for that confirmation on the transaction once again now that that's successful let's check out the contract we can see that the seller is initiating the contract with escrow account and once again let's head over to the block explorer to check out some more details and as you can see in the contract the seller is transferring the token to the buyer additionally the escrow account will release the escrow fee back to the seller just remember that's defined in our smart contract that we took a look at earlier and finally we can see that the status is updated to ship and we have the option to receive the nft once again we're going to head over to metamask and change over to our buyer wallet once we're in our buyer wallet we can go ahead and click on receive nft i'll bring up the contract once again all we have to pay is the gas fee and click on confirm and then we play the waiting game one last time and here you can see the very last step of the contract the escrow account is releasing the .01 eth to the seller which is the price of the product also sending back the .0025 eth or the escrow fee back to the buyer and that concludes the transaction like i mentioned earlier we're going to collect click stream data every time a user had to click a button during the buying process we made an api post request to the activity stream table and we can take a look at that by running a simple select statement in our cql console this will give us our activity stream data and here you can see it we have our wallet address timestamp action and product id by collecting this data it will help you make business decisions with your applications as your app gets successful and your users grow you are going to need a database that can scale with you that's where astra is needed it will be able to scale up to a very large amount of requests all while maintaining very low latencies and that wraps up the demo for today thanks for joining us",
