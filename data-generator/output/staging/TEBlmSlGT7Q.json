    "text": "thank you [Music] hello everyone and welcome to this short video on optimizing Trucking routes with Vector search and Apache Cassandra so the problem that we have is the typical traveling salesman problem where we have several cities that we need to visit and we need to find the most efficient order to do that in of course to add to our problems we're driving a 30 ton semi truck which means that you know our turns are kind of limited we can't do u-turns we really kind of have to think and plan about how to make the most fuel efficient path from City to City to add to this problem the highway systems surrounding most major metropolitan areas are just a Labyrinth of Pathways and sometimes finding the most efficient route can be tricky enter Vector search a new feature in Apache Cassandra and datastax asterdb with Vector search we can work with our data represented in a multi-dimensional space which will make the distances between our data points more apparent and easier to see let's take a look at a potential data model so we have a table called location vectors and essentially that table consists of a location ID as its loan primary key there's a location name which is a text value and then of course we have a location Vector which is a two-dimensional float the idea here is that we can use a vector search query to go ahead and pull back data based on that vector now to make this happen we're also going to have to use a custom secondary index in this case it's the new storage attached index now when we run that query we'll do a select and from but we won't do a where instead we'll have an order by and we'll use the new Ann of clause and then provide a vector with a limit to go ahead and pull our data back and as you can see this actually brings back our data sorted with how close they are to each of our city vectors in this way we can quickly have a look at our data and come up with cities that we know are closest to the cities that we're starting with this might do a good job of giving us a start on which cities maybe we should visit first however this is all kind of predicated on the fact that we can get to our cities as the crow flies well we all know that's not entirely true so why don't we plot out our cities on a graph then let's look at the highways that connect each of the Cities if we take the end points of each of those Highway segments we should be able to run a similar a n cosine based query to let us know which segments of Highway connect each City so in this case we'd create a new table called Highway vectors with a highway name as a text field and then we'd have a four-dimensional float which would be our Highway vector and of course we would also create our storage attach index on it as well now if we run our a n query from a starting City to an ending City you can see that we actually get Highway segments back in that result set and they're actually ordered in you know how close they are to each of the Cities and this is just one way that you could apply Vector search to an actual use case like efficiently planning the routes of your trucks to your stores to get them their products don't forget check out this and other great videos on our data Stacks Developers YouTube channel and remember at data Stacks developers we want you to be successful and we're here to help you get there [Music]",
