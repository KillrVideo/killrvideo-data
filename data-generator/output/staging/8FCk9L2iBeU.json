it's over hello everyone and welcome welcome to datastax monday learning we are happy to see you joining us and we start in one minute [Music] [Music] it index hello everyone hello and welcome to data stocks monday learning it's been a while since the last run and be happy to be back online that's alex wolshnev developer advocate lead at datastax developer relations team and today with me our special guests and one of the best expert in the streaming platform and messaging systems zac dean hello zig hi everybody how you doing today yeah it's amazing day and and well you know maybe at my place weather is not so amazing i hope you are more lucky but we have attendees from all over the world so i bet we can have people with the great weather not so great weather bad weather as mine and maybe even worse but that doesn't matter what really matter it's monday and it's a data stocks learning time and we are going to talk about incredible things today so zeke what's the main topic for us today today we're going to cover uh the history of streaming enterprise messaging design patterns and then we'll jump straight into apache pulsar the newest latest and greatest technology yep definitely and if you never have been at one of our streams before i have to say what that's data stocks monday learning the channel and the program we cover most important technologies which ever developers has to be familiar with at least a little bit or better become a professional our last big series was docker learning path out of five episodes and now this is the event streaming series of free episodes and we are happy to greet you again if you have been there already you know who we are and if you haven't just a few things you need to know that's only from engineers to engineers open source only technologies hands-on experience live communication with the experts well maybe you watch the recording right now but at the moment we are filming it it's the 7th of june it's a live episode with a live questions and very for life answers so as said that's evan streaming series led by zeke and alex and it's episode 1 introduction to evan streaming what is it how it happened to be why it happened to be and especially why you should care of it and why you should know how to use that and before we start i have to ask a couple of questions to you so we will understand you better so just a little bit of questions to you uh and we go live first one please go to menti.com and use the code two 655328 three four you can scan the qr code next to zig or you can enter the code close to meme oh i'm hiding the code so let me hide for a second that's better and your qr code is fine so scan the qr code or go to menu.com and enter the code 65532834 and jump in for questions questions a very important part but it's also a setup because in the end of this workshop we will run a quiz and if you attend this quiz if you give the right answers if you are fast enough you have a chance to earn the prizes from data stacks so jump in for mentee and don't close this step be ready for the quiz in the end easiest way to go for mentee is just open it on your mobile phone and keep it open till the end when we will have a game different prices so take a look looks like python took the first place well quite expected and then the second place there is a collision between java with 29 places and javascript with 28 voices which is nice but python still holds the first place next one is taken by c so quite surprisingly and c sharp and all the others are taking smaller part so biggest part of our attendees today have python java javascript or c background and that's quite interesting and that's quite interesting also but there are some people with no programming language experience experience well ladies and gentlemen with no prior programming experience this one may be a little bit rough right but you will make it we are here to answer your questions not just we by the way but also there are multiple people in the youtube chat and discord chat answering your questions so which queuing and messaging technologies are you familiar with you can pick multiple options okay kafka well quite expected zero mq i am qpm mqtt well well well well well so kafka is a pure leader pulsar oh we have some people who pulls our experience already that's great it's very good yeah but in general that's quite expected kafka known uh rabbit mq or active mq pulsar a little bit of zero mq and well gms is also has some presence okay good good good good good okay if you have no prior experience with queueing or messaging you have nothing to worry about because that's exactly the workshop for you to get your first step into this world and if you have some experience with the systems like kafka or rabbitmq or others that definitely makes your make it easier for you to get the content but we still have something incredible for you because you see game has changed a little bit with apache pulsar we will discuss in the second part of the workshop cool so tell me another thing how much experience do you have if apache pulsar i've seen that there are some answers but i bet yeah most of you never heard about that so know the concepts that's good you use it at once or two okay okay okay that's quite expected but we don't have experts in the stream which definitely makes sense good so have you been to any of our workshops before i've noticed some familiar names in the chat and hello everyone i see sm i see some people here ivan garcia thiago candelas anil kumar vijay prakash yeah that's great to have some familiar names oh saverio guzzo that's great to see you again cool so once or twice i'm your fan you are the best thank you and some of you never have been here before don't worry that's not a problem but you need to know what we run work a lot of workshops a lot of great workshops moreover so mostly probably you need to push the subscribe button next to zeek because we have some more upcoming great workshops even this week i will talk about that in the end of the workshop and thank you we are done and that means we can go to a presentation don't close mention you will need it for the game and we can start oh vladimir hello hi vladimir yes that's we have an incredible team of attendees here today so what are we going to talk about today fundamentals of modern messaging platforms those are great tools but that's interesting to take a look how it was before and why we should care about that and how it's developed over time when we will work a bit with apache pulsar and finally we will hands-on pushing the buttons and running pulsar and sending messages using modern messaging platforms you will do it i will only show you how to start and you will do it on your own and finally if you will have a quiz we need to include the fourth the point number four in this lease so and then fundamentals of messaging how it started before originally we have had a huge monoliths huge huge huge platforms answering some queries answering some questions and all communication from client to the monolith and maybe from monitor to another service to fetch some data was done usually via things like remote procedure calls or whatever was it it was mostly probably a normal http okay it doesn't matter call which was a great thing i mean definitely better than nothing you are able to communicate with the remote system but it also had some problems this approach is great as long as it fits your use case so i'm not going to tell you what things like rpc are gone forever no there's still plenty of space for every approach but it has some troubles and over time with the development of the systems those troubles started to trouble to many people so how it normally works if your application needs to retrieve some data from an external service or if your client wants to retrieve some data from you doesn't matter it's still going to be a request from some application i or client a to service b or server b and then after some time servers b responds hopefully response because it's a network and network is a fragile story and what's the problem of this approach it is not exactly slow because asynchronous call will work with exactly the same will be executed within the same time under the same conditions of course but as long as service b is not answered service a waits for the answer doing what doing nothing and it has huge risk with networking so your service must be available your services needs to have or service discovery or manual configuration how service a will access service b they need to know it in advance it's a point to point communication and that's important to understand at the moment i make a phone call i am the one who sends that i have only one sender and i have only one receiver so far it looks good but we can have it better and it's well maybe not exactly slow but it's definitely blocking as you wait for server to respond and if a receiver is not available process is failed even though the processing by itself could have been delayed that's important to understand if receiver is not available processes failed even if there were no urgency in process increased query and a set already one and only one receiver blocking um not maybe so stable maybe not so efficient let's take a look what change and what changed and what other approaches were suggested and there is a question from avinash is this an alternate to rest apis for communication between servers basically it doesn't matter if it's a rest api or remote procedure call they utilize the same blocking synchronous approach so in this example you can just take remote procedure call and replace it replace it with rest api and nothing will change literally nothing um am i missing anything zeke i believe that's they are completely interchangeable yeah they're pretty interchangeable i mean remote procedure call it was basically a way that you would code like on um xml rpc so you'd have a java client talking to a java server you'd make a request to the server and the reserver would respond so it's kind of like http but it's even more like lower level it's designed for like application messaging but yes it's over something like http yes so you see does it work it works um is it enough well maybe we may need something better for some different use cases and then message systems came to f offer something different what was the principle idea what's the general idea you need to remember it was quite surprisingly to decouple to the couple senders from receivers that's the primary point you need to understand so now we have a mediator or messaging service there are multiple options how you can call it but idea is always the same for them it's to decouple message senders from receivers by using a messaging service something what handles your messages in a special way treats them especially now application a communicates not directly with a service b but it communicates with a messaging service and messaging service dispatch this request to a service beam and service b gives the answer an answer maybe receive it in by application a if it is interested in the answer because there are some cases you may just want to give an order to process some data but you don't expect the result it also happens so it's a persistent buffer to handle requests and payload but that's what's important it's asynchronous so uh no need to wait as soon as your message is received by a messaging service it's considered done an application a can start to process next request or do some external work so this time in between from our original request to getting the reaction application a can be busy processing other requests or doing some useful work that's very important to understand so now in our point the message systems one message can have multiple receivers and that's very important from the ability to extend your system with the monolith system we use it to add some code when we just uh make some processings you need to extend it you need to add some things you need to add some additional operations on i don't know maybe if user ordering something in your internet store you now need to add some additional processing to it you go and change some code directly in your monolith at some point it's great it's easy but at some point it's getting too big it's getting unmaintainable and you want to solve it that's why we started to spread applications into a distributed system often decentralized system uh systems like microservices for example and at this point a very often idea to add a simple new processor to extend the behavior of your system was just to make a new micro service receiving the same message now not only service b will receive this message but also service c and the question is should you change anything in application a no not necessarily now it will be processed by your messaging service and everyone who is interested in this notification in this event we can say we'll get the update and can do something can react something so it's about the decaling and decoupling and loosely coupled architectures then i already told that it's a perfect fit for distributed systems and microservices and one more benefit which sometimes very important message will be consumed by the next available service instance let's imagine what we need to process a message sent by application a it goes to messaging service and there is no running instance of a service beam the moment what would happen in the old school approach as said we wait wait wait till time to leave is done and when we get an exception and everything is broken for some of the use cases yes that's a valid situation for some of the use cases you need to know immediately if this um request cannot be processed right now but it's not always like that sometimes you are completely fine to get the response hours later for example making um domain name management system very many years ago we had to wait for the propagation of the newly registered domain name over the planet and in some cases it took well it was quite some time ago it took up to 12 hours up to 20 hours in this case i don't need the confirmation right now it makes no sense to put my http call or rpc call if any api call to wait for 12 to 20 hours it makes no sense to make it in a blocking way no i want it to be asynchronous and then it's completely fine to me if service b just the next available instance of a service b will get back in few seconds and then we will process my message and dispatch the results of this processing um to the messaging service again that what makes sense and it works in a very reliable way so for many of the use cases this approach fits much better not for all but for many of them and um before i proceed to next question and to next slide i want to say where do we get a copy of a presentation use it here we have that's a materials link attached to the video and hi i ion very glad to see you so we have a lot of friends here today good so [Music] then how that works there are two main ideas notifications and cues but they work in more or less the same way so before we proceed to the type of those um messaging systems and approaches within those different um systems we have to cover on how exactly they are working and there is an incredible question from deepak i want to answer answer right now before proceeding what happens if a receiver is unable to process the incoming flow of events we will cover it a couple of slides later but one of if you ask me in person why do i like messaging systems my first answer my first idea would be they help you to build really scalable systems and if you have a flow of the messages so huge what service b cannot process them answer is we see how many messages we have here addressed to service b you have it into your monitoring and you simply spawn next instance of service b you spawn next instance of service b and in the end you spawn as much of them as you need to process all of them today with a modern upload approaches with clouds and with the ability to run an user new instance new instance of a service 15 some seconds sometimes or in the worst case scenario some minutes that's an incredible way so if service b cannot process such a flow of messages scale it out simple as that messaging system helps you to scale so we will get back to that how it works again now take a look uh we have three players in this game three instances um we have to consider we have a provider provider of a message or provider of a notification provider of a queue message and we have service consumer consumer is someone who is interested in the message we are going to dispatch in this example provider is a service a and consumer is a service beam but that's interesting way can change so usually the same service service b can be in this time both provider and consumer so first service provider or event provider registers in event manager and says hey i'm here i'm going to dispatch event a something happened user registered something order executed or whatever you want to do and that's it notice what between the registration of an event type and the real event there's a huge difference because here down on the time we see event a occurred it's not happened here it's just a registration okay i'm going to dispatch information if something happens and in the next step consumer can go to event manager essay hey there are multiple consumers and they say we are interested in event a it can be single consumer or multiple consumers doesn't matter then service provider dispatches this information okay event a accurate something happened order something else else demand registrated or whatever your system takes care of and as event manager knows whatever consumers interested in this type of event it will dispatch these event details to the service consumers so we will know okay finally it happened we have some job to do amazing so uh and that's quite cool so at the mo your consumers and this registration this subscription it's a flexible thing today consumer one is interested in this event it will go and subscribe tomorrow it's not interested anymore it will go unsubscribe and it will not get subscriptions again and of course different customers different applications can make subscriptions to different topics to different questions and to different event types so of course it's uh highly configurable and provider and consumer are detached the couplet and they don't belong to each other that's a flexible and loosely coupled system so it's all started quite a long time ago and that's basically begins with one of the first one of the most famous well-known systems first one ibm messaging mq as a serious system created like quite a long time ago and then there being being development in the end of the 20th century java messaging system was introduced this one became more popular and not because it maybe was better but from the point of view like the amount of companies amount of projects what needed messaging systems started to grow tremendously um that's important to understand what for dozens of years think what really limited to us was a bad internet connection it doesn't matter how fast your database returns data if your client has 56k modem usl robotics and going to download data within next half an hour you don't need fast database but as internet connection gets better and better people already don't want to wait people want to get answer now and systems are getting bigger and bigger and you need to be able to scale it out so messaging system starts to grow then when we have things launched for like active mq and this one already was quite well known i've seen some active mq users in our main techniques and um system i was working the most was launched at in 2007 it was rabbit mq and it's still probably quite good but the real hit was in year 2009 with kafka and i believe zeke will have a lot of things to talk about kafka today as well okay so we have a lot of things going on and the one thing we have to remember amount of customers amount of users amount of people in the internet doubles very quickly every couple of years and we have more and more lot and we have more and more data so as synchronous blocking calls of not a good fit for the a lot of use cases that's what brought messaging systems to us what are the main features for messaging systems asynchronous communication message retention acknowledgement and message consumption let's take a look at that first one we have to remember there are two main approaches in the world of the message dispatching cues and pops up with notifications i prefer to identify it as notifications and queue messages only two so it's quite easy to get if you have experience with amazon web services there is a simple notification service and simple query service sns and sqs basically that represents the idea cues or queue messages or notifications what is that and why do we need two because they feed different purposes that's why we need two let's take a look first at the queues simple idea of a queue we may have producer or two producers multiple producers publishing some messages or queue messages and we need every message to be processed once what's the story for example you upload images to cloud or your clients uploading images to your system and you want to make a thumbnail it like with old school traditional upload approach with no queues with no messaging platforms while we are uploading this image you have to on the fly grab this image generate a thumbnail and only then their blocking synchronous request will be returned like okay we got it we got it that's good but you know what that's so old school and not necessarily and there is no need to generate thumbnail right now so i want to do it later it's completely fine if it will be done not immediately but in a couple of minutes if my system under heavy pressure even in an hour there is no big difference there is no big problem no one will die if this message will be processed one hour later okay so no worries but i don't want this message i don't want this order to create a thumbnail out of a big image to be processed twice just because is a redundant consumption of resources and i want my system to stay efficient so i want it to be processed at once another example would be a buying order like i want to buy something i don't want to buy two things for double the price i want to buy exactly the thing i'm buying now one thing one unit for the price specified i want my order to be executed only once and that's the second good example so queuing that means what any producer may publish a queue message which will be probably which will be processed only once and only by one consumer then you can ask okay with multiple producers it's more or less understandable so the same information may come from different servers uh different uh data centers maybe that's clear but why do we have multiple consumers here consumer one consumer two that's important to understand those are the same service b but different instances of it and every message in this queue is something what represents my order or my image to generate thumbnail based on or something like that so every entity would have to be processed only once and that's why first and third messages first message will be processed by consumer one let's imagine it takes some time but we have more messages in a queue and then next available consumer grabs this one and start to process uh start to process it then consumer one is free again and it says okay what's the next in the queue anything yeah there is one more message so it will take the third message if q is empty those consumers will stay quiet they have nothing to do via idling but as soon as you get something in the queue consumers will pull it and produce it one message will be processed only once sweet and what's the best benefit of that first if anything bad happened on your back end if no instances of service b are available both are dead or all of them are dead no one is able to process the message no problem because messages will stay in the queue giving you time to restart consumers or maybe you are deploying a new version of service b no worries there is no downtime you just wait for a couple of seconds when you instances will get back and replay think from the backlog of messages so from the queue and process them so you are good and if you see what amount of messages in a queue are huge if you see what you have five hundred thousand messages in the queue waiting to be pretty processed what does that mean mostly probably you have to launch more consumers and as these architecture suggests you to have stateless simple stateless services they are very easy to scale and that's the second thing i really like regarding the these decal plate architecture so exactly one processing of messages that's clear only one consumer will get a queue message backlog of messages yes that's clear i will get a message when i need it as soon as i press complete the processing of the previous one then distributed processing those consumers may run on the same host on the same server but does it really make sense no i can run second consumer on the second server i may run first consumer on the third server and as a result i will have as much of them as i need maybe over multiple continents and they always running in the distributed way so even if the world data center of a consumer too is wiped out by hurricane i still will have consumer one in another data center and distributed processing is a cool thing so message fail over if consumers started to process a message but then fail it got an exception failed as soon as long as this message is not acknowledged it will get back to the queue and it will be processed by next available consumer so message failover is a very cool technology you have to be careful at this moment because you need to think then exactly you have to acknowledge message because if you didn't yet process it and acknowledge that it will not get back to the queue if something happens with consumer then it's for you to take care of a processing okay and then uh easy to scale well i say it usually this architecture suggests you to have them a distributed way and you can add them as their stateless as much as you need so so far so good then what's the publish subscribe it's exactly different thing when we speak about queues we think of the multiple amount huge amounts of consumers processing messages that works and then the question is uh what do we think about publish subscribe messaging it's not about exactly scaling like ability to handle 100 messages 1000 messages 100 000 messages beyond messages but message consumption in the pops up mechanism is about the extension of the behavior of your system for example i want to buy something in an online online shop and first thing in a very simple example behavior was for a system to process the order so grab money from my account and book some goods on them storage to send to me but when over time system develops like amazon does and now you need to do more and more and more things in exactly the same situation so publish subscribe messaging is different the few we have to be sure we use q when we need to know what one q message will be processed only once with pops up messaging it's absolutely different with pops up we want identification or event to be processed by all the consumers what are interested in it for example we are doing an order in an online shop first consumer received an event oh we have an order new order first consumer will take care of the logistics create a shipping order to the address second consumer will process um the banking process like pull money from my account and third consumer which is not present on this picture but it may exist will obviously send an email to me that's a special mail service what sends an email hey thank you so much for your order here is a special thing you may like to buy next time and then if you want to add some processing if you want to extend behavior of your system you don't have to change your producer you don't have to check to change topics or subscriptions or consumers you just add one more consumer simple as that so idea is very simple producers send notifications to topic consumers subscribe to this topic you may have multiple customers easy to extend every notification what uh has some subscriptions will be processed by all the services those subscribers for this kind of a notification so q mostly for scalability pops up mostly for extending the system behavior so that's the story message-oriented middleware started quite a long time ago basically you know what that's hard to say but it's almost 30 years ago already by the way that's interesting to notice what uh in famous aws amazon web services the first public service they published again many years ago was also belonged to his pops up and q story with sns and sqs but get back message orient middleware came from ibm websphere mq in 1993 such a while it was a breakthrough i would say but um well 1993 what would you expect it also has some disadvantages uh first one was it was a single machine design so it was a server quite powerful one but one and only one if you want to upgrade it you have to go to vertical scaling you know data stacks company behind apache cassandra we don't like vertical scaling it works till some limit and then you are into troubles and also single server introduce a single point of failure so we need to maybe have something better then it started to extend uh single host is not enough so now with the help of a network load balancer we may have multiple message queue servers one two three as much as we need working with different topics is it better well that's definitely better than single machine design it's quite easy to be better than single host design but that's not exactly solves the problem because now yes we have spreaded the workload but in which way first server is responsible for first topic or set of topics second server responsible for different set of topics and so on and so forth basically it means what if this server goes down this topic will be not available and your system is blocked do you like it i don't going on this way to develop a system we go to enterprise message bus with the message routing it's a more advanced thing uh basically it's very belongs to so-called service oriented architecture enterprise message bus is an essential part of the service oriented architecture what does that mean so it helps you to exclude these point-to-point communication from service a to service b service a just publishes message to the bus which is a quite big advance in comparison with all systems then message will be rooted by a service bus by message bus to service b and service c so those who want to receive the notifications and meanwhile data enrichment and transformations are on its way so if for example service b and service c needs the same data but form it in a little bit different way well then message bus may take care of it so that's good and that helps a lot already working with let's say heterogeneous and systems of different kind of applications so bake split into three different layers serving compute and storage enterprise message bus worked quite well to deliver some features first dynamic routing so consumers may appear and disappear using different ip addresses different data centers different networks and continents it's still possible to reach them it may do transformation for data for example some of your consumers may need xml format data while some of them may need json they can do transformation on that and every servers will receive data so it will understand message enrichment sometimes to deliver data to a consumer you need to get data from multiple sources because we have service our application a giving only the part of the data we know because of decoupling and we may need also data from application z and then we have to bring them together so we enrich data from other sources before we deliver it to consumer and of course message processing regarding the message processing that's what we will discuss later today so i will not stop on that and then finally enterprise message bus was a very good thing to establish third-party integration integration with other services uh is it some third-party application of some of your partners for example is it customer service or some different departments of your own company if it's an email server which sends or vice versa receives data and is it a database to store some information so it was a huge step forward then basically um kafka comes okay and we want to speak about already uh better distributed messaging systems and you know what zeke i'm talking and talking and talking now it's your turn i will only get my water and listen to you and answer questions meanwhile so um my only question is are you gonna continue sharing the screen and i'll ask i will switch back to uh i will switch back to yours got it got it okay so i have a question for the audience can everyone see my screen just a second i'm switching yes now you must be good fantastic so basically kafka was invented around 2009 as kind of the um it's called a distributed commit log and what this means is you're able to store all your messages as an append file system and we'll talk about a little bit about that later but essentially it means that you're inserting messages into a server and this message is then copied over three times so basically the idea behind kafka was to offer complete and total horizontal scalability so unlike all these mq-style systems there's what's called a um primary and secondary messaging system so for you know a particular server if you go back to like the mq days you'd have a primary server and then you'd have secondary servers in kafka each node in the cluster will be serving you know data for the various applications so basically the idea behind it is node 0 would have ownership of partition 1 partition 2 node 2 would have ownership of partition 3 and 4 and so forth so basically a distributed system can be described as a way of distributing data and the idea behind this was you would horizontally scale it and the design around kafka was to serve the data as well as store it on the same node for high performance purposes and it came a lot from using the the hadoop based architecture as well so if you're from a hadoop architecture background you'll have some good ideas therein so what is kafka great for now i've been a kafka consultant for about six years so i have a pretty good understanding of this so basically kafka is really good for just streaming data so because it's what's called a distributed commit log you're able to add messages the end of a file so because kafka doesn't have any kind of searching capabilities no indexing you know it's not doing any kind of random disk access it's not doing any search queries you're literally adding a file to the end of a file system so if you've taken computer science 101 right adding an item to the end of an array is very easy compared to sorting an array or worth inserting data into the middle so it's just inserting data that's all that kafka is and that's why everyone loves it and that's why it's so fast because computer science 101 right if you're adding an item to an array of one operation i hope everyone in the box has taken some kind of basic algorithms so that's kind of why it's so fast it's an append only file system and that makes it great for streaming because the data is going in real time now unlike rabbitmq or all these other mq systems active m2 ibm mq they're not really designed for having let's say a thousand machines or a hundred machines maybe even ten machines for one single cluster optically designed from the beginning to handle as many machines as you want given you have enough partitions in the cluster and it's well known for high performance as well the key architectural difference between a distributed messaging system and a distributed clustered single node system is the way the storage layer is designed so in these previous single node systems the data layer for any given topic is stored on the same machine and this limited the size of the topic to the capacity of the local disk of that machine so within a distributed system the data is distributed across several machines within the cluster and the distribution of data across multiple machines allows us to retain messages for an individual topic that exceeds the storage capacity of an individual machine so the key architectural abstraction that makes this distribution possible is called the write ahead log which treats the contents of a message queue as a single append-only disk structure which can be stored so as you can see it in the diagram over here right we're basically writing data to these various different partitions and each of these partitions are an append only log so this provides distributed messaging which is far more scalable storage capacity than any of the previous generation of messaging systems so remember rabbitmq ibm mmq activemqswiftmq any of these mq systems are designed to delete the messages immediately after sending them so you can't replay messages you can't do you know a replaying of a a whole streaming data flow that's kind of the power of kafka you know end-to-end story data streaming through it through a you know distributed processing engine and then because it's an exhibited processing engine you're able to essentially do all this fantastic real-time analytics so another benefit of distributed messaging architecture is the ability of more than one broker to salt to serve the messages for any given topic this increases the message production message consumption throughput by spreading the load across multiple machines so for example messages published to the topic would be handled by three separate servers each would sewn right at the disk this would result in a higher write rate since the load spread is through across multiple disks rather than a single disk as a previous generation of messaging systems so these are the two distinct approaches when it comes to how the data is distributed across the nodes in the cluster partition based and that's kind of the power of kafka now what are the problems i ran into of kafka given my six years of experience with it well basically kafka is all about partitions right and if you design your topic correctly from the beginning you'll never have to add another partition again which is perfect however when you add a partition to a topic in kafka that's a massive headache so what that does is it basically requires you to move all of your existing data in that kafka topic to these new partitions so all your messages are re-keyed they're resorted they're redistributed your data goes to different partitions and you have any active consumers vlogging what's going to happen is those consumers start reading different feed messages so the way your data is attributed changes fundamentally and you have to plan downtime for popping generally when you're adding a partition you're going to be doing this in such a way that it's just very hard to scale it there and if you want to add a server to kafka as well you have to do what's called a partition rebalancing event partition rebalancing events are very expensive what this means is again you're copying data over there's going to be some outages the way you scale it is through replica factor as well next step to consider is application development so application development of copy a little tricky because you know you can't assign a specific consumer to read a specific advantage so if you start adding messages to your person you don't want it hey alex i hear your keyboard typing do you mind meeting a little bit or yes sure thank you that's only you you hear that but don't worry yeah i will lower it for you ah okay okay thank you so basically you know if you're using something like any of these mq-style systems it's very easy for you know um a consumer to subscribe to a topic and then the broker itself to do data enrichment right so in mq-style systems you can do jqueries you can do xllt on the broker itself which will filter the messages and route those to specific messages and you can also do things like priority queuing so these are features kafka simply doesn't have and that's why you know mq exists they still do why kof can never replace it so there's other issues as well there's a lot of lost messages cpu spiking due to stream processing issues in rocks db and out of order messaging which is a very common use case so we're one hour into our workshop today and now we're going to cover the basics of what is patchy pulsar which is why you're here today so i'll cover the introduction the architecture deployment and development models different application components to the ecosystem some of the messaging processing components multi-tenancy and geo-replication and finally hands-on keyboard exercises now today is a quick introduction next week we'll be doing a lot of hands-on you know coding and development and then the week after we'll do some integration examples so what is apache pulsar well basically it's a distributed publish and subscribe messaging system designed for high throughput and low latency it completely separates the compute layer of messaging from the storage layer so there's a completely separate uh messaging service called the brokers and there's a completely separate service layer it's called apache bookkeeper and we'll cover that on the next slide so it's it's horizontally scalable for every aspect of messaging so if you need to increase you know your message volume you add more brokers if you need to increase your computation capability that's when you also add more brokers or bookies and it also features streaming and cueing so it was originally developed at yahoo so it was added to the apache foundation in 2016 and now it's a top star project in 2018. about 7 200 github stars and 300 compet committers so what is it well basically it's a distributed tiered architecture right separation of storage and compute now of course there's zookeeper in this equation and zookeeper is fantastic for metadata you use zookeeper for holding metadata information like which machine is the primary keeper of which partition which broker is serving you know which customer and which custom client connection details um which function is running which application so that's basically the role of zookeeper it just stores like which machine owns which aspect of the system so it's a very small piece of the apache pulsar equation as well and then you also have these stateless brokers which are irresponsible for connecting to producers consumers and they also can run sql functions and what are called functions which we'll cover later and the storage is handled by bookkeeper which is also a distributed append only log system very much like kafka and the data is broken into segments written on multiple bookies by the way i can't see any questions at all so if anyone has any question uh maybe alex jump in and ask on the audience's behalf i we are answering all the questions in the youtube chat so we took care of that and looks like all the others are poorly listening to you okay so why apache pulsar well we have several blog articles out there there's an excellent one called four reasons why apache pulsar is essential to the modern data stack so you can go check that out just google that article there's also a link to it here in the uh slides which you should get at some time so basically apache pulser as geo-replication built out of the box so you can have a cluster in europe you can have a cluster in america you can have a cluster in china and they could all talk to each other now if anyone here is a data engineer they're concerned about gdpr and you know data isolation don't worry pulsar features uh message encryption uh encryption connections and encryption at rest and you can also isolate your topics your partitions your machine so so don't worry about you know geo replication with no concerns geo replication with a lock-in key second to scaling so because pulsar completely separates the compute layer and the storage layer you can throttle each one as needed to lower your costs or increase performance next is multi-tenancy so pulsar is designed as a unified event messaging platform what this means is that you can run multiple business units multiple customers multiple needs on a single cluster so generally speaking when you come from the kafka world you're going to deploy many small clusters just because of the nature of uh of the beast right you need to isolate your data different teams follow different standards different customers have different needs and you want to make sure that you can't exactly query those different data streams you want to keep everything fully isolated so because of this lock and key approach to topics in pulsar and because of tenants and namespaces which we'll cover a little later you're able to really lock down you know the way things work from an architectural perspective the next thing is that it has traditional cueing so you're able to run mq-style messaging and pulsar we actually developed a jms driver as well so you can run these old-school java messaging service applications on a pulsar cluster we're 98.5 percent compatible with all of their requirements so you know that's a lot better than other technologies out there cloud native as well so you can run kubernetes right out of the box that's designed from the ground up it has something called a proxy layer which is used for service discovery and um there's actually some documentation as well on how to set up multi-region clusters it's not very hard and performance again separation of compute and storage means that you can have a very consistent high performance and we've generally seen very consistent low latency around seven milliseconds seems to be a constant number i've been seeing at least in my own testing so what are the deployment options for pulsar well we do have some new uh serverless architecture coming out soon i'll stay mom about it but maybe we'll do it later in the workshop series you can run it on-prem using ansible scripts or kubernetes so both of those are available there's docker images um they're all java based we have helm charts as well so you can get your cop your pulsar running as soon as humanly possible which is pretty exciting then finally we have pulsar as a service so data stacks acquired a company called kesk and keska was providing a managed service for pulsar and now we're launching a aster streaming so you can run all this fantastic pulse or exercises in the cloud without having to learn anything about administering a pulsar cluster as well so that's coming soon what about developing pulsar so in the exercises on part two of the series they'll be mainly in java however python is my favorite language in the world so i'll probably provide some python code next week as well for part two of this learning exercises you can also do nodejs and yes you can run a websocket directly on pulsar which is pretty cool right so if you're making like a web-based video game if you're doing like some kind of stock tracker you could hook it up via a websocket to a pulsar cluster through the proxy there's a restful api for administration so you can also you know handle all the apa layer details as well so you can call and make different things if you need to develop on.net there are client libraries out there along with rust and haskell so what are the different components to pulsar and what do they what do they involve so basically you have zookeeper which is responsible for the metadata and configuration details and coordination so zookeeper is literally just storing a table of information in like in a distributed clustered manner so that's all it has um generally speaking when you deploy pulsar there's two zookeeper clusters there's what's called a a global zookeeper so if you're running like a single worldwide cluster you need a zookeeper to manage all the local clusters so remember in our earlier example we had a cluster in america a cluster in europe a cluster in china each of those pulsar clusters will require its own zookeeper for you know metadata information about you know ledgers partitions broker ids client information next you have the global zookeeper which basically keeps track of how these different clusters in different locations talk to each other so that's pretty much what they're involved for they're doing what's called tenants and name spaces which will be very important for these things as well by the way if anyone has any questions feel free to you know pause and ask me but otherwise i'll keep going so a broker is a stateless service and a broker is responsible for interfacing with the producers and consumers application now thankfully pulsar has service discovery so unlike something like kafka where you need a giant connection string with pulsar you just connect to a single dns endpoint and in that dns end point you are basically running your entire cluster behind a load balancer so pulsar is the broker is basically the brain of pulsar it's where you run all your restful administrative apis it's where all the producers and consumers request their data and the brokers are also responsible for running pulsar functions we'll cover pulsar functions later a broker is also responsible for topic ownership as well but pretty much as you can see in this diagram right the producer goes to a dispatcher the dispatcher goes to request different data fields from the managed ledger which has its own bookkeeper client which then talks to bookkeeper which then gives the data back to the broker then that goes to the consumer so that's what the broker is so a broker is basically responsible for the dynamic assignment of data topic ownership can change on the fly a broker can crash and a broker can be overloaded and the fortunate thing about the broker architecture is you can very easily add more brokers if you need to process more data more customers very easily there's also a ownership assignment granularity so we have this thing called namespaces and we'll cover that much later but basically you have these namespaces and you can do cassandra style hashing broker also offers what are called unloaded topics and bundles which triggers the topic reassignment based on the current workload it's manual and automatic you also have this bundle split feature which can automatically trigger topics and finally you have automatic load shedding which forces topics to go from overloaded brokers to available brokers so it's very good for like keeping a consistent low latency high performance because the broker again is responsible for the messaging sending and receiving so it's responsible for just brokering i'll pause if anyone has any questions i just went through 20 slides in 20 minutes so i i speak fast no no you are good well there is a question what i uh didn't okay there are two good questions actually so let's ask let's answer them live one question from murat from management perspective kafka vs pulsar which one is more difficult so the tricky thing with kafka is whenever you need to add scalability to it it's very difficult right because you have to add a partition rebalance those partitions and then manage each and every single one of your brokers so going back to the original diagram i'm going to go back very far it's this one right you have a serving layer and a storage layer and the problem with kafka is you can't separate the serving layer in the storage layer so therefore you have a lot of pain points where you need to serve more data but you don't need to serve more so therefore you have to add more broker nodes and those broker nodes adding them is very expensive right you have to basically add a partition do a rebalancing event and then when you do a rebalancing event you have to wait for it it causes all sorts of cpu hiccups disk hiccups if you need more storage you have to add more disks so because things aren't exactly logically separated it it just adds like unnecessary stress to the situation and when you have this stress you're also interfacing with other things now there are plenty of companies out there that provide managed services to make it operate better but you know the technology itself should ideally just work and you know apache kafka has a lot of pain points around the operation side of the equation did i answer your question there yeah i think so for me it sounds really reasonable uh then um next one um if i am already using kafka what would be the main reasons for me to move towards pulsar question from tarak nan napsinc all right tariff that's a very good question and i hosted two webinars recently that covered you know what is pulsar from a kafka perspective and why would you consider migrating from a kafka perspective as well they're both available on our website but pretty much the reason you would look at something like pulsar is you would use pulsar as like a layer on top of kafka or as a layer on top of rabbitmq so basically pulsar is your single unified event event streaming messaging platform and you can run a single worldwide cluster through pulsar so you can take you know all this kafka data and then federate it to very specific namespaces bundles topics and authentication so the benefit of running kafka on pulsar is you basically get the ability to organize your data in a much more structured and fundamental way the second reason why you consider you know using pulsar coming from a kafka background is if you're just doing producers and consumers pulsar is very very easy you know you can subscribe to a topic and you can also do key based messaging so you can subscribe to a key and then you can read only from that key and then process that keyed message on a topic we'll cover those kind of application designs next week as well yep great uh oh sorry uh have you answered it i did oh okay i was afraid i'm interrupting you so a very interesting question from thiago candelas um can you currently use pulsar in cloud providers serverless like aws or azure so we do have a service coming out soon called after streaming and we're launching it imminently and when it launches we'll cover it in one of our soon workshop series but we also have cask which you can use right now to get started and you'll be doing some hands-on exercises as well later today in the cloud with pulsar so don't worry hold tight wait like 10 minutes maybe 20 uh and we'll do some hands-on stuff yeah yes you can run it on a cloud provider you don't need to roll a server out of your closet and set it up you know you can run it on the cloud the wonderful thing about pulsar is it's very very very easy to just set up and run in the cloud i'm thinking we'll do that in the third workshop you know deploy pulsar in azure i'll just walk you through it it'll be pretty fun yep cool well there is a difference between run pulsar in cloud and run serverless in cloud uh as uh someone responsible for maintenance i can say there is a huge difference uh so uh yeah but uh there is a really good moment to ask that because thiago if you have heard of astra or astrodb so apache cassandra as a service manager cassandra now i'm not sure if it's secret yet or are we announced at that already astro streaming with apache pulsar on the same conditions so serverless going live very soon at uh with data stacks astra astro streaming and that's quite cool and maybe last question or a couple of last questions um can you give some reference example from real life application uh probably in a comparative way which component can help to do what in this architecture question from tonai so can you give some reference example from real life application yeah i'd have to switch the slides entirely though basically um give me a second give me a second okay all right so i'm going to read a different different slide you can do a different slide so basically when i talk about pulsar i like to talk about these use cases and you know basically yahoo uses it for their their mail services and their finance services as well so they're running a full 10 by 10 cluster so that's 10 clusters worldwide all talking to each other so they put all their financial and email services in their their pulsar clusters and it's replicated worldwide and they're able to stream it in they stream it out and it powers everything the other one is splunk splunk acquired a company called streamleo and streamleo is a very good company and splunk basically they had a lot of challenges using kafka for their own you know log analytics business and they discovered that you know pulsar was a lot easier to manage and develop on when it came down to these kind of things and finally we have a company called xailfin which is a chinese you know company that basically is the single largest job board website in all of china they have about 70 million unique page views a day and a lot of page views and basically what they did is they replaced both rabbitmq and kafka with pulsar to simplify their overall architecture the other example is verizon media so verizon media runs all of their you know mission critical recommendation engines on top of pulsar so that's one very good example now let me get back to the continuing presentation uh yep uh we have a couple of more questions but we can get back to them later because well show must go on and we still have some things to do today yeah yeah so we need to cover apache bookkeeper very quickly so basically apache bookkeeper is basically your distributed depend only log and it works exactly like kafka right where basically when you're a client you connect to a broker and the broker then interfaces with the bookkeeper and the bookkeeper is then responsible for storing and delivering the topic information to the broker and the broker has like topic data so we'll have like a ledger maybe you'll have one you'll have three ledgers in this example and each ledger has a series of fragmented entries in each of these fragments are what store the actual messages and once you completely fill a ledger it's closed and put away so basically it's a logical attraction a ledger is created when a topic is created or a rollover occurs so basically you create a new ledger when either a time based limit is reached there's an ownership change or something it's append only so that means as you're always writing to the end of a log not before and there are entries and fragments so basically um the bookkeeper basically holds a fragment so what is a fragment well you can look at it like a partition in kafka that's the easiest way of thinking about it and basically in this example um there's a cluster of five bookkeeper nodes which means an ensemble of five so that means this fragment is going to be you know can communicate with up to five brokers and this is important for performed reasons so an ensemble basically tells pulsar how many machines am i going to read and write from in real time next is the entries as well so we will have like these entries which are written to the fragments now a quorum right of three means your data is replicated three times on three different machines and you'll get an acknowledgement as well of three so this is coming from a kafka world where you send your message once it's replicated three times so you're able to survive disasters you're able to replicate the data and this is also very much like cassandra right when you replicate your data to you know you can do local quorum you can do quorum all but basically the rule is very simple you have the right quorum which tells you how many places to write it and then you have the acknowledgement quorum which tells you you know uh how many machines should acknowledge a message this is very good if you're coming from a kafka world where you know you write a message once it's replicated three times and then you get the acknowledgement back after it's been replicated three times so from a reliability perspective this makes things incredibly good um towards the end of this presentation you'll learn that you can actually replicate messages all over the world you don't need to set up some third-party tool it's baked right into apache pulser itself and it's right ahead log so bookkeeper is designed for much easier process of recovery so the process of replicating fragments to ensure a replication factor is maintained for each ledger there's a manual recovery or an automatic recovery process and there's dedicated recovery hosts or even sharing in the same hosts available so putting everything together you know you have your producers and consumers that interface with the pulsar brokers and those brokers then basically have their own metadata which is stored in zookeeper but those brokers then request the data or send the data to the bookkeeper cluster and the bookkeeper cluster is responsible for serving and storing those layers into their own cluster which handles the replication factor so you immediately see the benefits right in the world of kafka you'd have both the service and the storage on the same machine and that would cause a lot of issues wherein if you needed to do more computation you would have to add more brokers and if you had to start adding more storage you know you need to change your replication factor adding new broker to kafka is a major operational headache versus pulsar you can do them independently so does anyone have any questions about this screen so far strictly this screen uh yes just a second um first question or quite opposite last question from vemmal in pulsar uh messages are baked up and restaurant using snapshots um don't know about snapshots so it's an append-only log so what that means is messages are written to the end of a log and your messages will read from the beginning of the log to the end of log or the last place they are so there's not really a paradigm of snapshots all the messages in pulsar are on a ttl meaning they have a time to live say a certain amount of time but they're really deleted after you've already read the message after a certain amount of time so that's kind of something we'll cover in the next lab messaging dynamics ptls all these kind of things but for now um i hope i answered your question but snapshotting is a database concept that doesn't really apply to an append only log yeah make sense um next one well i guess i know the answer is that communication between brokers and bookkeepers uh zookeeper is secured as well yes yes yeah so you can have everything talking over tls you can do encryption authentication you know it's pretty fun it's not that hard and the helm charts cover all of that by the way so you don't have to learn tls you can just run the helm charts and they'll do it for you as long as you have kubernetes but yes uh but i mean in general apache pulsar is enterprise level solution so of course all kind of security uh encrypting and so on is supported so there is no doubt i can simply answer yes and i'm not sure i got it but there is a question from one of our most persistent attendees from united states uh kafka segments became bookie ledger or vice versa uh it's it's tricky right because kafka is different i think entries would be segments in kafka so basically i would look at you know fragments as being like um so ledgers are entry so so kafka you define partitions at the beginning ledgers are created as the data comes so you know depending upon the configuration of your pulsar topic you can give it a number of partitions but that's a logical thing on the broker side um we can we can take this conversation offline and get back to you but that's that's an interesting question yep and last one i think you will like that uh how cassandra and pulsar feeds and advantages together yeah so the biggest thing about pulsar and cassandra and why i love them together so much is the fact that both pulsar and cassandra are worldwide open source solutions what this means is you send a message once the pulsar or cassandra it can be replicated worldwide to multiple data centers they're both distributed processing systems they're both highly reliable and they're both very interesting as well so imagine running a stream on a worldwide data set stored permanently on a worldwide database of cassandra that's kind of the the vision there and then being able to run graphqls and both systems so it's pretty fun yeah that's a lot of fun indeed uh cool so i think we are done with the questions at this moment we can move on wonderful thank you so the next thing is the pulsar proxy so the pulsar proxy is your own internal gateway this basically means that when you want to talk to a pulser cluster generally it'll go through a dns entry point and this is why pulsar is designed to work on kubernetes out of the gate so it has like service discovery built into it next is pulsar schema so pulsar has a built-in schema registry now this is very much like kafka so you can do avro json or protobuf you can do schema evolution and it's backwards compatible and schema management is automatic and it can also be manual keep this schema uh in your mind we may have a question about it later next is pulsar functions so the wonderful thing about pulsar is you can actually upload your code to the brokers and then your code will run as kind of as an aws lambda on the servers itself so if you need to create a application as a service on the pulsar platform you don't need to deploy a machine you can just put it directly on your brokers and then add more brokers as you need to run more functions so that's kind of like the the major benefit of separating the storage and compute layer since you're separating the storage and compute layer you can just add more compute to handle more functions and these functions can be in languages like java python and go so this is very good for complex some event processing streaming doing data filtering so we get an input of messages and we do output logs and topic logs we'll try and cover some of this in the very next session so maybe we'll write a pulsar function together we should we should we i believe it's one of the most interesting chances so we must write something next week oh yeah yeah it'll be very fun don't worry don't worry next is the oh so sorry can you get back to the previous slide for a second i want to add the thing so regarding the pulsar functions it's a powerful feature it's a great feature which can really help you um building flexible powerful applications and so on but there is a thing i want to warn our attendees because with this how easy it's supported how easy you can add some of the processing you also should do no mistake like bringing parts of your business logic into that i've seen so many companies what happened to them they're putting part of their business logic into database triggers uh yeah and then after some years they stuck into the situation half of the business logics in the database triggers half of a day with half of business logic in the applications now spread it into multiple servers and at this moment no one understands how this works seriously i've seen that it's painful it's a big problem and to rework this system it's really hard and extremely expensive and very dangerous a lot of moving parts uh hidden layers and so on and so forth so bringing something into pulsar function think of what exactly you are putting that at the end of that and put it under control and by the way we have some great questions uh we can answer them now or later maybe let's let's start answering questions at the very end because i want to make sure we cover all the main content and then we do the hands-on lab and then we should have because we're down to 30 minutes and people are eager to get their hands on those keyboards right yep yep that makes sense so the next thing we have to consider is the other ecosystems and components so pulsar has its own connectors we actually have our own pulsar apache committer building a feature to run kafka connectors directly in pulsar so that's pretty fun but there are built-in connectors as well so you can do jdbc drivers so you can talk to like a sql database we have a kafka and cassandra cdc change data capture connectors as well mongodb um you can also run dibezium on pulsar i haven't personally tried it but i've seen several articles written on it as well the next is pulsar sql so basically pulsar sql is just presto db now called trino and this gives you the ability to just simply query um a topic of records um it's not going to be like a real-time k-sequel kind of thing but that's okay because there's a lot of database administrators that just want to be able to query data and just get data out for analytics purposes so this is designed strictly for the analyst type role and you can obviously throw this on to some type of ui the next feature is tiered storage so with pulsar you have the ability to just store messages on like you know a much cheaper file system an s3 bucket you know an azure blob store or even an hdfs database so you can basically lower your costs exponentially by going from kafka to pulsar you know in kafka again you can't separate your storage compute layer so whenever you need to store more data in kafka you have to add more kafka brokers and that gets very expensive when you just need more disk drives on the tiered storage is transparent to client and you can basically configure it on a topic level as well next is security so the authentication is very pluggable so you can do certificate based authentication jwt based authentications kuberos or oauth2 so authentication means there's a user that has to basically connect to the cluster then you have pluggable authorization which means that you can authorize them to a topic to a namespace for a tenant and we'll cover those topics later and then finally we have tls encryption end to end both the tunnel between every aspect of pulsar and you also have plenty of example code on the apache pulser website on what's called end-to-end encryption where you can message encrypt every individual message or you can do you know hard disk based encryption on the operating system level as well they're all uh pulsar also has prometheus built into its helm charts we prefer you to try the data stacks home charts of course but there are home charts available for apache pulsar and it already has you know alert manager built in so you have your alert thresholds so with our own flavor of the uh the home charts you get an administrative console which gives you a powerful ui for reading things like you know name spaces and and um and syncs and sources and viewing functions and getting code snippets and looking at various clusters so it's a web-based administrative tool and it allows you to manage multiple environments multiple tenants multiple namespaces and there's many administrative clies as well so you can basically administer an entire pulsar cluster from the terminal command line okay so what is multi-tenancy in pulsar what is that all about why have i not really dived into it well let me dive into it now so imagine you know again you have multiple business units right each of these multiple business units have different you know organizations under them and then they have their own business logic different topics like maybe they're doing risk storing credit so if you're running a worldwide cluster like a u.s west in asia u.s east and europe these different regions each of those clusters needs to have its own administrative layer so you have authentication authorizations isolation policies which means that you can isolate messages to be stored on one specific machine only you can do storage quotas and distribution so i'm just going to bring up give me a second yeah so basically you have tenants let's look at something like e-payments any payments you're going to have maybe two namespaces one for just regular payments which will track things like credit cards and gift cards and the payments you know you want to make sure that only only the payments team can see that information it's it's pii data it's pci compliance you have to really lock it down so no one can touch it the next is you have another namespace for fraud detection where you can do like some very simple algorithms to do the risk store detection so you can really like organize your data in a very hierarchical way so this is not easy to do in other systems and this is why pulsar is very good for building a worldwide messaging platform so how does geo replication work well let's jump straight into it so geo replication means is that for each tenant so going back here you can create tenants that span multiple regions or you can have tenants that are isolated to a specific cluster so that's the power and flexibility of pulsar you can have your tenant available in one space and a tenant available everywhere else and that's kind of the power of it so when you have geo-replication enabled on a tenant basis or a namespace basis when you produce a message to let's say a topic one in cluster a that message will be replicated to cluster b and c and then it will do an acknowledgement after the message is replicated worldwide and then the consumer of that message could then read it you know later so it's a very reliable and simple way of doing worldwide application messaging for reliability and scale you also have a replicated subscription so you can keep your your subscription state in sync you have consumer failover to another cluster to resume from another failure point and you have a sub second delay and you also have basically this reliable design um the other thing too is the local acknowledgement so you can configure basically a local acknowledgement so your acknowledgement of messages are local to a particular region you can also enable what is called synchronous geo replication so if you send a message in one region you can acknowledge that it's been replicated worldwide you also have a rack awareness policy you can also selectively have the application go to a particular region so you know again pulsar is designed from the very ground up to do worldwide messaging you also have the interesting capability of creating an active active architecture active standby but you can also have one-way replication right so if you're doing business in china you can never take data out of china you can only put data in china so that's a good use case here where you know you put in some data you have its own cluster running in there you can also have an aggregated cluster so if you know you're maybe part of the finance team and you need to collect all your very simple compliance data you could have like a cluster that's for financial analysis and you can have all the data replicated to that cluster of a particular topic so it's pretty fun what you can do with pulsar all right lab time yeah lab time let's do it so i have a big question to our attendees there there are some questions but aren't answered yet we will do now a labora lab work online altogether and then we will have a quiz because we still want to send you some friends some prizes and um after that we may stay a zig do have a some time today i think i do if we will have some time we will answer questions uh after the lab time after the lab work and after the quiz because first things first we have to fit to the schedule and then in you can stay and ask some more questions okay so i will switch back to my uh screen give me a moment and what you have to do right now is boom what you have to do right now is to follow this address i will throw a link to the youtube chat io slash enterprise streaming series oh evan streaming series dot love one http um and i will throw the same link to discord and what's your work now is to push the button and to grab a training instance is and to do it and i will go a little bit in front of you and do the exercises on my own so we will discuss how it goes and what do we have to do but it's all well explained in katakura and if you use a katakuri before you might love it as i do because katakura is amazing and you can run complex software and do complex lab works without installing anything because we installed everything for you and that's an amazing uh project now supported by o'reilly publisher's house you may have heard of them yeah i love catacod it really helps us to run educational things so in this scenario we will install uh configure and start apache pulsar we will create new topic using pulsar admin we will create a consumer using pulsar client we will create a producer using pulsar client and use a patch pulsar for pubsub messaging now that's an important point today we work in console okay but in general you use such systems not only in console so for the next class one week later for the next workshop we will already work with a real code but now let's start from the simple things first thing we have to do is to install pulsar and that's a very easy job in our case first thing i do is i simply download the archive of latest pulsar version 277 272 sorry and when i have to unpack it and it will be done so all works very well now take a look if you don't have cataclysa experience before there are two ways for you to work firstly you can type the commands on the terminal on the right who am i root where am i pulsar or you can simply click these dark fields on the left side and they will be executed automatically good so i've just downloaded pulsar unpacked it and switched to a folder proper folder um in order to be able to execute all the commands uh now i can take a look at the command line tools i'm going to use today i will ask to show all the commands in the bin folder so we have we have multiple parts of patch pulsar here now we are going to work for with the bin folder there is a commands like pulsar admin pulsar client and so on those we will need today um then we have to start a local cluster using pulsar command so it will look like bin pulsar standalone before doing that i want to show you one thing so you will need to know if you want to run pulsar locally not in katakura but doing something on your own there are a couple of things you need to consider expert sir we did some pre-configuration to simplify uh deployment of a pulsar just to make things easier and one thing what really matters here is this line we set an environment variable pulsar memory to limit it to maximum direct memory size because in these in catacora scenarios we may run very easily run into limitation of available memory those are not so huge servers so far and you may run into this problem as well if you try to run pulsar on your own and you get a warning like okay no memory available i'm dying from pulsar then you know what to do you need to set environment variable to configure available memory to it and if you use um previous versions of java 8 11 jdk you may run into duplication warning of nesborn we just removed it for you okay so now i can launch the pulsar here so i can type it on my own on just click on the left side pin pulsar stand alone boom and now it will be a long long long list of different messages because pulsar starts in standalone mode and it still needs bookkeepers zookeepers and so on and so forth so there is plenty of work to do and it means what we can proceed so now we will use pulsar admin to learn about the cluster tenants namespaces and topics all the things explained by zig recently so first we are going to admin terminal notice we have multiple terminals here on top main admin consumer producer we can create more if we want not need that right now we have enough but you can if you want let me make it a little bit bigger maybe so i have to go to admin terminal here we go i have to switch to the folder and i will ask pulsar admin to ask for clusters list i will click here to execute this command katakuri is doing that for me and we have only one cluster standalone well because we are running pulsar in a standalone mode now we can ask the same pulsar admin for tenants list i'm executing this command by click and we have two tenants public and sample of course we can create more if we need and then finally we can ask for pulsar admin namespaces list for public so we have a public tenant and in public tenant we have namespaces public default and public functions we can ask instead of public for sample for example don't be afraid to make experiments don't me don't be afraid to crush things it's catacot it's not your production it's much better to break things here than on your production so that's how you learn and don't be afraid cool and finally i want to display topics in the public default namespace so public stands for tenant and default stands for namespace i click that and answer will be quite expectedly empty we don't have any topics by default that's a standard behavior so i want to proceed to step four jai gorov asks is it run on kubernetes so it's definitely runs in docker uh regarding the kubernetes i don't know at this moment it runs and kubernetes yeah for sure okay yeah by default so answer is yes it is kubernetes cool so let's move on now we will use pulsar client to create a consumer to subscribe for some kind of notifications so first i will go to i will go to consumer terminal i will switch to my folder with apache pulsar and i will subscribe consuming client consumer to the new topic using pulsar client tool let's take a look on this command first one will be pulsar client so that's the command we are calling now what exactly we are going to do we are going to consume pulsar client may execute multiple operations you can check for that we have been pulsar client help and you think we missed admin terminal you think so let me check oh you are right you are right you're right you're right okay so thank you uh tanai thank you panichara thank you uh we indeed skipped that step for my bed so we will use pulsar admin to create a new topic to subscribe to the topic we need this topic and we will create a topic in public default call it shakespeare quotes it's done very easy pulsaradmin what topics what to do create and then the name of this topic so it will be not the name but let's say the resource locator for this topic persistent public default shakespeare quotes so tenant namespace name of the topic execute created no response means good good response it's still linux in the end and then finally we ask for the list of topics like we did before pulsar admin topics list for public default and now in the we have this one persistent public default shakespeare quotes so it's done i already did step five as you've noticed it i give a consumer terminal good thing what my consumer stays with this topic so nothing bad really happened i may not do i don't have to restart that and we can proceed to step six we will use a principles our client to create a producer what will send messages but you know what we are experimenting after all so i want to make a step to the side from this list and do something more interesting we have here one consumer running right bean pulsar client consume blah blah blah my shakespeare subscription i want to run one more consumer terminal and i will execute the same command there ah of course i have to switch to apache police or soon okay no zero messages successfully consumed sure uh we already have uh sky exclusive consumer connected yes so i have to mark it as non-exclusive but it's exclusive so i won't have the two consumers on the same one this one is available and he exclusive consumer is already connected okay no worries it's still here it awaits for something so now we have to go to the producer terminal first don't forget to switch to the folder don't be like me and second we will produce with pulsar client command we will produce to public default shakespeare quotes message brevity is the soul of the beat katakura doesn't like me for all the switches but it's okay i will just copy paste it okay so something just happened we can take a look at all the logs there is quite a lot but what the really matters to us the beginning connected to server and in the end one message successfully produced now we can switch to consumer terminal and take a look what's happened there as we got the consumer running we see his this got message report with the content brevity is the soul of it exactly the one we recently produced client closing we are done one message successfully consumed in this way notice we executed consume for for one and only one message we might work in a little bit different way so i will switch to a step 7 to last step and in the producer terminal i will send 60 messages at the rate of one message per second so in the producer terminal okay i will do it again by copy paste usually it works and it starts to produce messages and as i say here we have my list messages described here and we have a rate on one per second and it looks like it works it produces them step by step then in the consumer terminal i can run pulsar pulsar client to consume shakespeare quotes topic from my shakespeare subscription number 60 in this mode by number 60 i specified to this um consumer what it has to expect 60 messages if it will has less um like 58 for example it will stay subscribed and wait for two more if there is a more messages waiting to be consumed it will consume 60 and quit so i'm pushing the button and we are getting things already so first two were produced recently by meme and those are getting live a question by thiago can you set the consumer to consume indefinitely yes of course sure that's how it normally works yeah and it looks like i've called it producer twice because i see a lot of duplication that's mostly probably because i pushed the button twice 60 messages produced successfully cool okay okay yes so indeed i've executed this command twice that's why i have duplication here it's on the producer side so in short if you produce the same message twice it will be consumed twice because well it was from your side so it is done and we can go to consumer terminal and see all the list of the messages consume it now we have 16 60 messages successfully consumed question is how many more do we have i bet we have 60 more because well we just dispatch it from twice and yeah here we go in the end when the second run will be executed queue will be empty and we will be done so that's 1955. uh zeke how do you think i think we are done with step seven i think we are done with the practice at my side but you may need or you may want to have more time that's completely fine so this instance stays for you for some more time in the end don't forget to make the screenshot of the congratulations you've completed this scenario don't forget to make a screenshot because you will need this screenshot to submit your homework and to get your participation certificate in the end of the workshop series so well if you forgot to do it or if you've energy if you complete it for work already and close it with window don't worry you've seen it takes if you run through just like five minutes and uh we are done with this one and i bet if i run it again it will be empty already okay so it means i've executed this one more than two times good so this job is done and i kindly ask you to complete this practical step complete this left after the workshop and set the scenario rating to the number to the amount of stars you think it deserves personally i like this scenario it's a simple one but we have four more lap works for you in the upcoming days next monday next monday and finally i think it's time to switch back to main team i think i think it's time to do that quiz yes so let music plays and let's now we are going to ask questions and you are going to answer them and if you are fast enough if you give the right answers you will get the prizes from data stacks and don't forget you have like 30 minutes or 30 seconds to jump back go to mendy.com and use the code 65532834 if you not in yet and if you are not in yet but you want to join you may also scan this qr code next to zig or just enter the code close to me and we are almost out of time so please hurry up because we have to start once again mentee.com 65532834 i see a lot of people has joined it and we are going to start just 10 seconds how many people do we have on youtube right now i don't know how many people we have on twitch but on youtube we have almost 100 people that's amazing thank you and murad says two hours is not enough for this great content thanks all the people thank you so much for the warm feedback and i'm completely agree to ours is not enough that's why we have four more hours two next monday and two more monday after that so really thank you so much for the warm feedback yeah uh cool so we have 50 free people ready to rumble let's start then so let's start answer fast to get more points which statement is right about http api calls they are slower than asynchronous messages they can't have payload they are blocking synchronous they are obsolete and discontinued time is up and the right answer was the answer number three they are blocking they are synchronous they are not slower than asynchronous insta messages that's important to understand message per se as it is goes exactly the same network exactly the same time with exactly the same payload so message is not slow synchronous http message is not slower than the asynchronous messages but the time available for the producer to work with asynchronous is indeed higher but that's a different story so correct answer is they are blocking synchronous and let me see how little world looks after the first question i see thiago is on the third place gabriel fournier on the second and parfa was the fastest earning 904 points which is a very good result but that was only the first question out of eight so let's take a look how it goes in the next one and that's a question number two so answer fast to get more points where does pulsar store data a page zoo keeper a patch bookkeeper apache kafka in a bookstore so whereas pulsar stores data time is over and the right answer is apache bookkeeper not in a bookstore that's for sure and definitely not in apache that would be quite funny what do you think yeah a badge bookkeeper is used to store data good so far so good so who made the mistake who is out of top 10 [Music] okay it looks like thiago left their top 10 but i'm happy to greet ivan garcia some familiar names and partha is fastest again that's an incredible performance that's 1827 points that's the best result so far and prakash is on the second place we've approximately 50 points delay gabrielle still holds in the top three which is a very good result but we have six more questions so let's advance question three answer fast to get more points there das pulsar stores metadata apache kafka a punch bookkeeper a page zoe keeper in a bookstore you have some seconds to think about that then time is up and the right answer is a badge zoe keeper it's not bookkeeper it's not apache kafka and still not a bookstore sorry so looks like nearly everyone gave the right answer and there are no mistakes from the top 10 but who was the fastest this time fastest was ruby making it into the top ten and i see our term mate to the top nine and the one garcia holds a seventh place that's a very good result but top three the positions what are getting prizes are still the same partha prakash and gabrielle fournier let me take a look at the fourth question so answer fast to get more points in bookkeeper what is a bookie did you pay the attention in bookkeeper what is a bookie server viva page bookkeeper running a collection of records a hashing function a guy who takes bets for you oh yeah i would make a bet there will be a mistake and indeed in bookkeeper bookie is a server with watchbookkeeper running it's not a collection of records and that means we are going to have a lot of mistakes on the leaderboard so let me see the result oh my god that's a vibe that's like a real white from second to sixth place all the full of the mistakes parfa gets to the first place getting not the fastest but still right answer nitasharam gets to the second one lubagav is on the third one prakash is on the fourth and piotr totter get to the fifth place with the fastest correct answer this time and gabrielle is only on the sixth so let me take a look at the question number five and answer fast to get more points which subscriptions are available in pulsar share it exclusive failover whatever you want for 9.9 per month available right now beach subscriptions are available in pulsar and it was quite funny question because all of them are available and any answer of first of three is correct share it exclusive and failover are all available in pulsar and no pulsar is an open source technology so you don't pay to use for that well you only maybe as it's an engineers to engineers you maybe are getting celery to run it quite sweet for me yeah all of both should have been an option but menti sadly doesn't have all of their both um in this mode so harry was the fastest making e to the top ten ivan garcia is on the ninth place first place holds by partha and if he he or she will make no mistake it's definitely will be the winner for today because the gap now is a real thing of 900 points that's a solid difference so far he did no mistake so question six answer fast to get more points what's the name of connectors to push messages from pulsar to our systems think source sync sync seek so many options such a short time but most of you gave the right answer correct one is sync not source not think not sick definitely not sync so let's go show me the leaderboard okay so competitors made pretty well petra alim was fastest that brings him to their place number 10 parta holds the first one with peter on the second and cuddy on the third and bala is following kazi fighting for the third place with just nine points of difference that's a competition ladies and gentlemen that's a real competition so we are almost out of time and we are almost out of questions so last two and that's question number seven answer fast to get more points which schema is not support not supported in pulsar avro jason wrote above or xml rich schema is not supported it's a hard one but the right question again was given by most of you but the biggest part of fair thing is xml schema is not supported pulsar supports protobuf as quite via quite popular in these scenarios and avro is supported as well xml is not supported so oh my god peter goodbye see you again later we have two more workshops you can win in the next one that was a bad answer and prakash and bala gave exactly the same time answer which brings bala to the second place using the mistake of putter and brings prakash to only nine bala and kazi are holding the first second and third place 50 luck following very close with only 60 points difference i can imagine how those two are nervous right now kazi and bala and partha should make no mistake and then he she keeps the first place sorry i don't know if it's a male name or female i'm sorry so it's going to be the last question so get ready for that release your mind warm up your fingers get ready we are starting the last question of today's quiz the question what defines everything question eight so answer fast to get more points which is not a component of pulsar vocabulary producer consumer subscription director which is not a component of pulsar vocabulary okay it was too easy for you it was too easy next time we will prepare some question harder 35 people gave a right answer but who of them was the fastest one who was the fastest one bala was the fastest one getting to the second place or holding second place and that's how it looks in the end tilak ivan garcia fire dancer ruby petra alim pewter and prakash are getting into the top 10 and they can be proudly and then kb have something to be proud for it's a tough competition with the dozens of people then kazi and bala with the fastest answer in the 8th question getting to the second and third place and parfa managed to give all the right answers through all the quiz and that brings him to the first place and now three winners partha bala please write a message to jack fryer jack fryer already wrote a message in youtube chat please send him a screenshot of your menu screen with your winner position to claim your price at the address of jack.fryer at datastax.com and ivan garcia next time keep fighting uh well played everyone it was a really really really really really good one i have enjoyed any moment it was like you took it seriously i seem good now before you close main team let me ask you one final question in mentee quiz is over so no prizes for this one but we will really appreciate your feedback what did you like the most in this workshop if you liked something i hope so what would you improve what would be any feedback or actually it's an open question so if you think you want to learn something on a different topic let them let me know oh yes and thank you for highlighting that we are not getting the swag since three plus months um sorry we got a serious problem with a logistics company we were partnering with and now we're finally dispatching prizes using different logistics company so swag will be dispatched or maybe already delivered very soon jack if you could please let us know in the youtube chat what's going on with perspective it would be really great thank you more practice opportunities it comes so this one was more about theory and we have more lab works coming into the next week would like to see more use cases okay i see him uh pulsar arc needs easier explaining well man pulsar architecture and pulsar is a solution what is able to dispatch billions and billions and billions of messages all across the world sorry but such less solutions cannot be simple it's just you cannot blame your bicycle what it cannot move 40 000 kilograms of some stuff because your bicycle is a backbeat for that but also you cannot be too sad about the airplane super plane boeing what it's hard to manage yes it's hard to manage because it's an airplane able to leave dozen stones dozens metric stones of goods so of course well prepared club thank you all was new for me got some idea two hours well spent thank you uh okay i thought volume was well balanced thank you for the feedback i will take care of the volume better next week good to know presto querying examples that's interesting team interaction and the way content build up of course many great content good session and so on and so forth thank you thank you too we can have some example of problem solving scenario using pulsar something like making purchase under on amazon how it works for the system that's a great question by the way we for the next week we have to prepare some better um explanation on the use case on how exactly it works thank you so much and we are done so few last things next episode june 14th same time subscribe right now please notice what different episodes of these uh workshop series required require separate registration so you have to register again for the next episode i'm sorry for the inconvenience but yeah we need that serene next one we will start in action so we are getting into more advanced things with pulsar um zeke could you please explain uh what's the things we are going to do next week yeah so next week we'll be covering you know producing and consuming and messaging and design patterns using pulsar so we'll be doing more hands on keyboard exercises how you should use pulsar as an application developer and it will be yeah that's pretty pretty much it so it'll be like hands down on keyboard kind of stuff okay uh i see bala simha reports of a registration it's saying sales ended we will check that that should work um so give me a moment date is texted your slash key is s-e-p-2 but registration must be if it's closed at the moment we will reopen it because that's obviously a mistake but for me registration looks uh open so yeah it looks good to me uh thiago if you uh registered for session two yesterday then you are good of course ah okay so jack fix it for registration registration is opened again that's good now if you like our workshops and if you don't want to wait for a full week well thank you we have something basically on wednesday and second run on thursday so on 9th and 10th of june build a netflix clone with graphql react and nosql database led by cedric ryan and me on thursday so on wednesday and thursday it's the same content but different speakers and different time zone and actually let me send you a link into the youtube chat so you would be able to register if you are interested in that okay it's being opened so register nope wrong button sorry sorry for a little delay that's it i got the link finally so i'm sending it to the youtube chat oh jack fryer already did that hey jack you are the big guy here okay basically that makes today workshop we are out of time so i think we are done if you want to communicate further if you want to ask more questions if you want to extend your knowledge on this one come next monday and don't forget to catch us on our discord server discord server link is specified in the description of the video but i again will paste the link so jump into our huge discord server and let's talk them you did amazing job today but what i really want to say so thank you to zac dean because this workshop was mostly prepared by him and it's an incredible work and i'm happy uh to have it running here and thank you so much for joining us today answering all the questions and making all the presentation that's an incredible thing thank you thank you everyone for participating today cool so see you soon and hopefully to see you wednesday and first day and a little bit of music for you to enjoy and relax in the end of a workshop and don't forget to do your homework and complete the lap one see you later [Music] on the same page [Music] oh [Music] you",
