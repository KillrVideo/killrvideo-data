  "description": "In this episode Adron Hall and Jeff Carpenter talk about networking and its inherent complexities and solutions in multi-cloud environments. Lately a lot of discussion has come up around best practices, and in this episode Adron & Jeff also tackle the top three that have been most prominent. We wrap up with a summary, and Adron’s top two tools for multi-cloud work these days. As always, we always are interested in your comments, questions, and thoughts on the matter so comment here or tweet at us and we can elaborate even further on more practices and patterns of multi-cloud deployments.\n\nHighlights:\n0:15 - Welcoming guest to the episode…\n0:50 - What do we do with networking in a multi-cloud environment?\n1:50 - The apples to oranges of AWS vs. GCP vs. Azure. They’re all just so slightly different!\n3:00 - Good practices around networking in multi-cloud environment.\n3:25 - First: Infrastructure as Code!\n4:14 - Two: Abstract your platform tiers; Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, or otherwise.\n5:00 - Jeff notes there is indeed a fire, somewhere, that is on fire!\n5:15 - Safety first, determine where the fire is! Be careful though don’t just grab the doorknob, check it first!\n5:45 - Three: Keep your databases loosely coupled appropriately to your systems and your applications.\n8:05 - Knowledge about your environment and findability.\n9:00 - Distributed systems problems?\n10:00 - Data tier, abstractions on abstractions do provide solutions. From data centers to regions to zones.\n11:00 - Summarized the big three, that keep coming up. Get to this point, and now you’re ready to go multi-cloud.\n11:36 - Adron’s World, what are the first two tools Adron goes for?\n\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems ok so you and Patrick we're having this intense conversation about multi cloud challenges last time and you know the problem I had was you were raising all these questions and challenges and not giving us any of the answers right we didn't give any answer are we gonna we're gonna start doing that now yeah so we wanted to raise the answers because that was what we were working toward is having that list of things that we needed to think about right and one of the things that we've been thinking about that I'd like to talk about is what do you do about networking when you're in a multi cloud environment okay right and that's good and I think that's where we should start because you guys were talking about all kinds of things like state management you're within your your data to you and you were talking about how do you scale your application and we're talking about all kinds of stuff deployments and and what have you and but honestly if like if you don't have a networking environment set up right between those clouds what what do you have so maybe that is where it starts yeah and it has to fundamentally write as you you get into your cloud provider or whatever and you go what's the first thing I need to do well you need to know how to connect into where are you gonna put resources okay so that's easy right sure I suppose in relative terms well I mean Whittle us has V pcs and this kind of subnet and sure has its own right naming stuff so like how do you even begin to unpack and and when apples to oranges that's the that's the inherent thing because you do have an apples to oranges type of situation yeah with a lot of these providers you know at first glance sometimes you might go in and say you've signed into GCP in AWS and you're looking at some of the docs and go okay with VP see here in a VP see here and then wait I have to set the subnet up differently and then I have to route with different resources and they're called different and then you go oh wait I have to go to Asher and you realize there's not a V PC so you got to figure out like what is that obviously it has a network but oh it's a virtual it's a virtual network now so you have three different contexts and different ways that you need to set all this up and it's all based around you know our standard web-based tcp/ip you know OSI layer etc but when you're allocating these resources in your cloud providers they're different and you need to have a way to to manage that in a way that you can do that over a period of time you can't you don't want to just like create this wonderful artisanal bespoke network in one and then you turn around you I don't know how to put that over here you know so ah so you need some good practices around this stuff right and you've made it like it could be a very manual process to do that kind of stuff up but that's not gonna really get things done for us long term okay so what are those best practices that are really gonna help us have success in managing just even the networking set up and in configuration yeah so first one yeah and I say this is as a baseline really to even getting into cloud space this should be a baseline but especially if you're gonna go multi-cloud you have to get your infrastructure written out as code and yeah whatever tooling that enables you to do that whether it's terraform or maybe ansible with something else or whatever combo you have you got to get that put together now without that it's just you'll you'll be sinking all the time right is that gonna give us that common language that's gonna help us manage kind of that terminology different between the different public providers not particularly man so you're still managing each of the states but the thing is it becomes very repeatable yeah but when you get to this next practice what you need to do is you still you you have all your infrastructure manage now is code so it's repeatable right but you need an abstraction above all the clouds to be able to interface with those in a seamless similar way all the time and that is where something like kubernetes or cloud foundry or cloud foundry on kubernetes some of that that tooling option comes into play to help kind of bridge all that so instead of writing weird custom stuff to one cloud provider even though you have your network build or whatever and then weird stuff to another one you can write your you can build your images and your docker containers or whatever and you can deploy those with kubernetes and then that kind of manages your application tier instead of writing proprietary stuff for each of the providers okay nice and you know something is obviously on fire somewhere yeah it's that last but it's but it's not our infrastructure it's someone else's infrastructure that's on fire right now yeah so if it's you stop and check stop the video or stop the podcast go and check and make sure everything's cool in your environment and they come back and feel the doorknob first don't just like plant your hand on it be safe exactly okay so that's you've given me two best practices so far infrastructure is code and then using that abstraction layer and then are there any more definitely ok there's probably a lot more yeah big one that I keep thinking about you have three is the magic number yeah third one three three is a perfect triumvirate of numbers here you gotta keep your data needs your databases loosely coupled from everything so that they are managed as the data requirements are needed so like if you have a distributed database yeah we're not quite in a world yet where you just ship that via your kubernetes deployment or out into a proprietary situation you want that distributed accordingly across your cloud providers and then okay the same time if you have other databases you need to think that through too like how do you make that available in each of your environments and to your applications you don't want a binding that's gonna break you want something that's loosely coupled that can manage its observability into that database system and place like that so so what do you mean in terms of this loop this coupling are we talking about things where our application instances or micro service instances are able to connect to local nodes in a local data center is that what you're talking about do you mean something else so basically meaning is that you can take your application mm-hmm and have written against appropriate abstractions so that your database wherever it is you can just kind of point it in that direction and your application will work with the database versus saying well prime example right if in your application you write only to one IP ha and you're tightly coupled to the IP right if something if the IP changes like your database has to shift or say that node drops that IP for some reason within the ephemeral nough sub the cloud I see your whole situation is gonna break because of the tight coupling there but if your application knows how to manage itself when something fails or like kubernetes rolls the app right it knows how to reconnect to an appropriate connection point okay so taking this into like the classic example of using one of our data stacks connectors to connect to Cassandra or DSC you usually have to provide it a list of connection points right which could be an IP address or it could be a well-known name there are different challenges that associated with that but what we really need is something to where we can reliably provide something to our services or our applications to know how to connect to the database there's not tie to a specific IP right right right okay and there's a level a balance you get you get the dynamic nature on both ends right you can make some application changes restart the application and it can get back in touch with whatever it needs to on the other end right and vice versa where if the database needs some changes to be made or you need to roll that you know some connection points or whatever variances that come up right you can make those changes and restart things and it's seamlessly interconnected between okay that makes a lot of sense oh and I guess I will say one of the things that that could be a challenge in term of reconfiguring the state of your application if you have to seat it with a new IP address oh yeah one of the good things about the way that the the driver has always worked is that if it's able to connect to any node mm-hmm in the cluster it's able to through gossip discover write patience of the rest of the node so it's really a matter of like getting that bootstrapping point that you can connect to but even that can be hard if you're relying on other guy P's well distributed systems problems right yeah so there's always the question of what else is going on and like with data stacks Enterprise that's one of the big advantages - right because you can easily expand that through the way it's built across your multi cloud so it's in the environments you need it to be whatever is running out in your cloud so like if you have different types of architectures in your cloud like the services are running over here yeah some other apps service is running in this cloud and you know that that layer is not exactly the same you can still have the data tier abstracted appropriately loosely coupled of those things and be able to have have it wherever you need it in whatever okay so if your application layer is kind of heterogeneous with different applications and services running in different clouds that the data tier doesn't care right or matter from that like I'm here I am available let's do whatever we need to do right and because of that core cassandra construct of the data centers in racks in terms of describing the topology you know we've always said it could be a literal data center it could be a data center in a different cloud provider and right can have multiple data centers that represent multiple AWS regions or additionally different what do they call what does insure column regions yeah it's a good question I think naming actually even changed one this yeah so they flipped it around but I think it's region and zone zone in region I have to look that up yes what documentation I doubt myself but again back to the naming and terminology conventions between these different ones and why we want infrastructure is code yep exactly so cool that's that's the that's the big three that keep coming up time and time again whenever I'm looking at any type of multi-cloud networking okay talking any to any customers or people that are looking at moving into a multi cloud environment those three things always come up so as and I often say these are your three things that as a baseline you need to get to this point before you move into a multi cloud situation I got you okay so me I'm gonna commit yeah I want it I want to be opinionated like on the spot here like what what are your what is your tool selection of choice you said we need infrastructure as code he say we need to hack things like what would you do at Adrienne's world we happen Adrienne's world my first go-to items are terraform and kubernetes okay boom and like right now I can go out to a repo that I have on github and I might have to tweak something just because you know the connection strings and and keys and such aren't going to be the exact same because I always have new accounts to connect to and such but for the most part the terraform configs that I've written out will deploy kubernetes into an environment and then I'm set up and ready to go get my data stack stuff out there and I have the appropriate prereqs met to go multi-cloud okay so that that'll get you started yep okay so you solve some more explaining to do which will leave for maybe a future time or maybe a blog entry or for yeah blogs videos we do it all all the stuff so thank you thank you thanks for sharing the wisdom more goodness to come on future episodes of the distributed data show Thanks thank you for joining us
