    "text": "no that's what I said welcome to the C sharp hour as things come apart today's episode coding session what do you want to call this is gonna be different a little bit different we're gonna get into the code here in just a second but I'm gonna give you an idea of what I am about to do so if you followed over the last couple of sessions it has been how should I put it rough there's been a few things that just don't want to work and the fact that they don't want to work you know as you can see here here's our big project five different projects it's grown our projects have grown the overall solution has grown and certain things don't want to work namely starting docker containers and bringing them down for integration tests is how should I put it somewhat error-prone the way I've been doing it emphasis on that the way I've been doing it I've been using X unit which is used for unit testing not particularly integration testing in the way that I was trying to use it if anything I needed to build a test harness or something to really go to that expansive of a level around testing but then I stopped I backed up okay and this is where I came to a conclusion a pretty heavy conclusion where are my concerns within this tool this is a schema migration tool what am I doing with it I that is that is like the core of what I needed to ask myself I need to ask myself what in the world is the actual responsibility of this tool I came to an answer the purpose of the tool is to provide a way to do schema migrations that is the key to it all that's its purpose it's not supposed to verify that it has a database it's not supposed to verify that it can spin up docker or not that has nothing to do with what the tools should be doing the tools purpose is to do migrations against Apache Cassandra data stacks Enterprise so why am i building a test harness why did I think it was a good idea to build a test harness that would be so expansive as to require the startup and shutdown of all those systems sure it seemed like the easy way to test against Apache Cassandra but it hit me I should write this with the assumption that anybody running it is going to have a cluster is gonna have a development environment with a cluster running somewhere so I should assume that that does they're already not assume that I have to do all of the spin up and shutdown for the entire project some configuration should safely be assumed within the project and within the command-line interface tool itself so what I'm gonna do today is I'm gonna at least begin if not finish out write a refactor which will include ripping out the docker code ripping out all of all of that piece and refocusing it around the assumption that we have a cluster at an IP address and that is a safe assumption right we'll add that to the readme that that is a requirement a prerequisite for this and then we'll move forward with the further development of the casma or a kasi cassandra schema migration tool at a later time but right now I'm about to rip out the innards of all that stuff so are you ready for that here we go all right first things first let's get an appropriate view here boom get back into the IDE but and then get this stuff going here I just clicked on all sorts of stuff that I want to do I opened up and oh I opened up a word editor sorry alright so in here I'm gonna actually let's hear take I don't want to do that actually take this it's here I'm in this go check my remote and then I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna do a git clone get at github comm Adrian Kassie schema migrator and then I'm gonna name it kasi refactor I'm gonna close that I'm gonna go open that project so that way I don't know nuke all of my stuff that I'm doing here [Music] okay it is gonna be great so okay docker for tests docker cruft so first things first here we'll just delete this just gonna completely nuke it how do i how do i how do i do that in this editor do i go here aha delete is in edit there we go remove that project docker examples we're gonna remove that project edit delete we already got tons of squigglies alright so here test helpers this brings up our filesystem stuff which i do want to do the integration test against that because that's what builds out the assumption of our standard schema etc so i'm gonna take this out of here and then where do we have tests around this all right cool so it looks like I may be closer to done doing this than I thought so let's just let's do well I don't want to I'm not gonna delete this outright yes I am dr. Croft that's gonna put the key space in somewhere but yeah okay we're gonna nuke it we're gonna nuke it for now because I need to rethink the test I just I do here we go and then so we don't have any squiggly lines let's actually let's run that huh why why is system threading in there I don't even know why that's how output helper doesn't look used so I'm gonna alt enter to remove and and access fields it looks okay this this doesn't need to be here I don't think does it else we got here so destination database is that IP dad looks like looks like we might be good here so let's do this let's let's run all these tests see where we get with that stuff all right there we go and then I'm all just say could not be found docker for tests correct that wouldn't that wouldn't be found so what are you trying to do are you trying to build too much so that's another thing quit in this what is going on to the right so where is that extractions it's going to what is this fussing about sure make it give me a hard time about my names here it's a safe impasse split variable declaration initialization really I should do that yeah I don't yeah let's do that all right so this is just where is this home a dream code it's Cassie refactor it's all that junk still in there is that what the problem is here we go let's let's do this delete that and delete this out of the directory now let's try to build right why Oh area so we don't need this why is that why did that not get removed that is strange okay there we go now let's try itself always gives me a weird feeling what I have to go into a configuration file and actually remove some XML it looks like we're making progress hello Zink is that right let's say that right this is zinc yeah so I'm going with welcome to the stream doing a little c-sharp refactoring here destination database okay this this would be this would be broken this is a true failure that we expect because now let's actually assume that our database is at 127.0.0.1 ie ah cool it's not really pronounceable so many consonants okay let's do what is what is the command I believe it is a service Cassandra start let's see if that's what it is get the secret password stuff so then service Cassandra stopped right like I do it for each one okay so that's good then get it in here since we're assuming that that is at that point now if theoretically should be able to get in there and get this verified right so let's go look at our function to see how we do this make sure we didn't do some weird setup beforehand let's go my go-to declaration yeah connection is false so this is inserting into on this assumes this assumes that I've used destination database to create the database with casma inception so first off let's look at our database it's an Apache Cassandra database run in a single node which is not very distributed database like but for development it's it's fine in this scenario so we're at 127.0.0.1 or we are at localhost so let's go with that test connection and suspense looks good alright so we got that let's run the test again whoops not Cassie console let's fix this stuff default Oh nuts working ok so anyway there's there's the console but we don't learn the console we want to run all tests there we go all right yeah magic happenin ok what does this say list cast my history already exists oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's go into our tests here actually let's go into our core Lib destination database the creation of this object should build out the database if it's not already built which is regular casma inception create key space if not exists create table if not exists there we go alright so that that should I should do it and not break Oh my destination is it's false true so we get an error but we did get a false back so it's your verified database assert false oh no this should be true start true that's what that should read because let's let's go in here and refresh that I'm going to make another connection because the tool is a little funny localhost but then our key space is going to be casma history I believe there we go if we look in here there's our customer history our history table and has Conn validate and validated so yeah that test should actually be working let's do this again ran it failed expected false no okay didn't build didn't build yet then build that faster ah success finally okay whoo that's what I've needed for this thing so I feel like we're already moving on it's it's so much easier when the database is just the known 127.0.0.1 setup now I need to change that where we could just point it at whatever hmm I wonder if there's a way to set up some configuration for tests yeah we'll leave it at 127.0.0.1 for now I do want to go in though and add in the readme I do I've made the assumption for the time being that catchy cassandra is installed and available single single node or a full cluster at 127.0.0.1 with that installed all tests should pass or development purposes however it would be good to change this so the value is derived a configuration setting so the database a database and be set up anywhere there we go okay details edit to read me so in this it's updated perfect let's run the test again see if we get a new a new field suasion that start I feel like that should have written at 2120 so it's a minute later if I run the test it's this overriding am i absurd I think I may be upsetting is that what I intended to do insert into the history table step details stamp success con value verifying the database cluster timestamp now equals true and on that table why is this like this casing oh I think I am planning to do that that way then yeah because here I do the create table if blah blah blah and the primary key is what did I not did i not set a primary key stamp time step step a step tax primary key I feel like it should be stepped details and stamp yeah actually let's do it let's do all that would steer consul data stores table oh no I want to I want to update the table yeah exit ok there we go so edit database tools where's the Oh modify commit nope no I just want to modify table right there in front of me okay so keys let's get rid of this one okay let's add another one and then let's add okay we'll step details stamp and that should be enough but I'm gonna add success to there we go yeah why is it not let me do this okay let's just create a new one will do table table do his hist right now and then we'll do step text and then we'll do right key and details that's gonna be primary key - oh forget it stamp timestamp when in doubt just write the code of boolean okay Fuli i guess i have to do it this way if i when i use the primary key bit well whatever and it's let's do it the right way all right step text whoops damn it step text there we go [Music] details text stamp time stamp and then success boolean so if I do that it just adds primary key to it so I don't want to do that but I want to do a key this would be primary key and then when I add columns so I have stamp step not stamped details stamp and success whoops modified table let's change the table name well now all right how do i I want to generate this now so see the scripts yeah there we go okay this is what I want and then key will do create table there we go all right so let's let's take a look at what we got here so that's what we want but I'm gonna add a partition key here on let's actually do it on success well what did I do open up too much success oh and then change the table name to history all right let's see if that'll write it so running the tests but use a key space oh do I need to do I do need to do that don't know all right where's my stuff so before this creaky space this one so I need to put use excuse key space that wait so this is back to in the fall sometimes airline 1:19 mismatched create expecting Oh create here whoa what is even going on here oh no that's right so I use custom history create table better the history see about that one and use casma history it's how do you do it's not where I wanted oh do I need a maybe I need a quote it use casma history how do I No well Dern it yeah casma history should just work oh I can't issue it in the damn query what I need to do is this that's okay run and and then let's do a private boolean run kasi query script so the thing is it with the driver you can't actually run the use command you have to you can do that in a sequel something that's just sending the cql you could technically send it but the driver role you need to set that in the driver instead so we're going to do is set string command we'll do string key space space like that actually we'll just we'll do this we're gonna add like so cluster executed super solid cluster connect that's what a cluster dot keyspace whoa that's a hell of a coming it creates a new session on this cluster and sets it to the default view nobody created this session will be set to it name of the default speed states can be specified in the okay whatever I want to do that I just want to do let's do this dot add like I need to do it after the fact so if key space it's not is string is null or so it's not not null or empty actually not it's always gonna be something I think so it's the dollar empty is in a white space yeah let's do that okay then do this stuff okay so clustered then that's where there's a freaking key spacer configuration and at key space Oh connect two simple pieces okay ah gotcha let's do this that bar session equals dated staff wait Cassandra C Connect session saundra session ah what is it so connect returns what Oh anion so I session session there we go so here that session equals cluster connect key space oops else session equals clustered I connect nothing let's just say do mood decoration clothes you're used to put to use oh yeah let's put into using statement using oh no let's not do that let's do this yeah that's almost not more readable what whatever okay that's gonna give the session based on that success is this let's see what this does Oh Bowl success true ah I got you okay so I'm this what place expression be true yeah that makes sense because if it gets caught you're gonna get exited here you're to throw not do the other thing so let's just say move put into using saving join decoration assignment what does that mean doing oh snap that's cleaner okay let's see what I did there that pulled the interface declaration here so basically the declaration is within the decision tree structure there so it's clustered I connect and if key space exists then you do a key space otherwise you do it would connect I almost feel like I could remove this if is null or empty do ya do it this way otherwise you're doing it this way yeah okay that removed one character made it a little bit more logical so feel like that needs to be on different lines but hey moving forward moving forward let's run that and see where we get what oh there is no argument given that corresponds oh oh I need to add this whoops so we'll just do no I could pass no I wonder if I could make the variable how do you make a nullable very parameter swear the last time I use c-sharp a lot that was like the new thing but I'm gonna you know actually I'm gonna make it a string dot empty I don't know if that's a really great idea either but string that empty no I'm gonna make it no no is more understood really across languages and such all right so no no where's this other one other refactor all right connection string oops not like that actually way to say insert into Casman history history now the key should be actually this should be the key space so here let's do this let's do public-key space equals this thing let's string there we go key space let's make it a name to be face yeah and then rename actually yeah let's do that you face equals oh no we don't want to do that we're to pass it per thing shoot how do we determine if we need it versus we don't need it yeah I'm gonna leave with that logic for now actually let's call it this let's keyspace call it casma history oh no we don't need this because we are passing it a dad burn it hey thanks for the father government the follow got Navin banana govern a banana like it I like it it's good stuff alright so shoot so I'm here we need to do this key space is the well we'll do the past end key space right so here in this though we'll want to have the key space and it's past in here so basically boolean yes okey okey space create his and then oops gasma history so the inserts just select and insert so let's do this it looks like it should be yeah we should never mind ah let's see Republic string Casman history key space gasma history equals this okay we're getting there I'm just having a moment here we go so get rid of this there we go there we go there we got one here I just realized it's really cool that the bill that caught that so it actually has insight into the cql statements that is super badass loving it having my c-sharp editor be aware of the actual CQ l Cassandra query language stuff is amazing and that worked so oh yeah woohoo I'm stoked totally stoked but then what am i doing that's always the question right alright so we got those tests refactored we got the docker stuff yanked out of there the assumption of having a Cassandra node at 127.0.0.1 has been built into the thing now so really we're ready to basically start our roll forward rollback of the schema migrations all right so what's your all right I may keep that out of that out here oh that's what I want I wanted to look at this - Sookie space is table name well not table name come on refresh it here we go history should have that and then if I run it again how am i upsetting over that that's weird that's from two minutes ago it's not even over writing the stamp now insert into here step details stamp success I don't think I need that ain't do anything with anyways okay now let's see here what what in the world what in the world is going on here what am i doing with that that's causing what is causing the absurd something is upsetting and running again what is this an already it already exists that's correct it looks like is this something thirteen a verified destination address oh let's see if I can do this run it forty nine so that's that's updated I have no error oh okay so if I'm running it again though right it already exists which means in here I was my create create table history Oh create table I goofed it up because I took out the if not exists that needs to be in there because I don't need to recreate it if it's already created and it shut an error out it should use the key space to create it if it doesn't exist if it does exist I eat if not exist it should just skip over that and continue onward so now if I run I should get no error here looks good so far yeah all right so got to test working got multiple Conville dates and finishes so the last validated would be at 2150 45 at 353 milliseconds so that's good I am I'm gonna call it so we just did a big refactor got rid of a whole bunch of stuff namely we got rid of the docker elements so you can use docker and I'm gonna change it to where it'll pick up based off a configuration IP speaking of yeah that'll be next next session so let's put that on there okay back out here to the github for our project a new issue bug report fix tests so cluster is deprived um configures from configure figuration based IP so the IP for tests or whatever the CLI is running against should be derived from a configuration setting and not statically used via a via magic string variable and the tests okay so that should work fix that that's gonna be pretty high for already one let's get another label in here call one cop choice top tasks and let's create it it's gonna color in here oh yeah something that really makes it pop come on didn't you use to be able to pick these colors okay yep I'm gonna go with that description the top tasks to finish max requirements for next things to the next tasks to left ie priority so that one that I just added face this one let's do this labels bug pants meant good first issue Help Wanted top tasks alright there we go oh yeah I get that MVP out there geez I think we got a lot of MVP stuff design catch me like that okay that's not party refactor maybe we actually need to do this patient need to do that to determine outputs for Mac OS that's gonna be a new high priority one alright alright we almost have the CQL executing but that is we are where we are now oh and the build plants good so let's let's go ahead and where we add there we are get that code pushed up there terminal get status oh and let's stop Cassandra don't need that baby running right now good status get and all that and oops give you all my actual desktop here git commit did it uh refactored removing docker dependencies get push all right so that's up there we are you're up and running things are moving forward and looks like let's hear our builds rollin let's go take a look waiting for an available agent tick tock tick tock tick tock no there we go okay we're rolling forward that looks good so next session will be fixing at IP getting into the configuration getting a bunch of additional things figured out too and let's see wait what's up governor banana I saw this channel by accident cool to see you guys occasionally you streaming it gives some insights it's very nice idea thanks I appreciate it do follow we will be back on a regular basis I do the c-sharp our I attempt to do the C sharp our every Wednesday at 2 p.m. oh you know like clockwork yeah but uh yeah so we got this going on bunch other stuff Python c-sharp nodejs JavaScript I know we got some Java coming I have some Java coming so that's gonna be super cool and I'll primarily focused around of course you know Apache Cassandra data stacks Enterprise doing graph store stuff things like that so a lot of good material a lot of good stuff we're digging through and showing people how to implement and we are always open for input so if you have any ideas any thoughts any notions of what else we should add to the channel let us know we're totally happy to add to it and we're hoping to expand on the whole thing and really really drive home even more solid content and just have a lot of good hacking sessions and each member of the team also is looking to dig into coding sessions on Twitch such as myself at Adrian hall David Gilardi Christina all team well we're all looking at doing more and more of it and especially doing some of it here on like a central streaming channel like this so keep your eyes peeled thanks for the follow and I will catch you next time have a good one [Music] you",
