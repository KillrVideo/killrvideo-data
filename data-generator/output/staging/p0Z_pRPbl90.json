    "text": "foreign [Music] [Music] thank you foreign thank you good morning everyone um I'm yoshikimoto a data Arctic from datastacks um I'll be presenting today about what's new in Apache Cassandra 4.0 um so 4.0 came out in July and there's some enhancements and changes that have happened in it and I'll be explaining about those um though to be about the new things that have been introduced okay so we'll take a look back into a bit of a history for particular Sandra so Cassandra was born like over a decade ago and it was it graduated the Apache foundations incubation stage in 2010 and after that the versions have been upgraded all along until this year's 4.0 um in 2013 we had um concerning 2.0 come out now for a couple of years in 2015 we have 3.0 and then after a couple of years um we have three point that burn which was the latest before 4.0 came up um over these years there had been a lot of enhancements there um where I put them on the screen so you can see like in 2.0 we had um enhancement in cql we've implemented the lightweight transactions um role-based Access Control uh use the different types and all that sort of thing 3.0 um there was a massive rewrite of um storage engine um we also introduced the time window compaction strategy which was an enhancement over the um the date [Music] the compaction strategy that was sort of oriented for the time series kind of data and the hints were also implemented for file based implementation and before that we implemented as tables but then um those were sort of causing some challenges so we've moved on to Firebase hints and that came in three point three point x series and we also had the materialized views coming in so there was a lot of enhancements there and the last version of 2010 well 2017 was when 3.11 was introduced and 4.0 came after four years so that was quite a long time um actually the new features were freezed in 2018 [Music] and the release of 4.0 after the feature free feature freeze is 2021. so there was a long time after the feature was freezed until actually the actual release of Cassandra um which sort of suggests that there was a lot of testing going on a lot of fixes introduced and it came out in July this year after that the latest version right now is 4.0.1 which is which was released in September um like uh like a month ago right so so that's the latest State we are in um if you want to look at the um well if you're looking at updating there's um the instructions there in news.text file if you download the Cassandra Source I mean I mean the deployments and um also when you're thinking about upgrades you would be able to upgrade from 3.0 and Beyond um those on the two point x versions will not be a string um for the upgrade I mean straight upgrade you'd have to have steps going through three three um and then to four so as I said there was a lot of um enhancements and fixes so um there's more number of tickets 61 more than the original Three um number of tickets that were submitted for three um and also there was um 140 percent more fixes um built into Cassandra 4. so this sort of suggests that we have tested massively to make it stable um we have this pipeline of doing the tests for Sandra and we we sort of invested there very much into making all the signals turn green for release meaning that we don't see a test failure so um that was the main focus for it and focusing to make it available so that you could put into put it into production from the get-go right so that was the main goal so after the release the older versions the two point x versions are um not officially supported by the community right now um 3.0.25 is the latest release of the 3.0 series and 3.11.11 is the latest for the 3.11 series um those two are the ones that are the supported versions of the older versions and um 3.0 will be supported until 4.1 is released which is which we sort of think is going to be around um April next year um and that's the sort of cadence that we want to be sort of like release like point point x series series and ERD cables kind of thing okay so that's the current state um so the main topic that we're going to talk about today is what's new so there's a whole list of things um there's the whole slew of tickets that we've went through um but the things that I would talk about today are one of the main several of the main things that we've introduced so one of them is virtual tables another of them is enhancement in the logging features um and then there's the string facility that has been enhanced as well um there's some functionality of back pressure which is introduced a while back and also in the other versions of Cassandra as well um and then there's some experimental experimental features that are sort of interesting and some other minor changes as well that I'll introduce in the end okay so virtual tables so what does that mean basically it means this Java management extension kind of interfaces with the database um so traditionally or the way that we interacted with the database in terms of metrics and all that kind of thing and maybe controls were through this jmx interface and then there we had sort of like command line two that would talk through the JMS which is called No tool and we used to do that to look at this metrics look at the status do some building with the running instances and all that um and also looking at the settings as well um looking at the settings was also most part of scanning the configuration files as well so that was the way that we used to do it but with the introduction of virtual tables where you might might find things similar in other databases where you have like a table that you could query for the various informations that you need to look into the database for um basically at this point in time it's the tables are read only um from the operation management perspective um and there is not that abundance of metrics and things that you could see um but we are working on it um the intention is to expand this so um You probably see more things coming in um as we go so nothing about is that we could select from a table right so we could there's like um several types of tables that you look into like information about the cash information about thread pools information about the connecting clients um the tasks that are run on Master Stables also the configuration settings and also um virtual tables that provide information about the key pieces the tables and called information so you could select the virtual tables to look into those informations for example if you select from The Virtuous the system virtual schema um key spaces um I mean the tables table in the system virtual schema key space uh you could list all the tables and and that in this database thing is that the virtual tables are basically it's not a cluster-wide kind of table it's per node so the information there is basically what you see as the node over there so um so that's that so whichever node you're in and you connect to the SQL show and do the the select you will see the information for that node um you could get information about client connectivities who's accessing with one from where kind of information and also you could look at like this configuration settings information the current um live configurations okay so um so these are the virtual tables as I said it's read-only um you can't update the configs using the virtual tables um but there is an intention to do that sort of thing if possible so um there's a list of things that you might want to look into from this URL if you're interested so um rather than doing interacting through jmx um interacting with virtual tables will be a bit super and easy to access so the next thing we're going to talk about is enhancement in the logging feature so the logging has been enhanced quite a bit where we could log information about um what's happening in the database as well as log information about the request itself I mean the queries itself um so there's um there's these two um login features one of them is the audit logging and the other is the query login and then they have the interfaces for um extending where to log the information So currently the implementation as an implementation we have um writing it out into files and either in a text format or binding format yeah so for audit login basically this is oriented towards [Music] um compliance for workloads so you want to understand who's accessing or who's doing what on which objects when type of things so these kind of um features would be required when there's some compliance um kind of policies in place um you specify what you would learn to log about and there's various levels or categories of what you would want to log and also it will take information of Google which which path those kind of access has come from so basically what it does is it will log the requests where I wrote queries but basically it's the requests and also about the authentication authentication um going on the timing of log will be um when well after executing in SQL SQL statement or Aussie or doing an Authentication um and before sending the response um as I said there's um there's a plugable logo layer where um which is which provides an interface for implementing implementing various types of um ways to publish the audit events um so as I said there's the binary log type and there's the other feature that uses TalkBack so setting the audit basically you would use settings in Cassandra ammo file um you would either enable true or false and there's various um Properties or attributes that you could set like the key spaces that you want to look for the categories like whether it's the authentication or whether it's like dmls or ddls those kind of things so basically you use the Cassandra yaml file to accept those um you can also use the node tool to enable disable on fly um which basically means that it's it's a live config meaning that it won't persist over reboot so um if you need to do that you need to do it with the Cassandra Yamaha um to view the logs for the binary types you would use the audit log viewer and specify the file for that okay so the other logging feature we have is the full query logging feature basically what it does is that it will lock all of the cql interactions um and you would capture that and you could use that to um reproduce what happened exactly so you would capture that and you could replay those so you can use the Note 2 to do that no to enable full query log or disable it or you could reset it using no tool um and then there's the SQL 2 on the through query logging tool to replay it or compare it with [Music] several versions of it or dump the contents of it so you could use this feature for for debugging migrations and testing um or collect of what has happened on the Node to understand what kind of queries or what kind of requests are coming in maybe sort of Behavioral understanding kind of analysis may be done on those as well of course you could use it to replay or reproduce some things that has happened nice thing about this is that well usually when you think about logging it does ins in certain cases we find that it may impact performance because it sort of um looks into the Cannabis path but um we're using the chronicle queue of open hft to um alleviate that kind of load so that there's basically almost unnoticeable load even when doing these kind of logs so um by the request login feature you um you could leverage them for the auditing facilities and of course doing the testings as well okay now next is about faster streaming so this is more about how you would stream data among the nodes it's a feature where which which happens when your bootstrapping for example and you would have to pass on data to from one node to the other the usual way what happens is is what we call as a stable streaming so um when a certain nodes has a request that he needs the no needs a certain range of tokens or the partitions for a certain range of tokens it will request it um the node that has that will prepare those ranges read off from there's a stable prepare that packet and push it over to the node that requested it and then it's decomposed there um so it decompresses it deserializes it updates the states and then serializes again and then push it into that disk that's a stable file so um what happens is that there's a if you look into the if you think about the kernel it's like you have things going into the reader from the user space into the kernel space putting it onto the network goes from picks it up from Network puts it back into the user space so there's a lot of same data copying between the within the kernel itself so um what we want to do is that sort of remove that kind of copying so that's why we call it the zero copy streaming so what happens is that okay give me um this range of partitions when this request comes in what we do is that okay so this table has that range we're just going to send over that as a stable just copy it over so that's it we're just copying the file rather than stream I mean serializing the serializing and all doing all that kind of decompressing and all that kind of thing so this brings down um I mean brings up the speed uh brings down the pressure um on the pipeline between the the nodes um it's enabled by default but you could turn it off um the caveat is that it's it's it works for level Compact and strategy three so that's one thing you have to have in mind but I think it's that it will bring down bootstrap time um drastically um and also it reduces GC pressure so next up is client back pressure so this is about [Music] um the introduction of the back pressure mechanism in Cassandra so actually there's a blog post when you go to the Apache Cassandra website um you could read it in detail but I'm going to talk about it right here um for those interests so the thing is that for each client that connects to a Cassandra node well basically you'll be connecting to the node and that node with the assets as a coordinator right so for each client they would have a Neti Channel um that will connect to an event Loop thread and so the event Loop set will read off of the new channel and push the requests into an inbound queue and which is then rid off at the node to be processed and once it's processed and the response is created it is pushed back into the outbound event Loop which is then read back by the event Loop that was um that put in the request into the inbound queue so for each event Loop that is happening in the coordinator node there's a separate um outbound cues right think about the inbound queue is that it's doesn't have a different size so it could grow indefinitely right so so the challenge was that when there's a lot of incoming requests so there's a lot going on in the event Loop and pushing it on to the inbound queue and from the inbound view in from Q it's red off and then processed but if the processing lags um the inbound inbound queue would be growing and the event queue well the event Loop will keep on trying to push in the the request but while doing that the outbound Q is being filled up with the responses but because the event Loop that is accepting the request and pushing it into the inbound queue is busy doing that the the rest for the outbound from the outbound queue to respond to the clients we blocked right so there's a bucket happening there and then because it's blocked um and the outbound queue is growing indefinitely eventually um you will be in and out of memory situation so that is was sort of a challenge that we had been having so the solution was to provide a sort of a back pressure mechanism so sort of we wanted to buy make a Bound for the cues right so um that's what we are going to set here using this um configuration parameter so by doing that the the queue will have a certain size and if that size is reached um it will stop reading from the uh kernel socket inbound buffer which will automatically well it sort of back pressures the back pressure will be felt at the client side as well so the client side will need to deal with that that pressure so that's the mechanism to not break the node so in this case this is we're we're specifying the throw on overload parameter as false meaning that basically it's it's just going to push back uh when we set the throw on overload to um true what happens is that it will it will send back an exception so in that sense um the client side would have to grisly handle that exception so depending on how you would want to handle that um there's two things that you would want to set well well there's two ways to set it through one overload whether it's true or false so basically by doing that um so you would it's a sort of a throttling mechanism to keep the node healthy and add a keep you know being able to respond with a steady vacancy rather than going increasing latency so this provides you um sort of a stable latency mechanism of course you would need to handle um the back pressure on the client side and think about how would you how you would handle that okay so this does help in um slowing down sort of noisy clients or the ones that are bursting and keep the nodes healthy um if the clients are good enough and clients could scale sideways for example um or you could have the nodes be scaled in a nice manner then you could keep a certain Peak rate in a controlled manner okay so um this is one of those mechanisms that will also introduce 4.0 about this there's also the same and the older versions of Cassandra as well so on to some of the experimental features so talking about performance there's there are various enhancements that are made um um to make the performance better for Cassandra including which we've already talked about the zero copy streaming but there's also enhancements in the standard protocol itself and also about um requires gossip level things as well but one of the um notable things that we are seeing and we we want to look into the future of even more better things is the use of the new features in the new Java versions so we we've made it possible to um 11. So currently you can compile in Java 11 and run it in Japan environments which means that you could use some of the features in Java level also we are experimenting with chapter 17 as well um so shenando and the GC functionalities which brings down which is which is aiming to bring down the GC pressure or sort of virtually eliminate um GCS is something that we seeing um try some promise so there's several tests that have been done um where we are seeing promises right how fast we could allocate how much request you could handle per second because of the lower GC pressures getting better throughput um the average and I mean p 1990 or 99 latencies are much better if you think of shenando and also [Music] um the DC so these are the graphs that were done using um the beta versions of 4.0 where detail agencies like the p99s and p999s um massively lower compared to um the CMS versions of the same version of even for the same version of Cassandra like we have the decide this key value workload the right side is time series will code um and then there's another one for tabular workloads um yeah so there's a lot going on um well this is we see promises there and we would love to hear more testing use cases how things went and that kind of thing so yeah we would love to hear people testing it um on shenando or the GC another functionality that's also in the experimental mode is the transient transient replication so this is also an interesting feature that was developed by Apple [Music] um so it sort of provides you with a way to have a temporary replica um and um which is replicated to the actual replica um using incremental repairs so how this works is is what I'm going to display now um so in the normal way of thinking is that when you have a replication factor of three the right request will go to the free the destination nodes and when you read with a consistent consistency level of quorum basically what is expected is that you would be able to read what you have written so providing with you with the confidence of the [Music] the consistency so in the case of transcendent record you would specify um the a replica other than the the the main replicas that you're going to have so if you have a replication factor of three you could specify that okay there's going to be three nodes that will be receiving the replicas but we also going to designate a separate node to be a transient transient holder of another replica by doing that what happens is that if the actual this nation replica is down um rather than holding a pile of hints to write to the transient very quickly and you could read from the transient metric as well as long as it holds there it holds the replica there and during the incremental repair the transit transient replica will be um well if the actual destination node is back up um the transmit replica will be um replicated to the original replica and then removed after that so this provides you sort of a way and helping um when those are down or reducing them the load on about the hints and so the way you would specify is um well you specify sort of like a portion ish kind of specification so three slash one means that you're going to have the three replicas but one transient replica as well okay other enhancements and changes there's a whole list of it but some of the notable ones um I've already talked about this we have support for Java 11 still experimental um but this there's a Blog on the Cassandra apachio org site where [Music] it's a documentation that explains how you would want to comply compile Java 11 and if I'm running in chapter 11 means that you would run it in Java 11. it will not run in Japan um of course and there's other [Music] um enhancements as well as I said for performance um enhancements the messaging streaming um the async features have been introduced also there has been removal of deprecated features like the thrift feature and also the compact storage feature that's aligned with it um we also have a feature that would restrict accesses on a roll to a certain data center so if you want to restrict a certain role to access only a certain data center you could do that there's also a bit of an enhancement in CC change data capture feature um well um and also changes in the read repair so there's been sort of like a um advice that you wouldn't want to really amuse the read repair chances so that has been removed um and also um we've also have a feature that would be able to turn off blocking weed repairs as well um we also added some functionality in the node tool repair feature which provides you with the preview and the value date so preview value data are similar things but basically what it does is that it to do a simulation of repair meaning that it will create a Mercury and compare it and see how much work is going to happen and what is going to happen or actually compare the the validate is more about comparing the market reasons see whether it's whether the repair has actually repaired things so that's something um an SS tablet up has been enhanced so that you could grab Json output of uh on a per partition based dump and also we've added a network network topology strategy um verification Factor expression feature that would automatically um be expanded to all the available DCs some of the [Music] features in the secure language itself have been added like support for functions like current timestamp current day current time current time uuid I've been added so there is arithmetic operations that could be done in the statements like like like minus two hours or plus two days kind of arithmetic things also um adding the use of simple operators within a SQL statement like all the operator signs we also have a support for Python 3 or SQL show so now we support both Python 2.71 and 3.6 and actually um there's a lot more Deep dive in the new features we have this site in in data Stacks where you could actually read more deeper into it if you look at the bottom right of the slide it says appropriate approximately three hours so um what I've done is condensed this into like 45 minute talk but um this if you want to go deeper there's a three hours worth of reading and actually Hands-On parts of it as well so if you're interested in learning more about the actualities of what's been introduced in 4.0 and maybe also about thinking about how I'm how am I going to upgrade my Cassandra clusters so those informations can be found um in these learning series that we have created okay um so 4.0 was a lot about enhancements and fixes so that you could run it in production from 4.0 in the past people you say that maybe we could wait for like several patch versions until we actually put it into production but we know now that people are running 4.0 in production so um say it's good for production um um so we'll be happy if you download and start using the other things Beyond 4.0 because 4.0 is out now we are looking into more new things so there's a lot of things being discussed in the Cassandra community and one of the things as a process we've evolved in the past three four years is the enhancement proposal procedure So currently there's a procedure where um there's a way you would be able to submit a proposal and feature enhancements and you sort of document what you are going to propose like this is the objective this is what we have to do this is the things that we have considered and this is the path we want to do so there's a lot of that going on and currently um the latest list we have is this one um there was there were while 4.0 was still in testing phases [Music] um we didn't have [Music] adopted ones yet but now over several votings there are several CVS that have been accepted um and probably the interesting ones will be the accessing through movement as well as the general purpose transactions which have had a whole lot of discussion on the Cassandra Dev mailing list and it is a very very very very interesting reading if you go through the um emails exchanged and also if you look into the proposal and also there's a company paper for it and it is very interesting so um we are looking forward to what this brings in the future um and yeah so the adult ones are there on others that are on the discussion so um there's a session in the afternoon about having Apache run on the kubernetes environment so there's a CP that are aimed towards those use cases like about the kubernetes operator um there's also the [Music] I think there was the sidecar one as well and others that will be coming um also there's another one called the storage attack index which is another implementation of a secondary index which is having um rather than having a secondary index as a sort of a lookout table having an index file accompanying the sustainable file so which does bring a lot of [Music] um this pressure on GC um and better storage use and there's a lot of others in draft still and in the dev mailing list there's some people looking to submit other CP so um we are looking forward to that and looking to even more new interesting features that will make things even better um yeah so calling out to the community we hope you would download Cassandra 4.0 or 4.0.1 now um and try it out Okay so that is all from me thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you thank you thank you thank you [Music] [Music] thank you foreign foreign foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] thank you foreign thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign hi everyone my name is Paul bredner I'm the technology evangelist at insta cluster I'm giving this presentation from my office in in Canberra at home so thanks for the invite to talk today I hope the um talk fits in with the the rest of the content that was a great introduction to Cassandra 4.0 I just listened to thanks to Yoshi for that that was very interesting so mine's a slightly different talk I'm talking about massively scalable real-time geospatial data processing primarily with Apache Cassandra is the focus so I mentioned I'm the technology the Evangelist at instacluster that sort of means I get to play with lots of interesting new open source Technologies I um I build new example applications using them while I'm learning I blog about them and occasionally I get to give a talk so it's good to actually be presenting to a live audience in this case I've done a lot of virtual conferences in the last um last two years and this one's actually live Which is far more exciting so so yeah there's a whole lot of Technologies I've talked about most in the Apache ones there are some other open source Technologies like Prometheus the busian um open search reddits and things as well and they're all available on instagramcluster.com Paul bradner I think I'm up to about 73 blogs there so I've been doing that for four years um it's a bit of an ongoing process there's always more to learn just a bit about insta cluster we have a managed platform for open source Technologies it's a complete ecosystem to support Mission and critical open source Big Data applications for multiple use cases everything from gaming through to um sort of iot for storage we have Cassandra Radisson postgresql which is only a recent Edition streaming we have Kafka and Kafka connect for analysis we have Apache spark and to search for open search and Cabana um and we provide that as a managed service we do Consulting and lots of Education around these Technologies as well and I guess one of the features is it's multi-cloud so we support this on lots of different Cloud platforms all around the world uh so this talk is focusing specifically on Apache Cassandra with some help from Apache Kafka as well so here's a bit of an overview in the last few years we're going to have a look at location in the news um the particular use case I'm focusing on is anonymity detection and we'll have a look at the how the application was built and some baselines throughput data we got for that we'll have a look at the spatial and non-only detection problem which is a bit of a variant on the original one this was sort of an extension I did over a course of a month last year and have a look and then at some solutions primarily focusing around how Cassandra solves some of those problems how you represent location and then how you query and index location data in Cassandra and surprisingly there's actually quite a lot of different options which is um why I had to have a bit of a journey through those and test some of them out and see which ones actually work best so there's things like bounding boxes secondary indexes Geo hashes Lucian index and then we'll compare some performance results and then extend it again for 3D as well in the news in the last few years you may have heard of John Conway he was a bit of a legendary computer scientist he passed away last year I think it was and he's quite famous for a number of things but the one I remember him for is The Game of Life which is a cellular automata um the next state of each cell depends only on the state of the immediate neighbors so that's got a very specific location aspect to it um it's got very simple rules but you can end up with some amazingly complex patterns uh that's a particularly astonishing one that I found also in the news unfortunately in the last couple years we've all been social distancing and been trying to have covid-19 tracing that actually works um here is something that I discovered on a New Zealand YouTube channel Uncle Ron's social distancing 3000 invention I actually think that was probably a very sensible approach for social distancing given that the um some of the apps that they tried including the Australian government covered Safe app that really didn't do what they were advertised for unfortunately also in the news we had a bit of a near miservently um there was an asteroid that missed the Earth in April last year and it actually came inside the the um the moon's orbit I think that was a bit of a nearness um so previously I presented a talk at Apache con a couple years ago now both in the US and in Berlin on the main application that we built um this was Kafka Cassandra and kubernetes at scale real-time anonymiction on 19 billion events a day so it was a pretty big number we sort of made it into a bit of a news story um 19 billion anonymously checks a day using a whole bunch of Open Source Technologies so the proper the non-ally detection itself basically it's um how do you spot the difference in the Stream of events at speed so definitely less than one one second and a scale so you've got both High throughput and also a vast amount of data as well how does it work well I picked a very simple way of doing the anonymity detection processing it's called cumulative sum control chart it actually originated from the 60s um it's a method which uses statistical analysis of historical data data is a single variable or key at a time but you can potentially have billions of keys so this is one of the dimensions of the large data size to it so you can't have everything in memory you have to be able to store the historical events on disk and there's a window a period of time or a number of events that you look back over to see whether there's been a significant change detected so we picked a relatively simple algorithm for this because we wanted the focus of the the exercise to be on the data layers we wanted to put the most stress on the data layers themselves rather than CPU and processing overhead so we built a pipeline it's got Kafka Cassandra and kubernetes clusters Kafka handles the streaming and Cassandra handles the data storage and kubernetes was used for the application scaling itself um Cassandra provided efficient data rights and reads was the key which was something like a unique account ID or a sense ID or something like that so that's a bit of an overview of the application the three main clusters and the sort of the pipeline basically an event comes in we store the event into Cassandra we then get the historic data for that the key associated with the event run the fraud or the anonymity detector or fraud detector it could be in a financial context and then decide whether it's likely to be an anonymity or not um so looking a bit more in detail at the Cassandra Dart model basically events are a Time series The ideas uh petition key and time is the clustering key which has an order over it and the read gets the most 50 values for the ID and it's very fast so here's an example of creating the table with that data in it and then doing select um for a particular ID and getting 50 the first 50 results back ordered by by time so we ran that application and that query on quite a large cluster to get some impressive results we didn't really have an upper bound that we were in we had in mind but we just sort of kept on going until we thought oh that's a pretty big number we like the look of that um so we use 574 CPU cores in total across the three clusters you'll notice that the um the Cassandra cluster was the most demanding part of the system that had 384 cores followed by the actual application Pipeline and then probably the least demanding part of the system was Kafka itself so the Baseline throughput um was 19 billion anonymously checks a day so for this um the focus on the geospatial anonymous collection in this talk I'll actually just normalize that to what I would call 100 so from now on I'll refer um so that is sort of the 100 figure and we will compare some of the results we get against that normalized value so we'll introduce now the harder problem which is to spot the differences in space as well as time so space is Big this is a famous quote from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy um yeah it's it's big basically it's got and it's got like scale and yeah there can be things happening locally or further away or essentially at an infinite distance but yeah it's big so it's interesting when geospatial data processing actually was the traditional big data problem in a sense which drove a lot of the developments and Technologies over the years and it still is still a relevant problem as well um and you can have spatial anomalies for example in the Star Trek universe you can imagine the the Enterprise coming across lots of different weird spatial anomalies and someone's actually classified these in a list uh how about a real example though well Jon Snow or not this one um slightly old series now but anyway going back even even older though here is Jon Snow's 1854 cholera map of London they had an outbreak of Cholera um and they wanted to know what was causing it and what they did um was they actually mapped the deaths per household and location and they actually were able to use that to identify a single polluted water pump that was was causing the outbreak and there were some outliers for example it turned out that there was a brewery right next to the pump but none of the Brewers got sick and why is that well Brewers drink beer not water so yes your anomaly detection system has to be able to cope with a few a few outliers as well uh okay so to be able to do geospatial anonymity detection first you have to know where you are so you have to have some replication of location that includes a coordinate system a map and a scale unfortunately the support guy in the desert here has come across a map that has none of those things so that's entirely useless and this is a slightly better map but Treasure Island map it has location in terms of lat long coordinates it's got a scale if you look down the bottom English miles whatever they are and it's got interesting locations with annotations like the bulk of the treasure is here it's pretty cool uh so geospatial anonym detection was a new problem for me and for my application so rather than having just a single ID the events now have the location as well as the some sort of value associated with that location so the problem now is to find the nearest 50 events to each new event and we still want to do it quickly in under one second and at high throughput as well um unfortunately we can't make any assumptions about geospatial properties of events including things like location density or distribution I.E where or how many are in a particular area so that means we need to search from the smallest to increasingly larger areas some Anonymous geospatial anomalies such as this one here on on this picture it's actually pretty big so we can't make any assumptions about the size initially at least and there was a very interesting talk at apachecon in 2019 where the guys from Uber were talking about a similar problem and using similar Technologies in fact to be able to forecast demand in particular locations in cities and they had to increase the area size until they had sufficient data to make more accurate predictions so the first thing I thought was well can we just use the latitude longitude coordinates as the Cassandra partition key or yes in theory compound partition keys are allowed in Cassandra but you can only select the exact locations which is not very useful for our application so how to compute nearness well in general to compute distance between locations you also need a coordinate system for example this is the the Mercator map it's got a few problems unfortunately it assumes a flat Earth and there is quite bad Distortion near the poles for example if you look at that the um the southern continent of Antarctica looks enormous and it's actually not that big uh in reality the world is approximately at least spherical so there is um a complex mathematical calculation which good to see the distance between two points so it's non-trivial to do the calculation unfortunately uh so there are some approximation methods the bounding box is a well-known one uh it's an approximation of distance using inequalities um basically if you know the location of each of the corners of the box and a location that you want to check you can check to see whether um that is inside the box I'm using some inequalities as in the example here so that's computationally simpler doesn't have any nasty mathematical functions or anything and accurate enough for some some use cases um so how would you do bounding boxes and Cassandra well using something like a country petition key and that long in time as the clustering Keys um you can create a table with that data and then try and run a query such as this one here unfortunately you get an error so basically you can't run queries with multiple inequalities like this unfortunately um okay so another approach is to use secondary indexes how well do these work well um there are the sort of the standard built-in Cassandra secondary indexes so you could create an index on the latitude and an index on the longitude but it turns out you had the same restrictions as the clustering columns you can't have multiple inequalities in the query um sassies are another option as well that stands for SS table attached secondary indexes a bit of a mouthful um this supports more complex queries more efficiently so similar to the the above example if you create two sassy indexes on on the left and long respectively and run a query on it that does actually work you don't get an error however if you read the documentation it says allow allow filtering may be inefficient so if you've got multiple rows being retrieved you actually have to retrieve the rows then do the filtering and typically isn't suitable for production so that seems like a bit of a DNA end all I must admit having looked at the sassy documents themselves in a bit more detail it says even though allow a filtering must be used with two or more column inequalities there is actually no filtering taking place so I'm not so convinced that that would be a problem or not although the performance results May tell the complete story uh which are here so here's the first little results so remember I mentioned that 100 is the original 19 billion um checks a day uh unfortunately using the sassy index we get very very poor results in comparison well under one percent of these um so that doesn't seem like an option if you are concerned all about maintaining the um the scalability and throughput of the results uh so another approach Geo hashes to the rescue um you can divide Maps into named and hierarchical areas we've also sort of used something already using a country partition key um there are other domains where this is quite well known and very common for example plate tectonics they're actually hierarchical which I hadn't realized there's the big plates and then there's actually subplates which is which form a hierarchy under each of the the major plates as well so hierarchical data and Geo hashes sort of go together um just a bit of background about Geo hashes there are different um approaches and standards for geo hashes this is this is just a an example that I used um basically a Geo hash is a rectangular area it's a variable length base 32 string a single character region is something like 5000 by 5000 kilometers in size and X each extra layer you add gives 32 sub areas and if you have an eight character Geo hash that gives you about a 40 meter by 20 meter rectangle anywhere on the planet um you have to encode and then decode let long to and from the geohashes so there's a bit of extra effort there and unfortunately there are some Education cases and it becomes increasingly non-linear near the poles so it's not perfect it's an approximate technique um so oddly enough some geohashes are real words ketchup is in Africa that's 153 meters by 153 meters for ketchup and Trump is in Kazakhstan he's got an area about 5k by 5K so we modified the anonymous check term the application to use Geo hashes lat long was encoded as geohash geohash now becomes the new key that we use and then the Geo hash is used to query Cassandra uh again there's a couple of different options for implementing Geo hashes in Cassandra option one and some of these are a bit silly to be honest I was I was also learning um Cassandra and some of the subtleties of Cassandra indexing at the time so I don't think um someone who is more expert in Cassandra may not have even tried some of these options but I'll present it anyway just to show um some of the things that I considered option one is multiple indexed Geo hash columns So in theory Geo hashes work really well for database indexes that's one of the sort of the good fits that they have so here's an example that I tried with eight um Geo hash columns and yeah you have to create eight indexes as well um then you have to run a query essentially starting from the smallest to the largest areas and then we stop when you've got 50 rows of data being returned uh there's some trade-offs with this approach multiple secondary columns and indexes or start multiple queries that you need to run accuracy and number of queries depends on the spatial distribution and the density which yeah that'll always be the case uh results well slightly better so a bit more optimistic this time so this gives us about 10 of the baseline's report which is about 1.9 billion checks a day so that's certainly not not as bad as the previous approaches we tried uh option two for geo hashes um is using denormalized multiple tables well so it turns out that in Cassandra denormalization is pretty normal so that's something a bit of a mind shift that you have to adapt to in a lot of the nosql databases in Cassandra in particular so it's perfectly acceptable to denormalize your data into multiple tables so that's what I did I created eight tables one for each Geo hash length as in the example there missing the ones in between and then you select again from the smallest to the largest area using the corresponding table again there's some trade-offs you have to have multiple tables and rights more importantly and also multiple queries as well uh did it work better it did so this option actually gave us 20 of the Baseline throughput so um it is certainly a better choice in terms of throughput at this point option three is to use clustering columns this is similar to option one but using clustering columns instead of the option one um so there's an example of of the eight clustering columns um yep how do they work well plus I had a clustering columns work in general well they're very good for hierarchical data modeling um they're so they're good for the modeling and they're also good for the efficient querying of hierarchical or nested data there's a few constraints around clustering columns in particular the query must include higher level columns with the equality operator only ranges are allowed on the last column in the query and lower level columns don't have to be included so here's an example of query over clustering columns we've got a couple of um the quality is there and then a couple of inequalities that we haven't included all of the The Columns so that does work but in terms of having multiple multiple clustering columns well actually one is enough so here's potentially a better solution a single Geo hash clustering column so you just use a Geo hash eight and time as the clustering keys so it's quite a lot simpler uh and there's your inequality range query again you just have multiple queries potentially and stop when you get 50 results back and this gives better results again so call this one option three it's certainly it's better it gives 34 of the original Baseline which is about 6.5 billion anomaly checks a day so that's certainly an improvement over all the other Alternatives we've looked at so far uh so yeah with spatial data there's potentially um some compounding issues um you've got to think about things like the cardinality for the petition key should be quite big potentially um which is which corresponds to about four or more characters in The geohash so it's not going to work too well for the shorter Geo hashes in general unbounded petitions are bad so you may need composite petition keys in production you may need to create a bucket out of something including time for example um Space versus time is a tricky trade-off you could have different sized buckets for different size spaces to bigger areas with more frequent events May need shorter time buckets to limit size and this may well depend on the space time scales or the underlying systems and process that you're trying to model so for example I've got a picture there of spatial and temporal scales for Ocean Air graphic processes and some of them are actually very small some are massive as well and some are sort of skewed in terms of they're big spatially but maybe not very big temporarily as well so yeah it depends on what you're trying to model as to whether it's going to work and how well it's going to work It's Tricky uh so another option that we had a look at is the Cassandra Apache leucine index plug-in which is basically a concordance if anyone remembers the days of physical book concordances they were often bigger than the the book that they were indexing typically a concordance for the Bible for example was a lot bigger than the actual copy of the Bible itself um the Cassandra leucine index plug-in it's a plug-in for Apache Cassandra it extends its index functionality to provide near real-time search including things like full-time search capabilities and free multivariable geospatial and biochemporal search uh it's achieved for a potentially leucine-based implementation of the Cassandra secondary index where each node of the cluster index is its own data luckily insta cluster actually supports this plugin so I I knew about it and it was available on our managed service so I didn't have to go to any trouble to try it out it's an additional add-on to my manager Cassandra service just click the extra box it says can I have this please and we spot the code so you can actually look at the open source code on our GitHub there as well so how does this help for geospatial queries well it's got very rich geospatial semantics including things like geopoints Geo shapes Geo distance search Geo bounding box search Geo shape search multiple distance units geotransmations and complex geoshapes most of which I didn't need so here's an example a zero point example for a start under the hood the indexing is done actually using a tree structure with geo hashes with configurable Precision so we are actually um basically using Geo hashes even though we didn't realize it um so here's an example of creating the table um and then we create the custom index which has a lot of sort of configuration stuff in there which is loosen specific at that point um there's multiple search options as it turns out um so there's different ways of of being able to retrieve the data you can try and sort it sort has very sophisticated but complex semantics you have to read the documents for that basically um another option it does implement the um the bounding box filter you need to compute the Box Corners in the the query it also has support for geo distance filtering as in that example there prefix filter as well prefix search is quite useful for search in larger areas over a single geohash column and you can basically search for a substring which corresponds to a small area of the full length geohash and that's actually very similar to the inequality over the clustering column approach that we've already tried uh so some leucine results um we tried a few of those we tried sort the bounded box um Geo distance and the prefix over a geohash um the best one was the prefix filter over the geohash that gave us 25 of the Baseline throughput which is about 4.7 billion checks a day which isn't too bad either so looking at the results overall now um all of the geohash options are certainly faster um the best one gave us the 6.5 billion Anonymous checks today um a leucine bounded box Geo distance was probably the most accurate so as a trade-off here between performance and accuracy typically but they only go five percent of the Baseline performance so that's quite a drop in the three put a few choose to use those uh and I thought it would add an extra complication at this point let's go up and down potentially so 3D up till now we've been thinking about space as purely two-dimensional there's no up and down in a 2d world in the flat world um the I don't know people last century or maybe it's a century before now um some of them didn't actually believe that the world was round anyway and they managed to explain away um the geography of their local area at least in terms of a square and stationary model of the Earth very strange but if you do want 3D then you need location altitude and volume so there are things called 3D geohashes they represent 2D location plus altitude and volume so for example here is a 3D Geo hash which is a cube with all the Earth's water in it so there isn't as much water as I thought how would you apply 3D geospatial or normal detection well potentially a current sort of a trend is drone delivery so maybe you could use a system like this for a 3D drone proximity detection so you could avoid crashes or avoid breaking any rules around where you're allowed to fly drones and things like that so it turns out there are actually a whole bunch of rules around using drones for example you're not allowed to use them within 50 meters of people in property 150 meters from congested areas a kilometer from airports and five kilometers from exclusion zones and interestingly enough these distances actually correspond almost perfectly to a specific length of 3D to your hashes so you can basically just plug in a 3D geohash and it should work um unfortunately I was hoping that we could um get drone deliveries at my house we're actually in the the region for one of Google's startup things where they're doing um their trialing drone deliveries of small objects up to about one and a half kilos but when I typed in my address and everything they said sorry we can't deliver to you possibly unfortunately I all of the rules associated with the drone delivery are violated for my house maybe I don't know so some results for 3D Geo hashes um so as I mentioned 3D geohashes basically work with all the geohash index options that we've already looked at um it's pretty fast there's no difference in speed to perform the 3D proximity checks and in general if you do need more throughput of course for a Cassandra cluster you just use a bigger more powerful Cassandra cluster that's one of the advantages of Cassandra um yeah so um I actually built some 3D demo Geo hash Java code it's available on my GitHub there's URL there it produces valid 3D Geo hashes for altitudes from 13 kilometers below sea level to roughly geostationary satellite orbit so just about the entire range of things that you might be interested in from an earth perspective and it can be used for any of the geohash options that I've already mentioned so now if you want some more information about this topic in particular or any of the other open source technologies that I've blogged around including quite a lot of different use cases such as iot machine learning over machine data I've done a series recently on using Cassandra for a globally distributed low latency financial application in multiple locations so yeah I try and come up with interesting use cases and then find the most relevant Technologies and talk about how they can be used so they're all there at that link there and finally if you want to try out any of these open source Technologies we've got a free trial offer on our main website and one of our newest offerings in public preview at the moment which is managed postgresql which I've only just recently learned and started playing with and it's pretty cool it doesn't have the horizontal scalability of Cassandra but it's actually quite a cool technology it's been around for a long time and it's great for Json data for example so I've been using it to build Json pipelines and things so that's quite fun so that's the end of the talk thanks very much for your attention I hope that was relevant and interesting and useful um yep and that was was fun giving a live presentation again so uh so thank you very

foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign so let's [Music] uh so let's start with the uh I am going to cover the Cassandra what you can say that on kubernetes uh now every day everyone is moving towards the kubernetes and I am I will show you how to clean and faster you can do your deployments of the Cassandra on the kubernetes okay so first of all I like to welcome all of you on this Cassandra day and I will take you through some basic concepts of Cassandra then I will introduce our operator to you which will which will which will make it very easy for all of us you to deploy the consent on kubernetes then how we can monitor our cluster which is running on the kubernets then we will work with some data we will try to see how we can access the cluster actually and how we are we are going to get in into the cluster which is running in the kubernetes because from our local machines and then some of the steps for scaling up and down what is a target API little bit on a DAT because after after me some there will be a complete session on Stargate and then how we how the repairs are running as a different service and then keep wrap up on this particular what you can say that kubernetes the center on kubernetes okay so now let's see what was the infrastructural earlier Whatever Whenever we are deploying anything if you need to deploy something you have to first set up an infrastructure and then you will have the data layer data getting stored on your infrastructure on your databases running on on an infrastructure and then you have the applications to connect to that database and it is a very tedious job now everybody everyone is moving from the what I can say that from the monolithic to the micro Services because it will make ease of using the services also simpler and past also and now how now everybody is talking about the kubernetes micro services and all that kind of stuff now you know we are seeing the shift also on the database earlier the people were worried about running the databases on the containers or Dockers due to due to the persistence and other things now you will see everybody slowly moving toward the uh 2D kubernetes for databases also most of the databases now can be ran as the what I can say that a container on top of a kubernetes because kubernetes give lot of flexibility to the database okay the one thing is that you can have any infrastructure it's an in-house private Cloud we are running it on a VMware you have a physical server anywhere you can set up your infrastructure and you can start using it and and you can easily do lift and ship because it's an it's a hardware dependent you can run your code on the kubernetes you can on gcp you can run your same code on your system same machine on your local machine also and then we have equivalent as an orchestration engine so what's an orchestration Oscar station is if I if we see a simple meaning of an orchestration it is something which help us to run something smoothly and orchestration will make sure that all of our services which are running on key which are running as a parts will be apply all the time if there is a need for scaling up or scaling down it should be here so all those things will be taken care by the kubernet or as an orchestration engine then we have a data layer so in data layer we are using Cassandra as a database in Kate Sandra and we have a Gateway through which you can access your data and the Gateway is called as a star gate what is this target gives you a flexibility why we use this data Gateway why we are not directly accessing the data by by accessing Stargate gives a flexibility to us to access the data in a model we want what model means if we want to access the data using rest apis if you want to access a data read or write a data using the Json we can do that and if you want to access the data using the graph API or something we will be easily able to do that so and then at the top nobody's why where this data is used or who are the sources of the data the most of the time the sources of the data are the mobile and the web apps and all those mobile and web apps know nowadays are moving towards from monolithic Pros to the micro Services because it gives the flexibility it improves the development process it gives the speed and same way if now our database can also run as a micro service on top of a kubernetes now first I told you I will give a very short introduction about Apache Cassandra and also a very short introduction of on kubernetes For Those whom the uh Patrick Center and kubernetes both are new I will not cover so much in detail about both of them but yes a little bit knowledge so that whenever we are going for some Workshop or a deployment you will be able to understand what I am talking about okay no more seconds in a category of a no SQL database or sometime we also call them as non-relational databases so whenever the nosql comes uh we we say that not like a SQL they they don't have so if SQL if we say it's a structured query language so it's not it's it's like a misnomer we have the query language to query over data so here we call it the SQL but we also have some different interfaces also to connect to the data I told you using rest API Json and all those kind of things you can read your data you can query your data the way you want so what is nosql no SQL is a distributed database and what are the differences between traditional and distributed database there's a very simple which if I talk about there's a very simple difference if I have to do something and if I work for 9 or 12 hours to do that thing that is a single system I am I am enhancing myself I'm scaling myself call for doing some tasks from 9 to 12 hours scaling by three hours that is single scale-up system but what's a distributed system if I if I got some tasks and if I add one more team member in my team and we will distribute a workload that is a distributed system the same thing these distributed databases does so whenever the data increases because nowadays the data is increasing so fast and our traditional databases are not able to scale or perform in that circumstances so what no SQL gives a power they are this they can distribute over workload so that means we don't have a single server serving our purpose we have multiple servers which will be there which we call them in Cassandra as a node so node can be anything it can be any jvm process which is running the Cassandra service okay it can be a virtual machine it can be Docker image or it can be or it can be a physical server or what you can say that bare metal server also okay so no nodes will be there so what happens in a distributed Data Systems you have a scale out architecture and performance will not be compromised for me the definition of the scalability is ability of the system to expand with growth in demand keeping the performance in check and this is what nosql distributed database are helping us because whenever there's a load increase you can add more nodes they will distribute the load and your performance will not be so much compromised and Cassandra has a ring-like architecture what's a ring like architecture every node is communicating with each other and every nodes knows about each other through the gaussian protocol they keep on sharing the information with each other about the token exchange and everything using this gossa protocol and using this gossip protocol only they will be able to know that which node is active or which node is dead so that if there is any failure they will be easily able to handle those failures so this is what we have as a nosql database Apache Cassandra running as a ring and date I told you the load will be distributed so what is the load here the load here is both the things data and the query so data is stored across the nodes in the local disks we prefer the jbar disks the disks which are attached to the server so now if I go one step back if we have a data like this a country City and population and I'm I need to store this data so and this data is a is a huge amount of data I have a data for the complete world and I need to store it you know you know how many records will be there so if I storing it I can distribute that data across the number of the nodes so for example now this data is distributed across multiple nodes in this ring-like architecture the US data goes on one server the Denmark on one UK one one Indian Australia and one so all those kind of data we distributed across these servers and how we distribute the data what's what's how the data is will get distributed does it get automatically one record on one node another on another node because this is a strategy and the one of the most important point of that strategy of distribution of data is a partition key so here if I say if I go one step back the partition key is a country and now the partitions are getting distributed across the servers there are chances when multiple partitions can be on a single server or all the partitions can be distributed across the server so they depends upon a load because we want or Cassandra what it does it will keep the same load it will try to keep the same load across these servers and now this is the one thing now whenever we talk about the center V6 Center is highly available distributed fast performing database no use you you know you have seen the two things the data is distributed and Cassandra is a highly scalable because you can add up or remove nodes at any point of a time so what is missing highly availability so how we achieve this highly High availability that is achieved using the replication Factor so replication factor is means nothing it means simply how many copies of the data you want to keep so if I say an application Factor 3 then I need minimum three copies of data then what is my high availability I my data will not be lost if I lose two nodes because data is lying on the three nodes still I have having the third copy of the editor sitting on some other server so that is what we mean by data is replicated is that clear so for example this is a 59 data so it will be replicated across so whenever there is a read and write the reader write best will come to the coordination node and then from the coordination node it will go to the nodes based on the token topology uh I am not going so deep into it based on the token numbers or something hash numbers it will go to the different nodes and you are saying seeing this data is replicating across the three different nodes so this is here and what happens if one of the node is down when it has to write the data on that node then the quadration node will store a hint for that now this data was not able to get written on the third node and whenever that node will come up automatically the data will be written there also is that clear and whenever the nodes will come up the data will also come there and what will be topology see whenever we say that we have to keep the data distributed we works on different different things for example we have to work we need to make need to make sure if we are in Cloud there will be if single availability zone is going down still we have the access to the data or if single region is affected we can have the access to the data or if we are in our local data center we want to keep the rack awareness or we want to keep the disaster recovery and all other kind of things so if we want to keep the disaster recovery we should store our data across the data centers and if we want to keep a high availability and protect our database from going down in case of the rack failure or the availability Zone then we will spread our nodes across different eases for different racks so this is what we should do and the data so we're keeping some nodes on rack a summon rack 2 rack three so if single rack goes down still we have four Quorum of nodes available there we are able to take all the read and write requests so this is what we need to make sure so next step is that data will be distributed there will be geographical distribution of the data so not only you can keep the data at a single data center single CT but you can distribute your data across different geographical locations of the world you can have some of your data sitting in India some of your data sitting in Australia and some of your data setting in in Singapore for example you want to keep the your your data what you can say durability toss in different regions and you have the users which are accessing the data from these three different geographical regions same thing the Cassandra not only gives you flexibility of different regions but also different Cloud providers you are having some applications which are running on gcp and some are running on A's on Azure and you want that data should be spread across both the data centers and then you also have an option of deploying your these rings in different data clouds or different data centers okay for example I will give a quick reference how scalable we are so all of you may be watching the video the series on Netflix and who and all that power to that what I can say what you are streaming is given by the Cassandra and we are running 10 and thousands of Apache Center nodes they have a huge amount of data which is distributed across the Cassandra nodes and which is spread across the multiple AWS regions because Netflix has the users across the geographical zones and and and Netflix need to be up always and the data should be persistent there so all those things all those power to Netflix will be given by the capacity Center as a database same way Apple all of you know we all are using Apple products and apple also for his what I can say pay and other applications use very big clusters a huge size of clusters they have almost one 60k nodes in one of their clusters they're running 160k Apache Cassandra in instances and they are having the data more than 100 petabyte and their requirement is of million operations per second so that is how they are getting the scalability performance that is what I talked at the beginning scalability is not expanding or growing with the demand scalability is growing with the demand and keeping the performance also in check and that is what you are getting with the power effect Center you're not only getting the more storage to store the data but you are also guilty getting scalability in terms of the query you are able to you're able to run the query with the same slas with the same performance even your data increases by adding few number of nodes just like Plug and Play kind of a thing okay so what is our toss task today and I am here to show you how you know these nodes will get deployed as a parts on the different kubernetes nodes and how we make it very simple with our operator to deploy all these kind of how to deploy the complete Cassandra cluster on the kubernets so now if I ask you to set up a Cassandra cluster so what steps you will do you first need to set up a networking storage firewall limitation then you need to install the Cassandra on all the nodes then you need to set up some monitoring softwares and all those kind of things then you have to configure your backup repair and all other kind of policies or you need to install the agends sorry so there are a lot of things which you need to do a lot of things so how we are going to see how we are going to depress so we will take a lot of time to deploy so let's not do all these things let's do it very quickly so first let me introduce Kate Centra so creative Sentra is something which is developed by data stack and then later it's open source to give the developers or give the admin status flexibility to deploy the Cassandra on the kubernetes so you can deploy the Cassandra on any of the what I can say that cloud or in-house using this gate center operator so first what you through yeah I know that you don't know some of the basics we don't have gone through this some of the basic concepts of the kubernetes but I am saying that let's insert up the kids Sandra so lets you click first quickly what I will do I'll try to wind up some of the basic points about what I can say that Cassandra what I can see that case Central components and kubernetes and then we will quickly go and check each and everything so what is a kubernetes actually kubernet is running your app kubernetes and orchestration service which will help you to run your application on the on the nodes as a container or a pod so one of the smallest unit of what I can say that kubernet is a pod so pod is nothing it's a namespace or a service which you are running am I right so for example if I am running one service I can run it as a pod a and if I'm running a slope is B I can run it as a pod B and inside the pods we can have one or more containers most of the time you will see only single container running on the Pod but even if you want to distribute something inside those containers within a pod you can do that but the Pod will have the single IP address the containers inside those pod will have the same identity as a pod they will share the IP address they will share the namespace they will share the storage they will share each and everything with each other you most of you will be already knowing about that what sport and all those kind of things second point which I want to configure is that foreign terms because we are going to deploy the database on kubernetes and database means data and we we will not be saying that once I will terminate that part or something happen the data should get lost we need that data always because it's a database so we need a persistent volume need to be attached to a service to a to a pod so what's a persistent volume persistent volume is a volume in which your data will not be lost even if your prod got terminated or got killed so this persistent volume can be anything because there will be a storage class you you you may have different kind of storage like like NFS storage class 40 some object storages storage class from some Nas storages or or different kind of things we have the storage classes also for different Cloud providers for example elastic file share for the for the for for the for the for the kubernetes we create there some file shares and then we share those file shares with the powers and all those kind of things so there can be different kind of storage classes and then in the storage class what we will do we will create one PV which is called as a physical volume physical volume is nothing it's like a volume it's if I say simply whenever you need to add a disk to your server server in a normal cases you add one volume to your server we also call that as a physical volume so physical volume is nothing is a storage container inside which data will be stored and this volume this this will be the dot and then what's a persistent volume claim so persistent volume claim is a use is a service which will connect your name space to that persistent volume so it will take all your request user requests report request which is coming for storing the data on the PV it will take all those things and if if I want make it simple see for example in the traditional infrastructure or in a VMware what we have we have the currency protocols using which the we will write on the disk the same is something this PVC also does not exactly but you can get an idea how it works okay and then what's the stateful set we will be talking lot about the stateful set so stateful set is a set of Parts which have the constant identity that means their state will not change even if there is if there is what I can sit at any issues with the networking or or your pod will come up again to do some failure it will come with the same consistent identity same course name or something whichever you have given to that okay so some of the custom resources or configurations which we give whenever we create a because because we have to produce yml files or configuration files what we give them so if you see this sample file I'll show you one more sample file from when we will do the actual deployment so you see that here so first we give some API version this is an optional so we have a kind so what we are doing kind kind is this kind of service it can be a service it can be a part it can be a stateful site it can be anything so here our kindness we are defining the custom resources for example we are saying the name of the cluster will be this group will be this and then we are saying the center Data Center data center what this kind does actually it is overcast operator and whatever cash operator does it will help you to deploy your Cassandra cluster it has all the services information everything there and whenever you say for the Cassandra deployment it will deploy all those processes like repair services metrics collector all as a support in in in the kubernetes cluster okay so you have this we will have the backup and restore services like madhua and we have the repair services we will have the graph now for the what I can say that store for the monitoring and all those kind of things and and this is something how we Define all those services okay what will happen so this will be operator and this operator will connect to the kubernet API because you know that in the kubernet master node or kubernet for the cloud or also anywhere we have some API Services we have the database in the etcd we have the scheduler we have a master we have the Q uh we have we have lot of services which will be ready we have the cubelet on the nodes running we have the proc CQ proxy running on the Node so all those different kind of services are running so what does this operator do it will talk so what does this operator will do operator will have all the information what need to deploy and then it will deploy all those services on the cluster and then all those stateful sets will be deployed on the kubernet cluster using this cache operator because cash operator has the information about all those services I'm right and then it will be monitored States will be monitored and if any parts go down it will automatically try to recover that and this will be for this single namespace which is called as a cluster is that clear okay so with the help of kubernet operator you will be able to Define what kind of a Services you you can you can developers can give their own information to the cluster which should be created there is set clear any questions any questions so we are moving to the next step you can post your questions in the chat and the team will try to answer all your those questions okay so first we will have the kubernet master we will be having the worker nodes and we have the container D or Docker D or any kind of a service which will be running there I told we told you that we have the Q foxy for the networking we will have the cubelet which will talk to the master for deploying all those spots on the different container different nodes is that clear so what we're going to do so if we have the normal kubernet step we need to do all those things I told you you need to install the Cassandra you need to set up storage and everything this will be a very tough task so what we do we make it simpler for the deployment so what are the cache separator features what does cast operator gives you it gives you a proper token ring in initialization it will it will help you to decide the seed node management and all those kind of things and it will do the server configuration integration into the different data centers rolling reboot of the nodes if there's some change in the in that in that complete State set if I say that and it will store your data in with the rack awareness with the pods running on the different nodes okay it can scale up and scale down quickly so all those kind of things will be provided you by a cache operator and if if cash support is not there then you need to do all those stuff manually so this is how we have the cash operators there okay let's quickly go for some Hands-On and I created a very simple start for those Hands-On so very safe it's setting up a kid's Center so most of you have joined this meeting on using your laptops and all other kind of things you will not be having a lab environment or some servers so very simple to start deployment of that Cassandra on a cubanate is you should have mini Cube installed on your laptop for your desktops then you will have Cube CTL and help so this there are very simple links to which you can go you can simply simply type install mini Cube install Cube CTL and install Helm on your web browser and they will take you to do these links and all these links you using these links you can quickly install all the three softwares I have already did it for mine I already done for mine so after installing what we do I will keep the what I can say that my shell radius where I will run up these commands I hope you are able to see my shell so now what we are going to do first because we are going to create a Cassandra cluster we will test these some scaling and all those kind of things so we'll start the mini cube with with more CPU and more memory usually it starts with default 2GB memory and one CPU kind of a thing or I think 4GB memory or two CPUs but we want to start it with four CPUs and memory of approximately 8 GB so you can start it so this is a first start you will you think you should do okay so mini Cube start so I think it's already running for me so let me check okay yes it's already running for me so my mini cube is up and running and next thing what we will do we will check the storage classes why we have to attach a persistent volume and we need to keep that data safe always on the cluster so we need to check also that persistent volume storage class is there or not we talked about the storage class for some time most of you if you are doing it for first time and in you are trying this Cassandra deployment on the kubernetes first time you will not be able to see this ratchet i o local path waiting for first consumer you will not be able to see it so what's a way to get it created so I have given the command so you can do this command Cube CTL apply and you can you can you can create this path also if you want okay so quickly you can run this command and you can have that particular storage available there and then you need to get the repose for the K2 Center the report will have all the information related to the cash operator all those Services which you are going to deploy everything will be there in the repo file in the repositories which you will do so what commands you will usually run help repo add K8 Central or you want to give some other name you can give and then you have to give a location where that app is available for example here it is given this location so I can copy paste quickly and then I can paste it out there so for me this wrappers are already existing there but to show you how to run this command so it says that already exists and if you have done this practical earlier also you tried this what I can say that this earlier also you can see that this repos sorry not Helm repose list so you can check out that your Zappo exists or not sorry a typo by me and it says that already I have the two wrappers which is Kate sendra and which is traffic so what this traffic will help you to compute the Cassandra cluster or Cassandra so cast Cassandra cluster case Center Services which are running on the kubernetes on your local machine so it will do some kind of a road routing or code forwarding for you to access those services on your local machine so that is why they are very important so instead of directly reaching to the network of a kubernet pod you can you can you can access using them the localhost you can do this using this and after you added these repositories you have to run the hand crap update to update your repositories you can do quickly by this okay so it got the all the updates for your repository okay this was done it was very simple but what we are going to do now we are going to do the so let me show you something so already I've pasted I have a sample files what I'll do I think I have some kid Sentra yml file here if it is there I'll take you through that quickly yes yeah so this is here so Kate Central dot yml file we are using for the deployment and what I'm going to deploy is enter the service and what version of press sender you can choose a latest version also and what is a storage class local path and I am giving a 5gb of storage because we are just getting it for a testing purpose do you want to allow the multiple nodes per worker yes we can do it a single worker node of the kubernet do you want to have multiple pods or things running inside it yes because in a local desktop we can't have the multiple machines what will be the Heap size you know that Cassandra is a Java process so Heap is very important component there so we are giving an Heap size of 1GB and New Generation Heap size of 1GB so then we are giving some CPN memory and we are setting some limitation for the CPU also and then we are giving the data centers you can here Define the multiple data centers also if you want if you if you if you if your Cubans kubernetes nodes are are spread across the multiple what I can say that parts or something like that you can give that also okay then for the monitoring we have a promotive stack and we are giving some default username and password for it and if you want to change that password you can give that password also here if you want to set up some password and then we have the I can also give you the command later on if you want to change the password or somebody somebody forgot the password after changing first time how it can be done then we are also enabling this target API okay and how many Target API replicas we want to run because it's a single node so one and I'm giving some Heap memory and some CPU limitation to this target ePay also because I told you everything will be run as a different service here where we are dividing all those which are running inside a same jvm container into some different processes here in kubernetes okay after this it's a very simple so I'll copy paste most of the commands to reduce the time uh taken for running these commands so you can do Helm installer.yml kit Center you can give here your cluster name so your cluster name can be anything I am giving the same case Center for timing but if you want to give some demo cluster cluster one or my cluster it's up to you you can give any of your cluster name so this command is simple it has installed using this file whatever mentioned in this file use that for installation use the Kate Center repository which we have created which you have seen from Helm repo list and then also we are saying the name of the cluster which you want to which you should use so after that we will press the enter so it will take some time depending upon the resources on your system usually it is quick for me that you check yeah it's deployed it's supplied but it's too Cube to check the statistics of all the pods but I'll show you how the statistics should be running so there will be one service which will be completed but most of this this default stat STS Services should be two by two there should be Target EPA we should be running and some other services are this is a repair services which is repair pod this is Kate Central Prometheus for monitoring pod this is a graph map pod which will have the dashboard this is a data center one pod which is running the service this is the upgrader which is completed and this is a cache operator which is running everything which is a mastermind of this so this is also running so if I check in sometime again it's there so most of the things will slowly move into the running status or one by one status we'll wait for some time more and things will look more but I can see that from it now I will also check the health of the cluster which I am setting up and quickly my motto is just to show you how what are these commands are done so we have created one cluster we will Define the center data centers and data center one which was mentioned in the cassandra.yml casecentral.yml file that data center one is running from it is a 87 seconds and let us also check for the data center one half over cash operator is running so we can curve and take this here so its cash printer is ready and ready to work and then we will check how many services are up and is it live simple running of this command will help me to get that so you will be able to see this how this was this is running all the services already we have some cluster IPS there are some ports which are associated to it all those things are is that clear any questions you can put it on chat but here how we deployed our compute kubernet to Center on the couponings no it is deployed does it works or not let's see because we are able to connect to it thus data is getting persistent on a disk or not these are still the questions but clusters is up because I am able to see the most of the parts in is in running state or they are able to return because this was important for me it's running Stargate is about to run because using this target I need to connect to the data I need to connect to my cluster and push some read and writing of the data so this is also very important for me graph now dashboard I can do the monitoring now preparing stay leaders in progress it will take some time and it depends up also on the power of the machine how Cube everything will be going to come up okay this is done so this is done this was a sample skate center.yml file which we have used now I'll go to the next step so what we have done we have run the traffic for the kubernetes Ingress for external access we have the Star Gate which will be what I can see that default gateway for all our kind of queries connectivity read and write then we ran a Cassandra cache operator to scalable Cloud native database we have the repair Medusa as a service spot running and then we will have the Pod running for grafna and prompties most of you know that chromatis is used for collecting the metrics and grafna gives us a beautiful dashboards to see those metrics so it makes visualization very good for all those metrics which are collected by the Prometheus and yes this Helm die is very helpful because using this we are easily and quickly with simple commands are able to deploy our cluster so this is how a work cluster is getting deployed okay so we have a traffic Gateway metrics UI microservices and Cassandra no SQL and we have the Medusa services for backup and repair which can take you back up to the object storage and then store it back from there you have the repair services in Cassandra sometime when the nodes goes down that node will have the delayed copy or will not have the actual copy of the data so what we want to do that so what we want to do there we want to do the repair on the nodes so that repair will be taken care by this repair services so all these things are running as the micro Services okay and to connect to these micro services from the outside we are using this traffic Ingress here as of now okay so most of things here I already explained to you something like that we are already seeing now what I'll do I'll show you how we will monitor our casing let us deploy does it release or not let's see okay for monitoring also you will see your dashboards like this you know like this kind of things but let me show you how we will enable that the first using that operator we will we will forward these requests to over what I can say that we will forward over these requests to the what I consider to the Local Host so this commands need to be copy pasted let me get the statistics one time more sort of things are running now yes we are running we are up and running all those important services are there running so first step done and then I need to do the Second Step also so I need to take this what I can say that out so quickly so this is a change in my version of the kids center because I did some changes in the cluster and you can see this now you will be here because it is rolling over the statistics if you do Cube CTL pods still you will not see some of them the ready or most of them will be ready so now if I do Cube CTL get services okay so I am seeing that my graphene is running somewhere so it's running here it is running on the attcp board so what I'll do I'll quickly forward this to some other port why because I want that to connect from there because in my system I don't know why this port is not or ATT Port is not coming up I don't want to troubleshoot it so I know that I can put forward this so I have Port forwarded the forwarded the request to different port and let me do so which Port I forwarded 7500 yes and why I am giving this so let me do 7500 so what are the username admin and what is the username we have given admin one two three I think so it's not taking it [Music] so in the file we've given admin and admin one two three let's Miss way see it file again that is admin and admin one two three yes one two three it didn't take it sometimes the default password usually I mentioned is a secret it takes that okay so I given the secret so it was able to take that you can click on the dashboard homes and you can go to the dashboards you want to see the multiple dashboards you can check here and you can see the Cassandra cluster and services which are there so we are seeing the node is down maybe it is taking some time to come up okay let me check why it's down and second [Music] of course it's coming it's running it's completed the target one was not running and one is running let's see What's Happening Here this is how you will get your dashboard let me check so this will be sure request how many reads are coming throughput your read latency your node status node is up now and the node count is one you are able to see total count is one and a disk you are using what is a disk space the different files which are using inside that it's given there as of now any compactions are pending on the table it is also shown here your any error is in the throughput everything will come up here in this beautiful dashboard apart from that you can also check the statistics for your Stargate API you don't want to make any changes so any HTTP request jvm Heap usage which is happening there you will be able to see from here you have this system and node Matrix so CPU busy memory use swap used disk used you will be seeing little higher for my system because this is a simple desktop on which I am running the service how many cores are there how many RAM and all those kind of from the local system and everything it is giving to me okay because you know that I I why it's giving 8GB because I started my this with a 8GB system load and system of time so everything is given there so it's my node on which this thing is running in the center of The View and we have also the index dashboard which is there okay so this is all how you can you have a different SQL clients request compaction and now after this what we will try to do I will tell you if you want to try of your own also you have this cassenter.io available here using the skate center.io you will get all the documents which are there before I will move to the next Works Workshop to connect to the database and all other kind of things so you have this what I can say that Cassandra dot IO there you can check all the documents from here getting started you can do small small basic Hands-On if you want to do on any cloud provider or or on your local system the docs for everything is given here do you have blogs all those whatever the events we are doing related to the gate center everything is covered in this gate center.io okay let's see the third thing we want to also want to see some write read or do some type kind of a data thing with this thing so let's see how we are going to do so now I'll try to run this command to do the port forwarding okay for that let's do that what I did I have read this command and did a port forwarding like this so forward it from 0 to the 9042 so because I want to connect to my system so next step which I'll do quickly this is a simple command to do the code forwarding Services I did a spot forwarding from 80 to 7500 also sometime before but now I am doing this forwarding from internal 8080 to the external 8080 881 to external ATT and you know that our SQL is it will will work on the 9042 port so that means no if I want to connect to that I can use that for the connectivity so let's go to the next step so what I need to do now I need I will use quickly the SQL shell to show you how you can do the cube connection to your kubernet cluster so let's see how we are going to do that okay so what is here so I'm coming to this here so what I am doing first to connect to the cluster I need a username and a password so what I'll do I'll quickly get the username of the cluster which I have deployed so this this these commands will help you to get the username and passwords so user risk Center super user and we are able to we will now get the password also if you please so let's see how to get that password it's a single command getting the secret you can put to both the commands together in the what you can see that script and it will give you together the result of what I can say that username and password so once I was able to get this username and password now I will be able to connect to the maclister but for connectivity you need the client idea you need to use the rest apis to connect or you will use the Json or using those Target and all those kind of things I told you that I will show you a SQL asset how you will be will be because For the Rest API render the commands are given very simply without a which are very simply available on on what I can say that on our stargate.io so how we are going to connect to this SQL asset it's also very simple so first what you need to do you need to download the SQL sh for extra which is available on a datastack website once you do download you can what I can say that unzip that I've already unzipped that so I'll go to the folder uh quickly doing this SQL search dot extra and you know that this file I didn't set up a path I'm a bit lazy in doing that so you know that in bin folder we have most of those things which are available there so we have the SQL sh available there now after generating that username and password we need to give for contacts so sqlash minus user so what username we got so let's copy this so quickly I am copying this and then I need to give some password also let's see it wants the host also so host will be in our case we will do The Host okay the password requires an argument which I need to give which I am missing so password is also I generated somewhere but copying a password need to be a little bit careful because if you copy the white spaces then this password is going to give us trouble so that is why I put it in there and I think I'm not copying any white spaces let's check it out yeah see I'm inside the SQL session on inside the Cassandra cluster so now we are sure even so we are sure this Cassandra is running on kubernet cluster and it's running there so we are inside the shell okay and then what we are going to do we can do describe key spaces to list our key spaces or something which we want to do okay so all those commands which you want to do you can you can you can you can uh you you will be able to see from here so you want to create a table you want to you want you want you you you want to see something you can do this here okay and all those documents related to your SQL sh command is available there so this is where you can get your SQL sh commands which you need to run if your first time user and you're doing first time there will be some little differences between the commands of what I can say that which you works there so you can see here [Music] so you can see we have a described cluster so this is a desktop Lister you can use or something describe cluster or disk cluster so it will give you more information about your cluster describe cluster and all those informations you are able to get okay so we are running the cluster Kate Sandra if you remember that we created a cluster with a K2 Center and by default it is using the murmur partitioning okay so this is this is how you can you will be easily able to access after that if you want to create a table you want to what you can say that you you want to play it you want to create a table or you want to create anything you will be able to do it using that okay any questions any queries you can put uh paste it on a chat apart from that I would quickly want to take in the last five minute uh in the last five minutes through some of what I can say that important Concepts no you already know the Cassandra you can quickly do the read and write if you want you're connected to the to the cluster and all those kind of things and also what else we can do we can quickly scale up the cluster with a single command instead of doing the instead of bringing up the server doing all this kind of things we can be easily able to set the size equal to 3 and we will be able to see the the Centric Lister getting provisioned with the three nodes and you will see the three parts which will be running there for the gate Center Crystal so this is how you can do the and we have a different service for repairing and all those kind of things but what best practices we should follow the best practices which should be followed for the high availability scalability and performance you should have some good disks for the persistent volume where the cluster is able to persistent the data much faster you you have your backup Services configured because backup to the object storage or shared storage because you know that these containers or these vertical parts are volatile in nature and also you should have multiple node kubernetes cluster to given High availability if if it is a failure of a pod and then then it is okay but if it is a failure of a node of a kubernet cluster then your services may get impacted so that is why whenever you're running these kind of services you're running it for a production try to have multiple nodes running these these particular kubernet Services which which was to find in the picture so with this I would I would I would like to say thank you and over to you foreign okay um good morning good evening good afternoon good night everyone happy to be with you for this hour and introduce you about a great tool to build an open source API layer on top of Castle van and I'm leading the developer advocacy team at data Stacks so as Advocate we do training public speaking uh support the developer building some tools sample codes sample apps and doing some talks and presentation likes today I'm a Java geek so I expect some Java code probably a little bit of live coding in the end um I need some spring for a couple of years already and let's jump into it right away so today's six parts I will explain you what is a tool it's called Stargate then we will export together what are the available apis for you so rest document oriented to use Casanova as a document oriented database yeah that's quite innovating graphql the new way to expose thing it will take over probably all the apis in the coming years I think just so much value then all about the tooling is because it's cool to have those apis but you want to use them so um you should not have to read the specification and build the tool by yourself to to consume the API and then we will go to what's next okay so the ID is first we would like to avoid developer to know all the languages you know as a developer wanted to to use the database you need to to know the language of the database if you are using a gdbc you need SQL if you are using Casanova you need SQL if you need  you need to know beat Json B and it could be n1ql if using couch based there is no there are a lot of language to know when new deals with database so that's for things Instagram it's a binary format and most of the time it needs to be stateful maintaining some connection between you and the database so the ID is to provide a data Gateway a proxy on top of your database to expose apis and allow stateless service on top of the database so developers would like only to consume API especially if they are front-end or mobile developers is a database design for the new standard associated with apis here with microservices we tend to say yeah it's one database per micro service well not really it's not really how it works what you want to do is as a isolate isolate the micro Service as much as possible and with customer you can do that you can isolate but per cluster per DC per um per key space and even per table so it's super fitted to to to be used on top of micro services okay so the products the tools called Stargate is just that an open source framework for data a proxy on top of the database to consume your data and expose some apis so this is a project stargate.io it has about two years and you can see we do have about 500 stars on GitHub already more than 30 contributors and it's in heavy development by that size but we are looking for contributors foreign between the database and the apis and we will have at the bottom the persistence extension and at the top the API extensions persistence extensions multiple version of Castle has of today 3x 4X and every thing related to data Stacks Enterprise okay so multiple version of Castle and at the top multiple flavors of API that I will cover in details during this presentation data graphql document and SQL jrpc will be released next week so this is our big proxy here so it's a NOS GI application so it's based on Java osgi and the framework implementing the RTI is Felix this is our runtime then to expose API we are using the Java framework called drop Reserve this is the Hat logo that you can see here and you expose one API on each board so 80801 for the authentication 8082 for the rest 80 94 grpc foreign to use those service you need to authenticate so you do have these endpoint out here at the top left hand corner to get you a token and the token will leave for by default 30 minutes you can say you can set the time to leave for your token the token is Crypt and store on one of the Castle Hot Table you are using just to to check on that in a technical dedicated key space for standards then it's all about filters and services osgi is all about services so authentication services to see if you know your token is valid when you invoke any endpoint then rate limiting just to throttling the requests as an API management solution you don't want to overload your system and the persistence service which is an abstraction on top of customer so as of today it's cassava only but the way Stargate has been implemented does not prevent you to change Castle hubby something else it's just a matter of implementation just a new storage for the Stargate that's really the goal is really to introduce these multiple multiple persistence layer also Stargate expose here a metric server on 8084 so the Matrix server is played by default provided by drop Wizard and this Matrix server could be consumed by a Primitives for instance the formative service Monitor and you can drive you can draw some nice dashboard in grafana in here one step even further you can see that even for the API rest you do have multiple services but we will see that a graphql the same here you do have the full feature for pictures of what you find in inside so first Authentication okay um Stargate is not a single point of value of course you would like to scale out your Stargate layer and what you need to do is having a load balancer on top of the Stargates and with that you could you are able to use any Android CPI so the the authentication is no different you really need to you really want to have multiple Target to avoid the spoff and each Stargate can expose the authentication API so you just provide user and password reusing the role-based access control from Cassandra without Reinventing the wheel here so you can set up some dedicated role on at Castle High Level to be exposed by by a Target that's the best practice the token by default is 30 minute but you can extend or reduce that time and the token of course are shared between multiple Stargate nodes so you don't need stickiness to use some Target note I told you that star get exposed some Matrix and points so those are sample dashboard in grapha now based on the Matrix we collect from the Stargate gvm Stargate is using projection by data stacks on Astra Astra DB which is the National Housing service in the cloud and we provide on top of those Target apis so those are dashboard that you can find in the last dashboard so this is the gvm HTTP traffic so see all the all the requests with the the throughput and the latency and you can see you do have here a dashboard to see hey for each node how many codes do we have and uh how much time I mean what is the latency for each endpoint so authentication rest and graphql okay so before um so I totally expect you to have for some knowledge on Castle so before when you need to log in and connect to kasara you provide some contact points one is enough for the first call to get the full topological cluster multiple is better and in your application you will use the driver and the driver will open and maintain some persistent connection between the nodes because the driver is clever doing the um failover load balancing l-check for you and is taken away so the driver will connect and retrieve the data from the proper replica based on your request to do all these magic the drivers need to keep those Connection open so it's totally stateful and if you do have a large number of node and uh maybe multiple instance of your services because you are working now on microservice that could be costly to open so many connections to connect to your cluster but it was before Stargate now with Stargate this proxy not only you still have the SQL to connect to but also the three uh for now stateless and point graphql grpc rest AG node without any data and it's pretty clever because with that the Stargate node here in yellow can join the gossiping of the Castle High cluster so the target is token aware and it will act as coordinator node for your request so with that you keep you can keep using the consistency level everything would work the same without without it now I told you Stargate is not a single pull of failure so what you want to do is have multiple Stargate and put some load balancer on top of Stargate nodes to do some stateless load balancing I told you there is no stickiness so that's pretty cool with that schema you can notice that you can scale the Stargate layer without scaling the data before with customer if you need more that if you need more capacity at you have to add new node but if you need more throughput you also have to add new node sometimes you add you know just to improve the the throughput including disk where disk we are not really needed now we started we split the compute and the storage and you can only scale the compute layer if you want to do so pretty amazing so I I gave you the the overall architecture of the the proxy but let's have really a look of what what is available and you know let's not do only slide but you know let me show you and and play a bit with it all together so the Stargate rest API so-called rest API uh is really a way to expose all the features that you can do with the castle language as rest so you find the same keyword key space table colon user-defined types so if you already know customer language you won't get lost okay not only target provide the endpoint but also the Swagger definition or open API specification and by just starting the node you will see you can access the web page and start using the API using this video you will find two parts in most of the API one is for ddl so data definition language so all about the schema over here and the second version is the DML everything related to data so working with raw Advil retrieve rows it's of course recommended to query by the primary key okay this is how you work with we also put some dedicated endpoints to retrieve all the rows um but you still have to you know provide the partition key otherwise you need a low filtering and it's super slow of course okay so um you know enough me talking and only slide let's have a look of what we can do so if I move to my here screen I do have a GitHub repo for you so let me copy the GitHub repo for you for YouTube bootmark so it could be that in the chat right now um and there it will explain how to start the cast on her node and start some Stargate on top of it so how to install Docker how to install Docker compose um how to start the demo so cloning this this repo do some Docker compose up in the instruction you will start a three node cluster with the key space and replication factor three and you will get one target so that's overall four containers to run okay so you can see here it localized you can also and this is what I will do today go to stargate.io Just target.io yes also ping you here like that go to the documentation pick one of the API quick start and here you will have a single toker run to create the Stargate node in developer mode and now these node this container will act both at the Stargate node and Castle holding your data that's just a convenient way to run some tests so this is what I will do and I do have it running right now so if I keep moving here you can see that I do have some uh Docker Stargate started I also have a SQL sh as a Docker container I don't know if you are aware but the Nuvo provides some Stargate not on this target but SQL sh Q lsh dokyo node and I just bring back this commands so hey this is this is what it looked like and with that you will have a SQL sh running and this is what I do I do have as well here this is my SQL sh so if I if I go back here so I do have running the Stargate and I can access the API on localhost and I also have my SQL research over here so I can here describe the key spaces for you and see that as of now I do have the system key space and a key space here called Java and with that I'm all set I do have the target upgrading and I do have a secret message to see what's happening in Casa so going to step three use SQL API let's see what we can do right so first what we need to do is to create a key space ks1 so here I will in my I will go in my secret search console copy that oh you know what I was too fast I told you it's a single node so what I would like to do is really to put my replication factor to 1. and here I'm good to go so I will then use my key space okay and I will create two class two tables so one table and one user defined type so video and Here video format as a user defined type okay so nothing new here really the the default way to use a and if I describe my key space you will see my objects ready to go okay so here I do have a user defined time and a table so then I can populate some data so here just copy pasting you can insert the reason in question it's not a well-known features to be honest but you know you should use it uh more um except it will enter your table only if you match the target schema otherwise you know so it's G is Anointed but here you do have a schema you need to match a schema so you can retrieve the videos like of course select star but you can also retrieve the uh one single video because here if I recall video ID is both my primary key and full partition key I can also select Json from video just to retrieve items as a Jesus but here nothing really new to show to you now stop the magic so this is my Swagger and I would like to use the data API because data and schema are the rest part and if you go if you see here we do a V1 and V2 I would like to use V2 it's the most up-to-date and this is as we can see where we do have most of the endpoint now so let's see what we can do so step four use the rest API and uh we need to get a token so with this curl command so let me go here and tell that curve command and as an output I get a token over here a token that will be available across old Stargate API for 30 minutes by default okay so let's copy that guy and move to the striker UI so first what I can do here is list the key space so uh V2 schema key space so houseworks it's the first time we are doing that you just press try out provide your token execute and here you see the result so we do have here system distributed system Java and we do uh we do have here cat is one the one that we just created together here I do have a data center because I created the key space with the network topology if you use Simple strategy for your replication strategy when you create a key space you will get only the name Okay so it seems like the API is working so what can we do we can list the table so get all our table try out providing case one as my key space here I do the video table we create together I can also retrieve the user defined type so here if I go to now types tryouts and provide the same key space we should find our UDT which is video format over here okay so far so good but it's not only retrieving stuff from the schema you can also create some tables so here I do the create table try it out on the key Space Case one and here look at what the the Jesus look like you need a double name Define the primary key providing partition key clustering key and the rest of the colon definition and the table option so here I will Define a table user first name last name email color first name partition key last name Crystal and colon and the last name clustering column ordering will be asked copy here pasting here and executed that so let's see so 201 HTTP code for created if now I go to list the table and re-execute that again I do have my video but also I do have my users table over here okay so far so good so now if I want to insert some rows in my table you know doing the full create read up they delete Circle so I will move from schema to data DML so we created some some table let's put some stuff in there so locate V2 so post key space table name here so try it out provide my token provide my keyspace name my table name it's users and here this is how we enter values so we put some p-value key value key value totally generic and with that we will be able to enter some values so here the full formic is written Cedric and then here and I can add another second one and third one yeah you know nothing special here but it's cool to see uh here that you can enter stuff oh I still have here my SQL sh I can uh select uh anything from the table we just created which is now users see so it's not it's not it's not a recorded video or something we are really working with so I had multiple read multiple rows so now if we just want to retrieve the rows I can try it out okay I need my token again so let me copy my token here retrieve the rows display his name table name I think it was users the fields that's pretty cool here I do have everything but let's say I only would like to retrieve uh I don't know first name I can just say hey um well I would like to retrieve just the first time so let's see here it goes and here at the output you see uh only the first name has been retrieved so it's kind of what graphql can do limited the payload output just providing exactly what you need and that's that's pretty uh pretty cool for rest uh I can delete the row same so here I will go here try it out here so this is oh I always need to copy my token from code to call here and I will delete my row key space guys one table users primary key so here I will use my um here and here I provide the [Music] partition key to do a delete at the partition level so you can delete multiple rows in the single single call this is why here we do have a s at rows okay so far so good so keep moving we can also search the table and it will be my I think my last uh Pi invocation for the rest so go to search a table try it out provide the token that I keep ing from one code to another here it is uh get the key space so it's still S1 table name no change users and here I can provide a where close and the workloads will be uh in Json format like that where first name equals David and we can say hey maybe I would like something more so I just say comma and here I add a second filter if I want to and so I just execute that and I have nobody called David in my database I think it was Kirsten right and here I do have just then retrieved okay the requests are paged in the same way as the query are our page in SQL only using um you know by default it's 5000 for the batch phase in HTTP because it's quite variable the default patch size is about it's it's 20. and you can provide here the page size when you search for a table here it is pitch size okay so that was the rest API really really close to what you can do in uh cql so here we delete so like only custom remain so that's cool but we do have way better for you so second apis that Dua for you is the document API so I show you just before that you can indeed run some Json insert and retrieve with but you need a schema schema validation and nested object is pretty dangerous because you will need to create some tombstones especially if I mean because the nested type needs to be frozen so what can we do well uh what we want to do is to be schemales or to be more accurate validation-less because you want to insert jizan a Json document doesn't have a schema you know you cannot put anything in reason you still have that security bracket and double quote fill name semicolon double quote value so it's you still have a format for a Json object but there is no real validation so we would like to insert those Json no rule how can you do that well we will use something called the document API there were ideas really to insert and retrieve any Json and do not care anymore about the schema but it's more advanced than just saving some text on the colonial what we do is we are using something called the document shredding so for now instead of talking about table we are talking about collection and each time you create a collection through the API a technical table will be created always the same schema always the same column names and you will have here a key which is the document ID multiple po to PN having multiple layer multiple levels in your design and at the end the terminal value the leaf so let's share with what it look like so if I give you this Json ABC first level AC second level B1 so two rows in Castle so Hicks is my document ID PO is the first level so a do we have a second level yes we do it's B do we have a third level no so P2 will be empty everything will be empty up to here it's a dupe value so I will fill double value if it would be a string it would be text value but hey that's really how it works on the other Hood focus on our experts the rest API will do the abstraction for you you don't have to know all these internals to use the API but still that's cool to know how it works for the second row C each does the first level so here I do have POC and P1 is null and I do have terminal value two I could do the same with a list so now C contain not just the value 2 but a list containing object D2 so now the second row is so first row is the same second row C so now P1 a we so we don't have a name so it will be a list so the trick here is to provide the index of the leaks so square brackets index square bracket and get the nested object so here I do have D which is the attribute name and two which is the value yeah it's working like that and with that let's go back to the demo board and doing a little bits of documents magic so I will get back my token so I think we use it for search the last time my token is still valid for 30 minutes so now I will move to the document part so what I would like to do is say hey so first I can list the namespace and don't be surprised the name size are exactly the same as a key space but for someone working with a document API and database like they like to talk about namespace to collection document so in the document API we are reusing the same attributes so here I can insert uh I mean create a document so let's create a document so let's see uh create a collection so let's see create a create a documents it should be green because we create something create a document here we go so try it out provide here namespace ID well I would like to reuse the same namespace or key space that we use until now case one collection ID hey um I can put whatever I like if the collection ID does not exist it will be created when I ask to insert the document so I can here use Curl one for collection one and here this is my Json uh providing here a video see we've nested uh item format frame here so execute that and as an output it's if everything okay I will get a token ID okay so not a token ID but an ID so that is my document ID okay so what we can do first is retrieve this guy uh you know like get document by ID so search document in the correction get a document over here try it out here I will provide the document ID immediately I will also uh find my location token namespace ID no change collection ID I put color one and here you can retrieve your document by ID 404 so do I oh I see I let my quotes at the end and here I got my document okay so we did the read we can retrieve the document by searching so I'm not sure that I would like to execute it but if you search for documents such documents in the collections uh here you will provide as usual token namespace collection ID and the workloads so the workload is could be would be the same as the workloads that I show you for the rest so stem structures like we are close where equals blah blah blah something like that okay um and you execute you get the item retrieve you know what let's do it so what we did I did retrieve the documents so what I do have get a document get the document get a hearing okay just to be able to copy paste the attributes so this is my took an ID okay namespace is one again collection ID hey here we go and we are close here we go so let's see if we can retrieve our guy says so the workload is working and uh as before here you do have uh fields to retrieve and maybe I only want I don't know um frames so I only want the friends back but requests so hey field name so maybe now he needs some stuff like that let's see not sure what why field names of is it frame valid let's go back with my objects yeah probably that just me frames frame frame frames and sure do you like emails better or do you need some code Codes okay so you want something like that hey here we go and you want an array so what we would like was frames uip with frames hey here we go so as you can see um here I do have the list of fields provided as an array okay so we created the doc we retrieve the dog we search for dogs delete would work exactly the same and which is cool uh uh I mean cool so if we describe now the tables we do have a new tables called call one and if I selects uh anything from these color one you will see that it's uh pretty do I use okay you will see that it's uh pretty Square sketch we do have P0 up to P 63 here um yeah so 64-bit and here you see all the so P key is your document ID PO is my email everything is empty up to my leaf stuff as I told you before okay it was the uh document API we finally we would like to show you the graphql so graphql release uh it's not so new it's almost 10 years but it it's really changed or became more visible when it it was announced in 216 that GitHub will be using graphql moving forward it's pretty interesting because you can have a single endpoint and multiple way to consume the endpoint so it's a way to implement API and prioritize giving customer precisely exactly what they need so you describe your data with entities you import your your schema and then when you create a query you exactly provide what you need same as the endpoint I I show you before just list exactly what you need and get predictable results okay so in Stargate until now I've shown you uh the SQL endpoints the rest and points with swagger let's move to graphic and endpoint graphql tool is you don't have multiple graphql two one is the playground one is graphic UL in size targets playground is provided so let's see what we can do again my nice stuff so here I'm moving to a graphql I will move to the playground so here it is guess what no new I need a token so can I steal the token somewhere it would be good so first I need a token so let's put my token as a either and execute that so if you we are invoke we invoke the endpoint on the schema so ddl so graphql schema and I use um a first query just to list the key space which is needs with graphql is you do the list of everything available here on the right side so I'm able to list the key space the table inside the key space so anything read-only is queries and indeed to edit the data are mutation so no nothing new for you working with Casa it's also called mutations okay so let's see what we can do we open the graphql playground and so what we want to do in the key space uh uh let's say create a table so in the key space S1 let's create the table books and the table Auto okay so this is how we create those in playground you do after completion so you know what parameter to provide and if you look at the schema so here that the schema table names partition key values pretty close pretty close to what we had in rest API right let's try to create my uh let's try to create my tablets over here so it seems happy um can I have my sanity check described Evers here we go we do have books and uh authors okay that's good okay um this is my token let's switch to the data so to go to the data I switch tab I'm now using the graphical tab different tab is different process on playground I need to provide again my token and here I would like to work with the key Space Cat S1 the one we keep working until now and I will populate my table providing so-called limitation and here we go so in the key Space Case one I will work with my uh book stable so because I because I design two tables now look at that I do have uh authors books to work with for books I I can I do have these uh query to work with books this is exactly what I will do after this one and I also have the insert video insert user insert books speaking of which it seems like in their books does not have these um capital letter for b and it should work better like that and here I do have two books in my table books sanity check uh from books here they are okay but I can also retrieve them using a query and here it is here is my query so query on book providing the title and if I only want the title I do that and if I want more than the title and that's that's exactly what you want to do with graphql if you also want the auto just ask for the author and here we go it will be based on exactly what you need um everything I just was on local Stargate you can also work with a star it's free to use up to 80 gigabytes and 40 million queries a month so in the instruction here you have some command how to do so but I you know I I won't do it in front of you I will keep moving with the presentation okay um okay this is my slide over here okay so we did a demo of the three big apis uh so what's next what can we talk more about it well if you look at the end points that quite some work right so many things there are so many so many endpoints to to learn and if you want to build your app on top of the API maybe you don't want to implement all the rest calls I know it's fun but maybe if we could provide you something better that will be uh you know welcome well my team is leading the SDK building so we do have three sdks for you Java JavaScript python if you remember my bio in the first slide you know I'm a totally Java guy so I will talk uh on the Java one now but everything that I show or do would be the same with JavaScript and python okay so um in you have multiple libraries you have the Stargate SDK to only interact with Stargate and this is the one I will show you in a minute but I also told you about Astra which is cast on R plus Target plus Pulsar in the cloud as a software as a service for free and here you do have the Stargate SDK leveraging the uh as high as detail operates Target SDK and to even to build some spring application for the Java one at least there is a spring boot starter so just import the starter enter a couple of keys and you're good to go all the SQL session will be provided to you so um I think I do have time for a little bit of uh Free Fall stuff like every everybody love at conference live coding okay so here I do have a a project and I I mean it's the Stargate SDK itself but it's just a product project where we imported the Stargate SDK so uh we will do a first method and what we will do is uh it's a test okay let's have fun blah blah blah import what I need okay so I need to work with Stargate so Stargate is auto closable so I would say I would like a Target client I will call it SC Stargate client dot Builder dot build okay I will open that okay so now I start thinking Builder okay so I need to provide a stuff we know that Stargate is running locally so with uh credentials we we have used cast on Hardcastle up to connect until now okay that's it uh I think we also need a contact points uh let's say I mean it's it's not even mandatory we are working locally so uh look at those okay and we want to enable um we want to enable those targets so we will say with API node so we have a single Data Center so Stargate client will do the load balancing failover if you do have multiple node I told you about the client-side load balancing but the I mean uh server load balancer but here the library also do a client load balancing okay so here I need a Stargate node config and I use all the defaults so I can simply say look localhost or just say hey both will work and with that if everything is okay I should be happy so let's see what you can do which Target API it's a free and a Target client it's a print API so I can let's use the rest API for instance and let's uh list the key space so here I do have this stream of keyspace name so what I will simply do is uh just system that out println right so if everything is okay I can run that guy and I will see the key space names in the console so run as soon test and here we are so live coding no demo effect so because I provided a contact point I don't have the SQL session enabled and because I provide a HTTP endpoint I'd have all the Three Guys open I provided data center name so the data center name is used in the SQL session but if I drop that the library use some default but it should tell you that hey man you should provide stuff okay so here it is no contact Point provided using default no data center provided using default data center one so um yeah now the guy is pretty pretty intelligent and will do it for you uh what can we do um and then I will just show you a last slide okay uh what we can do I don't know uh let's try to well with cql okay so SQL session dot get we know it's working dot execute so what do we want to execute uh select uh let me see data center from local home system okay dot one we know on local there is a single one that gets string okay so we want the data center value and because I'm lazy I will probably just output that in my console this is out okay here we go yeah okay let's run that uh do we have the data center I don't like the warning so I will put that hey hear that it's it's working um yeah uh yeah they do collection no I think I think we could hey uh let's maybe let's display a document and and then we will be that okay so a c dot API document space so I think the namespace we created was um S1 okay dot collection uh so which collection did we created together I think it was call one right we did call one okay and say I don't know um I don't know I don't know I don't know um find all yeah but I would need some some some some some objects to to retrieve them uh let's see what can do oh so I will just retrieve the collection definition okay let's do that correction definition look at this volts and I think it should be optional because we don't know if the guy is there okay and so what we want to do is see if is empty okay I don't need that anymore and if he's empty and I hope it is can what can we show you then to retrieve some data I need an object that match that structure blah blah blah called def.get that I don't know get name okay let's do that here here here all that to just display uh color one but you know never mind just for you to grasp how to use it just say uh the API you need the namespace you need the collection you name and here so yeah the connection one exists and his name is collection one then with that guy I can find but it will it gives me back some some object oh I think I I think can use string so okay so yeah I'm running out of time okay so stream the documents but you know when you love when you like coding and here I would like to do find oh and the guy I would like you to give me just string give me the reason I don't care about marshalling okay um so what do we have here is it happy with that okay the same C is okay so and now what we want to do is say hey call like like we do here okay so we don't need the output we just want to do that okay so hopefully never tried that before so document namespace collection find all as string I don't need any I don't need any uh class and this is something we should provide in the in the SDK to BNS not to have to provide stuff so let's see is it happy now it's not that b it cannot Marshal the the stream itself so I need really to provide an object and not a string but hey so I public class video and I think we use something called like and I will be done okay so blah blah blah video ID video video video video video ID okay are you up here with that hopefully it won't ask for everything so um public string blah blah blah generates killers and sellers okay and default Constructor okay all right and it's a public static class okay so now what about now are you happy with that public static class video Blah Blah Blah okay and now if I want to retrieve that strings but video iup and would be my last try because I still have one slide hey we do have a document so yes so for each we know that we do have the documents so let's show the document ID so not documents come and say like stop playing yeah anyway the the video is is here has been retrieved as a document okay um so we also provided that that's like a way to deploy both Cassandra and Stargate in kubernetes environments by the way this is exactly what we do have in um in US top and it's a way to expose targets uh at external and with that I think I cover it all uh next week we will have grpc and the demo will take even more time but until now I hope you enjoy it this is my coordinates uh if you want to join my network would be happy to have you and thank you for your attention and I will be with the others in the ask me anything question if you do have question because I think I've used all my time thank you very much and hello everyone here we are ready for the application development Workshop so we've been announcing that in the other room the workshop Workshop room that due to technical glitches we had to swap so if you are for if you are in for the certification talk I advise you to please join the workshop room because here now we are speaking about application development so without further Ado I will start okay so application development you I think by now you know much about Cassandra you know what kind of database it is you know how you have to approach modeling the data for your application now it's time to speak what happens when you want to actually write your application you have an application that you're about to create and you need a layer for this application to communicate to the database right so you need a layer between your actual app logic and the database storage Cassandra usually what is the answer the answer is you need a driver whether you have an API or you have a say a serverless function because of your architecture choice anyway you need drivers to to access the database well that's the standard answer I'll mention that there is a different answer at least Cassandra offers a different answer called Stargate which is something Cedric has described extensively in a previous talk in this room it is basically an API data layer that makes it possible to access the data in Cassandra or astral B for that matter by means of simple HTTP request by using different paradigms so you can use you can look at your data as a document API a graphql protocol whatever but and that's very cool because it's uh it makes it possible to just use HTTP requests from inside your application or your API today however we will stay on the Classic route and we will speak about drivers so that's also because Target was already described so let's go back to drivers there are drivers for Cassandra for ma for the most popular languages you see C C plus plus C sharp Ruby you name it node python Java and they more or less all offer the same set of advanced functionalities as you can see here many of them we will see more in detail later so just mention that today we are going to focus on the node.js drivers that's not uh particularly limitation of this talk because most of the feature you'll see um will be will have their equivalent in the other uh India in the drivers for the other languages so we will just stick to node okay so this talk um we have one hour and well we have 45 minutes now so even so there will be unfortunately no time to have a real Hands-On with you but I will provide you and I'm doing that in this slide I will provide you with all necessary information to go there and do the practice yourself today I will just show you a little demo now the drivers for node uh well you find the documentation at this address here and I also give you here the address of a repository containing all the practice code all the code that is used for the practice that um the demo that I'm showing now but this repo contains much more now let me okay so you see this GitHub immediatilos Etc this is my GitHub and let me show you very briefly this is the Repository and it is not just a bunch of lines of code but it has an actual readme that makes this repo a self-service say exercise room so you can start reading and there are all instructions to set up your testing environment starting from creating your database if you want to use Astra DB or using Cassandra that's say using a standard default Cassandra installation that's your choice so this repository guides you through setting up your environment in terms of dependencies creating the database connecting to it creating the the you will need a database a key space connection so parameters to connect whether you're using astral b or Cassandra you see there is all there are all details so in order to start running some sample code which I will do momentarily you also have to load some data in your database and there is it is all explained here by the way there was a question in the ask me anything session about how to load CSV into Astrid B and we answered yes you can by the way this repository in the instructions tells you also how to do that for a simple reason that in order to test the code we need a table and I will quickly show you how what what is in this table in this test table to just run some rating code so creating the table populating the table with some data okay at this point you have your if you if you do it if you do these practice by yourself at this point you will have your database your data everything ready to just run the code luckily I already did that for you so I have already my database called node practice and if you go looking at it let I will keep the SQL console ready to double check what happens with the driver code you will see desk key spaces sorry less key spaces you will see that there is a key space called chemistry that's the testing key space so if I use that you will notice that there is a single table here called elements and if you select from elements a bunch of lines you will see that there are chemical elements so symbol atomic mass atomic number name and partition key is simple it is just a table with a hundred or so rows for testing okay so back to the repository this is the situation we start from and now let me go back to the slides back to drivers so we are in node.js and we want to connect to Cassandra or to Astra DB for that matter first how do you install the drivers well that's a standard npm install on or in terms of a of a package Json file this is what you probably want to use independencies nothing particularly strange right and let's go on so how do your drivers connect to the cluster when you start using them in your code well let me say that the drivers are pretty clever because you know that Cassandra is cluster ring but luckily when you instantiate your driver from your application site or your API site you will just need to provide one to maybe possibly three at least contact points which means just the IP address of a few of the nodes but actually you can also do with one unless that one is down the point is that you give the drivers just the contact points which are the purple nodes in this sketch and then what happens the driver speaks with these contact points and asks hey tell me the topology of your whole cluster luckily these purple nodes as any other are constantly gossiping to each other and they are all updated to the current status of the whole cluster so the purple node answers back to the driver and tells hey this is the topology now from that point on the driver knows the whole topology and is able to speak to the whole cluster for any query that will come that opens the way and indeed drivers Implement that that opens the way to load balancing and other clever things such as going straight to the right node when you specify a partition key for example which is something that all Cassandra drivers are able to do okay so more let's look at some code most of this presentation will show code with some commentary by the way something that is very important is that uh in in the repository you also find these slides so you can go there and download the slide deck and look at it at your leisure so okay so how do you connect to Cassandra well you you require you import this dependency so a standard driver and then you instantiate a client object passing a config object in particular one of the parameters is this contact Point as I said it's a list of IP addresses then you call client connect you do whatever you have to do and then for cleanup or resources you should always do client shutdown that's it so that's how you create a client and keep the connection okay the client should be a Singleton so one single instance should be shared by throughout the whole process now a detail if you instead of using uh the standard Cassandra you want to use asteroid B good the only difference is the config object that you pass to the client when you instantiate so instead of giving the IP and possibly credentials you will give this particular kind of objects and by the way the Astra the Astra UI will tell you exactly how what to do so you need a secure connect bundle which is the location of a zip file that you previously downloaded containing basically a bunch of certificates and similar connection information and then you will have also a client ID and a client Secret that will make your connection authenticated um okay so as is best practice in this case obviously these variables are to be treated as secrets so they are in some environment variable probably out of your repo or whatever and so here in the code I'm reading them from the process from the com the environment variables okay so let's look at the First full example so by the way on screen on the slides I will pretend I'm speaking to a standard Cassandra installation so you will see here IP addresses while the code that I'm running will be exactly the same except I will use uh Astra DB config so I will contact the Astra instance that you just saw here the one with my chemical elements so what does this snippet of code do it will connect to my client and then in the main function I open the connection I run a query I take the result and iterating over the result I just print them now something is already clear in this case when I want to run a query a SQL query it is just a string that I will pass as argument to the method execute so client.execute query then something so this execute method in this way will return a promise I will then act in the then part of the promise and the promise will so the Callback in the promise will have a result and this result is an object with a rows and a rows is something I can iterate every item in the row will have name symbol Etc and those are exactly the name of the columns so if everything works I have here and node a heavier shell ready to use if I'm not mistaken I already sourced the environment variables with the connection parameters I already npm installed everything so I should be able to just run node code and this is this is exactly what you find in the repository the sample Snippets of code connect connection Astra so let's see what happens if I run this code this is exactly what you saw in in this live aha look I am reading all the chemical elements and I'm printing one by one name and symbol you see all of them at the end I will close the connection and these happens here after the iteration over the rows so this is a way to this is a very simple case where I just open the connection do a query read the results and act iteratively over every Row in the results cool let me just mention that the client connection can be configured in various ways for example here I am explicitly specifying a load balancing policy that as I mentioned earlier is token aware so it will try to go for the correct node holding the data for that partition I'm asking so this happens on the driver level so I will directly contact the right node once I know the whole top once the driver knows the whole topology of the cluster it will be able to just go straight to the node containing my data I also set an explicit reconnection policy a retry policy so there is quite an amount of configurability in how the the client is instantiated okay so let's have a closer look at how you query the data okay so something that you already saw is that to run a query basically you take a SQL statement as a string and you give it as argument to client execute command now uh you have noticed already that there are a few awaits here and there and I also mentioned that client execute returns a promise well that's not entirely true but one of the ways to use it yes it is promise based alternatively the same command can be invoked to give to in a callback fashion so let me just run this very small snippet of code as you see there is a string that contains a whole SQL statement that creates a new table so this new table is called metals and it has columns that are kind name density so this is a specialized table to hold information about metals how do you run this command you just client dot execute creation command so let me run this to do that I will open a interactive rapple to node just because I want to recycle this connection while I run example after example so this is exactly the creation command you saw in the slides so there is a whole string that is create table Etc and I use client execute so let me just run this thing creating a table is a scheme operation so it's a ddel operation and it takes some time very much more than inserting data or treating data but it has executed and let's see desk tables because I have my SQL console here in Astra UI and sure enough my metal stable is there so desk table Metals let's see and there we go this is exactly the table we just created in node using the drivers listen so how you write data well the Baseline case is a long string with the very same thing you would type into cql as I do here so client execute insert blah blah blah blah blah well this I can run for sure and I will do that that's exactly the same I just client execute a long string it is run let's see select slot from where I was inserting in metals so let me read what is in metals okay I inserted copper copper is a regular metal and it has a density well let me tell you copper has a much higher density this is a mistake but okay I pretend copper is very lightweight okay so that's a way but that's absolutely far from being the right way because I'm just writing everything into a long string and that's I might have to I might have traveled with escaping quotes uh that's not efficient when it comes to serializing numbers and it is also in general prone to injection attacks as you know let's say I'm writing an API I certainly don't want user defined user provided input to end up in such a statement right injections and all that kind of risk so I can do much better I can do much better means I can separate logically the statement or better the blueprint for a statement from the actual values so you see client execute then first argument is insert statement with placeholders for the values and then I put the values in an array that is matching these question marks but you see in this case I need a third argument which is type hints that's because Cassandra has a very rich type system it has text floats which are not the same as integers and so on and JavaScript is not a match it does not match that type system so in order to make sure types are properly treated in Cassandra I have to explicitly provide type hints so I'm telling that the first argument is a text the second is the text and the third is a float as opposed to a double for example let me run this statement this is another insertion where I insert the metal Palladium and there we go let me do my check and sure enough Palladium ends up in the table now let's do an experiment let me comment out the type hint and run this insertion again uh oh something went wrong and if you look at this message it really smells like a type mismatch kind of thing connected with serializing indeed okay but I can do even better because probably if I'm doing insertion over insertion I'm running statement after statement um I'm probably not in the mood of providing type hints all the time it's really cumbersome right so I can use prepared statements what does it mean well I have my statement look at this first definition I have a string that is my blueprint for an insertion and I I call client execute blueprint arguments and then I pass a third option object that is prepared through so what does prepare mean well it means dear driver speak with the Cassandra machines with the Cassandra nodes and ask them to kindly prepare their knowledge over types and get this statement ready for the next times I will so the first time the nodes will get knowledge on on the types connected to the fields that I'm writing then every next time the statement is run again I will just have to pass the data and the serialize the serialization with knowledge of the types will be automatic and indeed as you see I can promise you that in the next block of code where I insert Mercury this prepared through again the second statement will not trigger again a lookup in the schema it will just plain simply pass the data and they will be serialized the right way because I already had the node prepare knowledge of the types and see there are no type hints anymore uh by the way these two examples also show that the the second argument can be passed either as an array or as a name as an object with names matching the column names so you see here I have an array zinc but for mercury I'm passing an object that basically uh reflects the shape of the table and the column names let me run this part as usual so I have my prepare statement which is just the string then I execute insertion of zinc now trust me that there has been some special communication between the driver and the nodes and the nodes now are primed to later accept the fast fast serialization of the of new insertion data without the need to look up again the types and there are no type hints anymore now another small look at the table and sure enough Mercury and zinc have arrived properly yeah okay now uh something more on rights I mentioned promises indeed if you call execute client execute with this three argument syntax the first is a statement of insertion then there is the array or the object with the values the third might be this option set prepared through usually and this is a promise then I can have my then statement and my catch statement as usual so in this case I'm inserting well somebody hijacked my database and I was I wanted to use them for Metals but somebody wants to use that for metal bands so they are inserting AC DC which is not a regular metal but it's a band okay but still this client execute will probably succeed in which case I will have I will see this console log AC DC inserted executed so let's check this insertion of AC DC and that's exactly the code that now here I prepared a long text file with all Snippets of code that I wanted to show you in the repo you will find them at every one of them as Standalone code so just everyone will be just a run with the usual so as a script in itself so don't worry oh it works you see I have my nice console log so everything worked cool uh alternatively to the promise API I can use a callback based API and that's very simple because the same client execute statement will just have a fourth argument which is a callback a two argument callback so either error or result will be non-null so if I if if I have no error the insertion worked if I have an error I will have to print whatever it is so you see now I'm inserting another metal band Iron Maiden and I expect this statement to succeed so I probably will see Iron Maiden inserted let's see Iron Maiden and if I run the snippet yes I've made an inserted let's have a quick look at the method Table and there we go AC DC Iron Maiden with uh type band very good okay now let's speak about reading um how do you read data from the database well again nothing so much different I use client execute I just have a different query a select instead of an insert probably and even here I can use the placeholder syntax and provide the value separately so now I am reading every every metal of kind band so I will probably just see my two metal bands so you see I'm just reading and now the then called the Callback Associated to the promise will look at result dot rows which is a list I can iterate on it and now in this case I just you know print some one line for every band that I'm reading so here I'm reading name and density for the metal band let me run this small snippet so it's a promise based way of reading and let me make a bit of room there we go so here everything worked and that's how you read that's one of the way you can read Because In The Same Spirit you can also use the Callback way of things as you saw ready for writing execute now will have a fourth argument which is a function of two arguments in itself and the second is the result now for some reason I want just to read the copper the one line the one row of copper so I'm reading from Metals where kind equal something and name equals something in particular regular metal copper is the name so I can just read read rest DOT first which will be a single row and this row will have density because I selected density you see in the blueprint of this of the query so let me just show this at work and there we go copper density by the way I reiterate that copper is very much heavier okay okay so uh reading there are various other ways of reading one is this each row method so each row is basically contains iteration over all rows matching my select each row returned by this select will be subject to the fourth argument so each row has five arguments the fourth one is a callback to be run on each individual returned row and the fifth will be called in case of errors or with a null argument when just the the when I exhaust the number of the rows so when every row has been returned then at the end this fifth argument which is a callback will be called with argument null this is when I sorry here so in the console log finished reading usually I might want to be clean up so shutting down the client so as you see this query will just look at all regular Metals printing uh name and symbol of the density sorry name and density of the metal let's run this small piece of code and this is just a Showcase of the each row method and there we go including the callback for when the query exhausted all of its results okay this is just a quick tour let me just mention that you can also run batches so you can run batches very easily you can just you just have to wrap the every statement making the batch in an array and then you have this nice method client.batch that's it the rest works like like usual so either promise or callbacks and etc etc uh I will skip that to be to make sure to finish on time there's nothing particular unexpected there okay so before going on I'll mention that the the issue of execution profiles that's very useful because consider a real a real life application will probably have need to support different workloads at once so you might have a single application that needs a different uh consistency level here a different timeout there it needs to work on a specific data center there all on a single driver on a single connection how do you do that well you can when you instantiate the client as you see here I am passing uh um in the options profiles object so an object with profiles which is a list of profiles which are instantiated here and each one of them might overwrite some features some settings such as timeout consistency levels and so on and this is just this just makes the client ready to use one or the other of the profiles now the client is ready is primed to do that and when I run queries you see I have a select that so I have two different select here three actually and if I pass in the options which execution profile to use I will this query will be run with one or the other of the settings so this is how you achieve mixed workload in your node application and again this is not much different from what happens in JavaScript in sorry in Java or in Python the concepts are very much the same uh that's there's much more that you can configure so you can you can pass many other options to each row methods to execute method and so on you can directly set the consistency level as you see here you can Define the fetch size more on that later you can redefine the timeout for that one query execution policies and so on okay now I want to show you very quickly a mini API a full-fledged mini API you remember the table with Metals let me show that to you again I had my tables here my my methods here and they are they come into waste into types so there are regular Metals which are actual Metals as in chemistry sense and then there is this Intruders somebody is making fun of my chemistry for some reason my my customer Works in a Metallurgy and they want an API to make me make it possible to you know create and read make actual metal properties from this table and there we go this is a full API written in Express very simple that showcases what you can what you how you can use Cassandra drivers within a typical JavaScript API so you see there is the usual Express stuff there are a few endpoints in the root uh in inside the code Associated to the three routes I use my clients so the client is a as a good the Singleton is instantiated here in the outside before the three endpoints and then for every end point I just you know use the client execute stuff and maybe return stuff that's very simple the code is there in the repo uh what happens let's look so uh obviously you can do any kind of make of a usage of the Express properties in your query so for example in the get metal by name that will give me back one single metal and its properties I'm using the rec params name as part of the query for example or in in the post to create a new metal I will use the rack body adding something maybe for an insertion of a new metal so it so happens that I have this API ready to run so let me close the interactive rifle and let's see node code API api.js so now the API is there ready running let me open another console and I will just run a bit of curls so okay maybe this so the API is ready for me on Port 5000 you see with this first curl I'm just getting back all metals of the regular kind as you see here in in the queries so let me run this curl you will probably see a bunch of yeah a bunch of metals nicely formatted as Json or I can look for a single metal with a curve with the this get sorry I did something very stupid I think I didn't insert silver because that was inserted in the batch so I have to run okay I can change the metal to another one let's say copper there we go so I have my Nice metal back so everything seems to work and now I will insert a new metal called armonium which by the way does not exist for real but I'm having fun of chemistry inserted through is the response so I think harmonium with its funny density has been inserted to my database and let's check and there we go so this API is indeed working that's a very simple example but still okay now [Music] um I want to show you a few things about pagination because that's most often a very important thing now uh when your driver queries so when you query to get data when you do select as we did so far usually you get at most a number of items a number of rows back that is your page size your fetch size and that by default goes to five thousand so a lot of rows and if you are if you are a good developer and you obey the best practice then you are reading from a single partition so you're reading a lot of rows for one single partition if you don't do any kind of pagination and for some reason your partition has even more rows then you will get just five thousand then maybe you want to redefine fetch size to 5 to 2 and you will get just two rows but you might want and the driver is able to handle for you you might want to handle pagination automatically so you want to get rows two at a time but you want to get all of them so two then other two other two other two and from outside from your code you don't want to take care necessarily of all of the intricacies of you know page State and all that to do that you can use the asynchronous iterator and you just run your select with this syntax 408 const row of results and these in this body will be executed for every row and you will not even notice that behind the scenes the drivers and the node and and the Cassandra cluster will have exchanges one after the other of pages so you see in this in this code I'm setting fetch size of 2 which means I'm getting two metals at a time but still you will see that I'm getting I'm printing more than two rows here so pagination with the sync iterators uh let me close the API and run again my client again this is something I'm just doing because I'm lazy and I want to work in a Interactive Rebel so this is the very same code you just saw in the slide and you see I'm printing All Metals more than two right that's because the drivers is I just let the drivers handle all that another way in very similar way is to use the each row method and just pass the option Auto page through that's very much the same I'll skip these but it works again in an automatic way the driver will take over of everything and I will just magically see all rows that I need from the query um but sometimes I need to use manual paging I need to to have explicit control over Pages think about a web application where there is a nice button next results in the interface so it is the user that clicks and triggers the next page so sometimes I need visibility over the actual page State for the next query indeed that can be done with uh well with basically again a combination of execute so the first execute here the first line I'll let reset equal will give me the first batch of results but also potentially will contain a page State then until this page state is not new so as long as it is not null that signals that there are more rows to be obtained I can explicitly read the previous page State and pass it as option as you see here in this last long yellow line I can pass this the previous page State as an option to the next execute invocation and there will be more rows to read so this is how you explicitly look at the pages and handle them and control getting page after page of results so this is manual pagination and let's run this this is exactly the same code that you saw in the slide and there we go so you see I'm explicitly able to control page after page okay um in a similar spirit I can also use the method next page that somehow automates handling of the page state and that's very similar maybe I can show that to you so you see how the page States look like they are as you can imagine very long strings with which I don't my client side is not required to understand it just has to take them and give them back to basically the server okay so there we go you see I am printing the first two lines then I have a given page state that I'm giving back to the next page invocation which happens here I get another batch of two results and so on and so forth as at some point defend the page state is null which means no more results I remind you that I set I still set fetch size to 2 for demonstration purposes then again in for if if your row is small you can also safely get all 5000 or even more if you start having very fat tables with a lot of fields maybe very big fields and so on you might want to make it smaller so you might really have a use for fetch size one two five ten whatever okay so there are other ways to handle pagination this is a nice way so you can use the client dot stream method which provides an object that you to which you attach events so you attach the events readable and end and what is the advantage of this interface it will lazily fetch items from the back end from the database in order to avoid you know filling up your local buffer that is a very valid option especially when you are doing some kind of heavy or anyway long long lasting processing of the results and you want to avoid you know piling up results on your client side so this again is a easily demonstrated here and again it is just doing the same rating of All Metals you see that it's clearly stated what happens when so please have a look at the code all of these examples are basically adapted from the documentation on on the website so if you want to go there there is much more to know obviously this is just the first introduction that should get you going already okay so so far I've been basically showing you how to run cql commands the right way using the drivers what you should know is that if you are more in if you prefer to use models actually the drivers offer also um object mapper options so you can work with models and they are pretty clever meaning that you see I can define a mapper in this way so don't look too much of the details but I can Define this mapper in a way that it is able then to produce models for me this element mapper which is then able to support methods such as insert get or remove and so on and the arguments are just objects so I'm able to basically it's a model interface to the tables and I say to the tables because the the nice twist is that when you instantiate the mapper with more than one table you see this new mapping mapper I can give here more than one table to the argument and if I do that remember the normalization and duplication of data well this mapper is automatically able to come to map insertion of a single object in the JavaScript code to make it be to transform it into several insertions in as many tables and that's very much a useful thing because in in Cassandra this is a solution that is very often used to support for example different queries so just by looking at the column names this piece of code is able to handle basically the normalization in particular multiple insertions and readings so it's a pretty clever thing okay so my demonstration of the node part is over this is obviously just a scratching the surface but uh I encourage you to have a look at the documentation let me just show again this alternative that is Target start gate IO is open source and it can be plugged on top of any Cassandra installation it actually acts as a set of nodes which integrates with the existing cluster and they are nodes that hold no data but they can accept queries so it's a very clever architecture and they make it possible to just use HTTP request according to more than one different uh API paradigm um so yes it's HTTP request but actually there are sdks to for major languages to to make it even more painless to use and the nice thing is that it is just HTTP request in a sense so well this is this has been Illustrated better by Cedric but you can use a document like API which okay here it is a node but behind the scenes what it does is a series of requests so you can also use Curl if you want Postman whatever so request uh it can also support it also supports a graph a graphql interface as you see here but I'm not dwelling much on that and I think I'm very much on time and I come to my conclusion that is I remind you if you want to run the code yourself please have a look at the code sample I will then I will later paste this link into the YouTube chat it's a self-service so please have fun if you want and yeah here is where you can find Astra DB which by the way embeds Stargate automatically so Stargate is there already for you so you can start playing with document API whatever just out of the box um yeah so you find the one thing is that we and in as a data Stacks developer Advocates run very many workshops most of them are centered about usage of uh Cassandra or better Astrid B and most of them maybe all of them now uh showcase the use of Stargate so in this presentation you saw much more about the drivers and but if you are interested interested on various faces of Stargate usage please head to these links and have a look at our workshops which all come in the form of self-service repositories with readme as well then again we have a few resources for Developers so Academy if you want to get certified for Cassandra and but please connect with us on Discord where the discussion goes on and on and on we are happy to have friends there to discuss and help answer your questions whatever well that being said the way ahead is long and interesting just go and create your nice Cassandra application with that I thank you and see you next time thank you imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of Cassandra who grew those Powers until she can multiply it will move with Limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous peace",
