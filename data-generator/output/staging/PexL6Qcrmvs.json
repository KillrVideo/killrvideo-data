    "text": "hey we're live here at strata this is Jeff carpenter with podrick each patent hey everyone and we just want to talk about what's going on here like what's the vibe of this year's strata what is the vibe well we're in strata New York okay different vibe than every other strata you go to yes I think that's an important thing a really nice international audience here like a lot of people from Europe a lot of America yep yeah I've met some and apparently this is the destination for crude South America coming to New York applied a destination that's where you want to go just like we want to go to London yeah what are the big trends what everyone's talking about this year what I I think mostly what I see now is the streaming thing is huge everyone's talking about we are we have peak streaming not quite yet okay I think right now we are heading really quickly towards a trough of disillusionment because everyone that is tried stream is failing miserably okay the other thing that I have noticed is ml is also it's really weird and like machine learning there's leaves trying to figure it out still yeah there's still like four people that figured out how to make it work yeah and they're bragging about it and now there's all these little startups and say we could make you successful right I haven't heard yet a general use case where people feel like they can do it like the average developer working at some company that needs to make a buck right where they use it well enough people need to figure out how to make it work for points in oceans and then we can start to generalize I feel like we're not yet not yet so what did you see well this is a an interesting conference because it's always three conferences in one right so you have the vendor track so a lot of vendor presentations which was great then there are like researchers and people that are just kind of doing cool stuff the technology discovering things I love those ties and then there is kind of like the the major trends that and the messaging that the organizers are really trying to drive so this year that is a little big theme about social responsibility so we've started assembling all this data big data we got a lot of data what are we gonna do with it I know we're gonna use it to drive decision-making good for good hello well so that's this is like the conscience is coming to the floor this year because everyone's like oh my goodness you know we're agents of oppression we're collecting data and then feeding them into models that are reflecting back our biases right back out only at 10 times the signal strength well I've said this before yeah the greatest minds of our generation or in Silicon Valley trying to figure out how to make you buy one or thing right right so I think it's a good challenge like okay all right well how do we make this different how we turn these these skills around for good a lot of great technical details kind of technical nuggets buried in different places maybe nothing gets stood out you noticed any of the swag about the swag which was the best swag you saw a lot of bitchin spinners picture everywhere and then we're giving out socks doctor good data socks not so many t-shirts this year there's a few around that dip seemed like there was a dearth of t-shirts there were guys who's the blue is the SAS handing up beer steins beers yeah the determines were there with the beer and they did up uh not Jews s AP s ap that's right yeah of course and we were very appreciative of that and then there was another booth they were giving away the big Millennium Falcon Lego which I think kind of wins it that's the swag winner in my book oh if three hive watches this video he's gay they were raffle you know I'm not excited about that that was a good move yeah so I mean that's kind of like our insider view in conference but I think if anybody's been in the conference you know this kind of what we're here doing is collecting swag I see people walking around backpack stuff and like working with all that stuff yeah we have gotten this point where technology here is just you look around there's not a lot of super cutting-edge right now in database and Deana yeah it's a lot of maturity and trying to figure that's what it is we're taking on these platforms that new diseases that we've been building these technologies and they're just getting more solid so it's it's less exciting and cutting edge but it's about solidity yeah because there was an explosion all right startups and technologies and all these things put there's a whole different way of working now it's starting to coalesce a bit there so startups they're doing interesting things a lot of our writing streaming email yeah yeah but I think that the coalescence now is turning into like alright getting to the more boring part I'm running on that kind of technology which is the beginning day operation it's all grown-up and responsible now having kid yeah a minivan that minivan Abita yes sir that's what it is yeah I think that's what it is all right well that's it for now and we'll wrap it up for now and look for more content from us on data sacks Academy thanks all right thanks",
