    "text": "hi everyone welcome to Mongoose for Cassandra Developers so hello everyone in the Cassandra Community my name is Val I've been the maintainer of mongoose since about April 2014 nine years long time so what is uh what is Mongoose um I'd like to describe it as the most downloaded database framework for node.js it's an odm for node.js and mongodb some some high level stats according to GitHub Mongoose is used by about 2.8 million public GitHub repos which is pretty extraordinary when you think about it we get about 2 million weekly downloads and about 25 000 GitHub Stars you have this uh here's a little graph showing kind of mongoose's download numbers relative to some other similar tools of the node.js space so it's a lot of talk about mongodb project for a Cassandra conference right well it turns out we're we're going to be introducing Cassandra's support for Mongoose via the Stargate Json API um specifically there's a new Stargate Mongoose driver so what does that mean so that means that Mongoose devs can now start using Cassandra without changing their existing code or with minimal changes to their existing code just plug in Stargate Mongoose and all of a sudden your Mongoose code can start writing data to Cassandra unloading data from Cassandra by the Stargate Json API so Stargate Mongoose is still not production ready it's very early on but we've made a lot of progress and we're excited to share that with you so we have a sample app repo on GitHub just look at the Stargate GitHub organization there's a Stargate Mongoose sample apps repo and so today I'm going to show you a a sample app that we built called iPhone Market it's an e-commerce application on the back end we use Mongoose on the front end there's a view front end application it runs on top of the Stargate Json API and Cassandra assuming that you're running those locally built using full stack JavaScript runs on netplify so let's uh let's take a look so here's the iPhone market app let's say I want to buy an iPhone 12 Pro great a little old but still nice added it to my shopping cart gonna check out oh look I get redirected to stripe how cool can answer in test stripe credentials great now I'm gonna pay and great look my order is confirmed and all that data went through I went through stargate's Json API and was stored in Cassandra so let's go back to slide deck real quick so now that now that you've seen the high level of the sample app let's take a look at what the actual source code looks like so Stargate Mongoose uses mongoose's driver API which lets you plug in a uh a different basically underlying data storage layer for Mongoose so here's some Mongoose code where you import Mongoose set a bunch of global options and set a driver now ideally as a if you want to switch an existing Mongoose application to use to use Stargate those two those two lines of code in the red box on the screen is all you need to change ideally um quick over quick overview of what a cart looks like in um in Mongoose so this is the the cart schema for the for the e-commerce sample app in Mongoose applications the fine schema is not the database so let's take a little a little closer look at what the cart schema looks like um cart model to find a cart schema a schema configures a model so aim cart has four properties items which is an array of objects each item has a product ID and a quantity so you can think the product ID refers to a refers to the iPhone 12 quantity is one order ID is a reference to an order of once you've checked out total is the as the total amount for the total cost of the items in the cart and the stripe session ID stores a the the ID of your current checkout session in stripe um important thing to note is that a schema and a mongoose application is not just a wrapper for create table again the schema is application defined it's not set in Cassandra thanks to uh thanks to the super shredding data model that Aaron and his team have built out the schema lives entirely in the application it's not set at all on Cassandra so that means you as an application developer can keep your application development hat on no need to switch to doing database admin when you want to add a new property to your schema when you're trying to do some local development creating a new cart is easy cart model has a create method that takes in a that takes in a Json object in this case we're creating a new cart with an array of items that's passed in through the HTTP request body and again Mongoose is responsible for for casting and validating the request data so in this case you're just taking data from an HTTP request body and passing it into Mongoose and relying on Mongoose to make sure that items corresponds to the uh to the schema for the cart model so loading a cart um carts also have a find one method that lets you that lets you pull out a a single document that matches the given query filter so query filters are defined using JavaScript objects in this case we have a very simple query that finds one document by a by an ID that's pulled out of the HTTP requests query string however Stargate does support much more complex queries too however you'll have to take a look at the other sample apps to see those for updating a cart um there are several ways to update an existing cart but one particularly interesting one is find one and update again this is a new command that's stated in Stargate Json API it's an atomic find and modify so you atomically load a document update apply some updates and then pass the past the updated document back to the user also supports all sorts of cool query opera or update operators like this dollar push operator lets you update the items array and push on a new quantity and product ID so just to recap list of things that you don't really have to do anymore if you're working with Mongoose you don't have to explicitly create a table anymore you don't have to define a schema in the database you write that in your application and modify it in your application no cql queries just use a just to Define your queries using JavaScript objects and all this adds up to you spending more time developing your application and less time worrying about administering your database locally for uh when you're trying to build an MVP so what's really exciting about this is not only are we bringing modern JavaScript to Cassandra but we're also bringing uh well we're also bringing Cassandra to Modern JavaScript developers um so this this Ecommerce sample app is a full stack JavaScript application built on top of Cassandra via the Stargate Json API we have a serverless backend with async await that's deployed on netlify functions which is netlifies white label the AWS Lambda under the hood front end and back-end are deployed on netlify and um so this means that not only can you start developing full stack applications on top of Cassandra using modern JavaScript but now all of the all the JavaScript developers out there can start using Cassandra with the tools that they're used to using so again Stargate Mongoose is now available so you can go and try it out just remember not production ready but you're more than welcome to please try it out and let us know what you think so thanks very much for listening and here's a cute picture of a mongoose foreign",
