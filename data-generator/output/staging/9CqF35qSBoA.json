    "text": "here we go so welcome to another episode of the C sharp hour here on data Stax Academy last session and yes I'm just diving right in last session we got into schema migration a bit more and I noted that we ought to have a modern up-to-date c-sharp schema migration tool written in C sharp so why not we're moving forward with that today on that Thursday the what is today Thursday the 2nd of May who this year is flying and basically that's what we're gonna be working on today so I hope you are ready for some C sharp code and getting into that all right short order here I'm going to first kind of cover where we had gotten to and let's see if let's get let's get github open here I know one of these I had github open in previously so to be logged in Oh criminy that's what I wanted to show everybody okay let's go down to a quick you're gonna get a screen steal where I do some security stuff real quick [Music] all right there we go and yes I will bounce to the big screen real quick in a minute I just want to cover what we did previously first so it's you gotta use JetBrains rider to get this project started go ahead and open it up and we'll step through that all right so we have a solution file we broke it out to console core Lib core Lib tests so I have a test library project a core library project and then the actual console application itself so pretty good separation of concerns there between the different projects and let's see as soon as we get as soon as I get github run in here again just a second there we go so now let's hear what did we call I think we called it casi schema migrator yeah that's it all right now that is yeah there we go so I started it here just for build and working purposes eventually we'll migrate this over to the data stacks organization a repo but for now I'm going to be working with it from here the environmental tasks I had was here set up a build for our application we need to do that still we didn't need to determine the outputs so that we can build the c-sharp net codes to the various operating systems you need to set up some documentation which will mostly be this readme file schema migration doesn't require a lot of peripheral documentation and then we'll get a local docker ganado prep sassy Cassandra to work from so let's hear I don't think we had these listed out in issues so let's actually take a look these shoes and then let's do this let's create a project schema saundra schema migration MVP so this project is set up to get from nothing to minimum viable project or program minimal Viable Product there we go and we want to hear automated Kanban combine with reviews bug triage come studio yeah we'll do that create the project all right so what is welcome to I don't need all this stuff I think so let's archive that let's archive this or delete it actually delete delete delete delete thank you okay now what I'm gonna do here is actually will get these done and actually get them posted out on Twitch in some other places as we do them but let's here for two dues let's get this over here like this and we'll get us get ourselves organized here alright we need to let Sears set up a build for the application and we need to determine which determined outputs for mac OS linux and windows [Music] setup documentation for the application actually will probably is we'll just use the wiki or the main site page maybe maybe that instead of the wiki I don't know that if we do that we'll at least have it all in the project instead of the wiki the github pages or whatever wikis markdown and stuff like that for it so that might be a good route to go especially since the documentation will be pretty minimal since it's a pretty basic I don't I don't know if I want to call it a basic but it's pretty minimal step process to do steam schema migrations all rights and then local docker container for Apache Cassandra to work from and alright we're gonna need we will intend to build out some multi-faced options for this application once the CLI is CLI is built out and operative and I'm gonna copy the rest of these speed this process up there we go just three more two more all right that gets us to the point where we had these I'm the let's hear did it probably need to take this out of the readme now let's actually do that clean up our readme [Music] okay that's the sound all right what do we want to do that I want to look in here app will take cql files based on date time and growth half will execute the CQ o files actually the first thing we'll probably want to do is have it actually read in the files in the directory that the executable is executing from think would be the safe bet so let's turn this into we'll move this here all right yeah and then let's move back out here I don't know if I should have it make an issue or not yeah what the heck let's actually go ahead and do that so this one the vert I convert it to an issue will it keep it in the swim lane though yeah just gotta leave it there doesn't need to be an issue your active work issue can be specifically feature requests and whatever so and then since I was just saying let's get rid of the wiki and let's use we did that last time too so we'll get rid of the wiki here collaborator trips or date areas no wiki learn about that because no wiki we will have issues Web projects want to follow Billy reports and then I want this so let's say it's for branch I'll go with let's actually just go with this minimal one will select theme and then hopefully I think it should just take our readme IMD file that should give us our site no it'll be gonna be up there in a few minutes something like that yeah okay and all right we're all set up there I'm still wanna go back that far just wanna go back to here and go to projects alright let's maybe I should change this to an issue because that's all I get for the note alright let's just work on it from there so alright we wanted to read in files and process the files accordingly I guess the question is should I add more detail to that we wanted to follow the basic process of other schema migrators let's open this back up so that would mean that it needs to have a date in the in the file name and then have up somewhere in that file name too so let's actually start with a test oh yeah it'd been object class one TPS TPS reports TPS fall revert yeah I don't care and not worry about the our interpreter right now I want to basically want to create a class now that I can use to parse stuff so let's here let's rename this to migration files file migrator are they sure what we call call it couldn't call it so it's gonna need to be able to take in a list let's do this public void read call from path public would read file from pat just still work oh it does cool read file from path this method will lead all of the files in a particular path and then select the files to be executed wait no let's do this files from a path they're gonna have select files or select files or migration this method will read like will select the files from the files list to process boy and then what let's hear select files for migration and then I'm doing I know what I should actually be doing this a different way it's actually bounced over here into tests let's let's go this route instead rename this well we all give that a name yet but let's say public void test all that stuff I just did you may have read files from path fact you're public void read files from path verify path or determine configuration path actually yeah verify path we've had half from config if not available default to path of current execution call and here is refile from five now these tests I'm going to rename these tests to meet whatever the convention is for X unit actually let's look at that how do you write X unit test X unit yes writing actually to test the net core studio getting started X unit yeah that's what I want oh it is it's a yeah guys see sure Oh Roy oh sure oh I seen anything from him at ages fake mark stub excuse me cannot worry about that got that down we'll be following a number of those but I want to see yeah so we have that stuff going on did not state anything about though is prime oh is that how we said how we should do that it's tested test method that is run by the test runner from the okay so this is just setting it up and we have a fact where we run it based off of this object that's returned here where Prime service is a private read only i'm service variable inside his class public since it's in there it can get it okay all right there we go check our site again real quick still not built okay latest build make sure we follow all these people these are really good people to follow if you're gonna use X unit just FYI oh I don't follow it warned these days what's up with that follow them now then go Brad Wilson here one of the core devs they're on that team James Newkirk oh yeah let's follow him there we go alright and then follow X unit - all right we got all the key people followed Oh Nathan Young I know Nathan - we're some bikie crews so I know ride bikes around the other all right what else do we got here figuring I seen it with JSON XML and I will look back at some of this later just get what we can get running here running so we can start moving forward okay this is gonna be a files read files from path verified paths um fact public void [Music] files should exist [Music] this house or no aisle should exist yeah definitely I'll straighten out my naming later so don't don't stress if you're watching your [Music] all right verifying path [Music] this verified has selected yeah select to execute schema migration all right so always should be selected by date at start of file followed by either an up or down in the following [Music] [Music] all files should be cql type [Music] hurry [Music] [Music] yes son here those three should get me started do I even want to create an object for this part that is anything but static seems like a object the static object that just has functions on it would be fine maybe if I instantiate it with an appropriate path then I could have it error out if the path isn't good it might be kind of explosive and unnecessary though let's start with happy path we need to figure out what the heck we're starting with here we need to start with let's see if well the path needs to exist verify selected path I'll say available and we'll call it selection let's go with file selection equals file select door selections feel like I should instantiate it let's state new file selection this path here and this is gonna be let's do configuration path Oh sir librarian done at core that actually parses an appropriate path and fixes it for Linux vs. whatever that's my question anyway I'm gonna go with Linux first and then we're gonna figure it out later okay I'm gonna do slash this does not exist it's gonna be the configuration path there we go [Music] migration like a aah [Music] want some examples here this no examples here [Music] we'll find some documentation maybe maybe this one doo-doo-doo-doo assert dot something okay let's do just sir tonight yeah sir dot equal file selection hmm so do we need to do a file selection dot path exist a path path available Oh actually go let's call it operative path or operating path operations path and that should be false no actually it should return should default it should default to something we'll just put the path that will very clearly not work because we don't even have that object yet so let's do alt enter create type say generate code that let's do constructor I don't want to do that I want to do let's do this we'll do a public class file selection and you're gonna see the crazy way that I write some of this stuff do string path path so oh that's know how you write it class there we go okay file selection let's follow this casing way the way dotnet does its casing file selection there we go well come back here all right there we go now we're gonna do public void file selection seven string path for schema for query files kena at for schema public void file selection nothing and for now we'll say see your bar like just just it's my bar configuration path this path okay so let's do spring all right then yeah so this needs to then check for figuration value and then no configuration value choose default path where execute [Music] yeah directory exists that's whatever [Music] does this path exist that's the real question no there's our docks the docks came out finally all right so that's that is a thumbs-up [Music] No the rectory [Music] so that's what I'm looking up and then [Music] [Music] is Microsoft docks down oh there goes takes forever string fab [Music] okay so string dot IO file directory okay directory dot exists schema all right [Music] [Music] okay then [Music] let's go down here let's just yeah create method create let's make an emetic okay here we go whoa that's not really what I wanted they'll make it a string that's the piece who are amping that for that first test so check [Music] if this exists [Music] by a configuration private string operation path equals this [Music] operation pools have schemer I created directory no object it might should do that but I'm just gonna go with the path for now all right something else I'll selection so to cascade down to the other constructor is this one doesn't get it member names oh how do you do this stupid public just this there we go it's not a method it's a constructor what do I need to do new this I don't know I need to do so I need to do with file selections which all right thinking thank you thinking SOF else to do selection or basically do what is in file selection except ni file selection select all right so for solit file selection though check check for configuration value okay so we'll do that a minute first with this no configuration value choose default path we're executing alright how do you get the dotnet select executing path I get current directory that's it directory right directory what is that return so we should have a yeah let's do this private directory info cuz I'm actually what do we get back we get back a what salt so it does return it returns a string okay so let's get a yeah okay so private operations path it's a sign of that turn operation or all that stuff operations path here we go okay so enough to get that going let's get this in there to do well let's yeah that is redundant let's remove or done it else oh I don't have that code okay just you chill for a second jetbrains writer and we are gonna get this moving here alright yeah okay we got can I just run this one test let's see what JetBrains writer let us do run unit tests and nyan cat begins the run execution vrooom oh nothing nothing run let's get rid of these we're just gonna do one test at a time because yeah [Music] nobody's started running a stupid thing okay that is correct because what we're actually expecting back is this correct path this that's oh we want direct don't we actually do this for a cleaner test we don't really need the variable there and then [Music] all right [Music] running tests again we fail we failed there were pending Oh it's debug for a second here oh that that's negative dude oh whoops [Music] [Music] yeah it does not exist and we have file selection a configuration pad oh that's right because we're not doing this okay so that would be correct you need to do this though which is [Music] so let's let's do this private selector [Music] scream pad Oh No Pass selector I don't even think that's what I do this whole like right here this then that way yeah we can get this to do path selector else do half [Music] selector there we go pear picked okay well it's just Oh actually yeah we want to do this not return so this will be void you still want to do that yeah okay so now that one runs where that one was see how this goes now we need to stop our test diva let's continue to run stop and debug it yeah [Music] all right no yes no debugger well yeah right this way oh where is my site expert oh right here boom there we go [Music] pending [Music] [Music] assert that equal oh that doesn't seem super useful so this path past okay right cuz I moved down to path selector right so we should be getting that clearly hadn't written c-sharp in a long time oh but not executing from there other question is can I even get the current directory where I'm running a test all right so we got we got our first test here it's not passing just yet but we are at the end of our well 50 minutes I got to cut it a little short today because I have to step out for a quick meeting for ten minutes I will be continuing on this however this evening so I hope you join me on my channel at 3:30 3 p.m. in the meantime stay tuned for the next session we're gonna make some good progress on this and get this schema migrator at least read in the files and processing and sorting and selecting the right files to process for the schema migration so catch you next time everybody Cheers [Music]",
