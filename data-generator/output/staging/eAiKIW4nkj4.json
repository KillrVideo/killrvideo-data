    "text": "hello everyone I'm Aon plet from data stacks and today I'm going to take you through building a simple dsse 6.9 cluster and then going through some simple usage of um both the data API and cql all right let's go all right so first I'm in Mission Control here just nice and easy we're going to say create cluster uh we're going to enter a cluster name snakes and arrows all right and we want data Stacks Enterprise dsse we're going to go for version 69.0 we don't need to override the image um so for a data center um we'll say Far Cry and let's specify our data plane context uh we're going to name our rack our 40 how about that all right so nodes per rack we're going to say three um resource requests let's go with um just for testing here 8 gigs of RAM just a standard storage class and you know if we can go like 10 gigs of storage that'll be that'll be plenty um entering a password there I want internode encryption backup restore um all right and backup configuration well none there okay so Heap amount let's go four gigs uh no external data centers and we do in fact want to deploy the data API all right create cluster all right so now I can actually go into the cluster option here and we can watch our DSC 6.9 cluster come up okay uh cluster is moving along um we have three nodes showing is starting uh we can see that um we're looking at a version of 69.0 on all three nodes um two out of three nodes have IP addresses so uh this is this is starting to work okay uh we have a node that's running look at that our 10.1 120720 that's uh snakes and arrows Far Cry R40 STS 0 is now now up and running outstanding just waiting on one final node to come up here also note that DSC 6.9 is running on Java 11 behind the scenes as well oh and there we go all three nodes are up um so there you have it we have a uh cluster running on datax Enterprise 6.9 with the data API enabled so for these next steps to work you will actually have to expose two ports to your cluster um specifically the data API needs Port 8181 um and for those of you who have been using Cassandra and data sax Enterprise for a while now you know that to connect with cql you need Port 9 42 um so just make sure both of those are open Additionally you will need to build your clusters token for Access via the data API your token can be composed from the result of a coup control get secret command Um this can actually show the base 64 encoded username and password that we set up during cluster creation inside of Mission Control once you have have that data you essentially compile your token with the string Cassandra colon Bas 64 encoded username colon b64 encoded password and in this case it looks like this but make sure that you get this token together before proceeding to The Next Step okay I'm going to start by creating a new t-space um I'm going to do it with the data API and through the data API you'll actually use the create namespace and send that on a post request um so I'm going to name this default keyspace it's going to have a class of network topology strategy uh and I'm going to set my Far Cry data center for three replicas all right there we go I see a 200 okay yep status one okay hey next is inside of my default keyspace namespace I'm going to invoke the create collection command also on a post and I'm going to name my new collection Library all right and I got a 200 okay and that works next I'm going to insert a record into my library collection which is inside the default keyspace namespace I'm I'm going to use the insert one command and I'm going to send that as a part of a post I'm going to Define my document like this I'm just going to be uh some properties you might see in a book like title author image publisher um so let's send that through all right and that responds with a 200 okay and I get an ID next I'm going to do a find one and I'm going to just pull that one record back that I've created so I'm doing a find one sending it apart as a post I'm going to specify a filter of underscore ID equals and I'm going to set the ID that was just return to me and if I run that I get a 200 okay and I see my book document coming back by the same token no pun intended if I wanted to actually have a look at what I've just done through cql shell I can say use default keyspace and I can say select star from library and you can see here is my document out there um I could even say select star from library where key equals and we'll say one comma and I'll paste in that document ID and Bam there it is comes right back just like that um similarly if I wanted to create a traditional table using cassander table using cql shell I could go ahead and say create table and we'll say keyword and we'll say day bucket integer keyword ID integer keyword text text and I'll say primary key day bucket keyword ID all right and then I can go ahead and and insert some data into there um then we can say select star from keyword and Bam so in this way you know p6.9 allows you to use both the new data API as well as traditional Cassandra and cql shell data modeling methods for more information on data Stacks Enterprise just head out to data.com products datastax-enterprise there you can find all the information you need including downloads and documentation thank you and have a great day",
