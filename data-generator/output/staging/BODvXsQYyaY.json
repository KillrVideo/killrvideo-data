hear me if you can see me if you can hear and see us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so we will know we can start that's going to be exciting day for you it's already very exciting moment for me and that's almost midnight or is it midnight already for our guest speaker hello the name yes hey yes it is uh it is midnight titan you allocated somewhere in the united states i believe yes i'm in california oh that must be quite a sweet place but maybe too hot those months it is it is it's hot right now in california we're going through the heatwave okay uh we are hearing a verizon equal shouldn't be any let me check okay i hope we are good now anyway let us start i see almost 200 people join at the conference already and we will start very well um yes good so let's walk quickly through the things happening today what's going uh what is going to be and how do we going to get how do you can how you can get maximum out of the event today so at cassandra de india 2021 we wanted it to be a live event but now we have to do it online because of all the restrictions you know but that's maybe even better because we can get people all around the world and that's amazing so what is going to be about is going to be about apache cassandra apache cassandra what is it and why do we have a ball conference dedicated to one single database isn't that too much no ladies and gentlemen that's not too much and by the end of the first few talks you will know why so most of you i believe have no prior cassandra experience so in two words what is it and why it deserves a standalone event apache cassandra is a distributed decentralized nosql database ready to work with a huge sets of data like really huge you will hear some numbers soon providing highest possible level of availability elastic linear scalability you need to have more you can have more from the fro output from the volume point of view um geographical distribution which is very important for companies like netflix hello v a because their clients all across the world it should be very important to keep your database close to your clients then highest possible read not not only read also right performance and right scalability which overcomes most of the other databases and also it's now apache software foundation project so it's vendor independent it's managed by apache software foundation um who uses apache cassandra a lot of familiar names again so basically you are using cassandra already do you know about that or not you are cassandra user because mostly probably you have an account on instagram or maybe you have an iphone or maybe you watch netflix or maybe you have uh something like wechat alibaba account ebay instagram and so on and so forth so there are a lot of companies using apache cassandra but not only that actually for me it's one of the best examples of how very different companies sometimes competing companies can work together to deliver a single solution for example renee i know you was a lot in uh you involve it a lot into that development of a new version version 4 of apache cassandra right that's correct yes and so you are communicating with different developers about the changes and so on and so forth we both know what what quite a lot of the companies were involved in the version 4 release but uh whom you would mention first who did the biggest work uh developing cassandra version 4. yeah i mean without without no doubt uh it's apple developers putting a lot of effort uh in making uh photo too what it is today yep and so apple netflix uh and many other many other companies developing this database as an open source project and that's amazing for me what sometimes you can meet at even quite competitive names one to each other but still working on apache cassandra improvements that's what i like like that's how the world should work i believe in 21st century stop fighting already so numbers um do you recognize um do you recognize this slide yeah two years ago we met at the datastax accelerate 2019 and when they made a talk almost two years ago or more even two years ago actually uh about cassandra usa at netflix and some upgrades in cassandra version 4 and by those times it was already one of the biggest cassandra deployments in the worlds with dozens of thousands of cassandra notes hundreds of plaster and like really a lot a lot of data can you tell us how is how did it change in the last two years maybe netflix dropped cassandra already no uh cassandra did not uh stop its uh you know it's progressing in netflix um with all the changes that are coming in the latest versions of cassandra it only kept going um we we optimized a lot of stuff in the deployments and in the internals of cassandra and how we use cassandra at netflix um so that is it's not going down every day you know we see new use cases coming we see new clusters spinning uh you know the cluster the cloud cost is also increasing uh for cassandra so um yeah i don't see any downtrend in cassandra usage great so uh what is going to be uh today about there are two rooms and you can switch between them everything is recorded so if you want to watch each and every session if you want to you will watch everything you are completely good and you are completely good you can do it but in any single moment of a time you can choose only one room so as long as you don't have a time traveling device if you have please share with me i'm going to need that uh what's going to happen in the first room so sale room consistency level room welcome it's going on right now when um in a few minutes already we will have vanessa from the cloud data architect from netflix with um originally i call it cassandra at netflix scale but when i found there was so much better name you will see in a moment then one hour later it will be a workshop for cassandra beginners for nosql beginners cassandra fundamentals led by meme and i'm alex polish developer advocate at data stacks so after that we will play a little game cassandra quiz you join our quiz give the answers do it fast enough to overtake hours you get the prices then later uh stefano latini will introduce workshop efficient data modeling how do you build datum efficient data model with apache cassandra it's a very important skill because if your data model is wrong well you can ruin really a lot of the cassandra features so high end highest efficiency is the shared responsibility cassandra give you the tools but you have to use them right good then finally ask me anything session questions and answers with experts so it's just a round table you can jump in and ask your questions and we will answer them we get a lot of a great expert for you and finally goodbye meanwhile in the second room so first room is more focused for beginners people who only think of using cassandra or start doing that no prior knowledge required except of general databases understanding is well quite recommended i would say then in the next room there are five thoughts each one is great uh first one by raul singh um a platform architect and ceo of um anand corporation uh he will introduce cassandra.toolkit tools uh you usually need to know to be successful with cassandra because it's not only about the database but also about the tools you can use to work with it then you maybe never heard about that but there is a great feature data stack sponsors your education and certification as a cassandra developer or cassandra administrator so cassandra is great but world needs more qualified engineers so with our help you can become one paying not a single cent because it's all sponsored by data stacks in this talk stefano will explain how how this certification program works and what do you have to do to password to prepare and password certification and run a single demo exam so you will see if you are ready for the certification maybe already you are experienced user or not ready and you have to learn if you have to learn he will explain how do you learn so where exactly do you get information then payal kumari a database consultant from python will explain things about the top stone stomp stones is a very misunderstood concept in cassandra so again to be successful with cassandra you need to know what are the top stones and how do you treat them and how do you handle them and why it's important then anil kumar consumption a database consultant will share his knowledge in performance tuning he has a lot of knowledge working with cassandra clusters and how do you try to get maximum outfit from the performance point of view and finally sarma paddy pali from verizon developed a grafana dashboard for monitoring capac so he will help you to start monitoring your clusters right way because without monitoring you cannot control anything and you just put too much luck the skills would be a better replacement so most important actions for you today first try to get as much knowledge as possible because we are happy people we work in information technologies and software development and that's that's the field that knowledge is really valuable and easy to monetize don't get me wrong then i want you to try to get maximum from also a swag and prices point of view so first participate in the quiz answer our questions and win the prizes second ask questions to our experts using clink dts6 dot io cassandra de india questions using this link you will see a form you can ask questions and authors and you can ask your questions and upload questions you like users who get the most of vote will get a price and users selected by our experts for experts by the best questions we'll also get a price and finally don't miss your certification voucher because well this voucher gives you the free attempt to pass the cassandra certification first and if you are certified already following the same link you can grab credits to use us database astra for free cassandra as a service by datastax but today we focused completely on apache cassandra and it's cassandra de india and we are about to start at this moment i am going to switch to you and we will see how my how many changes we have had and then with cassandra at netflix in the last two years i can't wait i'm very curious it's a very fresh new talk and by the way thank you then i especially for joining us during your parental leave and uh thank you so much it's like a rare chance to see you again after all those like downs finally so if you're already then i'm ready to switch to your screen give me a second so ladies and gentlemen we start the first talk of cassandra de india and i'm happy to see you all here and yes you can proceed all right thank you thank you relax uh good good morning everyone uh i'm sure this is uh oh yeah we are almost in the noon in uh india time good afternoon everyone um it's gonna be a really blast of a day today with all the lineup of talks we have um without further due let's like jump into our uh talk today um netflix's mission to entertain the world with the power of apache cassandra on a high level today we'll cover uh evolution of cassandra at netflix cassandra scale in numbers a few case studies um that that will go through within the netflix uh usage of cassandra uh life cycle of cassandra within netflix and a few operating principles that you can walk away today uh after this talk uh why do why should you believe me i've been in the my name is vinhela i've been uh in the uh distributed systems ecosystem uh and distributed databases ecosystem for my entire life uh you know focusing heavily on apache cassandra and data abstraction recently uh for the last six plus years um i'm part of cloud data engineering team at netflix we provide uh databases as services to desktop the netflix developers netflix is something which doesn't need a lot of introduction uh but i'll take a brief moment to uh introduce netflix uh netflix is a video streaming service currently serving in 190 countries leading the way for digital content since 1997 uh entertaining over 200 million members right from the couches why why apache standard netflix well apache assembly is a database which supports millions of operations per second with a global data replication and failure isolation at a data center rack level it is a database which is chaos study from day one which exactly works with chaos engineering uh of netflix and it provides attainable consistency which supports a variety of use cases a variety of needs of uh you know developers of netflix teams and and the internal structure of log structured storage engine enables us to do lot many things uh on top of cassandra which will walk you through uh in in remaining slides uh apache cassandra at netflix uh if you think about your interaction with netflix right from the customer sign up landing on a home page watching a trailer getting a uh clicking on a play button uh you know getting a cdn url from your nearest location and as soon as you start watching a movie the helps health of the playback and all the metrics that are being pushed from your device to the netflix you know when you pause a movie when you resume a movie when you run your subscription when you rate a movie all of this data is being stored in apache xander not just that but also notifying when the new content comes when your credit card expires and invoice gets generated you know when all the notifications that you get on your mobile devices on emails all of the push notifications are also being powered by apache assignment and all of these features that we're talking about generate huge amount of data that demands aggressive latencies high availability which is essentially powered by apache xander all in all 98 plus percent of streaming data is stored in apache center data ranges from customer details to view history to billing and payments all of this is stored in apache and it is a foundational data stream for serving millions of operations per second uh you know to provide seamless experience to our customers let's let's take a quick look at evolution of cassandra netflix from the day it started netflix's cassandra story started back in back with back in cassandra 0.7 days um it started as a simple key value storage um where all of the data is being stored as a simple key value but soon enough uh it demanded recipes on top of a simple key value structure and then evolved into using rich data structures that came with the you know cassandra sql data model with all the payments billing all of these use cases coming on to apache cassandra you know auditing and compliance requirements were the top most requirements and you know we we we had to rely on that uh on on those features of design enough it demanded building abstractions on top of cassandra to you know to make and do to interact with the cassandra much easier um and recently we started inducing the data out of cassandra using cbc and pushing the data through the data mesh ecosystem and we started using distributed data we started building distributed data structures like queues logs state machines on top of apache santa in today's world at cassandra data discovery and relationship between the data is an uncertain use case that is also being uh you know being served from apache cassandra where building a kind of a graph systems and relations between the data within your data stores is also being served uh from cassandra so a long story short started with a simple key value of storage and to to an extent where we can enlist the data using cdc backup you know build the complex relations between the data using apache cassandra and it is not stopping here it is finding new avenues it is finding new use cases and it is finding its way to you know help netflix on its mission specifically in in terms of numbers cassandra scalif netflix uh there are hundreds of clusters uh with tens of thousands of instances um providing tens of millions of applications per second across the globe with hundreds of millions of operations happening per second as we are speaking with petabytes of data that is being uh stored in cassandra and served from cassandra to be specific with some of the you know fun facts um of our cassandra usage our most active single cluster is uh operating with 30 million operations per second uh at any given moment our single most dense cluster is holding 500 terabytes of data uh in apache cassandra and our biggest cassandra cluster is consuming 9216 cpus you know to serve the traffic on top of cassandra looking at the evolution of cassandra and you know talking about scale let's let's get into some of the case studies um that will give you a picture of different areas where cassandra is helping in netflix the first one i would like to walk you through is a membership membership as as named reflects it is a service which takes care of your signups when the customer signs up with netflix it takes care of login it takes care of all the data related to netflix numbers and the data store uh requirements from a service like that is uh you know highly available data store with uh durable guarantees and global as netflix is serving global customers and should be able to take part in these failures failures because uh you know aws lesions fail and netflix should be up and running regardless of the back end cloud provided uh is up a lot but as i said it's a membership service which is involved in your logins signups and you know all of the interactions that a customer does it demands low millisecond latencies when i say low milliseconds we're not talking about hundreds of milliseconds we're talking about single digit millisecond latencies and the batch processing because a lot of analytics happen on like how many subscribers we have how is the subscriber behavior and a lot of that uh analysis on the customer data happens uh on top of this uh data set on the membership data set so batch processing and low millisecond latencies are you know one of the main requirements uh for a data store that serves membership so that is when the cassandra helped uh this particular service with the cassandra configuration of a local column um and with a duplication factor of three in each data center with the serial consistency to compare with the component set operations like if not existing stuff like that uh each quorum for customer data cleanup when the customer leaves the service we should ensure that the data gets cleaned up so having a high consistency on that is also something that apache cassandra provides with the configurations a simple uh a simple data model but with rich data structures provided uh out of the box from apache cassandra here uh as you can see the cassandra table uh definition for our customer data it has um you know a lot of different types of secure you know data types that you can see maps collections static fields and you know frozen columns and you know you name it we have it in this particular data model uh the the data model is simple because the account id uh you know the data is partitioned by the account id which is customer id and clustered by the profile id as you know you know one account can have multiple profiles all of that are clustered by the profile id and ensuring the partition size less than 64 kilobyte for all the profiles uh provides a better performance and on top of all the data types that you see here it also has few user different types for the you know schema flexibility for you know flexible interactions uh for the developers the next use case uh that i would like to explore here is a playback uh playback is an exp is a service that provides experience when you click on a movie or a other series a play button start right from the start of the play button until you complete that movie all of that experience is given by the playback service which includes bookmarking when you're watching the movie uh you know tracking the history of what you're watching and providing all the logs and metrics as the movie is being streamed in the stream experience the device experience all of this you know is being tracked by the playback services and the data store characteristics for surveys like that are highly available um this service can the data store cannot go down uh which is powering the playback service it has to be durable because all the viewing history is important for us to customize the home page for uh you know our customers based on their viewing patterns and it has to be global uh because our customers travel all the time uh you know it is important for us to have the data store which is global uh to provide the seamless experience when our customers travel from one country to other and it should be able to take part in vision failure as i said again uh even if the backend cloud provider goes down on netflix service should be up and running so it should take part in legion failures but by by the name of it playback is something that needs the demands aggressive right latencies because there is not a lot of leads happen from this service you know when you're watching all the logs that are being generated from them from your device are being pushed out to the netflix service um and uh you know all of the viewing history log globs bookmarks everything is just pumping out uh to the network service so it doesn't need a lot of read requirements but the right it has to be super fast in accepting the right uh and there's a lot of data that is being pushed out when you think about you know it's assuming your movie when you watch a movie on one device and resume it another device it it resumes exactly from where you pause because that location where you pause is being pushed out to the playback service which is persisting in a data store and when you resume that movie another device it's being retrieved from where you left off so the consistency the high throughput is also important the reason the consistency is lower in this case is because even if it is uh even if some of the right events are dropped let's say you're watching a movie and it stopped at 15th minute 25th second but the previous bookmark let's say it's at 15th minute and 10th second you know there's a 10 seconds delay it's okay that can be resumed it doesn't demand high consistency and also persistence guarantee other is also not so high it's okay to lose you know some of this even some of this data uh and the cassandra configuration for uh to satisfy uh such requirements are you know leads and right with cl local one which achieves higher flight latencies higher throughput but again uh they are lower consistency lower data persistence uh with a replication factor two because the data per system is lower data persistence even if you lose a rack um some of the vr will be lost but that's okay uh with those configuration we were able to satisfy the requirements of playback service if you look at the playback systems and it's cassandra usage it's humongous playback playback is one of the biggest uh you know users of cassandra within netflix uh right from your device logs even data um you know the session summary like session is something when you walk when you start watching a movie uh you know all of us that events and you know where are you watching a movie how is your viewing experience um is your streaming experience good you know is your battery impacting your streaming experiences your network impacting streaming experience all of the data is being pushed out all of that is persistent in apache cassandra uh active sessions uh with netflix membership uh you can watch either two screens four screens at a time all of that is also being restricted through the use of apache cassandra and what you are watching how much are you watching you know are you binging all of the data in terms of playback history is also being persisted in apache cassandra so if you look at playback systems you know they use apache cassandra in and out for all of uh all of their needs and then the billing uh this is a common and very frequent question i keep getting does cassandra use um does netflix use apache cassandra for uh you know transactional needs like billing and payments yes we do use billing apache cassandra for our billing and payments use cases uh the data store requirements here are a little different from playback use cases where it is looking at highly available durable and global data store uh low millisecond latencies because when you're signing up and you're creating a uh account it shouldn't take forever to store your credit card information um um throughput and batch processing are also important uh requirements uh from a data store which is supporting billing and payments use cases because throughput when we when we are charging customers on monthly basis we process millions of customers data and it cannot take forever to charge the customer so the throughput is important that's why we use uh the batch processing because uh you know all of the analytics that run on um this data how much we charged customer you know how much is the revenue for this month all of that is being coming from the batch processing uh statement level consistency is required because uh there are cases where data is written and read with a higher consistency because when you are charging a customer we should charge it we should do the transaction with a higher consistency but when we are leaving that it's okay because it's for anal analytic purposes even if it misses by one to two percent that's fine uh that's where you know tunable statement level consistency is something that this team was demanding and one most most important thing that this team was looking for is the data loss is not acceptable and it has to comply with all the uh complaints um you know litigation and the regulations that this team has and that is where apache cassandra helped them um you know the data model is not so complex but apache cassandra with its tunable consistency at a statement level and audit logging um auth and author z that apache center provides out of the box enabled us to use apache cassandra for billing and payments distributed facing so it is a little different from the previous use cases we talked about um i mean there are so many tools and enterprise softwares that are out there to track the distributed placing system of distributed systems but those are expensive to be used in netflix scale and that's why we used our in-house distributed placing software called edgar and the data store requirements for a system like that are aggressive like assign latencies because when we are talking about millions of operations per second everything has to be placed so really really aggressive right latencies consistency is totally fine even if you lose couple of traces here and there it is not going to be the deal breaker so it's a tunable consistency and that's why we took the advantage of apache cassandra's configurable consistency levels in terms of we can you know disable the uh you know durable lights in apache standard configuration make it fast we can make it local one all of the con leads and write it rights are happening at cl local one which makes it faster with the rights it's replication factor one there's no need to replicate the data so much lesser load on cassandra um and they're not global clusters so lm clusters not a lot of work to do um and we don't put a lot i mean it takes a lot of disk space because there's a lot of data so we don't provision extra so we just provision with two to three days of extra iops and storage as a buffer uh especially for these pillows so in the story of uh history of distributed racing it started in 2017 uh with elasticsearch but soon enough they realized the cost of elasticsearch uh wasn't helping the team uh and they couldn't get a lot of you know tweakings and configurations from elasticsearch um that is when they moved to uh cassandra cassandra on ssds uh you know was the first solution in 2018 and then as it was demanding high disk it was costing us more so we moved on to ebs in 2019 but the data requirements and the disk space requirements were increasing every day as the distributed facing systems or option was growing within the netflix so in 2020 we have to come up with a better data compression and filtering algorithms within cassandra so that we can store more in 2021 we implemented a target storage with um you know cold storage is provisioned on a low iops and um low ebs cassandra clusters and the hard storage is on is on a you know a better performing disk and better performing ebs cluster just to optimize on the cost and then the next uh use case that i want to talk about is the ratings it seems very simple to start with but it is uh you know one of the important information uh that needs to be stored uh which means it has to be highly available database uh we cannot not show the you know advisories and dating information countrywide when we are showing our movies or tv series uh so that is why it has to be highly available this service cannot go down and it has to support full sweep of advisories and dating wide um you know getting advisories and dating for a given movie and country is different you know very simple data model uh and we were able to satisfy this with um apache cassandra because they were demanding high availability so we talked about different use cases and how apache cassandra helped he started with membership how membership what membership demands from its data store and billing and payments uh the demands are different distributed placing different demands rating um playback you know these are all different categories of applications and services in our netflix ecosystem but what i would like to show you here uh is apache cassandra is the one database which satisfied huge spectrum of use cases with its configuration and tunability at every place um in provisioning the cluster in accessing the cluster and using the cluster everything is configured and treated and tuned to a particular use case um and that's where the patchy cassandra really helped us uh instead of investing in you know 10 different databases we believed in one database and which served all of our needs in a really efficient way but i will also want to take you through a journey of apache cassandra within netflix um we talked about use cases but what is the life of a team which operates these databases is it a ops model is it a dba model is it a developer model uh you know how do we survive this demand and scale so that's where i would like to you know literally walk you through what happens when we get a new requirement for apache cassandra so divided this section of the talk into four different uh models one inception how does it start how do we provision how do we keep it running and when time comes when we want when when it is a time to move on migrate how do we do that and at the end of it you know murphy's law how does matthew applies to even you know even netflix teams uh inception where does it start uh it all starts from uh you know our business use cases um what our business is asking um consulting with our customers identifying the right data store at the right time is the key for any success of our services but how do we do that that's why we employ the surveys philosophy our status philosophy is simple we provide context instead of control we invest in education uh tooling and the reason we provide context instead of controlling it is restricting our users our developers by you know having the ops mentality or you know sre deployment methodologies we provide context they everyone in netflix has a similar view and responsibility as the database developers team is so every party must be equally responsible for that slos slo key sls could be the size at which the data is being coming and the rate at which the data is being pushed to the uh data stores latency what data store teams have agreed upon and availability all of this have to be these slos are to be avoided by both service teams as well as the database teams at the inception as i said we invest in education uh you know to provide more context instead of controlling uh we provide enough and detailed context in terms of scalability performance dual ability consistency and netflix ecosystem this gives enough detail for them to choose the right database and you know use the take the right choice when they're building a new system uh alex i'm i'm getting a record from you do you mind muting yeah um i hear a lot of echo i hear my voice back okay it's clear now and apart from the developer education we also invest in a lot of tooling uh better tooling in you know in a way that our customers get enough and detailed visibility into what is happening with the data store we don't provide data stored as a black box offering to our customers we give enough details on you know what their what the cluster performance uh you know what are the latencies what are the slos what is the cost and what maintenance is happening enough context in terms of cost so that they can optimize on their side as well whenever needed and enough details into the maintenance of is it backing up is that is it repairing so that they understand you know when there are issues on either sides of the system and even in the systems like you know when the when the cassandra is refining uh what range it is repairing if there is any impact to the customers they can you know correlate this data with the impact that they have in terms of backing uh backups how often the data is backing up when is it backing up the duration of the backups um and how the label the anti-cluster is in terms of providing insights at a node level um so that they when they see some message in their logs they can correlate with the health of the cassandra cluster uh with what is happening in the system so that it doesn't put a lot of burden uh in the database maintenance team but to to have all of this sls or key service level objectives um that is where uh hey all wait a second looks like we have a problem with connection uh give me a moment hey uh hello uh vinay i'm sorry i'm not sure if we can hear you hey one two three we can't hear you so ladies and gentlemen sorry a little pause we have to recover sound connection yes now it's good now it's good so uh your sound yes yes yes uh good now we can hear you uh you can't hear me right yes i can good so your sound disappeared like 30 seconds ago so we saw the slides uh but not but didn't hear you could you please uh repeat uh just last couple of slides or him yeah maybe maybe even the previous one yes this one was the sound disappeared perfect cool um must be the comcast can you hear me okay now alex okay perfect yeah so um as i was mentioning slos service level objectives uh are the key uh for any of this services to be you know to be healthy and these slos could be at a disc at a lead latency number of feed operations right latency number of you know number of types that are happening and these sls are promised and are about by both the service teams which is customers and the database teams and when any of these slos are broken the person who is appropriate for that broken slo gets the page uh you know it could be the team that is owning the database it could be the team which is using the database and all of that is integrated into our tooling to make uh both of these teams life easier and at the end we learned that good contracts make good partners which makes you know better service for both customers and the teams which are operating this then the story of cassandra doesn't stop there we you know let's say we started good really good cassandra use case and we agreed upon a slos and we said okay this is the best product to be used going forward how do we provision how do we get it up and running fast really fast is through the self-service automation so everything uh right from creating a cassandra cluster uh for provisioning and for getting all collecting all of that slos is automated and sells out to customers so there is no human involvement when a customer needs a cassandra cluster all of this is um automated for them uh but we need to prove it before serving it to the customers that's why we invested in robust ami build process and things like pre-flight check which i'll walk you through what it is uh when we are building ami is a aws terminology amazon machine image we use ami's cassandra amis to provision cassandra clusters and to serve it to to serve it to our customers and it goes through rigorous uh testing in terms of performance testing uh you know functional testing and performance testing goes through which is netflix benchmarking which runs performance profiles you know majority of our use cases which are running introduction so whenever we change cassandra push it out to production it goes through this figures build process which ensures that the cassandra that we are the new cassandra that we are deploying uh is battery tested and ready to be served this is where we ensure the new code the new feature that we have in adding cassandra is uh it you know is is not going to introduce any regression but that doesn't stop there let's say you have a really well tested cassandra but the deployment environment where you're pushing cassandra might not be healthy all the time that's where you know we use um our system we use the ec2 instance uh hardware the health check system which is a pre-flight check if you look at aws instance life cycle it follows a bathtub curve where at the early stages of any of these instances there are high probability of failure and also at the later stages of the last stages of instance there is a high probability of failure we ensure when a new instance is coming up before we deploy our database is that instance ready to be served for traffic that's why we uh we benchmark the system we remove the uh you know bad laments in the instances when any of these instances do not pass our benchmarking we do not put use that instance we terminate that instance bring up a new instance use it in uh cassandra cluster it might delay the process to launch your database but it is better than suffering tail latencies uh in the in the database once we provision with robust ami process and robust deployment procedures there is a lot of stuff that happens throughout the life cycle of cassandra um or not not just cassandra but any of our that registers that's where we invest in better tooling uh you know having a control plane which automates a lot of this stuff in the distributed environment is important uh that's where we you know we we started with building imperative control planes but eventually we we landed upon declarative control plans excuse me imperative control planes are such where you have a single machine on a single control plane which is um looking at the state of the world and acting on the distributed systems to uh to work according to your plan whereas declarative control planes operate with the help of agents you know you your control planes put some intent in the desired store and all of your systems work towards reaching that desire excuse me um and until they reach the desire you know they continue to focus on bringing the instances to the state where your desire store is looking for um imperative control planes are easy to implement uh they are easy to understand because it's a simple float for you to you know digest um um excuse me for that uh declarative control planes have a lower uh total cost of ownership uh they are parallel out of the box but they are hard to implement and because they have to have to stop parallelism from not happening and it requires a different engineering mindset for you to build the creative control but you don't need to build everything from scratch there are so many tools out there you know examples of competitive control these creative tools are the orchestrators like jenkins fabric compressible integrative tools are distributed databases like console uh apache cassandra apache zookeeper and puppet these are similar to the actor model if you were to take the differences of actor imperative tools are as simple as you know ssh in a for loop written in a bash and python uh intent tools uh integrative tools have a you know highly available distributed systems in the back uh to work on the intent uh and to continuously work on work towards everything uh digging more on declarative control things i'm not going into details on why imperative tools did not work there's a different talk that i can difference you all to watch on why we chose the creative control thing but a gist of it is a declarative control plane you know have a desired state and a state of the world and it relies on the agent mechanism to continuously work towards bringing the state of the world towards the desire that you are looking for and examples of declarative solutions could be think health if you are looking at a cassandra health you would start looking at each and every node in cassandra and see if it is healthy or not um if it is a thousand node cluster it takes forever for you to this for you to call whether cassandra is healthy or not um that's why the declarative solution like every cassandra node pumps sends a heartbeat of its health to a central streaming system which collects it and you know on a on a moving window basis it can tell you whether your cluster is healthy or not jvm fake which netflix open sourced uh is also an um temporary declarative solution that we implemented uh bathtub curve model easy for instance uh and how how detecting the bad elements in easy to instance is also a declarative solution if you look at netflix open source preamp which is a software stunning uh which is a the sidecar during apache cassandra for backup it also uses speculative solutions um cassandra repaired that netflix open source the repair service is also a declarative solution i can reference all of this detailed talk uh later uh in the description so that you can all get into more details of what each of these individual systems have been built with cassandra ecosystem overall uh if i were to summarize what we have been talking about so far um each cassandra node has a you know main process itself and all of these agents like a sidecar maintenance agent failure detection metrics all of these agents make your cassandra work um well with the rest of the ecosystem um and that's where you have others and inside systems which um produces enough information to automate or self field or when it is out of the system you call um you know you page the customer you paste either the customer or the other other database owner um in in terms of um getting into the life of cassandra sometimes you have to move away from one system to other that's where you invest in a better tooling even in migrations our migration philosophy is simple rely on immutable encounter and provide a seamless and transport migrations to our customers i'm not going to getting into details of this uh in the interest of time here but i would like to mention that when you are operating cassandra or any of these data stores at scale it is important for you to you know invest in immutable infrastructure fully baked and tested infrastructure before you push anything into the production ecosystem this is one of the toughest migration we had to do moving the hardware from one type of instance to another type of instance where we used declarative solutions like you know desires where we mentioned we want this instance let's say aws terminology from i to excel to i2 to excel and these agents continuously work towards you know moving the data from the instance to the s3 uh terminating the instance and when the new instance comes up downloading the data from s3 and starting up cassandra and coordinating all of this in a distributed system in in a fashion way it doesn't provide it doesn't bring down cassandra it doesn't bring down the database to the customer is important and that's where you invest in a better tooling in providing this data providing the data stores so as i took an example of this is a 64 um this is a 198 node cassandra cluster where we are moving from one instance type to another instance type and it is all happening seamlessly with the you know with the power that apache cassandra provides and with the help of tooling that we all built in-house to move from one instance to another seamlessly to you know our customers and sometimes you might end up doing the data migration as well uh all of your implementing the you know shadow rights and forklifting in your cassandra drivers in your application makes um makes the life easier for your customers to move from one system to another with the help of you know folk lifter and dual knives i said you know i've been talking about really good things all the time um but i do want to talk about you know where things go wrong i mean anything can go wrong will go wrong however you plan and how it um how it has beaten us and um one thing that really impacted us is that lately done automation uh we had an auto remediation to clean up steel backups and replace snapshot um which triggers only about certain factor disk threshold card consumptions mismatched as a result our automation ended up deleting you know really cold backup data and i think that's what i want to put a question to yourself how many of you who are operating databases please do your backups constantly any code which is intended to learn in a late scenario is often underpro so it is lack of functional testing with our changing ecosystem because that's the ecosystem that we are in all the time and the semantics could mean different on a longer time horizon so if you're not restoring your backups if you're not exercising the code that you you know implemented if you're not exercising your system which is uh implemented to run in a day extra paid scenarios high probable that when you really need it it won't help you because you're not exercising it on a regular basis and that applies to backups as well so um all in all the takeaway is uh invest in context sharing tooling and declarative infrastructure to run apache cassandra at a petabyte scale and few operational principles that we have learned by operating apache cassandra you know at a massive scale for over a decade is never write a number to update your cassandra automate it never have a word document which is listing out steps to heal from an incident just automate that a separate ops team to run your apache cassandra will not work the developers of apache cassandra the experts of apache cassandra should be operating what they built education and tooling are the two important things that really help does uh and slows our key slows for both customers and for the database owners hotkey anyone who is not abiding by that should be getting paid should take that responsibility and building the mental models of the systems that you're operating is always helpful for effective debugging with that thank you everyone for joining today uh thank you alex for this uh you know for your time for giving this window for me to talk about apache cassandra big pleasure big pleasure and we are always happy to see you again it's been a while since we seen the shower last time and always very interesting talks and of course for all of us it's very very interesting and useful to know how cassandra is used at the biggest scale so thank you so much for breaking your uh vacation if i can say so and joining us it's very late already so i wish you a good night uh you know what do you attend this i can say what we said we suggest our speakers uh to have a recording if it's not by your time zone but renee wants to be here live with you and that's incredible actually let me do one thing as we have a couple of more minutes i want to check if there are any questions we will be able to answer while we have uh first question i see from shashir kumar um why in netflix store billing information in cassandra as they will be consistency costs like uh local quorum for read write is it since netflix do not use relational databases or due to scaling bottleneck or analytical needs it it is purely scaling bottlenecks not just for analytical needs but also for throughput for uh live systems uh that we are offering so if you remember you know our scale we are talking about millions of operations per second um it was initially on article uh our building systems were an article there was a black day where our article system went down due to the disconnection and netflix site was done for for a number of hours and we never wanted to see that again we wanted something which is highly available and highly scalable which can provide strong you know high consistency requirements at the same time never goes down never brings that no dissatisfaction to our customers yep great thank you uh there are a couple of more questions first one uh what are the data store characteristics uh um of billing and payment systems uh characteristics like replication factor consistency level use it yeah so billing and payment system demand uh one any of our services demand high availability so that goes without saying uh two believe in payment system specifically ask for high durability and consistency of the data which means you know in each data center we duplicate three times every byte every write that we get is getting replicated three times and you know the consistency requirements are such that they need to when they get an acknowledgement when the customer gets an acknowledgement that they might happen it has to really happen we cannot come we cannot miss that and they should be able to read the right that they just did so um yeah those are the you know replication factor three local quorum uh consistency uh or the stuff that they these systems use and by the way that's a good answer to people who is trying to raise who is trying to raise replication factor to five to ten and so on you actually don't need it in nearly never okay there is a question personally i really like by syed babar uh why netflix went for cassandra over mongodb alex i missed i i lost uh one two three can you hear me yeah i can hear you good so um why netflix went for cassandra over mongol so well you know we when um when netflix benchmarked uh several data stores that are out there which are which are meeting the needs of multi-regions replication high availability where it is not a master slave uh duplication tunable consistency and petabyte skill literally petabyte scale with uh with the tweaks and tunes that you can do either to lose the entire data or to keep the entire data it's all in your hands and that's where apache cassandra is the only one database that is out there which can check all the boxes that we have yeah and mongodb was never not even coming any close uh you know back then and i haven't checked mongodb lately at least in last two to three years but i never needed to check one so yeah uh i would other point here now please don't get it wrong like mongodb is bad mongodb is not bad uh it's great for its specific use cases and but income for at netflix scale again when you not only read a lot but also write a lot of data mongodb is scalable from the read point of view but when we talk of right scaling then it's already a bottleneck as a primary or write notes uh or master notes so it's a bigger problem for this also point of view yes so at this scale at such numbers can't compete with cassandra answer is very simple and we are almost done so a last question maybe last two questions um of question from timothy do you use reactive manifesto and ddd principles usually during implementing new features with cassandra okay so this is a new terminology we have to manifest on ddt principle i i i joke about ddd it's a demo driven development so do we demo first i don't know what what our ddd principles are uh but when it comes to implementing new features in cassandra it comes from the customer demand when we implement when we were implementing audit logging the billing and payment systems demanded us to have audit logging because of complaints uh requirements that you know that the legal team was pushing on them uh there was a case where there was a need for us to have authentic all of these features were given by customers so it's a customer driven development for us uh great uh did you run or deployed cassandra in containers maybe with kubernetes the answer is not yet okay yep and final question we have there is a lot of question so i think maybe later if you will have time we can run as dedicated netflix meetup for cassandra maybe some of your colleagues also would like to have a talk and then we will be able to ask or people will be able to ask questions because now we have to change the next one but i really want to end with this question i really like quite an open one question from aditya mukheri mukherjee i'm sorry maybe i pronounced it wrong so good one what is the future of cassandra the future of cassandra yes i'm assuming the future of cassandra netflix no i believe it's more open but well maybe netflix maybe maybe maybe let me start with netflix the future of cassandra netflix is a bright and green and high velocity um you know we are hiding actively crazily for uh cassandra developers within netflix the demand is spiking day by day our teams are growing from the time when i joined netflix or seven years ago we were two engineers now we have 32 engineers in the team uh helping create us to operate data stores in netflix not just cassandra but a few other um i do not see it is taking any step back um in casa in netflix and when it comes to open source cassandra open source cassandra pro is coming up with full speed with a lot of features super high performance and i'm super excited for it um and i can't wait for 4142 and 5.0 with all the features that are coming um you know that i see the cp is already coming in with amazing new features um so you know i think it is bright it is clean yep great so uh thank you so much there are really a lot of questions there is really a lot of questions in the chat i want i just copy pasted the link two questions a special list of questions uh we collect questions we will answer at ask me anything questions and answer session um if your questions about cassandra in general write them there if your questions about specifically netflix things when state units uh thumbs up and subscribe to our youtube channel we will announce a special netflix meetup hopefully sometime later at this time we have to stop and you know what our guest is very tired it's like deep night at his place so let's let him go but next time we will catch you for a longer time and torture you with our questions for longer so thank you alex thank you probably next time yeah i'll be i'll be in india and i can host a longer session but yeah this time of the year so thank you thank you so much thank you ciao and thank you for coming okay so ladies and gentlemen what's happening next uh you have now two options cassandra fundamentals workshop with me right now stay in this room it's recommended for those who has no prior cassandra experience you will learn the fundamentals and put your hands and push for buttons and make your cassandra cluster running second option if you already attended this workshop or your half understanding of because under fundamentals when in the second room link is in the description you have the option to attend a talk of raul singh from anand corporation platform architect and ceo to watch his talk about cassandra toolkit so whatever tools you need to know using cassandra and we are starting in a moment so give me one minute and we start [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey everyone hi stefano ciao hi alex ciao how are you doing yeah good good good good good that's cassandra day and i'm always double happy at those days yeah hi everyone welcome it's nice to see you yep so let me check um i believe you can hear us i believe you can see us and that's amazing so yeah yes cedric double happy that's cassandra day my favorite project and of course i'm double happy at such a day today i have to wake up a little bit earlier because of the time zones but okay it was just 8 30 a.m for vinay it was much worse because he is located in the united states but whatever we have many people watching us right now and we have to start because we have a lot of very important things to cover right now so i believe you watched the talk uh by renek marchella on cassandra at netflix scale how do they use cassandra and take a look cassandra is a great database it's much more powerful than most of the other databases but it all comes with a price there are some fundamentals you have to learn and there are some limitations you need to understand and some specifics you have to learn second workshop of the day will be cassandra data modeling and uh stefano will leave that that's very important for you if you're a beginner with cassandra if you want not to fail but to succeed you must attend data modeling workshop but first first things first we start with cassandra fundamentals so let's go what is a cassandra you already know it's nosql distributed decentralized database people love it and many of the huge companies are using cassandra for the main five features big data ready ready to work at any scale highest possible availability and i don't mean only borrowing fault tolerance i also mean full pledge disaster tolerance because of multi-data center deployments which is a third feature geographical distribution you can have your cassandra data centers all across the world on every continent working as a single cluster and all of those are active active when finally read and write performance you know what it's not hard to scale your database for reads having those read-only slave replicas that's boring everyone can do that try to scale your database for right performance so you can write billions and billions and billions of operations within some seconds it's way much harder cassandra can do it um and finally apache cassandra stands for apache software foundation cassandra it's a non-profit non-commercial organization responsible for a lot of the open source projects and cassandra as you can see from the name belongs to apache software foundation so it's baked by many companies like netflix apple data stocks and so on but it's still controlled by the open source community i love it so what are the um no yeah okay nigel props says ask it a good question i want to voice it before we proceed how do we ask questions there are two options you can write them in the youtube chat and get your answer right now hopefully or you can ask your question uh for uh questions uh room session questions ask me anything questions and answer session later and when you participate in a little competition with one who asks best prizes or some people who ask the best prizes will get their prizes from data stuff who ask the best questions you'll get their prizes for data stocks yeah it's still a little bit too early at my place serene so what are the main cassandra features it's distributed replicated and masterless so decentralize it that means distributed stales for scalability and responsiveness a vehicle can have a lot of servers close to your clients so they get answer very quickly then it's replicated it means disaster toll around so if you lost your server server rack or wall data center or maybe availability zone in your cloud you still can get your answers and even write data and finally it's masterless so there is no single point of failure it cannot happen what because of a single server outage you cannot write your data to a cluster anymore it's not a single point of failure so a lot of a service answering your questions there are two kinds of scalability for the databases vertical and horizontal vertical scaling is a traditional for the databases vertical scaling means you replace your old machine which is not enough and then you just put a bigger server on that place and you are running again vertical scalability is easier to get that's understandable you put a new machine migrate your data decommission old machine launch a new machine you are up and running but it has some down downsides it's more expensive if you try it if you took a look at the higher rate production database servers they are extremely expensive and there is a still single point of failure for this note okay this note is more powerful but it's still a single note there is a second kind of a scaling which is a horizontal scaling horizontal scaling requires multiple less expensive commodity hardware so instead of replacing old note with a bigger one you just add more nodes of the same size first of all it's cheaper second of all it removes single point of failure logistically it's harder but it's not your job because it's cassandra cluster job to take care of that well most of the time so cassandra skills scales horizontally and it's a linear growth of workload and linear growth of capabilities if if a single cluster of free servers you can handle like let's say 100 000 transaction per seconds what do you need to do to handle 200 000 transactions per second if your data model is right you just have to add three more servers and you are good to go you want to double your performance again you know what to do double performance double the amount of servers in your cluster question here it works only if your data model is right so stay tuned there is a talk by stefano later on how do you do it yeah very important cassandra scales linearly and it's confirmed by many different companies there is a zero overhead and adding new nodes again as long as your data model is good but the best reading from that point of view was done by netflix guys they benchmarked cassandra scalability on aws from i believe 45 to 300 servers and take a look at this nice smooth line that's a straight line ladies and gentlemen and that is amazing because for all our databases you have it not like that straight but you are going to have it like [Music] not straight enough so cassandra scales linearly and that's a really powerful feature today you're working with one terabyte of data tomorrow you work with 500 terabytes of data cassandra scales linearly so how it works cassandra is very powerful but how it works internally first feature you need to understand what data is distributed then you work with traditional relational database we use it to think what we have uh all the data the full tables on the server main server you have and then when you launch read replicas a full copy of this table will be stored on this red replica sounds good doesn't work on big numbers because at some point in some point your data is so big it doesn't feed into a single machine and if you want to be able to handle petabytes we need to uh spread to spread it to multiple servers so how do we do it we split data into partitions if you have heard of sharding on the relational databases that's this can say it's a similar idea to split data to multiple servers but in relational database basis sharding is a natural painful process which happens way too late and uh there is a lot of complications if you ever did shardlink on mysql for example you know my pain and you know why i'm crying with bloody tears because it's really complex story and that's not nice when you have sharding in relational database with cassandra it's completely different because it's ready for big data from the very beginning it's designed to scale to any scale and as a result data is splitted into the partitions so while your single table in this case population per city per country is split to multiple servers in those partitions from the very beginning what's the um how that distribution works idea is very simple every table needs to have so called partition key partition key is a column in this case country but it may consist of multiple fields those define partitions in this case rows sharing these having the same country in this case usa for example or canada a way will be stored together within a single partition and we see them here new york and los angeles in a single partition berlin and nuremberg on the second partition and so on and so forth every server stores a lot of partitions so for example here we have two different partitions on a single server of course usually you have hundreds thousands hundred thousands of them or much more it's completely fine then um how exactly partition works story is very simple take a look every row in our column population per city per country has a value in the country designated partition key and this country is the country in the visa field is a country name right so how do we define these partitions first of all value of these partitioned field partitioned column will be hashed by murmur free hashing algorithm by our partitioner by cassandra partitioner and as a result you get integer out of string so while not necessarily string it can be also integer it can be different value but as a result you will always have integer this integer called a token and each partition has its token as a result instead of canada we have 12 and instead of deutschland we have 45. now there is a trick usually those numbers doesn't look like 12 45 or 59 of course usually those numbers are like this size and they are very very long but doesn't matter for now that's good enough for the example now take a look imagine you have a cluster of four cassandra nodes uh like first one third sec fourth and each node is responsible for a token range so range of tokens let's say 1 to 25 26 to 50 51 to 75 76 to 100 again numbers are much bigger but i'm simplifying that a bit then take a look which server will be responsible for canada we see canada we partition it with more more tree vc12 and we see what 12 gets to this token range so this partition will be stored on the first server then germany partition will be stored on this server and sydney will be stored on this server and this server will be without any partitions well it's fine because we don't have too much data at this moment now take a look if you want to decommission a server if you want to scale down like your black friday is over and you want to scale down to save some money makes sense when you announce what you are going to decommission this server cassandra cluster is smart cassandra cluster will recalculate token ranges and maybe it will see what okay now i need to store on the first server not 1 to 25 but 1 to 33 and here will be from 34 to 66 and so on so and data will be automatically migrated and this server will be decommissioned quite opposite if you want to add more server if your black friday is coming or christmas sales i don't know whatever if you want to scale up and you add one more server what will happen basically exactly the same situation first cluster has to recalculate token ranges and the numbers will decrease in this point 1 to 20 21 to 40 41 to 60 and so on though ranges will be recalculated new server will get its own token ranges and data will be migrated to a new server you are good and that's again absolutely automated so it's a cluster job to do the dash operations you just tell okay that's your newer server and cassandra will take care of it i love it as a lazy engineer i love that cassandra does my job for me but that is not enough data is distributed but even when we have it distributed to multiple servers it's not yet highly available because we have no redundancy only redundancy helps you to be highly available so data is replicated data is duplicated to keep you on the safe side take a look for example replication factor is a amount of how many uh times partition will be duplicated in your data center because replication factor is defined per data center you will see it soon so replication factor free means what every partition is stored on three different servers and we see what it's the same partition for canada toronto monreal toronto monreal toronto monroe stored on three different servers okay um that means what for example if we are going to store some data note what got the data don't forget cassandra is decentralize it so every server is able to answer to every query is it's a write request or read request select read select update delete insert they all are dispatched by any of the servers but in this case this server is not responsible for the data what came but it still has to store it somehow so how do we do that again cassandra cluster is smart so we see it sees what this data i'm not responsible for this token range but i know who is responsible because cassandra cluster every server knows token ranges of every server and as a result our server what got the request this server is called at this moment query coordinator because it coordinates current query knows which servers are responsible for this and then you just add more and then it sends these query to the servers responsible for the replica service responsible for this partition and all goes good but what if one of the servers is on fire power outage network outage system reboot whatever data cannot be delivered again cassandra is very smart and able to defense itself from inconsistency query coordinator sees that there is no confirmation about one of the replica nodes got all the data okay what happens next query coordinator will store this data as so-called hinted handoff and then with server recovers it will uh this node we'll see what this server recovered it will be like okay hello everyone looks like i was down for some time did i miss anything and uh all the query coordinators because every server is a query coordinator at the moment it gets query it will dispatch this hinted handoff to a to the server what disappeared for some time and data will be fully recovered and again what's the best here it's fully automated mechanism you can sleep well wake up in the morning check your monitoring and found out what you had a server outage during the night but there is no alert because there is no reason to alert cassandra cluster is self-healing and man i love it good so and um final important thing for us to understand uh is uh the distribution of the data centers so you can run cassandra cluster on a single server doesn't make much sense but you can but usually we speak about the data center of cluster of single data center of multiple servers or in some cases like netflix use case uber apple and many others for users cassandra usually usually it's multiple data centers of multiple servers building the single cluster on the left side we see an example of the cluster located by a single data center in the united states one in the europe and one in asia so that's how it works and they all are active so that's not like active passive data centers in some other databases they all are active you can store data in any of them and it will be automatically replicated in all the other data centers and final point i want to mention is cloud native and ready to support hybrid cloud and multi-cloud deployments you can have a single cluster of multiple data centers but deployed in different clouds simultaneously and it perfectly works for example this one may be azure microsoft azure this one may be amazon web services and this one may be your own on-premises data center still perfectly working together and that's amazing how cassandra is platform agnostic so you can have cluster across multiple cloud providers basically being able to survive outage of any of them and that's amazing so how data replication works when you have multiple data centers considering we have two data centers and replication factor is free for each data center it works this way first your data comes to the data center vest just for example one node becomes a query coordinator right we know that already uh query coordinator knows token ranges so query coordinator knows which particular servers to ask to store the data or to retrieve the data if we are reading it executes two operations simultaneously first it sends the data if we consider write operation to all the servers within the same data center like let's say these these and these are replica nodes for this partition we are updating and it also makes a query to so-called remote query coordinator which is located on data center east and then data is already replicated in data center vest and for data center east remote query coordinator will do its job and spread the data exactly like it happened to be a data center vest and boom we have data replicated in multiple data centers simultaneously and very very very quickly so speaking of use cases uh understanding use cases for cassandra is very important cassandra is very powerful but it's also quite demanding so it gives you a lot but also asks quite a lot for you and you need to understand when to use it or when better to stick to your old good mysql [Music] what are the main use cases for cassandra scalability and everything what belongs to scalability demandings high for output high volume or both you can scale up to nearly any amounts of operations per second and very high volumes for heavy rides and heavier reads heavy rates no surprise heavy brights is a very powerful feature because a lot of databases uh not so good in scaling for rights and basically everything what requires high volume or half output will be a good use case for cassandra uh evan streaming with bill owns of iot um sensors across the earth local analytics any other time series and so on basically everything what involves a lot of operations availability if you want your database to be 100 of time basically you have no other choice um if you want to stick to open source solutions definitely and for any kind of a mission critical database with no data loss and always on and full 100 uptime you have to go with cassandra and multiple data centers proper data model and proper architecture it's not easy but you can do it so uh we speak of banking data market data well basically every data you want to be available uh all that time next thing is distributed we speak of global presence and workload mobility first of all global presence means what if you have your clients in the united states australia russia i don't know india and so on and so forth um south america you want to keep your database close to them and cassandra is the best choice on the global presence you can have multiple data centers and keep your data close to your clients therefore decreasing the latency to answer to them but also workload mobility and mobility ability to move your workloads from one continent to another for example compliance and gdpr there are very strict rules for uh compliance in gdpr in europe for example you have to keep data of your german clients in germany with cassandra it's very easy because you can specify where you want to store your data in which particular data center and well there are some options when you need global presence and distributed data and finally cloud native for modern cloud applications deployed in cloud you can have uh deploy it everywhere you can run it on kubernetes there is a great project called kate sandra and basically hybrid cloud multi-cloud enterprise data layer everything but belongs to modern clouds multi-cloud deployment hybrid cloud deployment and so on that's all easily supported good so um stefano are there any questions we have to answer by voice so there are many interesting questions yes many of them we are trying to answer in the chat and also thanks to jeremy who is doing a wonderful job and helping us a lot and certainly yes um well there wasn't there were a few questions on an interesting point but uh well you will probably speak on that a bit more later namely the fact that any node can be coordinator for any query but this will come later if i remember well so there were question how can how can a query reach the data in the proper way or well we we've been answering to those questions in the chat but basically most application driver are speak to the cluster and get informed get updated on what is the status of the cluster so if nodes go up go down if the token changes usually drivers are on the application side they're smart enough to go straight to the node who has the data which saves our extra network hope yep yes yes yes and i want again to uh clarify that i see you've answered that two times already um can any node be a query coordinator house query coordinator chosen every node so you seek assembly is decentralized there are no designated for these task nodes every node can do the same job as others it just can be responsible for that for this token range but not for that token range when it will be reroute your query to a proper server note what got the request will be a query coordinator it's not really but just if it get that query it will be query coordinator if it didn't get bigquery it won't be query coordinator because there is no query to answer right so id is very simple there is no chosen one who gets the query will answer if you call to a huge call center uh how do you choose which one will answer you don't choose you will just reach the first agent you want and he or she will answer your questions or root your questions to one who is able to answer them at least good so um there is a great question and not a question but pink message from naya props consistency is a big issue so consistency is a very important thing and consistency per se is not an issue but lack of consistency definitely can be so uh working with distributed systems and by distributed system i mean every of them it's not about cassandra it's not even about databases if you develop a distributed systems that's also about your system so you need to know this idea uh very well there is a problem describe it and see ap theorem or eric brewer's theorem in the distributed environment you can have only two guaranteed qualities out of three in case of outage in case of failure what's the story take a look there are three important qualities of the distributed system you need to understand consistency availability and partition tolerance what does that all mean let's start with availability it's the simplest one availability e means what you always get the answer so as long as you are able to reach a server you will get the answer there is always send a server to answer this is quality means what you just get some response in case you ask something or you get your data stored if you are trying to write something right now consistency consistency means what then you ask for data you get most up-to-date value not outdated one for example if i change my username from alex to i don't know alex two whatever alex new volume new alex and then request for this data if system is consistent i will get my alex two value because it's the most up-to-date if i get the old one it means what system is inconsistent and gives outdated values and finally there is a partition tolerance which this one is the hardest one so i have to explain uh what is it um in bit more details it's very often misunderstood partition tolerance means ability of your system to survive network split network partitioning it means what you have a cluster of six servers for example and there is a network issue and servers first three servers cannot reach second free servers it's a network partitioning they cannot communicate anymore it call it network partitioning and in many of the databases or distributed systems at least so-called split brain problem and it's a huge problem so we want to have all of them you want our system to be available consistent and partition tolerant able to survive network split but it's only feasible then we have when everything works fine and there are rainbows and there are ponies and everyone is laughing and the grass is green and all good then yes you can have consistency availability and partition tolerance but we live in the real world and that means you have problems what kind of problems every each and every kind of problem network outage power outage whatever outage system reboot and so on and so forth altogether it means what in case of failure you can have only two qualities out of three and you have to decide which one you are going to have and there is a first thing you cannot drop partition tolerance if your system is not able to survive network partitioning then after first network partitioning it will be not recoverable or very hard to recover so we never and it's just a question of time when it will happen so we cannot draw partition tolerance so every system is uh basically a trade-off between consistency and partition tolerance so so-called cp and availability and partition tolerance ap and you have to decide i want more to stick to a cp side consistent and partition tolerant but not highly available anymore or you want to be available and partition tolerant but not highly consistent anymore so have eventual consistency again don't forget that's not about the cassandra it's not about database it's about every distributed system you use that's always this fight for things of consistency and availability good so what comes next is cassandra ap or cp is cassandra available and plantation tolerant or consistent and partition tolerant a lot of people say cassandra is ap available and partition tolerance that's not perfectly correct and i prefer another definition i prefer consider cassandra as configurably consistent why because well lack of consistency may be a big trouble and cassandra has a very powerful tool to handle this issue call it consistency level what's the trick in any moment for each and every particular query you execute select insert update delete you can specify exact consistency level you require to have and changing this consistency level you can bring cassandra from ap to cp site specifying some particular consistency levels you can get two consistency and partition tolerance field so i call cassandra configurably consistent and i find it more correct than eventually consistent you can be on cp site if you want so what are the consistency levels when you execute a query you can specify i want my consistency level to be for example any one two three quorum in all let's take a look how it works uh idea is very simple then you have consistency level one it means what with replication factor free you have pre replica servers in your data center here we consider data center of six servers your client writes data query coordinator will send the data to the replica servers to get together simultaneously asynchronously at the same moment of time but it will wait for one and only one confirmation so as soon as the fastest server get the data returns confirmation okay i got you immediately query coordinator without waiting for the confirmation from other servers will return answer to the client yes man i got you you are good to start your data then with consistency level quorum it will wait for the majority of the servers replica servers to respond so if you have replication factor free then quorum will be majority two it's like half plus one or account uh to the closest integer volume so for free it will be half 1.0 but we cannot ask 1.5 servers so we round up to two right um so what goes here we are waiting for two confirmations out of three and as soon as we're too fast server answer we will return answer to a client and basically consistency level all requires to wait for confirmation for all servers what they got the update and now there is a trick take a look when we use consistency level all when we use consistency level all we will wait for confirmations for all replica servers and now we have a problem you know what cp theorem is still here what happens when we go for consistency level all try to think when we go for consistency level all we move from availability and partition tolerance to full consistency and partition tolerance because we will wait for all confirmations from all the replica servers there is zero chance to go for inconsistency right but there is a problem you cannot be consistent and available at the same moment of the time and the distributor doesn't try in the distributed system and as a result you move to cp and yes your data is always consistent but as long as the one single server cannot answer for example this server is on fire this server doesn't work what happens next you get an exception cannot store your data desired consistency level cannot be reached so your two servers are working one server is not available you cannot store the data because you know what no we cannot reach consistency level all you just moved the system from availability and partition tolerance ap to consistency and partition tolerance cp and now you may question me okay but i want my data to be consistent man like i'm kind of financial institutions i cannot store my data in eventual consistency way because you know what there are auditors and clients who will be very angry if i store their data and those are eventually consistent yeah i can understand that so is there a way to trick the cep theorem and get to the middle somehow answer is yes you see it's a great um workshop i teach you how to break basically the physics law uh not not to break because you cannot break them but i'm kind of to bend and still get to the middle immediate consistency is what are you looking for immediate consistency is not the full consistency but it's better because you can be consistent and meanwhile still be highly available first way let's take a look the first way if we write with a consistency level all so we wait for confirmations for all three clients then we can read with a consistency level one because all three servers were updated guaranteed and now my client will always get most up-to-date information doesn't matter if it asks first second or third server does it work yes it works is it the best way no there is a second way if you write with a consistency level one so you wait for only one confirmation then your client can read with a consistency level all get data for all three servers when it will always get most up-to-date information does it work yes it works is it optimal is it the best way still no okay so what's the best way when take a look the right way to reach immediate consistency is a right quorum read quorum that's a simple mathematics if you write guaranteed to at least two servers of free so usually it's free sometimes one server can be down when you write to two at least and if it fails you know what not enough servers were up in your cluster so client knows what operation didn't succeed if you write with consistency level level quorum always there are two servers who store your up-to-date information and if then you read with consistency level quorum simple mathematics there are two options first you read information from the updated servers then you immediately get the most up-to-date value you are consistent right but there is a chance what your query will go first will be answered first by one updated server and one not updated what happens then uh query coordinator will see what one of the node returns outdated information and it will do two things first ping it will return to your client the most up-to-date value consistent result and meanwhile in it it will initiate so call a repair on read so if coordinator notices what one of the servers was outdated that energy initiates the repair for data and cassandra cluster in background will execute self-healing recovering from inconsistent state fully automatically and again if you don't monitor it you won't even notice that but cluster is recovered already fully automatically isn't that amazing and now that's what's the trick if you have two servers at least two servers or free always having up-to-date value there is no chance to get into inconsistent state because you can ask two updated servers you are good you can ask one updated and one not updated when you will get updated information and cluster will recover but there is no mathematical change uh chance to get um to into two inconsistent servers because there are not there is only one inconsistent server that's example done by for replication factor three but if your replication factor is five then quorum will be equal three and result still will be the same so write quorum plus read quorum brings you to immediate consistency right uh there is a question from george angelino but repair on reid is deprecated in four no yin yes and no so there are two repair on read one repair on read then coordinator notices inconsistency this one executed always uh in version 3 and version 4 in any version in cassandra version 3 also was repair on read which is which tries to execute repair randomly in like a little percent of queries of read queries it will execute repair randomly it doesn't matter if it's really required or not this repair on read with no real reason is indeed deprecated and switched off in cassandra version 4 but yeah that's exactly what uh makes sense and uh last question before i proceed uh poor gupta asks i can't go back yes for this uh room in conference you cannot put it on hold and you can't go back during the live stream because i want everyone uh to be able to participate in the quiz and if you are too late if your stream is delayed you will be too late on quiz and you cannot win the prizes so pausa and uh getting back on time is switched off perfect stream so you can participate on the quiz and in the questions and answers uh but event stream is dumb that is done you can get back in time and watch it again from scratch good okay so and final secret of immediate consistency the right way there is a little tiny formula you need to understand is a consistency level of right plus consistency level read is higher than a replication factor then you have immediate consistency let's calculate it uh four concern for replication factor three what's the quorum for replication factor three it will be two so majority of the nodes then consistency level uh quorum two plus consistency level read two four makes four a two plus two makes four four higher than three we have immediate consistency if we go with consistency level of write o which is free we can therefore decrease consistency level for read up to one or down to one and it still will be consistency level right all three plus consistency level read one one three plus one four four more than three via immediate consistency good so consistency trade-offs higher the consistency less chance you can get stale data price for that is possible latency for example uh if you have replication factor free consistency level quorum you wait for some data if your network works perfect your servers aren't overloaded all of them responds in exactly the same time and you get free confirmations in this very same millisecond well good for you then it doesn't matter which consistency level you use but in real life it doesn't work like that some servers may be overloaded some network may be lagging and slow as a result you usually get confirmations not all together but next by next by next by next byte next with some time difference between and as a result the more servers you expect the more servers you wait for higher chance of possible latency by the way that's one of the reasons we don't recommend to have too high replication factors because just you will wait if you have a replication factor 90 you will have to wait for 60 servers right and no no it will be better said like if we have replication factor 99 we will have to wait for 66 answers more servers you wait higher of a chance what some of them will be in a bad state and won't answer as fast as you want and you want your cassandra cluster to be quick it depends on your situational needs and you indeed may uh choose the consistency per query so if your application works with different kind of data or some kind of data you want to have consistency level one and for some of them you want to have consistency level quorum that's perfectly fine for example iot and sensor systems with very bright heavy workloads like when you have billions of sensors in the world dispatching their state every few seconds and there are a lot of them so amount of rights is tremendous in this case you can go for consistency level one for rights if data isn't required immediately so if you only store data but not going to um query for it were very same millisecond you dispatch it if you usually query for this data a little bit later when you may benefit from consistency level one it means what at least one replica server will get your data and therefore we'll replicate it immediately during the query with a normal replication or we'll replicate it later with a repair if anything goes wrong then it's a good and it helps you to be faster on rights but that's not a general use case so usually we recommend to stick to consistency level quorum or local quorum speaking of which there is one more slide i want to show you is for multi dc consistency levels there are three more consistency levels you need to know local one local quorum and each quorum why should you care then you have multiple data centers in very different places you want your application instance in the united states work with the united states database instance right you don't want your application server in the united states go to european database if you have a database in the united states it will shorten the latency correct so every cassandra driver you use is aware of so-called local data center local data center is the one what's considered closest to the center to the server you run your application and then you specify local one or local quorum it means what your application will wait for one confirmation of quorum or or quorum of confirmations from the closest database data center not from the remote one and second option you have to consider is each quorum it means what you want your data to be guaranteed delivered to each and every data center you have right now and you need to know if it was delivered already with each quorum and replication factor free per data center we will wait for free confirmations here free confirmations here and free confirmations here this one guarantees what data is delivered to each and every data center right now not later during the repair but right now but there is obvious price your client will have to wait for each data center to get as we discussed it recently with the name they are usually using local quorum to guarantee what your application works with the closest data center and doesn't work for your queries to be a globetrotters and go to australia for example um alex yeah sorry um i have to interrupt you because i think the time has come for me to say goodbye to you and hop off hop to the other room because yes so i i'm actually i've actually collected a few interesting questions but i'm not sure if we make it in time maybe they will be they will be touched again on the q a session i guess yes uh take a look don't forget to send your questions to q a uh session the best of your questions will get prizes and not only send but also upvote the questions you like and questions you would answer you would ask so we will see what you are voting for good yeah and for that don't forget to put your name when you ask the question otherwise you will not be able to get a prize yeah right put your name in the question otherwise we cannot identify you right good okay so it's time for you to jump uh jump away see you in the other room uh and goodbye goodbye thank you thank you good uh so stefano moves to the second room uh to run his um talk about cassandra certification program the trick is data stack sponsors your education for cassandra there are free courses at the academy and free certification with a voucher you are going to get because you attended cassandra day india what matters for us is right now if you are a complete beginner you better stay with me if you already acknowledgeable in cassandra you may switch to a stephanos talk in the second room link is in the description of this video and watch these uh talk there will be a training he will explain how do you learn how how to pass the exam and he will run a small demonstration exam so with a very similar questions to the real questions but not exact questions sorry and if you answer them surely when you feel like okay it's all good i am ready to pass the exam but if you're a beginner stick to me and we will proceed with the next steps so and one final notice on the consistency level questions consistency level has no [Music] doesn't affect anyhow how data will be distributed in the end because anyway every replica server every replica will get this information it's a question of only for waiting for confirmation what it got it that's very important to understand so still every replica on every data center will get your update so um and there is a good question i will even make a stop and answer so approve gupta how apache cassandra database deals with a split brain very good question so first of all it's a really good question to ask for questions and answer session i will send you the link again because you can win a prize with this question because it's a really good one i like it and if other experts will like it too you may get a price no guarantees but try and use your name sending the question so we may identify you in short answer is in case of a split brain so network partitioning we discuss the present term uh in case of a split brain uh those two servers for example those two data centers will be not able to reach this data center there is a network spline between them network split so we kind of have one cluster and second cluster or one single cluster is splitted into two parts how it works what's the problem of a split brain in general what people uh start to rail to write data into both of them like it may happen with a relational database when you have multiple masters people start to write data in term first part in the second part there are two master service on my sql for example and as a result you have some changes store it in the first one some changes store it in the second one and you now have kind of two different clusters and they just you cannot bring them together it's called split brain problem very good question indeed apoorv so how does cassandra handle that very easy take a look here we have a network split and we have for reviewbride for example with local quorum uh that means uh or we write with yeah before we will write with local quorum uh we better go for the normal quorum it's easier to explain here when we write for when we write for a quorum we see what uh one two three uh one two three servers will answer those servers won't if you write to this site this server won't answer because we can't reach them but we get our data stored here here here here here and data is exec data insert mutation is executed for the first two data centers but if we try to execute and insert into this data center with the same consistency level forum when we got into trouble uh because uh our query cannot be executed and we if this data center cannot reach those two don't forget there is a network speed between them uh what will happen very simple this data center will answer you i cannot reach desired consistency level i cannot store your data sorry and you may say like okay it's uh i how come you cannot store my data you have enough servers no i don't because for consistency level forum we need more servers from other data centers we can't reach one so it won't store your data you may think it's bad but no it's not bad but if it would store your data and then you have an issue with uh you have two different mutations in two different parts of your cluster that's what batman split brain is a real problem not but one of your data centers doesn't work right so that's something we can survive don't forget about the cep theorem uh we always want to stay partition tolerant okay we're a little bit out of time so i have to move on [Music] good so all about data and how data is stored internally next uh important thing cassandra need to understand but meanwhile let me check the second room if they started successfully it's my event so i'm really worried really worry for them okay stefano is live in the second room we can proceed good so data data data how cassandra stores data what is the data structure for it on our workshop introduction to nosql i like to ask people a question is nosql schema-less and a lot of attendees always ask for yes nosql is schema-less and it's complete wrong if you think what you want to if you think what nosql is schema less you are wrong because there are more than 200 different databases in nosql group and they are very different cassandra is no sequel but it's schema full so um okay sorry there is one more question i do want to answer right now where is it uh tadouri asks how quickly we can switch to ap to cp and vice versa basically it requires no time because you specify consistency level on each and every particular query you execute and of course there is a default so you can set a default value but if you want first insert to be executed and consistency level one and second insert to be executed at consistency level all there is no time to switch you just specify a different value for the second query so let's get to data it's all starts with a cell what is a cell cell is an intersection of row and column it stores data like in this case there is a cell it stores name let's go higher a bunch of cells uh build a row row is a single structured data item in a table so we have some id we have some first name last name department that's a role so far so good then comes a new thing partition working with relational database i bet most of you have experience with a relational database you use it to have cells rows columns tables consisting of them it's not like that in cassandra and that's very important for you to understand there is one more thing you need to remember a partition partition is the base unit of access in cassandra not vero if you will forget about that your cluster performance will remind you with some downgrades so data structure partition is a group of rows having the same partition token it's a base unit of access in cassandra for example in this table we have we split our employees by department and all the employees from the wizardry department will go to the same partition and all our employees from the dark magic department will go to another partition oops it looks like i exposed some of the personal data let's move on when what is a table table is a groups of columns and rows storing partitions and partitions is the most important thing in a table well but in general you know idea of a table rows columns partitions inside how do we create a table in a cassandra query language very easy ah so by the way welcome to cql cql stands for cassandra query language and it's indeed as you see very similar to uh sql and you know what it's very good and it's also very very very bad why bad you may ask answer is simple you know what sql is designed to be very similar to sql it's good because you can really easily learn it and start to use that because concepts are the same create table execute insert read some data from table the data from table it's the same but there is a second issue why it's it's so close it looks so similar to sql but many people make a mistake and that's a huge mistake what leads to huge problems they know sql they see sql first time and they like oh sql is so similar to sql i already know sql i can use cassandra no they are not don't be like that you are the best you are attending our free educational event so you are not like that i know please watch uh watch that sql is indeed similar to sql but cassandra is not similar to relational databases it's a trap and if you try to use cassandra like mysql without joins you will run into troubles i guarantee you so watch for only this workshop watch data modeling workshop by stefano but besides that yes indeed table creation in cassandra is very similar to a creation table in mysql for example by the text we see create table key space group of tables a table users by citing some columns ct last name first name address email text text text text text text we have more data types than just text it's just maybe not the best example and we have to adjust it then let's go with a primary key and primary key is different primary key is a very important concept i will explain in the next slides but in general what you need to know at this moment in primary key we identify partition and clustering columns what it all means don't ask questions in the chat just listen to me i will explain first of all key space key space is the highest idea of the table key space unites a multiple groups of tables in this case we create key space users and when you create when you create key space you there are many options to specify but there is only one option you must specify it is the replication in replication you have to specify class and replication factor per data center so well first about replication strategy there are currently only two replication strategies and you may have or simple strategy or network topology strategy simple strategy is good for your laptop and bad for everything else don't use simple strategies anything close to production environment and network topology strategy is the cool thing it's aware of your network topology it means it understands what you have servers racks and data centers and that's very important because it will try to keep your replica servers as a far away from each other as it possible uh how come for example take a look here i specified replication factor by data center for my data center united states west one replication factor will be free and for europe central one replication factor will be five now let's play a little game i will ask and you will answer please answer in the youtube chat how many data centers i have in this cluster i'm waiting for your answer in the youtube chat two two three any more options two two eight two okay no no no no no no no you all are wrong you all are wrong [Laughter] okay enough there are a few dozens of answers but it's wrong all of them are wrong so no really i need at least okay aftershaq was possibly right unknown yes that's the right answer sashank uh was the closest one but the real answer was a real question was now focus question was how many data centers i have and the right answer there are two possibly right answer first of all unknown this statement may be not valid at all i may have zero data centers and this statement will fail but considering this statement is correct right answer is more 2 or more 2 plus 2 plus so notice question like eight it's about replica servers how much replica servers i will have if you've answered eight uh that's not about data centers your answer was about replica servers not data centers this answer is wrong and most of you answer it too which is also wrong because real answer is to plus i may have five data centers i may have 20 data centers within this cluster i just don't want my data to be stored in all of them but i want my user's data to be stored only in two of them so overall my cluster may have as much data centers as i want but this data will be stored only in two data centers of the cluster overall count of data centers within cluster may be significantly higher so the correct answer is two or more good right let's move on ah i wanted to say one more thing on network topology strategy why it's important to use network topology strategy take a look uh if you have your own on-premises data center how it usually looks like there is a server a group of servers is in the server rack so you have server rack and multiple servers in it and then finally you have multiple server racks with multiple servers now take a look what happens if all of the replicas for some token range are located within the same c within the same rack the problem of perak is servers within this rec tend to fail together because they have shared power supplied and as a result the server rack tend to fail together also possible network outages and so on so in the best case scenario you want to keep your replica servers for multiple different token ranges as far away from each other as possible then you have on-premises data center with real servers and real wrecks cassandra will try to put replicas into different racks so they will be not all in the same rack and if you use not a hardware on-premises data center but you use cloud like amazon web services for example then you may have obviously available event within a region you will have multiple availability zones and in this case network topology strategies also a weight available um sorry a layer of network topology for your cloud and then it will put your replicas into the different availability zones why for the same reason availability zone tend to fail together so if you have ability availability zones one two and three your replicas will be spread into the availability zones one two and three and if one availability zone is not available there is an outage then therefore az2 and 3 still will be available and you can maintain quorum consistency even the wall availability zone is down i don't know about another cloud providers but for amazon web services actually availability zone is a real data center isolated from all the others by some distance has independence power supply and so on good so game was quite interesting but let's proceed so finally example data how it looks like we have a key space which is a group of tables we have some tables one of them is users by city and we have two partitions because we have users in phoenix and seattle a city will be a partition key column last name first name will be clustering columns and there are some data columns what is that what is a partition clustering and data codes let's take a look at that uh yes i will explain what the clustering columns don't worry we are good don't rush i will so first of all what is the primary key primary key is an identifier for a row it consists of at least one partition key and zero or more clustering columns so primary key is this all long line city last name first name email and it consists of a partition key which is a city and clustering columns clustering a primary key has one main duty it must ensure uniqueness of your data must ensure uniqueness of your row for example compare this good example and this bad example what's the difference same table but keys are different one key is good second key is bad try to guess and answer please in the youtube chat what's wrong with the second key what's wrong with the second key people in the same city can have same first name and last name right for this one it was easy indeed last name and first name is not unique between the city especially no it has a partition key scratch games ct will be partition key in both of them so it's completely fine partition key is present but indeed first one is good because we have uniqueness uh in this case i did a little check once vera like a dozen of john smith in new york and can you imagine because cassandra is a nosql databases database it uses so-called absurd approach so insert an update are essentially the same and if you have your primary key like that ct last name first name every next john smith will overwrite data of the previous john smith from the same city and i bet uh previous one will be quite angry on you i would be at least so and ravi says partition per record to many partitions which is not required no it's completely fine you can have as much partitions as you want it's completely fine to have partition per row it's completely fine good so well then what's next next is the partition key partition key is an identifier uh okay and the last question from nagesh why cannot we have in this example primary key as ct email why first and last name neither uh you are right from the uniqueness point of view last name and first name are not needed here at all and our primary key indeed can be ct and email but we still may need last name and first name i will explain it on the next slide when we will discuss clustering columns because clustering columns use it not only for uniqueness but for some more options we can use so partition key you know already what partition key is an identifier for a partition rows with the same partition key will go to the same partition partition key consists of at least one column may have more if needed good examples when we just have a table by users only users without a city without anything in this case primary key user and this will be a partition too so primary key will match partition key or better to say primary key will consist only of partition key without any clustering columns it's acceptable in this case we will have as much partitions as users we have and again it's completely fine it's safe you can have a lot of the partitions and we can have for example you know what we are on youtube watching video and imagine a table comments by video we have comment and video id and we are good they are splitted by video it's fine for us because we can retrieve them together they are stored on a single partition but in some cases it may be not the best scenario because uh okay for this one i have a special slide so i will explain to you later on a special slide finally clustering columns they have two duties first duty is to ensure uniqueness as a part of a primary key we discussed it with example already right ct last name first name city last name first name email unique great works so it's organized with a clustering key of email but it's not the only job of clustering columns where is the second job so that's getting to nagesh question uh before uh primary key um in this case we used last name and first name uh clustering columns i establish sorting order so in this case we will have our users sorted by a last name and then sorted by first name on insert time very quickly and that's fun fact when you retrieve data from cassandra and if you want to retrieve it sorted already cassandra doesn't execute sort on select statement because data is pre-sorted on insert time that's a very cool optimization hope i will have time to show it to you later so clustering columns are used to establish sorting order for example in this case comment for a video video has multiple comments you are writing comments right now if we go like that video id comment id they won't be sorted by time and that's bad but if you go video id is a partition key created and comment id we have created that as a timestamp and therefore all our comments will be sorted by time and as a result when we retrieve comments we can show them most recent first very easily and we don't have to change anything they are sorted already so now take a look those slides have a slide of a year award and that's of joke of course but still i believe those are the most important slide what you will see at least during this presentation that's for sure and maybe all across a year with them you can build an efficient uh scalable cassandra database without them i'm afraid you can fail so please pay attention to what's going on right now that's important to understand only three rules but it's very important uh to follow them store together what you retrieve together avoid big partitions avoid hot partitions so first what does that mean store together what you receive together example you open a video on youtube we as a youtube want to show you all the comments for this video most present first for this exact video right all the rows within the same partition i store it together as a result that when we retrieve rows we are going to get all of them we better to get them all of them in the single query asking one single server or at least three servers but not a dozen of them so we want to fetch one partition in general try to fetch as less partition uh try to make it like as less separations as possible if all your date in a single partition we need to try to fetch on a single partition it decreases slot on cluster and decreases amount of network operations database works faster so this example is good we partition our comments by video id we also have created it and comment id for a primary key so we will store uh comments sorted by time and we will have them unique so next comment will not overwrite a previous one but what matters they partition it by video id as a result i can retrieve all of them knowing video id second point this example may be not so good if we don't partition our comments by video we partition them based on something else will it work yeah yes and no take a look imagine you are ordering uh pizza when you order a pizza do you specify a full address of your apartment or or your house i don't know about you but personally i do i do spit survivor full address if it happens what i wouldn't specify of a pool address how that would work delivery boy will have to knock to every door on my on my street and ask everyone hello sir did you order pizza hello ma'am did you order pizza as long as it won't reach my house does that sound stupid to you for me it does sound stupid that's why when you order pizza you give the full address now take a look what is a partition token in cassandra cluster partition token is the full address is your apartment number or your house number and then you uh give a full query like select comments with video id three five five five three three three five five five five five five five your driver will calculate particular values uh particular token for this partition and as your driver knows which server is responsible for this token range it will go directly to the server responsible for its token range grab your pizza oh sorry grab your data and give it back to you but if you want specify the full partition key it cannot calculate the right server and it doesn't know where to go what will happen then it will tell you are you um sane like are you fine uh there are one thousand of servers should i ask all of them no way i won doing that and you get an exception i am not going to make uh i'm going to going to ask them every server in my cluster it's called full cluster scan i won't do that and then there is an option in cassandra you can force your database to go and knock to every door on the street or every server in your cluster to ask is you may be responsible for this data and you may be responsible for this data as long as you have free servers it may work then you have more than one server a more than free server or maybe 3 000 servers it's as stupid as it sound when you order pizza you specify the full address same rule applies to cassandra you specify you will work with data you need to understand the partition that's why this example when you are going to retrieve all comments by video is bad you don't specify the video and therefore you cannot reach the comments without forcing your database to do a full cluster scan which is a very bad practice there is a great question on time from a poor of gupta can partition key be composite wait a second you will see so store together what you retrieve together that's quite clear second avoid big partitions so what does that mean take a look there is only one hard limit you cannot have more than two billion cells per partition how to calculate amount of cells very easy multiply rows by columns and you have amount of cells in your partition but there are some recommendations those are much more strict we recommend you to have up to 100 000 rows in a partition and up to 100 megabyte in a row partition those are best practices you can go above but try to still keep your partitions fit because it's not good when you have two big partitions your system doesn't going to work too well and we at data stocks work a lot with different cassandra deployments worst partition we've seen so far was 1.2 terabytes of data it's disgusting don't do things like that or i will come to you in your nightmares and ask you again not to do it in person avoid big partitions how does that work take a look at the first example we have again video comment comment by video video id is a partition create that and comment id as clustering columns our comments cluster it partitioned by video that makes sense because store together what you retrieve together and then when i'm going to retrieve all the comments by the video i have a single partition i can get it that's all good but you can tell me hey alex you just told us up to 100 000 rows in a partition and there are some videos in youtube that have more than 100 000 comments you are right but take a look uh what's the problem of um what problem we can face in this case first of all will we have a too big partition from the site's point of view no we don't because although we can have more than one hundred thousand comments per video they are still very very small what is a comment timestamp author name author id comment text video id commentating uh six fields maybe a little bit more but all of them are text fields small fields so okay even if we have 200 300 thousand comments per video they're still very small so from the site's point of view they will be fine uh second point um it won't lead to uh problems from the deletion data point of view because deletion is a separate story uh paella from pfeon will tell us about top stones today also recommend to attend uh but in general as the you wrote the comment you usually don't edit it too often or don't delete it many systems don't support deletion or editing of your comments like twitter for example and um as a well at least not after some time and as a result we will not have the system overloaded with this kind of operations so it's fine uh to have it like that but what's wrong with this example then country and user id imagine we all together work in the e-commerce company selling our goods in europe europe has a lot of countries usually not so big and we decided to partition our customers by country and we sell in belgium and we sell in france and we sell in italy and so on and so forth and we are doing well and everything goes good till one day we go with our goods to india on to china for example and somehow our goods were very in high demand then and they are extremely popular like everyone wants to buy uh something from us first of all colleagues congratulations it's amazing now we have a lot of money that's all good but now there is a problem in comparison with europe asia tends to have smaller count of countries but much bigger at least some of them not all of them of course but some countries are much bigger from the population point of view let's imagine we uh yeah we got a huge success in china literally everyone from the small babies to the elders buying something from us what happens and a result we have uh one part we have partition from france one partition from italy one partition for monaco which is a tiny country and we have like 100 clients there and like one billion clients in china what happens as a result our partition by country will be too big and you can tell okay alex don't worry we have money we will buy more servers we can expand our cluster it will be all set no it won't why because with replication factor pre per data center we have free replica servers for the partition and if we had then 10 servers in the beginning now we have money we buy 10 more servers our cluster now is 20 servers what will change it for the partition nothing because we're still replica servers free replica servers responsible for this partition that's like try to extinguish fire throwing paper into that you can add 1000 servers it won't help still have one big partition one overloaded partition which is um blocking everything and all on this server so second trick of the partition size you have to remember avoid big and constantly growing partitions that's a real situation real use case happened with fun of our clients i will give you no names because well of the client secrets but it's a real use case i've seen in my life imagine huge telecommunication company huge infrared internet of things infrastructure hardware all across the world different sensors reporting their state every few seconds every sensor makes a simple report sensor id timestamp value so sensor id is basically the unique identifier of the sensor timestamp is when it happen and value is what happened a value is like temperature or humidity or network for output at this moment and so on and so forth so whatever sensors can report can be here and we need to store this data so our original design for the table is sensor id and reported at is it a good design let's take a look we partition data by sensor does it make sense well watch the first rule store together what you retrieve together i tend to retrieve the data for the same sensor together so it's quite make sense if i want to understand the temperature fluctuations in my server room in the data center well then i can get the historical data from the sensor very easy and we use reported add so the report time first for uniqueness and second for sorting order so far so good so this design definitely makes sense and everything went well everything works but when something bad happened now please answer in the youtube chat what happened and then hey partha that was a very fast and a very fast and very good answer i actually answered it actually was very very fast indeed did you attend one of our previous workshops so indeed in the beginning it will work but as every sensor reports its uh status over time partitions will grow and aurora and grow and only grow and as a result after a few months considering the report will state every 10 seconds you will have huge partitions how do we solve this problem there are two options first one is uh put ttl time to leave cassandra is a really cool database i told you already cassandra can have ttl time to leave per row and even per value per row which is cool so when you store a data when you insert a row in cassandra you can set a time to leave and you can specify i won't you die in two months as a result in two months these row will disappear and therefore partition will be growing only till they reach detail and then alt rows will disappear that works and some clients are using this feature that's quite cool but for some cases it's not enough but in this particular example our client wanted to store data for many years and they didn't want to delete it after a couple of months okay how do we solve that then composite or compound partition keys that's the answer to a previous question uh i don't remember who asked that but doesn't matter someone asked that what is a compound or what is the composite partition key take a look in the new battery design we suggested our partition to consist of sensor id and month year and then reported that as a clustering column so this part is good basically we introduce it only month year as a new part of a report or new part of the data we insert into cassandra so sensor id timestamp and value are still the same but month here it can be integer or a string but it's a new value we add to a table new scientifical value uh how does that look like very easy today is july of year 2021 therefore month year will be 0 seven to zero to one and next month august will be my god next month is august that's awful where is my summer so next month will be zero eight two zero two one what it makes then imagine we have sensor id one in our month zero seven to one to the two zero two one so uh we go to um we are getting these reports and sensor rights rights rights rights rights we have a single first partition for this sensor then month is over and we have august uh this value will change and as a result hatchet value so token will change as well and we create a new partition and we write to a new partition or better to say cassandra creates a new partition for us so as a result we have new data stored there and it is available always and we have multiple partitions so we don't have constantly growing partition as soon as month is over data will be moved uh data so sorry the data will be stored to a new partition and basically a lot of people usually ask at this point uh what's the um them why can't we use just timestamp or why can't we use date why can't we use our for this field answer is while we are using month is very simple idea is don't forget when you query for data you have to specify pool address for your pizza delivery or full partition key for your cassandra and as a result if i'm going to query data from a sensor one for free last month how my query will look like select all from sensor data where sensor id equals one and month here in may june july right as a result i have simple uh sensor id equals something and month year in a list of three possible values so my select query is simple same and reasonable but if i specify something smaller than one if i specify day if i specify hour if i specify second approve uh how my query will look like if i'm going to retrieve data for the last three months for the same sensor if i'm using hours for example still the same select all from sensor data where sensor id equals month e equals one and timestamp or hour is equal first hour of may second hour of may third hour of may fourth hour of may you get the idea basically my select statement will be huge unsupportable and i will have to query for very many different partitions so store together what you retrieve together that's right and avoid big and growing partitions right but also don't make them too small if you don't really need that so you need to keep the balance and understand when to stop that's how we do it with bucketing that's how we do it with compound partition keys and finally next part is rules of a good partition avoid code partition basically i explained it to you already on the example of the country uh when you have multiple countries with a small amount of clients and one huge country with a lot of clients this partition will be hot everyone will be doing operations with this partition all the time and as a result it's overloaded whilst other idling and the worst thing you cannot scale because you can add as much servers as you want that would help as long as all the load goes to a single partition that won't help so avoid hot partitions uh by spreading workloads um then adding more workload will grow um amount of partitions because when you have multiple partitions and uh we i have three servers everyone is responsible for five partitions and it's getting hot i have a lot of clients all of my partitions are overloaded what i can do i can add more servers cluster will recalculate token ranges and spread data over new servers and as a result i will have less pressure on each server workload decreased on each one of them so that works very well so this one we've seen already this one we've seen already and you know what we have few minutes left i will show it to you on the next one right now i'm not interested in that i want us to go to lab directly so that won't be a workshop if you don't push the buttons now i want you to run cassandra cluster and put some data into that and you can tell me hey alex we have 10 minutes left i will download now cassandra i will install cassandra i will run multiple notes of cassandra build them together in plaster set all the things up and it will take approximately next hour how the hell is going to happen answer is astra so astra is a cassandra as a service offered by data stacks you don't have to deploy your cassandra because we already did that for you and oops uh so let me switch to it yes you have a link on this uh page github.com datastaxdevs workshop intro to cassandra i will throw this link to you in a moment data stacks there workshop intro to cassandra so you don't have you don't have to deploy cassandra because we did that already for you and you can use it for free what do you mean by free alex uh alex means free means free so as long as you don't run production workloads on your astra cluster so astra is a cassandra service you don't pay us at all we you get monthly monthly credit of 25 dollars that's like 40 millions of uh read operations some millions of rate of write operations like 40 gigabytes of data so if you earn money you faster then well we will bill you if you don't earn money faster we won't bill you and you can use it for educational purposes as long as you want so i send you the link and for the astra step now i will show you how it works so it's going to be github.com data stacks devs workshop intro to cassandra and that's the place you will get intro to cassandra for developers we will do a lap uh lab part from this one it consists of three simple steps create your astrodb instance or better get your astrodb instance because it's created already by us create a table and execute simple cql operations cassandra query language operations um and we can do it together or you can do it after a workshop so first i go to astra datastore.com oops i want to do it in a new tab you're right i already have my astro account so i will simply sign up with google and in your case you may also sign up with google or github or whatever you prefer next one you can you will have no databases so you will be asked to create one you will get to this uh page like i do already and you see this current plan is free tier up to 25 per month then pay as you go and then i'm creating a database i have to specify database name and key space name so obviously i will use values as it recommended from these um data starts devs a workshop intro to cassandra and database name for me will be killer video cluster you can put yours but in general i recommend to follow the instructions and key space will be killer video now answering question by approve select provider and region currently astra supports free provider google cloud amazon web services and microsoft azure you can pick any of them it doesn't matter i will choose google cloud because i'm a certified google cloud architect so it's kind of native for me uh from a region point of view pick any which is closer for you so i will specify europe and i will choose belgium europe west one because it's a closest to me and here on the right side you can see the current plan for each year up to 25 per month and you can see what one million of read requests cost less than 40 cents and right request 1 million of write requests costs less when 1.15 cents and storage is like 27 cents per gigabyte so basically using this free tier up to 25 per month you can have a lot so sounds good and i push the create database button good now uh your list will be less less complete and bit smaller than mine uh but you see i have this killer video cluster and the start of spending so uh to make me not wait i will uh actually use the previous killer video cluster to proceed with the steps it's all also europe 1 in gcp you don't have to follow these but if you want to get an attendance page participation page then you will have to complete it in your pace and then submit this work as explained in this workshop intro to cassandra by the way if you want to get a nice page for this intro to cassandra let me show it to you this one i believe no it's a case sandra i want to get back data stacks developers if you want to get a nice shiny page into cassandra workshop like this one we have already more than 200 people have ordered and you can be the next then you can and that's all verifiable so you can view it you can you will be able to verify your own page it will look like that nice you can put on your linkedin but you will have to submit your homework okay but we have then how do we connect and how do we start working with that idea is very simple every database has here a connect button and cql console button now we will stick to sql console and it will take a moment to start for cassandra query language shell and we are good so i can now work with my cassandra cluster directly and it's all in cloud i don't have to install anything and i can say describe the spaces and that's all my key spaces i have here then i can say use killer video i'm using k-space killer video i can create a table as explained at here right i can create table if not exist user by sitting good so i simply copy paste execute that and i have my table created i can ask for describe table users by cdm and i have my table here describe it and then i can start inserting and updating data we are almost out of time so i will just um show you how do we execute insert and then you will proceed without me because everything is explained in the link github repo i sent to you good so finally final step of this uh exercise is create insert update datum so basically we can just throw away data like that i copy it from that and paste it to my cluster and data is here so i can now execute a select statement and get my data from here okay looks like i have successfully inserted some data so this part is over uh what is next one data stacks dot ios indian yeah i was little bit in a rush in the end sorry but it's all explained by the link i sent to you so you can start using cassandra with this part now next one going to be a quiz and quiz means a game we will start quiz in two minutes so i will get back to you in a moment stay here answer questions and win the prizes you don't have to be a cassandra expert because if you uh listen for really enough if you get what i say to you then you will be good so i'm launching i'm executing a little hold on pause and i will get back to you in two minutes and we start with peace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay okay so uh welcome back hello everyone hi uh so uh nice to see you again nice to see you all that's um uh stefano lottini uh and alex volchniv developer advocates at datastax and we are happy to greet you here today and let's play a game let's win some prizes and let's go to main team mendy is the tool we use to ask you questions and if you give the right answer if you answer fast enough you get the prizes that's how it works so how do you join first of all i paste the link to this quiz on youtube chat second option you can just open menchie.com and use the code 78705295 and we will start with the simple questions before quiz so you will be used to mention my personal suggestion use your mobile phone to go to main team it's the easiest way so you will can watch you can watch and meanwhile answer questions with your mobile it's the best way and let's start with the first preparational question no rush it's just a training yet it's a drill not a real competition let's start simple what's your experience with a relational databases my sequel postgram whatever whatever you prefer oh black belt in joints that is cool wow a lot of experienced developers and looks like no one okay only one person with zero experience with relational databases mostly probably a student i would guess so you get to the right place to improve your knowledge on nosql databases although this right may be a little bit rough for you stay strong you will be good yeah but most of attendees definitely have good experience black belting joints use relational databases all the time or at least a little that's already something well i would say to all those who have a knowledge of relational databases you come to the right place if you want to learn something new right so so next then what's your experience with nosql databases xero elito a lot no sql guru and it's a little bit weird question because there are very many different databases in nosql and it would be a mistake to put them all together but but still in this question we do and it's completely fine so i see oh we are getting more and more attendees more and more people jump in nice uh that is good so we will have some competition in the end yeah it will be tough to win the swag yeah this time we have a lot of attendees and last question what's your experience with apache cassandra or datastax enterprise or data stacks astra okay we have a lot of newcomers we have some more experienced people but most of you are beginners and that's completely fine that's well expected distribution of votes because well that's a good place to start but you know what we have a second room with talks what a better feat for uh casa for people with experience with cassandra so far so good then we can start and let the battle commence now focus warm up your fingers warm up your brain you will have to answer as quick as possible and now notice youtube stream has a little delay one second of delay by youtube i cannot change that anyhow that's on youtube site so personally i recommend you to watch your manti first and then youtube because questions will appear a little bit earlier on your mobile phones than on youtube yes so look at your phones and this time answer fast and answer correct yeah now we have right answers and wrong answer you know that's not wrong answer to say i don't know no sequel that's a great answer you are here to learn but now that's a quiz competition and we have right answers and wrong answers so ladies and gentlemen start your engines because we start the piece and that's going to be question number one so answer fast to get more points how many master nodes does cassandra need at least three per cluster three per data center not a single one cassandra is decentralized enough to maintain consistency and time is up i want to see your answer oh such a shame such a shame only 42 people gave the right answer cassandra is decentralized so there is zero masternodes no masternodes they don't exist in cassandra an answer free per cluster or free per data center is obviously wrong this concept doesn't exist yeah that's a typical mistake of people used to other sql databases yep every node is created equal in cassandra yeah that's true democracy you know yeah well well well well well well so let me see leaderboard who is on the first place and who when not so fast skeets went fast enough with 927 points getting to the fastest place then boughty on the second and zlatan on the third but everything will change because we have more questions so ladies and gentlemen answer fast to get more points how data is being distributed by partitions all data is replicated to each server with address locators using post mail how data is distributed okay and your time is up and this time that was better better looks like you paid attention to a previous talk data is being distributed by partitions answer all data is replicated to each server is obviously wrong were you at the first talk done by a cloud data architect of netflix renek marcella they have a lot of data like really a lot if they would copy all data to each server they will went bankrupt to a very next day because data storage is not so cheap at this scale yeah so who was the fast and who is not so fast and who made the mistakes so raph was fastest and with one thousand eight hundred into one points t he gets to the first place great job keep fighting well done sarkar uh keeps his position in the top three and skeets went to the third place which is still enough because first three places will get the prizes and uh what i really vote for is all the coffee to alex on the ninth place thank you that's exactly what i need and actually that's what i just got one second ago so let's move on then that's going to be question number three and answer fast to get more points how to scale cassandra plaster that's enough how to scale cassandra cluster vertically upgrading servers or maybe increasing scaling factor horizontally by adding more servers or just you don't need to scale cassandra performance is always enough what do you think what do you think time is up and most of you gave the right answer you scale cassandra cluster horizontally adding more servers not vertically not increasing scaling factor there is not such a thing it's a joke there is no scaling factor in cassandra you may mean replication factor but it doesn't help you to scale the overall cluster performance and fourth option cassandra performance is always enough oh man that would be great yeah but let's move on and let's see on the leaderboard who made a mistake none of the leaders made a mistake and saurabh gave the faster again fastest that's such a performance two fastest answers in a row amazing skates hauls his second place very well but met her medka got to the third place that's good and take a look all the coffee to alex climbed to the eighth place keep fighting keep fighting i need more coffee if he wins you'll get your coffee yeah no you know what i'm going to get my coffee in any way yeah but there's quite some competition here very good we are only starting so that's question number four answer fast to get more points which replication factor is recommended 1.5 3 15 42 which replication factor is recommended five three fifteen forty two time is up and i want to see your answers okay it was easy uh most of you 86 people answered replication factor free is recommended and that's right some of them some of you said replication factor 15 and well ladies and gentlemen that's frankly speaking too much too much yeah maybe if you have five data centers and you have replication factor free per each it's fine but not replication factor 15 percent yeah and 1.5 uh i have to ask those seven people how do you imagine half of a server like should i use a chainsaw uh to make some cassandra cluster you able to use one point half i tried that doesn't work i don't know why half of a server just don't work sorry not even gluing it together yeah yeah yeah lazar lazar may work it's not working you know i'll approve i'm an old-school guy i prefer chainsaw yeah so gaurav gupta was fastest with time getting to the eighth place and that's a great result all the coffee to alex grow keeps growing now it's a sixth place but the top three looks like that saurabh dinesh and mukesh garc great job people let's move on also rahul is climbing up yeah that's slowly gaining the podium question number five hunts for fast to get more points cassandra cluster can be deployed on aws only any combination of cloud providers and premises data centers only one cloud provider of your choice sega mega drive i would love to take a look at that well you can deploy cassandra on arduino it isn't going to work very well but okay so it was easy any combination of cloud providers and on dc premises simultaneously cassandra is platform agnostic and data and cluster consists of multiple data centers and to answer questions please use menti.com to a youtube chat this way you have more chances to win prizes uh so how it goes on the leaderboard no mistakes by the leaders maybe we need to add more complex questions so souraph was the fastest again dinesh holds the second place and will cash for and the coffee the coffee fourth place is almost there also rahul rahul is keep fighting and take a look there is only three points difference between mukesh and over yeah yeah three points it's like one millisecond so mukesh stay strong and keep fighting you have to keep your third place okay so question 6 we are in the middle transfer fast to get more points cassandra cluster can have multiple data centers wrong single cluster can only have only a single data center correct but not more than two data centers correct some data centers are passive only for read correct all data centers are available for read and write okay try to surprise me okay okay okay okay you know what what i can tell about that you see there are a lot of people uh i would say 9 4 19 plus 9 but still thinking these relational databases thinking you see it's really very relational single cluster can have only one data center such a shame no correct but not more than two data centers no correct but some data centers are passive only for it no yes all data centers are available for read or write and you can have a lot of them within the single cluster yeah yeah sometimes the word replica might trigger false associations because in other databases speaking of replica databases implies that they are only read-only and jeremy in the chat makes a nice remark what's nice is that you can add data centers without downtime to your application absolutely true very good observation yes yes thank you for your power that's indeed very important information uh you can add more notes you can decommission notes you can update the centers you can decommission data centers cassandra is designed to have zero downtime deployments it's not easy you have it's a shared responsibility cassandra gives you tools you have to use them properly but together cassandra and you will build a perfect successful zero downtime team yeah so leaderboard are there any changes no mistakes uh for leaders and what are the changes gaurav gupta was the fastest again getting to the third place that's incredible lost his position getting to the fourth place by one point but one point different one point oh man that's so close so like yeah the battle is not over yet for dinesh dinesh keep fighting saurabh holds his first place mukesh hunts him like very very close and gaurav made it to the top three to the prizes list so that is interesting but that's not yet the end of the story there are more questions everything can happen so that's a question number seven you know what to do hunts for fast to get more points see if ethereum claims what in case of failure c a and p are all guaranteed only a availability is guaranteed only two or three capabilities are guaranteed or maybe we are going to need a new cap few seconds left you have to decide quickly did you pay attention right cp theorem claims what in case of a failed state only two or three capabilities are guaranteed and there are 17 people answer it what cap are all guaranteed and you know what stefano i think we have to ask them where do they leave because i'm going to move i will yeah i would like to live in such a world yeah that would be amazing guys you mostly probably have rainbows and unicorns and uh dragons because well it is a mathematical impossibility in this world unfortunately yeah it's like squaring the circle yeah yeah yeah you have to pick only two out of three yeah okay so what about the changes uh still no mistakes by the leaders leaders are doing very well and souraph was fastest and gaurav take over mukesh ah okay but dinesh is very close still still there's still there and albert is scrolling smoothly so we will see how it goes and we will see what we will have in the result because the battle is not over and that's going to be question number eight so to get more points answer fast recommended way to reach immediate consistency is read write one one read write one all read write worm quorum viva video chat well when i have to reach a consistency with separate we work together we usually use a video chat yeah so pretty well yeah yeah maybe it works for cassandra and most of you gave the right answer recommended way to reach immediate consistency is read quorum write quorum answer read write one o second answer we also will give you immediate consistency but it's not the recommended one and read write one one is quite a bad way to reach humidity consistency because do you remember the formula one plus one equals two if your replication factor more than twos mostly probably it's free then boom you don't have immediate consistency at all so show me the leaderboard okay so like all the leaders are giving the right answers all the time and saurabh was fast as you know what there are no changes on the leaderboard after this question it was too simple it was too simple um please try to reload the page 50. sometimes it happens we are sorry no you know what that's going to be question number nine so answer fast to get more points what is a key space what is a key space it's organized into rows and columns it contains tables and defines replication it defines it with partition key and contain rules it's a place to store keys five seconds to go and your time is up and the right answer is key space contain tables and defines replication it's not organized into rows and columns it's not defined fifa partition key key space contains tables and defines replication for the tables 15. so someone was too much in a rush okay let's see the the effect on the on the leaderboard of this it will have changed a lot yes i think so uh well so gaurav was before i'll take a look albert made it to the top three oh yeah yeah that's that's cool so saurak falls for first place go rough made it second close call yeah faster stands for good good good gaurav but albert made it like very smoothly faster faster faster faster faster and he's in the top three and well all the coffee to alex is on the fifth place that's still good result and let's take a look we are getting to the end and that's question number 10 so answer fast to get more points what is required in a cassandra table data columns clustering columns partition keys nothing is required everything is allowed your time is almost over the last one sounds like a philosophical position in a sense yeah time is up and we see what most of you gave the right answer partition keys are required clustering columns and data columns are optional indeed so what about the points who was the fastest with his time mukesh made a mistake oh he lost his chance to fight for the top three yeah and gaurav was the fastest again like we have a very strong competition here and all the coffee is four 40 points difference four position with 40 points difference that's good but let's take a look hey apurf i see you in top 10 top 10 then you have almost 100 people competing that's already a great result by the way yeah so question 11 of 13 answer fast to get more points cassandra tables contain multiple partitions only rows and columns replication factors endless seas of dreams and fears you answering fast and your time is over and the question is done so most of you gave the right answer you see 65 people already said have this right cassandra mindset multiple partitions table contain partitions not only rows and columns that's important and replication factors are defined by key spaces and we are getting closer and closer to the end and i can't believe it albert you did so great now it's time to say goodbye hello sixth place yeah but the coffee to alex made it to the third okay at the third position okay that sounds good so sour wrap in the first place gurav gupta is very close to him with 200 points difference that's not a lot all the coffee to alex on this third place and rahul is ready to fight for the third place staying on the 4. let's take a look on the next question it's question number 12 out of 13 so focus answer fast to get more points how cassandra executes joins joints require dedicated join table like in sql it doesn't it does but kinda lazy this one's going to be interesting so how cassandra execute joins right answer it doesn't cassandra is a nosql database it doesn't have foreign keys it doesn't have relations it does not have any joints there is nothing to join and by the way how you imagine joins on the distributed system with thousands of servers and petabytes of data they don't work i imagine them very slow yeah very very very very slow exactly so uh right answer it doesn't doesn't no joins and then you may ask okay how i'm working with data at all after all you know what there is a gentleman next to me well how next to me uh for one thousand kilometer next to me uh about here in the screen anyway yeah but here in the screen anyway he will answer this question in the next uh workshop which is going to be data modeling workshop yeah it's a two hours answer so be prepared right right right yeah but you know what we want you to be the best engineers and get the best salaries and to get that you need to pay some time and attention so uh leaderboard one question oh my god it throw it was frozen for a half second and i decided what saurabh made a mistake but he didn't very well so first place is still by saurabh second place by gaurav gupta with the fastest answer and all the coffee to alex is on the third and rapul is there following all the coffee trying to fight for the third place in the very end so you know what it's going to be last question so free your mind warm up your fingers concentrate focus focus focus breathe out breathe in are starting the last question answer fast to get more points single data center cluster of eight servers how many servers we have to add to double performance or 8 12 it's not possible to double the performance within a single data center a little bit nervous you are right and the right answer was eight servers cassandra has zero overhead on adding new notes so if you want to double your performance of your cluster of eight servers you have to double amount of the servers so some of you asked for it it's not possible to double the performance in the single dc it's wrong it's possible 12 servers usually you don't need usually double the amount of a servers under normal circumstances is enough to double the performance and some of you answer it for servers again i believe uh you know what these 14 people who answered four servers to double the performance of eight server cluster i believe those are still the same people uh from this miracle land where you have c a and p simultaneously like people really send me the key to the magic world you cannot double class for cluster performance with less than the size of the current sites of the cluster so sorry that won't work right answer is 34. uh people gave uh is eight i can let's see oh my god i i'm so nervous i'm so nervous i just cannot open the leaderboard alex stay strong you can do it the leaderboard is no mistakes between leaders saurav and gurav gupta gave the answer in exactly the same millisecond if uh saurabh get the first place gaurav gupta made it to the second place and all the coffee to alex made it to the third place and we can first place winners top three places uh make play screenshots of your uh phone or whatever you use make a screenshot uh to fix your uh winning position uh you will need it in a moment congratulations everyone congratulations everyone and i know i want i want to congratulate cedric is uh claiming he is all the coffee to alex ah okay hi rapu nice surprise to you rahul p you are getting the prize because cedric was all the coffee to alex but he is an employee of data stacks he cannot get the price so i tried to but we spotted him so rahul gets to the third place because all the coffee to alex is a datastax employee disappearing from the least and variable saurabh gurav gupta and rahul made it to the top three that's such a story what's that that's a plot twist so rahul take a screenshot we will tell we will tell that you deserve your prize [Laughter] thank you all thank you i really appreciate it yeah that's such a game great so i have to congratulate three groups of people first our winners saurabh gorath and raul you are great you made it to the top three in a very rough competition and that's incredible result you have the best you will get your prizes make a screenshot and send it to jack.prior at datastax.com uh stefano could you please support jack's uh yeah i i wrote it already i already opened it i will repeat it but i have to change so sorry and rahul p i have to change the message because yeah you know this was a absolute surprise to everyone so okay so here you will see there is an email address please take a screenshot of you winning and send a screenshot yes say hello to jack uh then i have to congratulate those who made it on the leaderboard so all the people saurabh graf srinivasa medka subba you made it to the top 10 out of almost 100 people competition that's a very good result uh you don't get the prizes if you are not in the top three but still it's a great result and i can only say we run workshops related to cassandra every week so better luck next main team and those who made it to a quiz but didn't made it to leaderboard do not be too disappointed without that yes we send the prizes to the winners but you know what that's not houses that's not ferraris uh nothing so big sorry it's only be a nurse uh we have limited budget yeah alex sorry important information they tell me that in the other room the screen is not being shared so you could maybe make sure there's a technical problem in the other room sorry there is a problem in another room they are not sharing the presenter is not sharing the screen and okay sorry sorry guys but that's the only way to immediately and fix this but second room should be empty now no it started payal kumari started already okay now about tombstones okay so uh say hello to everyone and i will check what's going on in the second room and congratulations to winners we have a pause for a few more minutes okay sorry alex sorry guys that was a bit of a technical urgency okay so we are about to have a break in this room until uh 16 15 ist so 35 minutes break and if you go to the other room if you don't want to take a break you can go to the other room and there is an interesting talk about tombstones so yeah thank you cedric because there was a question i was about to to answer yes maybe this interest this is of interest to some somebody else so uh tarum sharma writes that i'm preparing for data stack certification and i am using astra for practicing can i ssh into the system where astra db is running no you cannot ssh into astra because this is exposed as a service you cannot you do not have access to the to the cassandra software itself uh maybe the so for most of what is about the certification you probably do not need to to to access this layer of the system except and that's important for the administrator part because obviously if you want to prepare for the administrator certification it will be important to you know to to operate at the level of the system set up the cluster configure restart to do these things and this you can't do with astra but don't worry because there are other options for example well you might want to install a single a single node cassandra in your computer because that's absolutely feasible you can do that with docker you can do that in many ways or you can you can use our hands-on scenarios there are also scenarios where you can there are interactive scenarios where you can access the layer of the cassandra system and restart it and stop it and do your operation things so this is unfortunately not what astra offers because astra is a service that offers you the ready-made database you will never have to take care about what's behind what's below okay that's uh okay anyone has some resource for using docker for single node to try things yes we have documentation on docker let me uh let me fetch it because if you if you are familiar with docker it's a matter of a single line basically but there are specific i have to find them here okay um yeah so right well well let me let me drop you a link to the docker hub of data stocks where you find uh if i'm not mistaken here you find not only so you find also maybe this is data stocks only yeah you should also be okay this was for data stock so it's a that flower of uh it's that flower of cassandra that is packaged as datastax but you can also go and look let me find it you can go and look for the cassandra apache cassandra docker hub here so if you're familiar with docker i think that's very simple that's a good starting point you can download your you can grab your docker images and start running cassandra single note is very simple it's a one line docker command if you want to set up a multi node the docker maybe all in your machine if you have enough power and ram you can also do that with docker compose and i i will i will retrieve a very nice resource to do that you have to give me a second there is a there is let me find it here here no i can't find it now sorry we used uh okay i'll i'll write it later uh if i find a bookmark in my bookmarks but okay there are uh there are there is documentation and there are interactive scenarios to play with docker within um ah maybe it's here within um here i think that's it yes exactly so this is what i was looking for so give me time yes this is a very simple this is a very simple exercise that will give you some okay it's a hands-on docker exercise that you can run in your browser thanks to this catacode environment and you can simply do the exercise within the catacota scenario online in your browser you will learn to use docker to set up a single machine a single node cluster within docker within the scenario and then you can also reproduce it in your machine once you are comfortable with that okay so that's okay so there is a question uh how to submit the homework well the homework is hi alex welcome back did you solve the issue uh it's there is an issue on a speaker's side and okay let's see i cannot solve it we just uh starting uh from a second laptop uh second speaker i see okay uh so um you're answering questions i see well there were a few questions on how to start a cassandra from docker oh okay so we drop a few links also the very nice scenario by david chung which is a good way to flex your muscles in docker with cassandra uh yeah that's more or less it then there were how to submit the homework uh alex did you did you do the uh the the interactive scenario about uh crud during the uh only a little demo because we were out of time uh so that is the homework yeah that that is the homework your homework is to go to this um link this cent in sly a few times already um i will do it again github.com um data stocks devs workshop intro to cassandra and it's all explained at them so i'm sending it to chat let me see one two three uh and besides that i believe we are having a pause right now yeah uh well 15 minutes more or less yep first room goes to um a little vacation let's say for 15 minutes or about that and second room i will start with a little delay because of these speakers issue on them second room we are working to recover and we will proceed with some little bit shift for now tom stones simply explain it and performance tuning on cassandra later and grafana dashboard for apache cassandra in the first room we meet again at uh 16 so 4 p.m 15 minutes indian standard time for data modeling workshop with stefano and i hope i will be able to join you and maybe uh add some comments if you don't mind yeah that would be very welcome great so we go to the browser i'm switching for that have fun [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] i do that [Music] okay ladies and gentlemen so ready or not we are coming here we are yes uh we are here and we are ready that's stefano tv datastax developer advocate uh his job is make you better developers and he's your best friend remember his name and well me as well but maybe we are friends already i hope so that's going to be data modeling for apache cassandra building efficient applications and stefano now uh it's you uh by microphone so let's start okay thank you alex hi everybody welcome back uh yes so we have had fun with the quiz now it's time to get serious and we will speak about data modeling data modeling uh as a subtitle building efficient applications actually another subtitle is how not to shoot yourself in the foot with apache cassandra so how to start in the right way when it's time to build an application and design the database around it with cassandra so let me quickly tell you a few practical things many of you ask for this so this content is recorded and it will remain available on youtube then uh it's good to repeat if you have questions you can write them in the chat because we we have a look at the chat alex and i uh there are other people from that from data stacks who monitor the chart and help you with the questions but most important keep the keep the questions for these dtsxio cd india questions address because there we collect the most relevant the nicest the best the most voted questions and some of them will win prizes and we will discuss them at length so please if you ask questions there add your name if you want a chance to win some prizes or you can join us to our in our discord channel where we can go on with the discussion even after the stream ends so please remember those ways let's keep in contact uh okay so we this workshop will last uh slightly lesser than two hours and it will cover the very important topic of data modeling you see here some other links so we have a forum academy we have spoken a bit about them already so i will go further okay so for this workshop we assume you know something of the fundamentals of cassandra at least you should know what the database is and uh well if you know what a relational database is then good but also careful because part of this workshop is teaching you how to unlearn something of relational databases so when we say cassandra here we mean any cassandra which might be apache cassandra itself or the data stocks enterprise um packaging of cassandra and rich packaging of cassandra or we can also mean the the astra db which is a cassandra as a service offered by data stacks anyway the logic is the same the maker the architecture is the same so everything applies to all cassandras so who am i uh i am stefano i'm a developer advocate at datastax and yeah here are my contacts so feel free to contact me and that would be appreciated okay so let me start what are we seeing today what we will speak about there will be some introduction to cassandra just to level things up then we will touch the important topic of denormalization which is one of the most important concepts that if that makes cassandra stand apart from relational databases we will then see how through the usage of keys and partitions how is how the data is stored and grouped and arranged in cassandra which will be the basis for exam examining what kind of queries one can do on the database then finally armed with all of this knowledge we will have a look at the data modeling process in itself after that we will briefly touch on a few other uh topics that are uh important and they make they are part of the data modeling process but they are not the most the basic parts okay so we have a nice number of uh uh attendees we can start i think alex yeah sales definitely let's go okay so let's go introduction so what is data modeling well uh when you are creating an application backed by a database at some point you have to create your database so you start with a general idea what your application should do and you end up with the database created designed in all its details this process is the data modeling and when you do data modeling with cassandra there's a particular way to work and this is what i will illustrate so what is cassandra well you have probably seen uh you have probably seen and heard alex speak at length about cassandra let me just summarize it in a basically one slide it's a nosql database very high performance in terms of size and speed both and it's a database that can give you so much but it is it has its particular features so you have to learn how to use it so when i mean size when i say size we mean the so-called web scale so something like hundreds of petabytes of database when we mean speed uh in particular cassandra is optimized to be very very fast in writing but also reads are fast because of the way data is uh stored and when you mean okay okay sorry cassandra is able to with to to support uh tens of thousands of operations per second per node in for example rights uh what do i mean by per node well cassandra is made to be distributed in it's made to be a databasing cassandra is made to be spread over many many different nodes whereby nodes i mean single servers machines virtual or physical no matter and in cassandra a database is distributed not only meaning in over various nodes but also it might be geographically spread for example all over the world no problem cassandra can deal with that the cassandra is nosql it means not only sql that's the meaning of the nosql tag it is a very general label given to many different databases but in particular cassandra is known is not is a database that is non-relational and it's not transactional so there are no joins there are no foreign keys there are no transactions when you do operate when you do writes in the data well that's basically because a join would not scale very well if you have hundreds of thousands of nodes so there is no hope to coordinate on such a scale so they they have to invent a very different paradigm and well this is one of the reasons why you will need a very different way of thinking about how you model your data okay so what do i mean by learned how to use it well again it's a it's easy to get your data model wrong and uh especially for those of you who come from a renaissance relational background in a sense most of the data modeling consists of learning to think in a non-relational way all the way from the start especially if you get the data model wrong then your database will behave in a suboptimal way so the performance will be bad or maybe it will very it will not even work uh so that that means that you will need to know something about how cassandra works internally okay so another another important observation about cassandra is that cassandra sits in a very precise place in the axis that you see here in the slide the oltp olap access what do i mean by that oltp that is online transaction processing is the kind of a workload you do with a database when you when you need very fast operations that are very simple let me say fast and simple on single pieces of data so you need to update a single row very fast you need that it is absolutely real time almost real time and the queries usually are always the same think of a warehouse management system for example on the other hand on the other end of the spectrum you have olap workload that means online analytical processing and that is a kind of usage of a database that is very different it involves very complicated analysis that can run for hours or anyway they are not they do not need to be real time you can take they can take their time in a sense and they involve very complicated juggling with the data the queries are complex and the queries are maybe experimental because every night the big analytics have to run in a slightly different way and so on and that is a very different thing so the point is that a relational database with all its limitations for example scale limitations somehow sits in the middle and is able to more or less handle all kinds of workloads cassandra takes a very precise stand in that and it is designed to optimize scale and speed and it is made to work best in the oltp side of things so cassandra sits on one particular site that is not equivalent to say that cassandra you will never be able to do all up with cassandra because you can plug additional solutions on top of cassandra using that as a storage engine you probably know spark for example or hadoop maybe still relevant knows you can use such and other tools on top of cassandra using that as a storage but cassandra in itself is made for very fast very simple you know it's more fast than smart let's say in this sense yeah but i want to say about that a lot of people um misunderstood or under underestimate this shift and they uh try to first of all uh sidebar bar says almost every oltp system is normalized no not almost every ltp system is normalized if otp system wants to be quick it has to denormalize sorry um we will come to that yeah we will come to that and uh second point um what i wanted to say uh for uh on um small to medium projects uh we use it to have um single database uh can you please switch to a previous slide sure yeah so with traditional relational databases they are a little bit of everything and we use it to have single database for all the purposes a bit of otp or little bit of a lap but then working on the big workloads working with netflix scale now working with facebook scale and so on that doesn't work well because you need to have more of that and we you use it to use multi-purpose or general purpose databases like postgresql for example for the big project simple a single database is just not enough that's why most of the big projects using multiple databases at once thank you stefano your turn yeah thank you for the remarks okay so let's summarize very quickly a few features of cassandra so cassandra's big data ready it is able to deal with very huge amounts of data it is very highly available it has no master node it has no it it is a democratic architecture so it has no single point of failure it is able to offer uh no downtime basically zero downtime it can be geographically distributed anyway it is distributed and that involves the cip theorem you might have seen with alex earlier it is optimized for a very fast performance in reading and in particular in writing which is usually the the bottleneck for many databases and it is open source it is vendor independent there will never be log in if you use cassandra which is a point that is very much important there are also some other observations some other maybe cones one can spot looking at cassandra in particular it requires qualified engineers you learn to use cassandra after doing it for some time after studying it after learning it but that's actually a good point because you you might become the next person to get a very well paid job because you know cassandra which is in much in high demand cassandra might be a bit complicated to manage in some cases so doing operations and setting up configuring might be not so easy that's yeah that might be true but there are managed solutions that obstruct from you all of these needs and you just have a database that you can use in the cloud another point is that cassandra as we said is focused on oltp workloads but as i said already you can plug spark hadoop other olap solutions on top of it no problem and then it has it is not extremely elastic in terms of search capabilities but then again you can plug uh leucine-based solutions on top of cassandra again so solar solar or elastic surge they can work on top of cassandra no problem so yeah so let me just to give you a glance on what is what we are going to see next when you do data modeling there are two different completely different ways to approach it and that is relational databases versus cassandra and this one table tries to summarize it all so what in relational databases is accomplished by making heavy use of joins and building indexes in cassandra is done in a completely opposite way by com by using and using a lot the concept of denormalization which uh i will touch in detail in a second uh a traditional relational database is based on the idea of referential integrity that is built in in the database cassandra cannot afford that because that would not scale at the size cassandra is able to to to reach in a relational database the role of the primary key of a table is that to guarantee uniqueness and that's it in cassandra the primary key defines uniqueness but also gives the table instructions on how to partition data and and how to group data and store it and also has consequences in how and how fast you can access those data data modeling in a relational database starts with the data usually you describe the data then you you make them into a model and then you think of your application so it's driven by the entities that are uh part of the application that are part of the flow in cassandra you take we take a completely upside down approach and we start with the application we start examining how the application works and then we model and then we write the tables so it's based on the flow of the application which is the the same as saying it is driven by which queries will be part of your application uh you will see more on all these points shortly okay so this is this is the introduction and we start in the going into much in a bit much more in detail so let's speak about denormalization what is it well i will start with normalization so normalization is a concept that was uh invented more than 50 years ago and that it was a pillar on which relational databases were invented the idea is to embed data integrity in the database by imposing constraints and relations between table in particular the point is you will never want to duplicate information in many places of your database so that you will never have mismatches so you don't duplicate information and whenever whatever is the the query you want to do on the database whatever is the information you want to do in the database there is always a single source of truth for every single individual piece of information so look at this example we have recipes like cake or pizza and we have ingredients like like mozzarella or champignons in the real world every recipe contains many ingredients and this relation is realized by so the word pizza appears only once and the word champignons appears only once the fact that pizza contains champignons is in a third table that only contains the the co the code the id of pizza and the idea of champignons it is not like a repeat pizza many times in many places because there are many ingredients that's the main point of the normalization of the of normalization sorry let's make myself clear this is very nice in theory very good and it works nice it might have a cost the cost is that sometimes to retrieve the information you need you have to to make a round through various tables and you have to mix and re-edit the information that as you retrieve it from the database which is called basically a join so let me make this example a bit more sql so the same relation between recipes and ingredients is now made into tables as you would write them in sql so we create the table recipes we create a table ingredients you see recipes have an id ingredients have an id all nice and perfect and then we need a third table that just describes every relation between a single recipe and a single ingredient so we have three tables and every time we want to know something about pizza we need to look at all three tables so the point is that we have designed the tables in a way that they describe the word there are ingredients on one side and recipes on the other side but then when it's time to know what are the ingredients i need for a pizza i have to look at all three tables and i have to do what the joints so i have to start matching ideas and coming up with the final answer you see here pizza mozzarella pizza champignon perfect that is what i need i just want to know what is to be put in my pizza but that needs looking up several tables and if you think of that on a scale of many many many rows that starts to be unbearable in terms of performance a good thing of the relational model is that usually once you have your mo your tables done you can ask various things you can have various kind of information from the same table so i want to know the idea of cake i use the same table and i do just a different query that's super nice but usually you are more concerned about performance in these cases which leads me to this light denormalization what does it mean it means we might want to sacrifice this very nice and elegant and formally mathematically beautiful idea of normalization and we sacrifice it for performance because you see even with relational databases the typical story many of you probably have lived is that yes normalization is nice but my queries start to be very slow i can optimize them all i want but at some point they will just be slow because they are too complex so even in a relational databases from time to time people start thinking okay i can sacrifice i can do this small duplication of data just a bit to make my query go faster i duplicate the name pizza and marine rows so that i have a simpler simple query and my query goes faster my application is well performant and my customer do not turn to the competitors because my site works fast which is the point after all so this was already there in uh relational databases but there was a bit of a you know clandestine solution what cassandra does is say okay let's embrace this approach from the start as a first class citizen in our database let's forget about normal forms and let's just apply the normalization completely so my queries will be fast that's more or less the point of the normalization so that in this case if i want to know the ingredients for a pizza i just look at a single table you see there are there are many rows with pizza and many rows with cake so what it is fast i can do my query that's the big point so the denormalization is based on this idea let's make the data redundant no problem that's okay as long as every query needs to look at a single table that's super nice because it is faster it is faster not only because there are no joins but also because so it is fast for two reasons in a sense one is that i don't have i don't need to do joins i just browse a table and that's my answer not only that but also uh you basically are moving the the burden of making the join to the to right time instead of read time and the right which which is ultimately responsibility of your application that writes the data so it's not it's not anymore in the database the join it's in the logic of your application but the writes can go in parallel while a joint can't so even not only you move the applic you move the problem to right time where you probably can afford it a bit more latency in most cases but you also you also make it faster because the rights can can work in parallel because every table never speaks to another table in a sense in such a database because there are no joins there are no foreign keys there are no nothing that's by the way the only solution that is able to scale to scale to to very big distributed systems so you see this uh this small sketch on the left is a relational database every query can have a look at many tables and has to do their their thing and then combines data and then you get your your solution your answer in cassandra you design tables so that every query just straight goes to a single table reads the data and there you are okay so the point is exactly that you combine all columns that you need for your query in a single table you do not do joins and the queries are very simple because it the queries are always go to that table retrieve the data and browse it that's it so one table per query no more than one table and but that means one thing in your design of the database you start with the queries and then create the tables which is a point that we will develop much more later another point which might be hard in some cases for relational people is that there's no problem in duplicating data as long as you know what you do so redundancy is your friend so that does not only mean that i might have many rows with pizza but it might also mean that i can have two separate tables with more or less the same information arranged in a different way because they have to support the different queries again yeah it's uh it's strange sometimes sometimes to think okay i have to i want to duplicate my data but think of performance what does it what what cost more having more storage or having more milliseconds in your queries and your customers switch into competitors that's a big that i mean that's at the end that's the practical consideration right okay so this is uh this is how um how it generally works with uh with the denormalization with that in mind let's have a closer look at what happens when when cassandra stores data in in the in its tables okay so we are about to go to a section that is a bit more concerned about how is data stored in cassandra which is in a sense architectural detail if you want but it is far from that it is very important to have a clear idea on how the data is stored in cassandra and how it is distributed between nodes because that is the secret for a successful data model am i right alex yes definitely okay so do have you seen some interesting questions or something or can we see it actually i was out helping with the second room okay so i was not here for the last few minutes sorry i see what jeremy is answering questions okay yes i see thank you jeremy okay so i uh let's go let's proceed in this case anyway uh feel free to put the questions in the in the address that you have been given maybe alex you can paste it again so we might collect the best questions for the q a session later yeah and by the way there are some good questions don't forget them do don't forget to put them in the q a part i will paste the link again soon i wanted to add a li i wanted to say a word exactly when i had to go um about joins um about this competition normalization to denormalization there are two things i want to say can you please switch a couple of slides back to the normalization the normalization story yeah maybe things was this one yeah yeah but that doesn't matter so take a look uh first of all we use it to be if we were taught in the universities at the database courses and so on and so forth what normalization is great and generalization is bad um how to say it in english only sith sikh uh put everything in the absolute it's i'm trying to quote uh star wars it's not like that in real life it's all relative yeah it's all relative uh relative and we use it to think what the normalization is good the normalization is bad no it was a lie people lie to you all your life since your very first day they told you what normalization is good the normalization is bad it's false it's wrong it's not like that the normalization is great then you keep it under control then you understand what you are doing then you know how to normalize when you know how to de-normalize when you are in control of normalization versus denomination then you can use both it's not a star wars uh realm then you can have like the dark side of of course white good side of the force and you can have only one of them let's say yeah that's uh in uh real life you can have all of them and be pretty successful with that using event normalization when you needed the normalization when you need it thinking about that and keeping it under under control when normalization when the normalization is bad the normalization is bad then you do it because you don't know normalization or denormalization then it's bad then not you control the normalization but the normalization controls you then of course it's very bad yeah sure but that's true also for relational databases because you might end up slave to the relational logic and end up and you might have queries that are too complicated to even understand so that's really any complex tools might be might end up owning you that's a general lesson i would say and second sorry where is the second point sorry very second point again uh people often don't understand a huge difference between this normalization to the normalization competition if you go to normalization you don't duplicate your data but you pay with joints and joints ladies and gentlemen are way much worse when you can think of them and then you go with the normalization you pay for it for a higher amount of rights because you have to check change data into multiple tables but now think about the trick multiple rights first cassandra's rights are very fast second cassandra rights are executed in parallel and third you can execute multiple writes at once in a single asynchronous way if you are going to update three different tables you run those update statements in parallel and you are good you can parallelize them as a result you will have not free updates executed one by one by one so it will be a duration of time of a free queries but it will be duration of one query because you executed those three updates simultaneously right so by the time consumption it's more or less the same but let's take a look at the joints when you see a long select statement for example i will join and join and join and join and join one time in my life i've seen a select statement with 61 join in it 61 join in single select statement it was luck maintaining that yeah good luck maintaining that but that's not the worst problem worst problem is joints can be executed only synchronously one by one by one by one you cannot execute joints in parallel they are always being executed next to next to next to next to next and by itself joints looks like a simple operation but first of all you are going to have chains of joints and second you are going to have your data growing and growing and growing and growing now every company is a data company that's 21st century welcome ladies and gentlemen as a result considering those two facts the normalization is not bad as long as you control it not it controls you and we can parallelize uh rights but we cannot parallelize joints situation looks a little bit different thank you stefan i'm done yeah i see people in this in the chat who are sympathetic with your situation so very complex joint that will explode in your face okay um yeah so tarun sharma asks a question that uh about how data moves when you add or delete nodes i have to skip that because that is a bit of topic uh we might come back to that and make sure to write that in the q a if you don't if you didn't already now let's go on with the data model or most more specifically let's see how our data how is data stored in cassandra so as i said you have to know how your table is designed because that defines not only uniqueness of your rows but also defines how are the rows distributed and grouped and which implies what kind of queries can you do and you can't when you read data or when i say count i usually say they are unbearably slow in production but it's the same as saying they just can't be run right we want our customers to be happy to use our application and whatnot okay so this is not a technical concept this is important to know how to model your data and make your application successful so let's go in detail okay first point which is very much similar to relational databases a table in cassandra is rows by columns nice so far so good and much like in a relational database a table in cassandra has a primary key which is a selection of columns that defines uniqueness so you cannot have two rows with the same values in the primary key because that is a single row by definition so let's look at this table we are now using an example in which there are recipes like pizza or cake and these recipes are rated by reviewers so anita gives an eight to the pizza carl gives a nine to the pizza zoe gives a two to the pizza and poldo gives a three to the cake so this is a site that collects this kind of information and we have such a table by the way pizza pizza pizza this table is absolutely denormalized because we are in cassandra and we want our query to just read from this table okay so what is a good choice of the primary key for this table obviously obviously different rows might refer to pizza because it's different reviews different persons so we sure have to to in include in the primary key at least recipe name and reviewer because otherwise if you if we just have reviewer we the the poor anita will not be able to review two different things and we if if we just have pizza not two person will be able to review pizza so absolutely those two columns have to be part of the definition of uniqueness of rows so the primary key now the question is shall i add or not date well yes or no depends on your model what are you what are you trying to do with this table do we want an application where every reviewer is allowed to just give a single rating to a particular recipe okay if so then uniqueness will be defined by recipe and reviewer and date will be just a data column but if our application wants to allow reviewers to give a history of reviews today yesterday and the day before that i give different values to pizza then i have to include date in the primary key so you see the primary key is partially depends on mostly depends on what is the particular real-world situation that i want to describe in my table okay one thing that probably does not make sense is to include another column such as rating if i include rating in in the primary key then i might end up with different columns that differ only by rating and what is that a quantum vote so that doesn't really make sense right so so let's assume we want an application where uh anita can vote for pizza now and also next week so we we choose that the primary key so the set of columns defining uniqueness is recipe name date and reviewer okay so now you see i made them blue so there there will never be many more than one row with the same three values that's the point of uniqueness okay so this is so far something that relational database people will find very familiar now let's move to unknown territory oh no okay that's a consequence of what we said so far when you do an insert when you insert data at least you have to provide the values for the primary key otherwise you are not even specifying a row to change or to to create so uh in the same sense you cannot just edit or update the value of a field in the primary key because that would mean you are creating a changing on a on a new row so the other row can the other column can be changed edited in place if you want conceptual at least but those are defining what what is the row so the blue ones are defining what is the row so they cannot be edited in that sense uh okay just a small remark why don't we introduce a column called recipe id created on the fly and use that somewhere in our application well indeed we could we could the choice between using surrogate keys or organic keys is well nuanced i would say and depends basically on the flow of your application and that's also the case in a in a cassandra database so it depends on your use case you might find the the application that is you might find cases where the application is uh works better choosing to invent keys to guarantee uniqueness and other cases where this is this does not pay off uh i will not do that today but it's absolutely a perfectly fine choice in some cases uh there is a question from nitya lakshmi asks in this case anita can give review only once in a day right yes because okay yes i didn't okay that's very specific uh good question by the way good question because in in this example to make everything short and understandable the column date is just a day does not contain hour or minutes or seconds if the if if it were a time stamp then there could be a review for each individual milliseconds or whatever which would maybe hardly make sense but anyway yeah good point so i wanted i wanted to take everything very simple on screen so yes one day so the resolution of the column is day thank you yes uh and uh there are two possible consequences if we allow multiple rights per day uh then uh yes uh every new uh review from the same reviewer will overwrite the previous one for the same day for the same re recipe uh or we can use lightweight transactions and prevent multiple reviews from the same reviewer for the same receipt uh that's for the use case and indeed i believe we can use datetime in this case like justlyne suggested if we use datetime then we can have multiple reviews per recipe per review right yes yeah good points and both of them will be touched later in the slides so stay tuned for more on lightweight transactions if we make it but i think so okay okay so let's move on partitioning so you have seen what the primary key is at the primary key has a logical role in in your table in a sense now partition key this has been touched by alex already in the fundamentals lesson the partition key is a subset of the fields of the primary key and at least one column has to be there and that defines which rows are grouped together in partitions and also defines how are those rows those partitions distributed across the cluster nodes so again as i said this might seem a simple technical implementation architectural detail but it is crucial to know that to design your data model properly so let's go to an example let's keep this table recipe name date reviewer i decide that the partition key is just recipe name so what does it mean well you see in a slide you're seeing a slide that is very very chaotic that's for a reason because i have a replication factor of three so you see this partition pizza it is repeated in gray also in this node on the left on the right and also in this node below it so let me tune replication factor magically to one which makes everything easier to understand don't do that in production because that is a bit of a fragile architecture but now in these slides we can so what is partitioning you see i have rows these uh orange blobs are the nodes of my cluster and i have rows stored in this table this table is distributed across the nodes but you see all rows with recipe name pizza are close to each other they live together on this node all rows with the pasta live together on the nodes to the right and so on so what does what does it mean once you define the partition key columns you are defining how are the rows kept together in partitions and that is very important you see there are no rows with the same recipe on different nodes if i want pizza i have if i want everything about pizza i can go to a single note and i'm sure i have i will have everything the opposite is not necessarily true i might have as is the case here for cake and rice i might have several partitions stored on a single node but that's not a problem obviously the important point is that i will not have pizza scattered through the cluster so each row belongs to partition and the partitions are defined by the choice of partition key there is a hashing algorithm alex mentioned the more more three partitioner which makes the partition into the the values in the partition key into a big number this number is used to decide what is the node hosting the data my point is if you are if you are able to make sure that everything about pizza is on a single node then you're golden because you are sure that every query that needs just stuff about pizza will be fast because it will go to a single node it will never have to look around several nodes so it's your responsibility to figure out what is what are the needs of your queries so what are the needs of your application what will be the queries that you will use in your application and you will design the partition key accordingly so i know that i i want to get stuff from this table only for a given recipe and i can decide the partitioning is like that alex you're welcome to say something there are multiple people ask at the same question that means what it's important yeah uh so uh but uh we can discuss it one minute later i'm not sure if i interrupted you uh well i don't know maybe maybe another maybe a next slide will speak about that but please uh yeah well as far as i remember you want so the question was um same question multiple outers what if i have pizza node growing and reach storage size or uh same uh what if pizza data size is more than a no it can hold so what if data is gross take a look there are two situations then data on the server grows and then partition grows when data on the server grows don't forget what server holds multiple partitions you add more servers to the cluster cluster recalculates token ranges partitions moving to a new empty server all servers are unloaded and therefore you don't have your server overloaded as a result if your data module is good then all good you add more servers you get more space so there is no problems if the server is overloaded just add more servers but there is a second scenario when not a second per se is overloaded but partition is too big as we discussed it on the previous session then it's a very different story adding of new servers won't help if you have one single huge partition so basically that leads to a very different problem it means what your data model uh was wrong from the very beginning or not or not perfect anymore because of the business requirements changing then you have to so you cannot change partition key it's not possible uh so the only thing you can do is then in this case create a new table and migrate data to a new table and i hope i've answered it in very question can you alter the partition key of a table after it's created no you can't and uh question why is pi and fish in the same partition this i answered in the chat but that's the point they are in the different partitions yeah so usually you have a i don't know millions of partitions for example because there might be a lot of recipes but you have a cluster with five nodes so what do you do you you will sure have many partitions sitting on the same node but that's not a problem that's something that happens and it's okay and as alex said if if this is somehow a storage issue you can add the nodes and the partition will be redistributed what is important is that a partition will never be cut in half and they kept a bit here and a bit on the other node that's the important thing the opposite is not a problem okay so the point is that when you do your query if you want your query to be fast you want it to be a to to access a single partition which implies to access a single node to speak directly to a node that's the big takeaway now let me just show you what happens if i if i have the same table the same primary key but i decide that the partition key is different so you see instead of recipe name now my partition key my partition key is recipe name reviewer now it is the same data the same rows but they are grouped in a totally different way you see i have fish and salad here on the top i have cake on the left i have pasta or i should say better i have fish car in a partition salad nina in another partition cake poldo in another partition and it is important to note where is pizza well pizza is a bit here pizza joy on the right and a bit uh in the in the bottom left pizza anita and pizza card but those are now different partitions because what define the partitions now is the combination of recipe name and reviewer that's because i designed the table like that for my reasons so what is important now is that yes i have partitions and as you see you see uh here on the right salad aldo is two rows and they are together because it's a partition the partition defined by a particular recipe name and a particular reviewer so my point is that if you change the partitioning which you can't do once the table is there so if you design a table with a different partitioning the same data will be grouped in a different way and spread on the cluster in a different way then what is the right choice between those two examples well there is no right choice it depends on the query you want to run so the first case where recipe name is the only partition key is a is a way of arranging the data good to answer a question such as tell me all reviews of pizza because that hits a single party a single partition which means a single node the table on the right is not able to answer my question tell me all recipes all reviews for a pizza but is able to answer a question such as tell me all reviews of the pizza by zooey because that now is a partition it's a smaller partition if you want so there is a really tight relationship between the table shape and the queries i want to run on them okay this is a very important point one might be tempted to say okay let's make a super giant big partition so i can do all queries i want but then i will have two big partitions and we would have problems of uh other kinds so the problems that alex mentioned so too big partition is also a problem for various various reasons one is that i will have all data on a node and the other nodes sit in there idle and i'm wasting my resources if the database is able to to be up like that maybe that one partition is too big and then i got the partitioning very wrong okay so you might start thinking oh damn but i might have to support the different queries so my application will be able to give me all pizza reviews but also all reviews by anita which are two different queries two different ways of looking at the same data so how do i do well the answer is create two tables which is nice two tables each one built exactly to answer a single query so each one will have the same rows the same primary key by the way but the partitioning will be chosen differently and each one of those two table will be able to answer fast that one of the two queries and this is a full full power of the normalization now you create two tables no problem you use more disk probably it's not a problem as long as my application is fast now it is up to my application to do double insertions we already mentioned this point but that's again that's no problem if i write my application in the right way that is absolutely doable and it's not even a performance penalty on the contrary it is the only way to make my application fly on very high volumes of data and traffic right and read the traffic so you see so far we have said that in cassandra you need a single table for a query but in most cases you need a single query per table so these are two queries on the same data and they end up requiring two different tables but again that's okay you can do it you don't have joins come on okay let me touch on two typical problems you might encounter when designing partitions let's stay on my example of recipes we have a partition key that is recipe name so we have a partition for pizza and a partition for soup now everybody knows that pizza is very good delicious and soup maybe nobody likes soups let's say so there is a lot a lot of reviews coming in for pizza all the time and nobody thinks of soup well that's a imbalance because we will have a partition that is very thin and one that is super big not only that but one of the two will constantly receive rights and we have to work a lot and we and the node hosting that partition will be very busy and this is what is called the hot partition which might call it hot pizza also in this case usually if you identified such a problem you end up you solve it by rethinking your partitioning so you for example in this case we add uh we add a date in the partition key we make the partition smaller more evenly distributed between nodes and the also the the right load is a less a hot spot on a point again to do that you have to examine your application and make choices that are compatible with how your application intends to work there is another problem that might arise after some time of your data model working you might have a model that works for example look at look at the example below you have recipe name and reviewer so there are relatively small partitions because we added reviewer everything works for some time but then what happens time goes by month after month after year and the partitions will grow unlimited so at some point there will be too big okay maybe that's probably not happening for when it's when it's a chef's reviewing recipes but think of an internet of things sensor network that collects sensor every second and stores them in partitions at some point maybe in a few months your partitions will be too big they will have billions of billions of data now what is the solution in the case the solution is the so-called bucketing so you see what i do here on the right i invent a new column that does not contain any new information it is just a column that i calculate on the date it is a string say year underscore month whatever and when i insert data i add this column i added the value for this column and i make this column part of the partition key so what does it mean that every month my partition is in a sense locked finished it will not receive rights anymore and i start with a fresh partition so i keep the same amount of data but in a more manageable way and if you think of a recipe application or also an uh an iot sensor network probably the data of two months ago i can keep them but i will maybe not even need them or if i need them i can query them month by month or something so my application might be it usually is able to cope with such a choice okay so let me go forward so so much for partitioning the important message is you have to know how your table is partitioned because your data model depends on it ideally you never have queries that look at more than one partition which means that you have to store together what you will retrieve together now a remark you will never want to query data from different partitions but the opposite is absolutely okay so let's say you have a partition with all pizza recipes you're not it's not uh necessary to retrieve all the partition at once you might want part of the data there and that's fine with some constraints that we are about to see but that's fine itself so there's no need there's no need to have queries that get all data from your partition uh so what we also touched is that you should not design partitions that are too big or that will become too big and here you see the numbers the numbers are very generous so hundreds of thousands of rows uh 100 megabytes if you stay up a bit a bit below it's even safer but you can have up to 2 billion cells in a partition so the numbers are generous but you they have to be kept into account when designing the partition and the table and its partitioning yeah uh as one of our architects say we have seen partitions uh up to one terabyte we even seen particular latest top score was 1.2 terabytes for a partition it's a damn disaster don't do it like it's a very very very very very very very bad idea yeah then you think uh for some time it worked now we have we start having bad performance yeah yeah or we have nodes going down and whatever so this is not to be underestimated at this point uh by the way a life hack if anyone tells you cassandra is slow uh tell him what he has bad data model 100 guarantee yeah absolutely yeah so closing with this slide be sure you are also thinking of how the the the load is distributed across partition so you try to avoid the hot pizza problem because that would be in at least it would be a waste of your hardware resources if not worse okay so let's touch on the third part of this of this section clustering because you see so far we have been looking at how are data grouped and how are those grouped partitions kept each one maybe on a different node but how are data how are rows arranged within your partition we might have several pizza reviews all together how well this is a nice thing of cassandra within the partition rows are kept always sorted sorted by what by the rest of the primary key so you have a primary key some of the rows were the partition key as recipe name in our example and then there are date and reviewer those are called clustering columns and they define what is the sorting order within the partition for the rows there can be zero one or more of such columns by the way if they are zero what does it mean that partition key equal primary key and that by definition implies that your partition is always made by one row so the problem is not even there but if you have more if you have some clustering columns such as date and review or here they define the order within the partition you see in this example we have three different pizza reviews they are a single partition and they are sorted by date in the example below we have three different salad reviews the first two happen to have the same date well in that case we go to the reviewer and sort alphabetically by reviewer so that's a very important thing and it's the nice thing is that when you when does cassandra maintain this order at the right time so every time a new write comes to the database whether in memory or later on disk the data the row is put in the right position that that is what what uh makes also read so fast because when you read you you read okay there are complications there are several ss tables but that's another point but the principle is that when you read data from cassandra and you do it the right way you are reading a con contiguous set of rows so it's fast okay so how to choose your clustering then how to choose with the order in which you want to put your clustering columns so you see these are here there are here two examples same table same partition key and there are date and reviewer or reviewer and date in the other case that are clustering columns guess what the order you use decided by looking at your queries and finding out what is the right choice to do according to your queries because cassandra browses the rows in order so let's say i want to need i want a query i have a query that requires pizza reviews of a specific date well then i have to keep date first after the partition key as in the example on the left remember that cassandra wants to read the rows sequentially contiguously as they are in the partition so if i put date first then my query will work on the other hand if my query is i need pizza reviews by anita and then sorted by date within that selection then i have to change my my clustering i have to put reviewer first so my query will be able again to work on a contiguous set of rows then again there might be cases where my query will work in both cases so if i need just all pizza reviews i need the whole partition i'm not even maybe so worried about the ordering within but in general even choosing the clustering depends on which queries i want to support so you see there are many limitations if you want in how cassandra makes you access the data but that's all for the sake of speed and there is a huge gain in this case and don't forget that you might you can always create a second table if you have to support different query patterns so it's uh everybody wins right except the disc that is maybe the cheapest actor in the story so that's not even too much of a problem okay so before closing with this very important section i want to show you some actual code you see cassandra can be accessed in various ways there are drivers there is drivers in any language and so on but below all that the native language you speak to cassandra is cql and which also is offered in a nice console where you type commands as you maybe have seen in the lecture by alex cql stands for cassandra query language and it's very similar to sql by the looks of it yet there is a huge architectural difference in the underlying structure as you now maybe have understood so just to show you this is a command that creates the table we are we have used as examples so far so it's very similar to sql create table name field type field type field type and then there is this statement primary key you see primary key is a selection of the columns that will make the primary key but you see this part in red with another set of parentheses this is how this is the syntax to specify what part of the primary key is the partition key and it's absolutely important to know that and to make a an informed choice on the partitioning okay so this is now i'm closing with this section and it is very important that you keep in mind that you choose the primary key in a sense for logical reasons because in your modeling of the data you want uniqueness then within the primary key you take part of it maybe all of it if you want and it is the partition key and this decides how are data physically kept and stored in your cluster how are they grouped and we how are the groups scattered around what is left of the primary key the blue part is the clustering column and that defines the ordering within the partition which again is important because that also implies some queries that you can do and some other that you can't do okay i would say for the partitioning and the keys this is everything uh alex do you want to add something have you seen some interesting questions around uh all answered by jeremy very good thank you jeremy yeah there is only one question to highlight we speak a lot about denormalization but it's always need some time to land into the brain into the mindset chatterjee2need asks if i need all reviews by anita then should a reviewer be my partition key and answer is exactly uh so if you want to be able to query review by recipe you need a table review by recipe and if you need to query a review by your reviewer you need a table review by reviewer and those are two different tables in theory you can try to have a single table with indexing or a single table with materialized views but the traditional denormalization approach brings you to two different tables uh updating them with badges right yeah and don't be afraid because usually in most cases that's the right choice to do so don't be scared by the idea of having many tables that's absolutely fine and it's the best compromise with the real world you can have if you want to scale your data in most cases so yes for sure you want to do you want your query will will for sure have to reach a single table but most often also every table is designed for a single query not necessarily because there there's there might be many queries that are served by a single table in some cases but usually every query will make you design a single as a specific table and that's okay that's fine think of performance and scale okay so let's speak about how to query data and well also how to write data in apache cassandra that's uh much a consequence of what we have seen so far so about writing well writing is a fascinating topic and many of the details are hidden in the architecture of cassandra what what is important for us today is just one thing uh cassandra does not uh cassandra wants let's say cassandra wants rights to be fast so when i say right i mean just right there is nothing else happening than the right uh what i mean if you try to write a row that is already in the table nobody is going to tell you stop the the row is there already because that would be that would mean having a look at the table reading the data making a check coming back with an answer you can you can't no nothing on that because we want rights to be fast and that's a point because in many in many cases well there is a pattern that practically is used in a relational databases that amounts to this let's try an insert if it fails the row existed already and i do the other thing well that doesn't work in cassandra because your right will work will succeed and the last write wins so you are effectively overwriting your data what do i mean in cassandra insert and update are almost the same thing indeed we usually speak of absurds i say almost because there are there is a one corner case that makes those two operations different which is connected to counters i will not mention almost not mention counters today so let's say we have this operation that is absurd regardless of whether uh the row is there already or not i write it and to write it i have at least to provide the full primary key because i have to identify the row i want to write and maybe i will also have to insert other values so let's you can have a look at the typical insert statement again this is very similar to sql maybe the difference is the single quotes as far as i remember so insert into table column names values and then you put the values and that's it but the meaning is different because this insert i would i would have i could write a update it's the same cassandra does not waste time looking back in the store data and checking against what you are writing that's a point okay now having said that let's turn to reading data okay this i told you nobody will tell you this record exists already okay reading now again cql looks like sql but it's different uh look at this look at this insert at this select statement select columns from table where conditions nice perfect and it works you see i get my pizza reviews perfect the point is that in cassandra this this statement and in particular the where clause must obey several constraints to work well some something we already saw in the previous section about storing storage of data and let's let's uh recall them a query must go to a single partition and then within the partition it has to read rows in a sequential order according to the clustering order what does that mean it means that the where clause if you in your query that reads data must specify all of the partition key with the equal equality with equal signs because it has to go to a single partition bum to a single node that's some point second point it can specify clustering columns if you want but remember the sequential order we want to read contiguous data so if i specify a clustering column i also have to specify all columns of higher importance all those on the left of it so i can't just specify the third clustering column because that would imply you know skipping and jumping around in the partition which does not make us standard happy another thing connected to this is that yes you can use inequality you can use greater than or lesser than but only on the last clustering column you specify because again anything else would imply skipping and jumping across your partition as you read the data which is not something you want to do another point is that you cannot use any other random column in your where clause so these are strong constraints i know i know but they are the key for fast reading of data uh okay somebody might observe okay we have something called allow filtering let me say this today allow filtering does not exist i know there are very specific cases where it even it is even good to use in production plus it is something that you sure use in testing in development on very small tables whatever but today we are we are considering it doesn't exist okay for those who know what it is let's forget the second but allow filtering okay so um okay so the where closes let's see a few examples again here i recall the same tables as before so we have recipe name date reviewer in particular recipe name is the partition key and then date and reviewer in this order are the clustering columns so here you see there are five different where clauses and they are all legal first they all specify recipe name equals something so they they go straight to a single partition everything is nice the first one is just that and that's okay it will retrieve the whole partition nice the second one specifies the date with an equal sign good it defines a particular contiguous block within the pizza partition perfect the third one is a date greater than it's also fine because again if you think of the storage within the pizza partition it is again you start there and you browse all rows so it's fine again the the second to last also specified date with equal sign and then reviewer greater than bob that's fine that works because again that implies a contiguous reading in a particular section of the partition nice the last one similar it is a two inequalities so it will define a range from here to here in the partition but again everything inside so it's they are all good queries they are all good where clauses uh okay so these are instead bad examples all of these queries all of these where clauses will not work rating equal 9 come on there's not even it's not even in the primary key no recipe and rating again as long as as long as there's there is a condition on rating that will just not work recipe name greater than pizza that's interesting yes recipe name is the partition key but if you put a an inequality if you want recipe name greater than pizza and i mean alphabetically then you are possibly looking at a lot of partitions so absolutely no forbidden recipe name equals solid good and reviewer equal carl no that's not good because you see a reviewer is the third column so i'm again i'm implying that my my cassandra will have to skip through the partition in a in a jumping way so that's not accepted and the last one again recipe name okay date lesser than blah blah blah but then i set a precise choice of reviewer so again that implies a jumping jumping across the partition and they are all prohibited so no all these are all bad examples let me go ahead well this is just to show you the full syntax of the select statement um that's just for the record and i just want to specify to make you aware of the fact that most of the parts of the select statement are very constrained by partitioning primary key so you have limited freedom in selecting and that's sort of the point of this section when you read data you have to read that in the way your table is made for so you you probably now now when i say when you model data you start from the queries that starts to make sense i guess even better when you model your data you start from the flow of your application the word that it has to describe and then you come up with queries and then you design the tables so this is the flow more or less i hope this is starting to make sense to to you okay so to summarize um when you write data you need to give the primary key otherwise you're not specifying any particular column any particular row sorry not only that but there is no distinction between updating and inserting that would be too costly for the latencies so you just write fast fast fast and it's up to you take to take care of overwriting valuable data when you read you are very constrained yes because the structure of the table wants you to be careful in reading and the three main point is are you need equal signs to the partition key completely you need to specify it completely you can if you want specify values for the clustering columns but taking in keeping in mind what makes you read contiguously and you cannot put any other column in the where clause okay so this that is one of the most important parts that i wanted to show which brings me to uh the actual data modeling operation so uh you now know uh you now know the idea of the normalization you know how uh data are stored and grouped in cassandra and you know what what are the read queries allowed let's model some data okay there is um there is a canonical a standardized flow in cassandra for modeling your application data and it is this there's a flowchart here more or less my point is so the main point is that you start from the application and then you come up with the data model while in a typical relational database you can see it here below in gray the flow is more or less the opposite right so how do you do in cassandra well there are two steps that more or less go in parallel and communicate to each other in a sense and they are the conceptual data model and the workflow model so on one side you do something that is very much similar to what you would do in a relational approach you map you do a conceptual map of the entities and the properties and the relations that make the domain you want to use in your application entity relationship diagram at the same time you you start laying out a map and a flow of what are the what is the flow within your application once you have those two things you can start mapping one onto each other which starts which makes the your queries emerge so you end up with specific queries for each step in your application workflow model okay so you start having the queries that will be needed for your application to work now query by query you design the table so for each query you look at what it needs and how it needs and you lay out a first logical draft of the table and this you do with a very handy schematic convention called the chabotko diagram now you are almost done because you have your your tables and they work with your queries because you designed them to what is still missing is uh let's say implementation details so making this conceptual table definition into making this logical table definition into something physical so making them into actual create table statements that implies optimizations uh checks that you are staying within all the parameters uh last minute so to speak choices about how to arrange one-to-many and similar things but you are almost done and then you end up with a physical data model which is basically a set of create table statements okay so let's see this procedure at work on this simple example of the recipes first entity relationships so conceptual data model you speak around you get an idea of your application you speak with non-technical people and everything and you end up with a mapping of what is the domain of your application so this is really an er model you have entities you have relationships and each one of them might have a number of attributes so you see we have in this simplified example we have recipes and reviewers they are in a particular relation because yeah it's many too many uh and both recipes and reviewers and also the relation itself might have some attributes so you can have a recipe name a recipe category i don't know snack or dish site dish whatever you can have so the re the reviewer can have a name a photo url an account id i don't know something and also the relation themselves might have attributes so a review has a rating has a date and so on so this is still a very conceptual thing but it is a mapping of every field that will maybe enter your application at the same time okay so here is the point where you can start asking yourself is it the case to introduce a recipe id or do i or am i happy with recipe name for some reason so such questions might start here already and have to on the other hand and at the same time i look at my application workflow so there is a general idea of what the application has to do i start speaking with a i don't know technical people but also non-technical people to have an idea what what is the application how does it work what steps are there for the user and that is similar in a sense to the so-called user stories approach for uh designing user interfaces because we start from what what what do we want to make available to the user when when they interact with our application so for example user logs in or let's forget about login user enters our website and they want to see they want to be able to type pizza hit enter and see the recipes sorry and see the reviews so that's a query that's a particular step in the flow of our user in our application so they hit enter and they see a list of recipes or reviews for the pizza and that's a query behind this operation there's a query which i called q1 select all reviews for recipe name sorted recent first nice then they see this list of reviews one is by a particular reviewer anita they want to click on anita and they want to see all reviews by anita okay that's another step in the flow of the application that's a different query and that is probably a different table in general then once they see anita they want to look at the details of the reviewer and they might go to a third query a third step in the flow which makes them see the details of anita the photo the profile picture whatever so you see every step in the interaction between user and application is mapped to a query basically a way to retrieve some particular kind of data from from the database which means that we are starting to map the flow of the application to queries which is the same as saying two tables in a sense we are almost ready to start writing the tables indeed the next step is let's make the queries a bit more cql so let's write them as tentatively as a statement so look at the first one select reviewer rating command from reviews by recipe where recipe name equal pizza nice and date greater than blah blah whatever so this is a query ready-made i want to build a table around it so how do i do and this is the logical data model step you look at your query and you start thinking of what are the fields i want to retrieve from this query then what are the equality conditions in the where which means what is going to become partitioning then i think what are the inequality conditions so this date greater than means that date will be the first of the clustering columns because otherwise you remember my query will not work and i want it to work then i look at ordering so i want to i want data sorted decreasing i want reviewer sorting increasing and so on that's not the end of the story because okay i know that i want some fields or if you are dating and comment i want to retrieve from the query so they have to be in the table but let's not forget the last step which is let's ensure uniqueness is obeyed so reviewer has to be part of the primary key so i have to lift reviewer up and make it part of the primary key but not before date otherwise the query will not work so if you apply these five steps systematically that's a algorithm to come up with a with a logical proposal for the table and this is uh summarized by this diagram as i mentioned this is the chabotka diagram and it is a list of the fields with some markers like this k for partition key and c with an arrow for clustering column and so on and this is for the logical model so you see we started from the application needs we made we made these needs into a flow every step in the flow is basically a query on a table and we create the table looking at what is the need what are the needs of that query and there we are we are almost ready to create the table there's something to be done because uh you see so far i haven't yet assigned types to the columns now i assign types i decide the recipe name is a text date is a date i could have chosen a timestamp but let's say it's a date rating is a number so i write int and so on so this is when the data when the proposal for creating the table becomes a physical create table statement and this is where many considerations uh especially about performance and optimization enter because okay i can give those types to the to the column and i'm happy but i might take my time and make sure are there data imbalances in this design are there hot partitions are there giant partition and small partitions that might make my nodes unevenly loaded are my partition going to become too big am i comfortable with the amount of duplication that this model implies is there need because something sometimes there isn't it is is this flow uh does this flow require some client-side joins by which i mean for example that my client has to read a table and then use it use this information to read another table is this co is this okay sometimes this is a a proper way to proceed is this okay for me and there is also the issue of nesting because uh i've seen that in the comments uh in the in the question and answers there are various ways of let's say hiding a one-to-many relationship in uh in cassandra if you think about that even just having a partition with many rows is a one-to-many because let's look at this table this table encodes a one-to-many relation between recipes and reviews that's perfectly fine and that is done with a particular technical device that is one partition many rows nice fine that's a way uh that's not the only way in some cases i might find it better to use columns of a particular data type that is set of strings set of numbers or lists of numbers or a map of numbers so there are data types that somehow are used to encode nesting or one-to-many in a sense relationships on these so this last step of making the data model become a physical data model i have a slide just to show you that there are various choices to be done when it comes to data types in the columns so i have the typical data types text int float boolean blob by the way text in cassandra has no fixed length so you're not bound to say varchar 12 whatever text is just text whatever the size then you have a various kind of numbers you have double decimal tiny intimal inter various number of bytes allocated you have other data types such as date time various kinds of ids unique ids and so on you have counters which behave in a different way and they are a special kind of column that cassandra takes care of incrementing or decrementing and reading but you cannot just go there and write a number because of how they work and then you have interesting types that are collections so you have list of something set of something map tuple and you can also create your own user-defined types so you can create a type called reviewer that contains subfields such as id name photo url and you can define a column to be of type reviewer so you have various ways of embedding one-to-many relationships if you want or nesting within cassandra so let's say we have done all of our considerations in this sense and we come up with a final data model in particular do you remember the rating of of the recipe it's going to be a number 0 to 10. so i decided to use a smaller integer i decided to use a small int which just consumes a bit less bytes just because why not okay so i did all of my final optimizations my considerations and here is the chabatko diagram for the final choice with data types and everything this table on the right this diagram on the right corresponds to the create table statements you see here which is the final one this is now the statement that makes me create the table now if you do this procedure for all queries in your application workflow and you end up having as many tables your data model is done ready to use so that was more or less all of it so let me let me summarize when you model data in cassandra you start with the needs of your application uh there's a question why date is text date is oh sorry my bad yes uh that's uh thank you approve is very like thank you thank everything super approved thank you now the slides are perfect thanks to you sorry i think it was ah see it was date here then i i messed up sorry okay good good point well spotted so um yeah that that is a typical error that might happen and then your data model works weird but uh probably hopefully that is uh found before starting going to production uh okay so jokes apart when you model data in when you model data in in cassandra you start with the application you identify the workflow which becomes a set of queries and you and you end up for each query building a physical table that's more or less the flow don't forget when you create the table that you need to identify the partition key that determines how the rows are grouped together the clustering columns that define how within the partition how are the rows sorted and then obviously there's a query so you need some data back so you probably need data column or even just a clustering column but you need some data back so those are the parts that enter the steps in creating the table then you end you complete by doing some performance considerations table size table hotspots user defined types various kinds of one-to-many nesting and that's more or less it now a very important thing is spend time on modeling so don't rush this is a phase that determines if your application will work on the long run so and it's not so nice having to change the data model when you're already in production so try to avoid it okay so with that the most important part uh yep sorry um uh there there is a nice point from uh shashank sharma what worries me more when we start project things are not clear and we need to keep changing the data model am i being pessimistic here well from my point of view you aren't being pessimistic but more realistic because it's completely fine but it's a part of them actually that's a real life that's how it works yes business requirement changes today you need this data model tomorrow you will need another data model and yes there is a complication because you cannot change table partition partitioning neither clustering columns because partitioning key defines the data distribution of our cluster and clustering columns define data ways to store data on the disk on the nodes and as a result you just can't change them because can you imagine like uh today's hero is netflix can you imagine netflix reshuffling all of their petabytes of data yeah of course not but their business also leaves and uh changes and the story is what basically if your data model changed now you have to design a new model create a new table and migrate your data and that's very easy to do if you can afford downtime and if you have small amount of data then you just set it to downtime migrate your data and put it back and everything is fine problem is mostly probably working with cassandra you are going to have a lot of data and you cannot afford any downtime then it's a very different story and it's a long story how do you magrave migrate your data from one table to another i believe something that is done happens and involves quite some quite some orchestration by on various sites yes yes so it's not easy but it's doable and i'll be actually what i think what we need to run a special workshop on migration on reworking a data model uh what do you think stefano yeah yeah so so you know what's great uh i'm here on your screen on youtube and directly under me you have like and subscribe button and that's we are getting close to the end of a second to our workshop that means he likes our content so push that subscribe and like button and you will be notified about the upcoming workshops including data migration yeah which is a science in itself so when you have to give up time and so it's uh it will not fit in an answer today probably okay so let's go ahead okay okay so let me just mention we have 20 minutes or so let me mention a few other nice things just to round up your knowledge obviously this is not the end of the story this is today's probably is going to be a first introduction which will give you pointers to go on and study and learn more about data modeling there is a whole course on data stacks academy in that so make sure you check it out but a few other tools in your belt we can already at least mention so one is absurds and lightweight transactions so you remember we said that in cassandra inserts and updates are the same thing which are absurds forget about counters for a second now you probably complain but i want to write a row only if it's not there i don't want to overwrite without even knowing that and somebody would might say i want to update my row a particular field in a row only if the previous value was this and that okay that's absolutely understandable and makes sense and there are a lot of cases where this has to be like that user creation user changes passwords stuff like that so yes uh do not so um let's say a faulty choice would be to move to application level this check because if you read and then write that's a very typical anti-pattern because you see if you have several clients at the same time they read they see that the row is not there and they all write then you are you are overwriting because there is no coordination between many clients right so you have race conditions and now you will say what do we do well the answer is lightweight transactions because there is such a thing as a lightweight transaction in cassandra so look at the syntax you want to insert this row only if it is not there so insert into blah blah blah values columns etc and then you add if not exists nice such a statement since you add if not exist at the end has two possible outcomes if the table if the row did not exist i get back and applied true nice if the table existed already i get back and applied false plus the previous current value of the of the row so this is effectively a way to ask cassandra to please check read and then maybe write and there is you see there is a way to do that in the same spirit i can do a lightweight transaction of an update conditional on the value of a column so update blah blah blah if rating equal to again i can get applied true if this went successfully or i can back applied false because the previous value rating was five and not two and i want to uh out here i think this opportunity is a very powerful it's very important to understand uh maybe for reviews by recipe you don't get is it so really important but imagine you have your client uh trying to buy something with his laptop and with his mobile phone simultaneously and he ha he's trying to buy two different things but he has money only for one of them if you don't use limitations like that if you don't check the state if those transactions if your separations will be executed simultaneously he will get two uh things and which he can't pay for free for free or maybe for free partially for free uh so in this case we can check not only if rating equals two but if uh amount of money on account more than something or if amount of money on account equals to the previous expected one so it didn't change during your application run because if i work with mobile phone application web application i mostly probably can uh if i chance i will work with different servers uh so yeah there are some things like that to consider yeah so very very good example yes so there are cases where effectively you want it is correct that you want to know the value of the row before doing anything with it by the way there is a question in the chat the rating has to be a clustering column no in the lightweight transaction you can work on any any any column you want indeed this example on rating rating is one of the data column of the table no particular role so okay so lightweight transaction exist they are thing and they are useful for some use cases again uh alex's sample is perfect also you don't want to use it to you don't want two persons to create a user account at the same time with the same email probably or you don't want them to be able to change passwords simultaneously in two ways and then you don't they don't know which is the right password to use and stuff like that uh the point is that they are the so-called compare and set operations are not as fast as a simple cassandra write because it's unavoidable right because such a transaction requires some kind of coordination between the nodes because they have to agree on what is the previous value so usually standard cassandra writes go to a node or several nodes depending on consistency level and they just write this one has to do something more to succeed or to fail there is a protocol to arrange this coordination between nodes they have to speak a few times between with each other they have to agree on the value and they have to agree on the outcome of this transaction so yes it is a transaction in a sense but it is not nothing like a database lock as you would imagine in a relational database i mean there is no rollback there it's not a transaction in that sense it is lightweight not in terms of performance but in terms of guarantees that it offers it is just ensuring that particular partition is temporarily locked as the nodes speak to each other and agree on what is the response to your query which means that the performance is not as super as for the standard cassandra rights but still sometimes it has to be done right i wanted to add what there is a very often mistake even for the people who work with cassandra for a long time they don't realize how heavier lvt in comparison with a simple right so how people consider lvt it's read before right normally i just write and if i do lvt then i just do read before right so it's kind of just two operations so it will be twice slower which is not a big price to pay if i'm going to update your financial account right wrong uh in don't forget we work with replicated distributed system that requires us to make an agreement between replicas before we all agree what yeah we are going to uh change something or we aren't going to change something so actually as it said performance costs by stefano it's actually not two times slow but i would say four to five times slower than the normal right yeah so there is some overhead let's let's say there are four rounds of messaging the protocol involves four different rounds of speaking between the nodes that's the point there is also a question in the in in the chat why is it called lightweight well lightweight does not mean performance lightweight means that it offers limited guarantees limited to that partition in that table so it's not a lock a transactional lock on the database that's the point so yes maybe maybe compare and set is a name that would lead to less confusion because transaction brings back so many relational memories it is a bit uh to be taken carefully as a name so the point is that yes there are cases where you want to use this uh technology but let's say if your whole data model is built on those then please rethink your data model because you are absolutely not extracting the performance by cassandra in this way okay so that's that's for lightweight transactions let me speak about batches batches are another nice feature of cassandra and another sometimes misused feature of cassandra okay so sometimes you want to execute many statements in a sort of atomic way there might be cases where i want to save bandwidth i want to pack statements together send them at once to the to the cassandra node and have it execute them nice indeed batches offer exactly that they allow you to pack some statements together i think up to 100 or something i don't remember and they get sent all at once to the server to one of the core to the coordinator node it then ensures that they are all executed because it has strong retry mechanisms and so on now in this statement you can put only dml statement so data manipulation language which means insert updates or deletes and well it is a [Music] sort of atomic but not a transaction what they mean is that all statements will get executed eventually there is no rollback as if it were a real transaction in a relational database but you have no guarantee that all rights are visible at once so atomic but not consistent in a sense so everything is will everything in the batch will be executed but if you happen to read from that table halfway through the batch execution you might find some of the new values and some of the old values so uh take that as a caution not only that okay so this is the general idea so when when it is absolutely perfect to use batches let's say you have two tables very similar with same partitioning and i want they describe the same data so they are two tables that reflect the same recipe data the reviews and my application is adding adding a new review so it might clo it might group the insert on one table and the insert on the other table in a single batch and send the batch to the to the coordinator very nice this is a super nice fitting example because you see the partitioning is exactly the same on the two tables so i'm sure that my batch will go to a node and that node will execute all of it no problem so this is performance wise it's a dream a similar case is when i'm inserting several rows on a table that end up in the same partition so there are two new recipes of falafel in the table falafel is the partition key so i'm inserting two new rows in a single partition of a single table very nice i close them in batch and i send them and those would be the golden examples for batches now in real life sometimes it's also useful to do slightly spurious batches so the so-called multi-partition batches or which automatically become locked batches what happens do not consider batches as a way to pack together as many insert as possible and then send only at once because that is absolutely a performance killer by the way you you have no guarantee that the batch that the statement occur are executed in order within the batch and there are also limitations when batches contain lightweight transactions and counters you have a lot of limitations so the point is that you can sometimes uh find yourself in the situation where you you might you want to group together some different inserts on different partitions of different tables and you want to group them in batches which potentially might also have to communicate between nodes sometimes this is okay but consider that implies a very very uh degradation of performance for those rights so again know what you're doing use them sparingly and do not build your whole application workflow on top of batches alex you want to add something on batches usually um [Music] that's uh not today i'm answering questions okay i'm answering okay maybe that's a good question so we can answer by voice raul asks what's the use of batch if it's not atomic or has rollback and not parallel so first of all that's very important to understand what uh if you made if you are going to make a change into multiple tables for the cross table integrity for the cross table uh consistency you do want all your records all your mutations all your updates to reach the tables and be stored and if you let's say you are going to update three different tables if you don't use batch then you at your application site has to send multiple inserts and what happens if your application server fails because of power outage at the moment you do you are trying to do your inserts two inserts are done one insert is failed and there is no gross stable integrity and you are in troubles now because how are you going to recover in this state to avoid this situation what you can do persistence so first you persist operations you're going to do on disks so you will be able to reply them then you try to execute them if everything is done you will remove this uh file with a free operations from disk operation is complete if it's not complete if your application server failed it recovers it reads separation from disk and replay the situation again and then you can discard this file you know what you just invented cassandra batch yeah uh so basically that's how batch works uh you send the batch you don't have to persist anything at the application side because cassandra cluster the first node which gets your batch will be a batch coordinator first thing it does it persist batch safely and then play it and if anything happens with this cassandra note it will replay batch as soon as it recovers because batch is persisted so batch is a guaranteed way to deploy mutations to your database and you can try to emulate it on your own in your application but you know what i believe what lazy developers are the best if you already have this feature then why not just uh use it and don't don't develop it again it's already developed by the cassandra community okay so that's why i use batch yeah good point this applies to the most interesting batches that are the logged batches as the name implies and alex said there is a log that is first thing the log is stored the batch is executed and then once everything is done the log is deleted so this is a persistent thing and every batch that works on more than one partition is automatically logged so this is yeah thank you alex good good remark okay so i think we have a few minutes so i will just make you aware of the existence of another couple of uh features then they are for you to investigate more one is that you can have you can define time to leave to to cells in cassandra so you can define a number of seconds this insertion this table sorry you can define a number of seconds the the data you inserted will be there for after the after which the data will evaporate away uh just be careful because this is always per cell so if you time if you do a certain timing to this time to live you might end up with magical partial rows that you never inserted by yourself so if a party is expired the other is not but it is a only knowledge very useful mechanism maybe more to keep your table clean of old stuff than to embed logic in it so if you need logic probably you you want to have a separate column date and to check in your application against that but in general the time to leave is a very useful addition to to the cassandra models another thing that we usually keep last purposefully is that cassandra supports indices after all we said you can define secondary indices on tables yes you can you see there's an example of a query that did not run then you create an index on the table and then the same query finally runs super nice this works by creating an additional a secondary index on an existing table but there are all sorts of caveats to to be aware of when you create indices the column you index on must be must behave in the right way and the indices uh follow the distribution of the base table so it's the index does not magically create a new table distributed in the new way so if your query with the if you're querying with the index if you are not careful you will end up doing a very slow query because you will it will have to to go to all nodes in the cluster before it finds your your match so but in some cases in this is a very useful and very powerful they are not a replacement for the good all the normalization that's my point last point that i've seen mentioned in the in the chat as well is that cassandra supports materialized views so you can ask cassandra to kindly take care of maintaining a new table with the same data as the other table please and cassandra will do it for you you see uh from this recipe name date reviewer here i create a new materialized view that is a table i can't even insert into i just leave cassandra take care of this table and then my queries will work in a in a new way basically just be aware that you have some constraint on how to choose the new partition and primary key and in particular okay the update is is asynchronous so cassandra has some background jobs that keep this materialized view in sync but the important thing is that you should not just create any materialized view because if you get the partitioning wrong for this one it is a table for cassandra so you will end up having terrible giant partitions or whatever monster you can imagine so you keep an eye on partition size also for the materialized views so consider them a sort of experimental feature and before using that massively in production take care of what you're doing so to speak uh well this was by design just a quick mention i think we are right on time yeah we are right on time so there are a lot of questions about easy materialize that we use production ready uh in short my answer will be uh yeah [Music] so i know some success stories with mutualized views i know some not so success stories with mutualized views as well there are some limitations and current implementation of neutralized views has its issues that's why currently materialized views are considered experimental i hope that will be fixed and then you know what apache cassandra is an open source project so if you are not satisfied with something go develop that we will help you to become an apache contributor we will be happy to do it yeah that's a great answer uh but besides that yeah we are have to stop at this moment yeah like two more minutes uh because we have to start our ask me anything session yeah very good so you have uh you have one minute to complete the yeah i think i've said everything i wanted to to say so don't forget there are ways to exercise to investigate deeper to do hands-on exercise in your browser the courses if you're interested obviously two hours are not enough to know everything about data modeling so please uh go deeper into the topic because it's absolutely fascinating and uh yeah i hope this has been fun and most of all informative i hope you learned a lot and see you in a few seconds in a q a session thank you definitely thank you so much and we will be back in a couple of minutes with ask me anything q a session see you soon [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] transition hey looks like we are back one two three can you hear us can you see us hey gentlemen uh alex sarma uh say hello something everyone hello good evening in india yes perfect so it looks like our sound is good and it looks like we have a lot of attendees asking questions and we have a lot of questions if you can that's a question to my dear colleagues sarma and alex can you see the translation can you see the screen um yeah i see the screen uh in the youtube channel yeah yes great uh summer do you see it oh i believe yes i was reading some some of these questions good yeah there are some nice questions by the way um um okay we are missing the fourth guest expert but okay let's start there are many people who ate and we don't want to make you wait for too long so let us proceed we are almost in the end of our cassandra de india it was great and actually oh my god i just noticed it you submitted 130 questions that's amazing and we definitely have the first winner uh by the number of upvotes 40 upwards it's the most popular question obviously so sg please uh contact me after the presentation after like a sunday i will send link to my linkedin profile in the chat because your question definitely definitely deserves a price give me a moment good now uh so you know gentlemen uh let us start then with this question right uh as it's so popular we have to start with that uh there are other competitors like big table stila which are pretty cost effective and highly performant whatever cassandra differentiators then compared great question who wants to answer first alex sit back so okay yeah i can take it okay please basically it's really uh there are multiple dimensions here uh so if you talk about the big table the first uh thing that we need to uh understand is really the uh hosted versus likes uh self uh host so it's really like they are talking about like maybe the cost efficiency of the table because uh it's not maintained by us uh like to get access but as usually it's an all depends on the scale it's a similar for the all uh hosted solutions uh if you have a traffic that you get in the hundreds of thousands requests per second and it's uh most probably will be very expensive so it really is a uh this is the first dimension then we will talk about the uh things like uh data stacks astra that's also hosted for you uh then we can maybe talk about like cosmos db uh etc we so the first step is really like hosted not hosted so it's uh it's hard to say uh about that and and another things the big tables uh it's original one uh designs basically initially uh cassandra was based on the big table design but it this introduction of sql it's changed so also the database design is uh makes sense to look uh really fit in your setup regardless it's hard to say uh because they have some features uh and in some benchmarks they are faster but if i remember correctly they have uh they run fast only on specific hardware if you have like pcie disks etc so it's an uh and also they have uh some interesting features but uh cassandra right now this is especially with upcoming things like storage attitude indexes etc will uh jump ahead again uh so basically uh if you talk about the uh still like there isn't still many features uh that i'm missing uh or like file formats are supported it starts really but i don't want to say it's really like the difference and you need to evaluate the options like pricing uh costs uh ability to scalable maintenance uh for for your project yeah does to answer your question yeah i think so um summer do you want to add anything yeah that was nice summary from alex like you know it's not very difficult very easy to answer this question because it's very wide but what i would like to say from the cassandra side of it we have a wonderful community so there are so many developers developing on top of it we have nice integration with third party tools and obviously other products might scale to that level but cassandra community is just huge and that's what i see as a positive side if you start working on cassandra side of it so yeah i mean i favor to cassandra but obviously i haven't worked on bigtable so i cannot comment on it yep i have some experience with bigtable not breakthrough first of all for me bigtable is a only managed only proprietary solution by google it's good database so nothing like i'm saying it's big table is bad no big table is not bad uh it's just uh very limited from these points of us already covered by alex for example and well so far still for me looks like a startup which may survive in the future or may disappear tomorrow so far it's a project of a single company not the big full um not a project like cassandra which is developed by apple data stocks netflix instagram and all the hours many companies putting fair efforts into the cassandra which belongs to apache software foundation and truly open source by nature so for me it all brings quite a long story if these kind of questions we can answer uh we can spend a year answering basically because there are a lot of things to consider but we have to move on it was a good one and next one is interesting and quite uh popular too from apoorva how ah okay i started to speak about this one so i will stick that to the top for a second how can i find uh how many nodes with what hardware config cores program is required for specific number or read write operations question by gaurav gupta it's a good question really so uh it's uh as well it's many things that you need to consider when doing the size estimation because performance depends on the uh multiple things things like uh data model itself uh the uh replication factors that is used the uh consistency levels that is used in the operations uh then hardware itself so how much memory do you have uh let's start so right now in the age of the cloud it's quite easy to do uh by just uh experiment uh running the experiment and uh making sure that you have an uh environment say for example that uh like five notes replication factor three uh it says the main main problem that i always have seen that like users uh customers are testing these three nodes with replication factor three everything runs fine then they were 185 uh two more nodes and then everything is much slower because of the need to have and go between the networks and stuff i usually recommend create a model for your database and then use something like nosql bench uh to run the test against uh your database you only just need to have a representative uh data set and noise coil bench can help a lot uh we have used it uh a lot for testing the different hardware configuration data models etc but the main thing you need to test for a long period of time quite long for like not five minutes because there are effects like repairs there is effect like uh compaction etc it should be like taking your account but experiment is the best way yeah as alex said right each application is very different so i would put a lot of testing in non-prod and also make sure your non-production server is also beefed up which looks like production just to make sure you get the right workloads in place yes okay so i believe the answer at that and meanwhile there is in the chat also a discussion mostly exactly about the the no sequel bench uh suggested by jeremy hanna well we know him and others also as well there is no simple answer you need to try to make the testing first with no sql bench nothing for me to add basically you answered this question of course good so next question um gupta how apache cassandra database deals with split brain uh i personally can't comment so it's like [Music] we need maybe somebody like jeremy uh answer so um now yeah please please yeah the only thing i can think of is you know watch your gossip and repairs i have no clue how split brain can even happen split brain can happen in theory when we have for example three data centers and two of them can communicate and interact with each other and the third one is not accessible so we have group a and group b and there is no communications possible between two of them because of some failed networking between two data centers um in general answer is in this case my answer is very simple it all depends on your consistency uh level because for example we imagine we have data center data center with free server rex we have server abc a and b available to clients can communicate c is available to client can communicate let's say like some network fluctuation but a b cannot talk to c c can talk to a and b uh partitioning network partitioning that's a big problem many databases run in complete failed state in this case and basically you get the split brain issue my suggestion in this case so it all depends on your consistency level if your database expects to get if your client expects a consistency level a quorum then in the a b group for quorum is reachable and on the c group quorum is unreachable therefore all vibrations executed with a b group will be executed with consistency level quorum all the operations routed to group c will be not completed and will be failed because you have a desired consistency level set to quorum and that basically means what database will not be available for all the clients trying to work with group c which is bad but believe me if that would uh fulfill your alterations it would have be it would be much worse because well then you will have uh non-integrity not oh how to say it better no zero integrity between the data in group a b and group c and what's the worst in this situation basically you have no way over the manual uh over when logs basically to try to recover your database into the consistent state so apache a short transfer to this apache cassandra database deals with split brain with the help of the consistency levels yeah okay uh really like i originally saw that acdb means astra cloud database that's why i didn't answer it okay so it's interesting but yeah it's it's really uh alex is uh correct it's really depends on your uh application and like do you really need to have an uh strong consistency levels uh in your application uh it's always a trade-off about the availability of database versus consistency and in many use cases it's a case to serve stale data or something like uh of course depends like if you have an uh payment transaction processing or something like it may not be desirable also i've worked with some clients who like uh favors the availability versus consistency you may not see the like transaction immediately in your bank application but the transaction pass through so okay but yeah consistency level uh could be dependent on the like you can use the quorum uh for normal operations and like get back to the local forum potentially for the last iterations all right uh good so i believe the answer to this question let's move on and next question oh my god you people are asking so wide questions uh what is the relationship between apache hadoop hbase hai and cassandra okay let me take that so a relationship is very difficult to say like you know we all know that hadoop is the beginning of all this big data stuff um i personally have not worked on hadoop um hdfs is still very live and people use hdfs a lot hbase and hive kind of very old i don't know if i want to use it and [Music] yeah so the cassandra started with these concepts of big data and you know in relation i i would take spark and cassandra that's much better run it on hdfs that is the part of hadoop um i think maybe uh also uh it evolved so basically uh i think the relation code come from uh history so basically the uh google published the big table paper and original cassandra design was based on it so basically why it's still called white columns uh stock the hive or the edge base is also based on the big table design but they stay on it so basically they didn't change uh in contrast for the cassandra dt to the uh table or entailed uh predefined schemas etc and then we from the from the hadoop we can from the edge base we can go to the hadoop where because hbase is uh needs hdfs to store the data but also each deface is become the bottleneck in this case because in this case it's an uh h based not telerand is a uh favors availability or trades availability there's also the uh consistency uh and hive is uh because like hbase and uh cassandra's is an online transactional system uh hive is uh all up system it's analytical system you are running the query hadoop is under the hood running the a lot of tasks and then you get the answer in some time but it's not we are not talking about like milliseconds uh response time like having edge base in cassandra i did use the hbase for some time five six years ago okay so i believe the answer is nothing for me to add basically next one how gossip works this one is quite good okay so gentlemen how gossip works so basically uh gossip is a works as follows basically when you uh uh when cassandra node starts it uh joins to uh those obviously okay if it's joined to the cluster is uh starts it's uh on the start it slows the known configuration of the cluster and starts to exchange its information with other nodes so basically uh every uh some period of time each node tries to communicate with some other nodes in the cluster and sending the its own view of the cluster so the information about like its own state for example we have you can have some kind of health index uh inside the payload it's also sends information about the other nodes like is the note is up or not is down it's exchanged information with uh about the schema version it starts basically it's not communicating to all uh nodes in the cluster at the same time it's selecting some nodes and exchanges this information there isn't like a lot of optimizations there so we don't uh send full snapshot of all known data we only exchange this information uh when necessary the another thing that i want to mention basically cassandra selects other notes more or less randomly with some exception of the seed notes there is a high probability to connect to the seed nodes to send the information because it's a nodes from which the other nodes are having higher probability to get the actual data and get the correct state of the cluster so it's like basically if when the node set the data to the seed node the reason the information spreads through the cluster much faster but the idea is very simple it's and this part was a comment from the uh if i'm correct from the dynamo uh paper the name of db plus it was extended with the things like uh failure detection uh algorithm was added to it for faster detection of the machines when they are down so i i see gossip as like you know snapchat so each server is sending its information to to the other servers in the cluster as alex said it doesn't send it to all servers but every server is participating in that communication and they all share that information saying okay i'm i'm having let's say chest pain i'm having you know storage problems so this gossip messages are very small and they exchange the message between the servers and whenever there is a quorum of other server c there is a problem with one server they basically understand that okay this one node in the cluster is having issues now remember that whenever a client likes a java cassandra driver or a python cassandra driver connects to the cluster we call them just client for just better understanding the client also listens to this gossip it also gets the messages say for example one node is restarting so node is going down that client is getting that update uh from the cluster so so the node which is the client is communicating to if at all that particular node which is coordinator node in in theory uh which is going down then it can communicate with the other nodes in the cluster so remember that gossip is just short messages sent across the cluster and not only within the server side even the clients listen to that gossip they participate in it there's a recent comment about the kitchen name for internet communication i just want to clarify that uh the gossip its own is a part of the internet communication because internet communication includes things like repairs uh the uh sending the request to other nodes at stairs it's really the uh i think uh part of internet communication but the separate set of the messages and uh that are going over the wire okay so i believe this one was well explained yeah so it's a reason like a question about does client interact us not level or cluster level so basically this is just one thing it's well uh i really like the java driver documentation for a lot of explanation how things work usually like client uh connects to uh so the client connects to the nodes that is and open so-called control connections and on this control connection it receives the pieces of the information from the gossip uh but really like through this control connection see the uh state of the cluster as this not see it so basically if you connected the client to a node and you have a split brain it will even if the cluster is available it will see the uh only part of the cluster and you it's reconnect to some other node it's just for clarification look into the java driver nodes or driver documentation it's very interesting reading how the clients and cassandra bumps okay so we still have more than 100 questions gentlemen so let's speed up uh there is also a question i really like uh from krithika how does cassandra achieve zero overhead while adding new servers that goes to elastic linear scaling i believe good question i don't really fully understand it i can i believe so it's based on the first workshop that's why i i can answer it and i can explain that so take a look question is um do you remember maybe this very nice slide a very nice graph picture from netflix tech blog they they did an experiment on scaling cluster from 45 servers to 300 servers uh growing them workload and it was a nice smooth line straight line on the performance so not a decreasing growth like most of the databases do you can add more servers but you have overhead of new servers adding so way then performance start to degrade at some point and every next server add you not as much as it could and in the end at some point it's a straight line already not growing you understand what i mean uh one one thing uh that i wanted to mention so it's really like uh adding the new survey is not free i mean from the perspective that because you need to distribute the data to uh to a new server [Music] it's still you need to read this data from your disk and if your like not is uh at the hundred percent allot already the addition of new servers will add like some additional overhead of reading the data from the disk of course it's a bulk reads it's there it's maybe not so big but it's also need to be taken into account that like don't add the servers uh in the peak times for example if your nodes are overloaded usually what we worked with companies uh big companies especially like telecommunication before the iphone launch or something like this it's cluster expansion then done days and tweaks before because like you then start to get the uh steady load uh it's there it's not like in some rare cases you you can add like if you see the uh the need but uh usually it's like please monitor there are things like uh for example uh at top centers there isn't uh like think like that can uh recommend you at your new cluster based on your data growth etc monitor the uh number of requests latency sets there and then decide to add the notes all right i'm trying to find the picture i use it to explain that oh got it finally so give me a second i actually want to mention i want to show it almost done so um oops not like this how do i split you oh my god sorry yeah finally so hopefully now i can see what i mean where is my slides okay yes you can see what i mean um what i would add what i would mention here what a linear scale up of a cluster is all about data modeling you can handle any amounts of a job as long as you have a good team and you share the work in a reasonable way so it's not like one person is doing all the work and all the others are idling as long as you are sharing work between your workers or database nodes in this case in the even reasonable way so they so they can tolerate it and your data model is good so if one guy can like carry 20 kilograms let's say no you don't give him 100 he's mostly probably going to die under this pressure but if you need to carry 100 kilograms you just add some more people to carry on this weight uh split it into reasonable doses so if your those dozens of uh load you are going to carry um so partitions basically are of a reasonable size and you can add more and more servers and those partitions will be splitted over them cassandra design supports it very well as soon as your partitions are not even some of them are too big some of them are too small in comparison with others then you run into the troubles and cassandra will not scale linearly if your data model is bad that's why i asked you to pay attention uh to the data modeling workshop database that done by stefan today that's my answer to this cassandra skillsli linearly story and let me switch back to them slide on good okay so what comes next shashank sharma uh you create the query uh when the table now it will open a pandora box for a dev we need to find all the possible tables where that particular data is stored so take a look development of uh so i want to take this answer for me it's more about the development and i spent a lot of time developing so take a look development on the of the application for the highly loaded distributed environment it's a hard job and it requires a lot of discipline it requires a lot of development things like code reviews uh it requires like going to need a quite a strong team of developers if you just take a bunch of juniors throw them and go develop mac cassandra applications they will do it but you will then be very sorry about the outcome so now we need to find all the possible tables where that particular data is stored no if you are trying to find all the possible tables where that particular data store it means your development failed already um what does that mean uh if you have to look for them if you have to find them then you don't know where away and it has to be from the very beginning of a development clear but okay that's part of my code works with this data and all the required operations done with this way and there shouldn't be hundreds places uh in your table in your application you have to change uh 100 of the queries it has to be centralized in the good meaning of this word and process it properly with some clean coat approaches single responsibility principles and so on and so forth so you need to understand what you are doing and it's not an easy job but mostly probably if you are working with a distributed application you have apache cassandra you at least go decent salary for that so don't look for the possible tables for this particular data store you need to know it in advance with your code and that has to be very clear if you are got into the situation what this application has been developed in that way what no one understands what is it and where it's stored then you need to refactor this application otherwise it will work very bad of course i'm sorry for a little bit of expression but it's painful question i've seen it many times people just doing some job without understanding what exactly they're doing yeah alex i have a small advice here for just the community right regularly it's not directed to shashank generally people coming into cassandra i tell them about data modeling right data modeling is the key if you don't understand how to data model then don't use cassandra it's not a right fit and also i know alex and cedric they basically run these workshops almost every week there is a workshop about data modeling i'll give you an example which happened about five years ago i was pulled into a emergency call basically they deployed some new code yesterday night and what they told me is version one of the application was very good version 2 is very bad so the only thing we identified there was a data modeling so somebody in the developer knows how to create databases in rdbms not taking the name so they they just created rdbms style uh you know tables where the id column is a uuid they never use the uuid for query and that's completely wrong right so we spent about a week working with them data modeled it and after that application team did not talk to me for like four years so do the data modeling right and i would say attend this data modeling sessions or workshops what you know alex creates uh almost every week they do this so it's it's a key to learn how to use the database not just use it as rdbms thank you yes uh we our job is to make you successful with apache cassandra and related technologies and we are doing our best developing different workshops for you to learn and try to do the best and we are done with this one so so this one is really this one has really a lot of lights but it's a little bit out of topic so i will ask you to stay very short on that to improve skills in data science what are some good cassandra based project ideas one can build gentlemen um from my personal uh perspective the cassandra shines closer to the serving side cassandra is a base for example for the project michelangelo that implements a feature store you can because you can quickly change the data you can like load the features for your model for example it's a typical use case when like some input data comes when you serving the model predictions and you enrich the data uh with some additional information for example if you uh receive an uh query to get the predict the credit uh score and you get like user id maybe it's there you can then pull the rest of information from cassandra very fast and then you answer it very fast it's one of the very nice features of cassandra that i would uh highlight uh yeah i think there is a race i think look into the michelangelo and uh or implement the feature store yourself especially like it's very nice uh integration uh together with spark yep um um sharma yeah i definitely suggest uh playing with spark cassandra and because that combination is deadly we we have put together some information you can look up on linkedin find me and on my github i have some information but we'll try to put more projects together i'm i'm sure alex also has some [Music] you know projects in pipeline on this i will also mention what looking for data science connected to cassandra i would definitely take a look at the teamwork of apache cassandra plus apache spark together they make a great team and like running machine learning training models in spark with cassandra can be a really great story together because they like on the very different side of this field and together they built this uh bring team this dream team and astronaut i'm trying to answer two questions at the moment so let's get back to that next one how are communication latency in overhead handler in the cloud native approach uh do you guys understand what's the question is i'm trying to understand i think it's an um maybe comes more from the background if you like trying to use cloud services from the on-prem solutions something like uh the okay another thing is really uh comes to uh cassandra itself and uh for example how cassandra can work uh over the slow links or something like then this way it comes this fee threshold potentially you can tune if you have really slow links and you need to uh the notes are not going up and down in this from the status uh perspective it's an uh and it was especially at the beginning in the aws uh lifetime uh when it was common to set this threshold to very high value because of the nodes in the different region didn't go up and down all the time um [Music] from the client perspective i would say try to bring the client closer to cassandra to avoid this overhead same data center same availability zone or at least region and use there was a very nice white paper from a datastax development team about the design for telegram applications that had a lot of useful advice on correct uh architecture design from application site so you have low latency answers as well if i unders understood the question correctly [Music] so so personally i think this question is for like you know when you put cassandra on cloud and we might be talking about multi-cloud i personally would put you know one data center in only one cloud don't mix up the data centers and have your clients stick to the data center um to avoid latencies basically and you know one data center i don't expect it to span across multi regions if you're talking about aws regions that will keep your latency slow obviously if you mix all these things like in a multi-cloud and multi-regions then latencies will come in so just uh during architecture phase just make sure you design your clusters properly so that way you don't mix up all these things right okay uh so we have few minutes left there is a question full of pain is it possible to completely migrate to cassandra from relational database management system yes short answer is i will first give my short answer when you uh please put your point of view on that my answer is yes but what you can is doesn't always mean you should because you see on the big projects you usually need multiple different purpose databases and cassandra is not a general purpose or multi-purpose like some traditional relational databases it's very strong it's very performant but with some solid limitations uh so yes yes you can to completely migrate from cassandra from relational database but that means you in some cases it may be uh better to consider splitting data for example thinking of microservices thinking of using databases what feed purpose of your database feed purpose picking database would be the purpose of one particular microservice one part of your system for example there are graph databases they good they are amazing should we drop them all because cassandra is great no they serve two different purpose and there are situations you need graph databases for situations you need cassandra there are situations what you need and so on and in the applications you may have to use multiple of them that happens quite often so uh my point here is not too rushed to drop everything to migrate to cassandra i understand what some of you may have a situation that management forces them to use oracle or i don't know mysql which is sharded for many years already because it doesn't handle your workload and you dream to migrate to something better yes in this case that they indeed may make sense but in some scenarios you have to rethink what you have right now and what you need to have in the end and then you may find out what uh you will for some of your workloads better use uh some k value databases like dynamo or like i don't know radius and for some of your use cases you will need graph databases and for some of your case you need cassandra so think ahead and don't rush that's what i wanted to say uh gentlemen yep uh so converting from rdbms to cassandra is possible we did it we migrated from ibm db2 to cassandra so pain points are we had to train a lot of people internally so you know people who come from rdbms style of thinking they continuously do wrong things um hello filtering on every single query and we had to fight with developers for 8 months on this this is the live scenario but once we started educating every single person on the team saying you know don't write a low filtering or don't do it this way or don't use id columns like you know uuid columns for your partition keys um things got better but you know whenever a new developer joins the team obviously that education is most important and i keep sending them to this uh data modeling courses but it but it is possible yes we did it yeah yeah they had the same experience when we like moved from uh big mobile operator from uh oracle because this could not scale at all they could not buy the bigger machine so they literally reached the top limit of the vertical um vertical scalability yeah okay is that a secret what server they were using uh i don't remember it was i think most probably hp or something like don't remember the model yeah but that definitely was uh such a monster yeah it was a monster and i would say that this monster was able to handle only 20 million subscribers [Music] when we moved to cassandra at the end of immigration the single cassandra cluster was able to handle more than 70 million not surprised but it was completely pain towards the data modeling it's territory oh yeah well i can say what the sermon said about the need to teach people because uh ops team was coming from the rdbms background it's another operation system yes there is a side question on youtube from manish simple strategy for replication places replicas on consecutive nodes in the ring does network typology strategy also the same no it doesn't it's much smarter i love questions i can answer fast so uh okay uh how different is cassandra from couchdb i'm sorry i have literally zero experience with couchdb so i won't be able to answer this question maybe you uh college tv is basically the document database that's all the main difference it's a completely different uh type of the database it's closer to the more to the mongodb our salsa would say it was a nice feature if we need also to talk about it's like coach db versus coach base uh it's there because there are the differences because coach base could be also used closer to cassandra as a key value coachdb itself is a nice feature was and you could provide a custom conflict resolution for you for the database uh not only like what cassandra is doing using the timestamp but also you know whatever logic yeah but sir yeah it totally depends on the use case as uh as mentioned here by alex right it's a document database so if you're like you know looking at uh then look at compare between and couchdb it's actually very difficult to compare between cassandra and couch so maybe just stay with the type of the database you're looking at especially nosql has four types so we have to research on that good yeah so it's you see it's like to compare airplane to a ship which one is better well man they are just different so that's nothing like airplane is better than a ship or vice versa it all depends on your use case and they have different use cases so we are almost at the end and there is still so many questions um how many data centers can cassandra cluster have let's make it weak how many data centers can cassandra cluster have guys i have no idea you you can have 100 data centers but why why do you want to have so many just just have three right i would go with three one is your life one is your analytics and third one is the backup yeah it's it's heavily dependent on the use case because we had customers like shipping companies still that like basically two data centers in the u.s east coast west coast uh then something like japan then separate australia emir this kind of separation so it was like six seven uh but you need to like theoretically uh it could be a high number but then you have an overhead uh with uh communication between the data centers and operations and other things you need to design the uh data model correctly or replications for example that especially if you talk about the gdpr requirements uh it's that's really uh you for example starting to create the uh different key spaces for different combinations regions basically basically exports but yeah uh agree about like analytical backup instead etc we always determine to have all uh data centers maybe accept the analytical equal uh from that perspective and be active active everywhere perfect [Music] right uh what is kundera and hector in cassandra how are they related who are all those people like cassandra world is huge uh hector uh if you remember correctly it was an um java client for uh [Music] remember it's uh correctly so hector it was it's one of the clients uh original clients i would say uh to uh cassandra uh at the time when it was thrift-based primary okay so it's a good story old time uh and like if you go to the hector uh github it's saying use java driver all right kundera i don't know i think it's for something like scala library um okay uh sermon anything you don't have to no i don't have experience with them good yep okay so um meanwhile there is a side question where can i get this session recording we will send all the materials in the email to everyone who has registered for this event so don't worry you will get every recording every session uh now i will answer very quickly to this one uh what does local quorum means very easy uh first part so that's about consistency levels first part local means what we require confirmation only from the local data center so it's the data center which is considered closest uh to the application server you are running instance of your application if you run your application in the united states west you wanted to work with united states best data center right so it means we wait for confirmation only from the closest cassandra data center quorum means what we will wait for half plus one server answers uh from there this data center so for example if you have replication factor free it means what we will have we will wait for two confirmations what data has been stored for example from the closest data center to us i hope it's clearer now i like this one what is the term snitch in cassandra give some example uh gentlemen i i can say i mean snitch is a very large topic just like gossip but snitch provides the network knowledge to cassandra so it basically helps in replication of data and you know placement of data for safety like in snitch is a very large topic i i would say uh snitch is the network information for cassandra yeah yeah it's it's convert basically the uh gives the information about the topology and depending on the implementation it could be the uh is a from the local file it could be from the cloud provider like making the uh availability zones for example they presented as an uh rex and uh data center and regions are represented as a data center for example so it's uh but usually we are recommending to use the uh gossiping property files niche even in the cloud because it's making your uh potential migration to other clouds or having the multi-cloud setup easier that is cool uh that's actually quite interesting yes so in general as a gentleman answered already snitch is about you remember cassandra network um gossip oh my god cassandra replication strategy network aware network topology of error strategy network topology strategy network topology means what vs replication strategy understands network topology and the question is how exactly it understands network topology it understands network topology with a proper snitch there are multiple kind of snitches you can just describe your topology in enough configuration files uh you can enable gossiping for that or you can use for example i don't know aws based niche which will help you to use availability zones uh features and so on and so forth but this suggestion by alex is indeed very interesting because for the migration if you will need to migrate that then switch off um if you want to migrate from aws for example uh to shut down aws niche is going to be a lot of fun i bet so okay i hope we answer it but and we are almost done so let it be the last question um uh now what to okay okay okay first this question because i just like it does it mean netflix majorly uses cassandra over relational databases uh well that's better to ask obviously venae than me but as far as i know yes netflix majorly uses cassandra over relational database it doesn't mean that don't use them after all as i said there are still many use cases you need to have both uh good that is uh briefly closing some questions how is data stacks cassandra software as a service different from manila vanilla cassandra very simple vanilla cassandra you deploy you maintain you take care of the service servers and upgrade and so on and so forth data stacks astra cassandra as a service is we maintain we deploy you just use as a client so it's our headache it's all about headache for me [Music] okay that was honestly i i would say maybe also sometimes the astra gets new features uh of cassandra before the release yeah right right right so uh astra is a different story that's why it gets it's uh asterisk cassandra is a service but not apache cassandra as a service and there are some features what exists as core cassandra enhancement proposals but not yet accepted and pulled into the cassandra so for example astra used storage attached indexes and data stacks enterprise as well but apache cassandra not yet because this cansandra enhancement proposal is not yet accepted same goes to unified compaction strategy i don't remember if it's rolled out already for astra but it's going to be sooner than it will go to apache cassandra because asterisks manage it and controlled by data stacks and cassandra is managed and controlled by apache software foundation so community has to agree what this improvement is indeed worth it and has to be included into the open source apache cassandra and last question we answer i'm sorry but we are out of time shouldn't we have replication factor closer to 10 gentlemen it depends how large is the cluster so if you have 10 if you have 100 nodes in your cluster and in one single data center maybe 10 but it depends you know are you trying to have your data more secure um for like you know against losing data what is that you're worried about that is more important to answer yes uh agree on that usually what we see like uh typical recommendations three uh in some cases i have seen the five and then maybe once we have the seven but then you need to like you have and like you use the local even if you use the local form you're having the increased latencies because more machines need to read the data from the disks they could happen i could have dc pauses or something like this as usually this will uh lead to the more increased vote on the servers better if you really worrying about the your data gets the things around an additional data center what uh sarma mentioned as backup data center for example uh because even if you have the five uh replicas or seven replicas and your data center is going down you lose everything and uh even on the clouds sometimes regional downtimes [Music] in this case having more data centers will help you to make the data more available it's in primary you need to like i agree with uh that you need to reason why you need that but you need to think about the latencies increase etc yep uh i will please go on one one one follow up on that if you have too many replicas right uh there are several issues with that one is your storage requirements increases uh the second thing is how do you keep everything in sync is repairs so you need to do a lot of repairs and that takes time so you just have to calculate all that before you increase the replication factors yep um so uh what i can add from my side uh first of all you definitely definitely make sense and it makes no sense to have more replicas uh than um wrecks or availability zones because you just start to duplicate it for um with nearly no uh real um benefit except of a situation when you have a single rack of course uh so i mean like you don't have to go below free replication factor free second don't forget what there are multiple uh well what you need a replication factor is set not per cluster but per data center so technically forgive me please but this question is uh not really good one i mean there is a solid mistake replication factor of what data free data centers of free servers but per data center or i don't know 10 data centers of 1000 servers overall replication is set per data center and different data centers may have different um designation so you may have your clusters spread by geographically united states europe asia but also you can have uh working on the smaller regions you can have um data centers spread um did splitted not by geographical idea but by the responsibility as sarma said you may have one production one backup and one analytical in this case for example for analytical workloads you definitely not need anything close to replication factor 10. and for production again a state another problem mentioned already more servers you have higher probability you are going wait for the response then executing query on a high consistency level like quorum or especially all if you are waiting for response from 10 servers or 100 servers definitely chance is higher to get a delay then you are wait only for free servers more servers you have higher chance you run into trouble sooner or later just mathematically okay ladies and gentlemen there are such a lot of questions i'm going to show you something like um it's still 118 questions i love you thank you so much for that's uh flow of questions now how do we keep in contact uh because i still want to be able to answer your questions there is a special link for you and i send it right now to the youtube chat discord discord discord discord discord i send it five times so you won't miss that you have to use join our discord server there are more than 12 i believe thousand members and you always can find someone to discuss cassandra and it was increa indeed the great thing i see nagash asks how to submit homework i will send one more link to you github datastaxdev workshop intra to no intro to cassandra so all information about the homework and participation page is located here and apollo thinks we have very cool instructors and i'm absolutely agree we indeed have great speakers so ladies and gentlemen that's an incredible day i'm very happy we spend it together with you i happy to say thank you alex thank you sarma that's incredible and we got so many questions answered you are the best uh you are really the best and uh vera uh last points for me to say uh to the attendees i will say them in one minute alex yep alex one second so between both the rooms right i know that rl and cl rooms um how many users registered and how many attended uh approximate counts oh that's hard to say uh we have or more than 2 000 registrations and regarding the attendees on youtube it's extremely hard to judge because people are switching from one room to another a couple of times and youtube every time counts it as a separate view so there is a lot of duplications but we have many thousands of views and that is amazing yeah we need that replication factor so it's not a duplicate yeah okay so uh thank you uh sama thank you alex i believe we are done with you for today but i will definitely call you to our next event because well it's going to be amazing and you did a great job answering questions and thank you sarma for so much for your talk alex i hope next time you will join us as a speaker as well because you see world needs your expertise so uh thank you so much and say goodbye i will be live one minute later with some last words thank you okay stay safe have a nice weekend bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so uh la final words final words we are almost done but we still have a few things to tell you ladies and gentlemen and first i will start you are the best you are literally the best we stayed with us until the very end and that makes us absolutely happy yeah this is very nice to see so much interest in cassandra and good now uh last few words um about what is important and what do you need to know uh there yeah it was over when uh it was like altogether like 12 hours of content i believe and there's still many dozens of people in this stream i mean like that's that's insane you are the best that's incredible uh so uh voucher link please not a question voucher link uh we won't answer cassandra questions right now we please proceed to discord but we indeed have to dispatch a couple of links uh so yeah so let me drop the link to this already so you will just you know so everybody knows how to keep in contact and yes here actually everything i wanted to tell uh right now is about voucher no well not about voucher we got stuck for inside of workshop and technical things i'm sorry i'm not sure uh what's the question so uh cassandra de india is done but cassandra's story never ends what matter for us cassandra is one of the best and most powerful databases no worries and i would say one of the very rare open source communities which stays truly open source and doesn't stick to any commercial company with commercial interests but states apache software foundation project now in 21st century amount of digital information grows exponentially by some investigations by some researchers estimations we are going to have many hundreds of zettabytes of digital data in the world by the year of 2025. so in just a few years amount will basically more than double go many times most of these digital information is of course videos and photos of cats but uh that also about all the information you use to store in the database now more and more companies realize what to be successful they need to have a lot of data and make decision based on this data it's called data-driven companies and more and more companies in this field all the biggest and most successful companies realize that wait a long time ago and to make reasonable decisions you need to have a lot of data to build them in and then you need to store this data somewhere and cassandra is obviously one of the best choices now take a look cassandra is in high demand already and this demand grows but what's the problem cassandra is not the easiest tool you need to really learn how to use it it's not a bicycle what you can see it and ride but it's more like an airbus or boeing and you have to learn a lot of knobs buttons tumblers lights uh to understand how do you ride that without falling down from the skies that means you need to get skills and data stocks on this way is your best friend because data stocks first features free education if you want academy.datastax.com is free and open you just go register and pass for courses on the cassandra data modeling fundamentals administration operations application development and so on now we work on a special course on cassandra version 4 because there are some major changes coming so you will be able to handle them as well and all of it is completely for free now you have to say yes data stocks i love you because well yes it's a great project then second point knowledge is great knowledge is the essence and it's very important to be a skillet engineer but how to confirm that to your employer or your potential employer uh what you are skillful in this way our suggestion is to you pass a certification bad certification costs money data stocks now suggests pre-certification you get our courses you pass the certification with our voucher completely for free you can become a qualified data expert engineer able to handle the power of apache cassandra certified absolutely for free again thank you data stacks so what to do now when the cassandra day is over there are two steps first i will even send it to a chat grab a voucher it's the step number two it's for step number one second uh uh pass the course pass the course take a look today talks are overview so uh you need to get a better understanding to pass the exam voucher last 30 days since emitted okay good thanks stefano by the way i didn't know password course courses are at the https academy.datastax.com all right password course uh there are two paths for developers and for the administrators pick any of them but one part of this course data modeling i do recommend to attend both of you doesn't matter if you're a developer or if you're administrator and notice one voucher gives you two attempts so if you get um so yeah complete course but you can do it within 30 days definitely you can take it yeah within one week basically yeah in two weeks you you get uh to a great level of preparation yes and uh finally then you pass it the course past the um development or administration and data modeling you go yeah each belief if each voucher gives two attempts and finally pass the exam and enjoy your life you are great uh you just got better in software development informational technologies and that's a great way to get higher salary get a better workplace there are a lot of great companies hunting cassandra enabled developers and administrators and after step 3 you are going to be one of them isn't that amazing if one completes all courses on data stacks academy does it make her a led a liable for the certificate uh completion of the courses doesn't make you a liable for the certificate completion of the courses make you a liable to pass the exam and even and also and also to get the free vouchers in that way yeah you can also get voucher for the completion of the courses and only when you pass the certification then you are certified when you pass the exam you are certified specialist okay so we need more speakers too so take a look we have this uh amazing cassandra day program this is cassandra de india one week ago we did cassandra de italy we did cassandra de russia a little bit earlier cassandra de china and we will go and spread cassandra love all over the world so but you know what we need more speakers and maybe that's you going to be our next speaker i would really love this idea so for next culprit papers i want to see your proposal good idea learn cassandra use it in the real world and come back to tell us and to tell everyone definitely sounds great i believe uh stephanie do you want to add anything well uh it's been a very intense and wonderful day thank you all for the attention thank you for being here in such numbers and uh yeah i hope this was enough to make you interested so go go ahead and learn cassandra because it's a unique and fantastic database so and don't forget to come back to us if you have any questions and everything so yeah i hope we hope to see you soon oh yeah the discord link i just sent a discord link so we can communicate uh sarma says it was no doubt an amazing day yet indeed it was an amazing day thank you so much for attending yes such a feedback in the chat is what uh makes us a go ahead and gives us the fuel so thank you for this appreciation okay and sarma asks is there a next cassandra day in some other region nothing scheduled yet because actually there is some period of vacations but as soon as we will have anything you will definitely know about that yeah we have a link to keep you informed on upcoming workshops that's a specific link here let me paste it if you visit this page you can stay informed and i think we also have a mailing list for those who like to get mail about upcoming workshop this is it take a look uh dumani says never enjoyed the full day tech discussion as much as we enjoyed hearing the speakers today so nice to hear you you make me cry just like thank you so much yeah we put a lot into that okay so we are done for today a little bit of music for you to relax and uh you are the best you spend your weekend to get better engineers it means what you will be better engineers just keep going the right way thank you so much for coming that was stefano lattini and alex polishnev developer advocates at data stocks and we wish you all the best and have a great weekend or what left of that have a nice weekend thank you everybody see you next time see you next time no bye-bye formats to change [Music] cars [Music] you",
