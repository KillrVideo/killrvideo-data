    "text": "hello everyone I'm Ain from data stacks and today I'm going to take you through building a gen application on data STX Enterprise 69.0 let's go so the application we're going to build is one that I've actually done before um and if you've seen anything that we've done with uh generative AI on asdb you know we've done some things involving like um Rag and and uh searching by images and searching for images so back in February I created this app for a blog post and uh it was it's called just called the car search app and really what it does is it it's just a python app that runs on our astropy library it uses the clip or contrastive language image pre-training model or sentence Transformer from hugging face um and it um it will run on DSE 6.9 and essentially what it's going to do is just return images based on our search criteria um and it will use Vector search to do that as Vector search is you know what is used industrywide to um you know maintain a local context for a gen application it's important to remember that for this application to work we are going to need our 64-bit encoded username and password um from our DSC 69.0 cluster that I built in Mission control um if we want to have a have a look at it you can see that I just have to sign in here all right here's my cluster snakes and arrows data center Far Cry and I have three nodes um and this is on yes dsse 69.0 so we're in good shape there note that you can see I clearly have the data API enabled on my cluster so if I have a look at uh the blog post here from February and I I kind of look through here um you can see that I have a link to the GitHub repository here I and really what we're going to do is kind of look through this and we're we're going to follow some of these steps to make sure that we're kind of building everything the right way but the uh the first thing we're going to do is actually uh clone this repository locally now I've already done that so I can just have a look and you can see that um yeah we have all of our our files and python modules there um what I'm going to do first is as we kind of show here we're going to set our environment variables now since we are running a python app when we're using the flask um web environment to do that I'm actually going to have to have this environment variable called flask app so I'm just going to do an export flask app car search just like that next I'm going to also create one for my endpoint now you'll notice that the variable is named Astra DB API endpoint um that's just because of that's that's kind of built into the application that way this was originally designed to run an Astra but we can still leverage them and what I'm going to do is set that value to my um to the data API endpoint on 8181 um from my uh my DSC 6.9 cluster there just like that and the last piece I need is my token now the tricky part about this is as I mentioned this is the um 64 Bas encoded um username and password um along with the word Cassandra so I'm going to go ahead and paste that in so now I have have all three of my variables needed here next let's have a look at the at the code for the loader because we have to we have to load our data so here's our code for the loader and you can see this out in uh out in GitHub and basically what this does is it brings in our token and our endpoint um creates a client connection and then brings in a reference to the database once it has all that the first thing it does is is this create collection command um and it's going to create a collection or a vector enabled table called carore images we're going to have that set with 512 um dimensional Vector embeddings so it's going to be able to support that that number actually comes from our clip model as specified here um because that's the size of the uh Vector embeddings that clip supports and we want to actually uh match up by code sign uh so that's what we're going to set as our as our metric here so one last thing we need to do here is when it's defining the data API client there are some things that are happening behind the scenes with uh the astb endpoint uh that don't happen or that we don't want to happen when we're using dsse um so what we need to do is we need set this environment variable when we when we call or instantiate our data API client object and we're going to set it to this constant of environment. dsse and that's because we're connecting to a data Stacks Enterprise cluster and that's going to tell um Astra not to do anything special or any extra like pre-processing with the uh with the API endpoint uh normally with Astra you would have that happening and uh we we don't need that because we're not connecting to Astra okay with that we should be able to run our loader and we can let that run there you go you can see that all of our car images are loading all right and if we want to verify the data that we've just loaded uh we can jump out to our cluster using any local install of uh cql shell which I'll use right here all right there you are you can see that we're on our snakes and arrows cluster um so let's use a default keyspace then you can say select star from car images and we'll just say like limit to all right so you can see that the um the embedding for our image images are out here um this one in particular is 355 jpeg um and that's this Vector embedding here is what that jpeg um goes ahead and processes has um so yeah so I think we're I think we're all good here set let's go ahead and look at one more file here and that's going to be this Astra con uh python module and you can see that we are bringing in the application token and the API endpoint um but we also need to make that change here to not have a default Astra environment so let's get rid of that and then make sure that we're using that environment equals that constant of environment. d c um and we can bring that in because we have this import from the astropy constants Library um so that gives us access to that environment variable that we can we can use the uh the dsse constant from it so with that set I'm going to run flask on port 8080 okay that looks good see Local Host 8080 hey there we go car search look at that um and now I can say oh yeah we we have a bunch here red Tesla um and I can search and with any luck hey we have red Tesla all right all right yellow Mustang and there we go we have a yellow Mustang all right outstanding outstanding um one example that I I always like to like to use with this is the ability to uh to search by image and I have this image called my car with ladder so it's it's right here and and basically it is just what you you think it is I went out to buy a ladder and um I realized I didn't have my wife's SUV I had my my Ford Fusion so what I'm going to do is actually use this image to perform a search so if I go up here and I say choose file let's go ahead and find uh my car with ladder just like that all right and you can click search so you can see that that my image of my car with the door open and the ladder sticking out the side um actually did process into embedding and that uh Vector embedding was matched up for similarity our data set came back with this image of a Ford Fusion um just kind of like my car how about that so yeah so that's that's the app and uh we have this fully running on uh data Stacks Enterprise so that should do it for more information be sure to check out my GitHub repo at github.com a0 NP car image search and of course you can also o check out uh the post that's on the data Stacks blog of just data.com blogcast DB for more information on data Stacks Enterprise just head out to data.com products datastax-enterprise there you can find all the information you need including downloads and documentation thank you and have a great day",
