    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems and welcome everyone to the distributed data show I am Patrick McFadden with me today mr. Jeff carpenter thank you thank you very much thank you very much that's a good Elvis invitation so Jeff uh we're gonna change gears a little bit not an interview today we are gonna talk amongst ourselves a little private chat just you and me and thousands of our closest friends mostly millions maybe that's about my job performance yeah we're gonna have that awkward conversation no we're we're gonna talk about trends and data development things that are happening but way more important is are these things that as a developer who works with data do I need to pay attention to these things because it is loud right and noisy right yes sometimes I wish I could just go and work on my thing and come and not not read everything that comes into my inbox or stop listening to podcasts but guess what people spend minutes on Hacker News and you already feel irrelevant we got to keep educating ourselves exactly and let's face it this world is not changing it has gone through different cycles the working with data data development has gone through a lot of different cycles for sure but in my opinion you know there's there's hype and there's not okay we're gonna call some winners and losers here hmm maybe just try to be informed about what you spend a lot of your time on because let's face it how much time do you have during the day right it's finite finite I believe it's 24 hours exactly yes all right so 24 hours you probably would sleep in there what are you gonna learn right well throw one out there for us all right I'm gonna just start off here's one on my list and I hear this all the time I actually do a lot of talks on those two stream processing and what's your first reaction when I say stream process Oh honestly Wow okay we're probably word association I so how is it different than messaging that's a great question right and I I would say there are plenty of projects vendors people that are blending those two topics yeah and but getting a message from point A to point B is very different from taking a discrete or a batch of data in the stream and processing it in some way applying some logic to it so you're talking about time windowing and spark streaming is a good example of that micro batch micro batching yeah right it takes a time window apply as a slide to the window and it processes things in those windows based on the data that's inside of it so if it's a one-second window processes all that count aggregation functions such as you know average group by any of those things that happen inside of that one second window in the stream or discrete which would be that's like for instance akka for instance does discrete storm does discrete flink does discrete so there's a lot of different technologies that do a discrete do one piece of data okay and what about so in the messaging world one of the problems that frequently comes up is this idea message ordering right okay so well this was that a problem is well is it a problem well sure because you want to make sure that the first thing in is the first thing out because order does matter and especially and that's when you're talking about serialization versus linearization right and the serializability of data meaning one two three four not one four three two I got a joke for you I've already seen this the video you know it's these race conditions and your data is not okay not not race condition who's there yeah yeah anyway the race can that's good yeah thanks it's settled you have to I'll give everyone a few seconds to think about it pause the episode alright times okay now we're back yeah you got it now you're probably laughing I get it but race conditions in your data inside stream sure you've especially whenever you have something like transactional financial data which is right so do I use streaming for that stream processing and data transactions I would say probably not and in cases where you're doing maybe when you're trying to do some analytics on the data itself and not say processing people's actual money but you want to see how things are good perfect okay right so it's not part of that that frontline transactional behavior it's analytics right that go beyond that after the fact well that's all right so use case always use case right and as we as you always you told me this earlier it's like it nothing matters unless you have a decent use case yeah that's a pretty good guideline words to live by what yeah if you don't have a use case that don't do it but streaming streaming has a lot of great use cases from telemetry data financial transactions IOT of course probably lives and breeze on stream processing more more of it is becoming like retail is finding uses for stream processing because it's the immediacy of the data so I have to ingest a lot of data really really fast right and I have to react to it probably the most important part in that is you can you can ingest and store it a lot of data quickly that's not a tricking right right we did that back in the day with flume who remembers flume but what do we did we just dumped it in a file actually I wrote the connector for the Cassander one that was that was my big move okay nice welcome but it was it was a thing for just storing and then later processing this is where you got the lambda architecture which was right you know you had some processing but then you had the back-end storage to store stuff just to storm process later it needed it because maybe the volumes are so high or you needed that larger aggregation I think if you look at anything with stream processing the first thing they say is lambdas dead because you're moving faster right yeah so what do you think are you convinced yeah I think for the right use cases it makes a lot of sense okay well I'm gonna say that this for any developer out there it is definitely should be on your radar definitely should be something you study and understand at least from a use case perspective it is a relevant technology for sure it's a tool in the toolbox definitely if you're working with data be be aware and maybe even go out and do some tutorials learn how to do some stream processing of your choice there's plenty out there right know it what do you have ah well I've been thinking a lot about machine learning and specifically again what are the use cases for machine learning the experience that I have and that I hear a lot of other developer types having is I mean the asking themselves this question like do I need to understand all of the math there's a lot of math yeah and so wouldn't it be nice if I didn't have to learn all that math or do I you know what do i what do I need to learn in order to set up a good model it is very clear that machine learning has come from some math person like tensorflow has a whole different language right it's it's not anything I'm familiar with I'm not a hard core vector math person I know you're shocked with that it's true right no I see that so the things that I think are kind of no-brainer use cases are I mean the pattern recognition types of cases especially where I'm able to train machine learning model on a set of data and I'm beginning to identify anomalies and what doesn't fit that pattern that's just that's easy from writing learning so I feel like any any use cases that you have like that if it's Mon turning transactions for fraudulent activity or if it's just looking at your log files to identify what's going wrong and be able to do preventative maintenance on things from from an Operations perspective those are easy no-brainer yes do those use cases and then beyond that I'm kind of watching to learn like we're where is this really gonna fit well that's what I I get this filter of this is so high p but when you start up saying AI everything right let's say I all the things yeah everything needs AI yes but right now or you know what you know what order do we attack the problem in where the areas in which we apply this that are gonna be the most successful well it's probably because the companies that we want to emulate that are successful like an Amazon or Google are using a lot of AI successfully that's right so yes I mean I so not every engineer is building a self-driving car you're right right so I mean there's there's clear cases where yes we want you know our computers to be able to learn and sort of simulate human behaviors and pick up all the things that we don't even know that we're consciously that we rules that we couldn't consciously articulate that these algorithms can pick up and and begin to reproduce uh-huh so that's great it's just that not every one of us is working on a use case where that type of knowledge is needed yet well and then it's multifaceted I I think there are concepts inside of machine learning that are worthwhile maybe for everyone to know ok regression analysis ok regression analysis is a pretty basic it's I think it's an evolution especially when you're doing any kind of if you if you're really proud of some crazy SQL you've written at some point then maybe the next step for you is a regression analysis just on some clean data because you can learn some things from that that's it's a good one I think ok yeah anything with clustering classification understanding how those work I a surprise if that didn't somehow work its way into it like an SQL style workload okay yeah so um it sounds like from your perspective it's a it's a real thing that we need to be looking at definitely relevant relevant yeah so what do you see hype or not you should if you're a data developer what are you doing um I well I think this is one of those areas to watch I don't know if you run out and do all the the tutorials yet you know if you've downloaded tensorflow and it started playing with it then great but mm-hmm this isn't gonna be a thing that's gonna eat your job tomorrow mmm it's true so start yes start working on it although wasn't Terminator based on machine learning like all these AI is taking over the planet doomsday they may just take you over just remember that mm-hmm yeah and that's why that's the way I want to live by fear yeah just listen to you on musk he's really on that game definitely excellent okay so why don't you throw another one at me Patrick all right I got I got one this this may be a little fringy for this is we're starting it in the fringe right NLP natural language processing you are you familiar with natural language processing um well to a certain extent is this gonna be the part where people would need to turn the volume down because we're about to say the key word and activate everyone's yeah exactly this is so there's a certain set of terminology that we're gonna try to talk around you right yeah I know there was a Sikh or astronomy okay so natural language processing it's one of those things it's kind of like old what's old is new again and it's based on a lot of new technology of course but it is trying to solve an old problem and that is that humans when we communicate with each other completely stumped computers computers that process a look at language and how humans communicate just don't get it I mean I'm sure you could understand have you ever done any kind of text recognition no no okay so that that is a hard problem and I think many of us will will maybe laugh a little bit about Siri dr. Siri right does it do doesn't Siri understand you no no it's just pattern matching well does it pick up your words okay yes yeah in the rock especially The Rock The Rock knows like Cirie remind me to dominate today oh right yeah well there's tons of research in this Alexa and you did it I brought up the key word yes okay all right so Alexa Google's got way ahead of this so naturally which processing right now is is definitely picking up but what's the what's the filter how do we know if this is hype or not well so I feel like I hear a lot about this in the context of BOTS customer service BOTS well okay chat BOTS you can consider that natural language processing kind of operations so that that seems like a very hot area right now should we be doing everything with BOTS yeah that's that's a good one any time and it's there's also two different aspects and natural language processing the typing of text and then wrecking speech recognition right right on top of that and context and things like that I was just at NLP day in January I think it was and so I friend Michelle Cass Bowen hi Michelle she talks yeah this is where I get all my NLP knowledge from okay so I'm gonna tell you right now on an LP idiot she'll knows a lot she works in this she gets very excited about it and it's because it really is the future in many ways but then I have to ask myself is this something that everybody's gonna have to know how to do hmm keyword well as so yeah thinking about this architecture they like what is the interface right so am I going to be taking I'm taking natural language and then I am I trying to convert that into an API of some form and if that do I want to think about it as just an interface layer yet another interface layer or does it actually drive things in my in my application design mm-hmm I don't know yet right yeah that's that's that is what I think about is like is this somebody some is just a person who's writing code for some application do you need to know how to do the NLP or just how to apply it is there a service out there or something like that yeah no I think it will be as a service I do you think I guess you know amplifying what I said a minute ago I think I I think it does affect your interface design because it affects the interaction model mmm okay it's that you're working through within your application but then tie it back to data for me how does this relate to data development well that a lot of data that we collect is in natural language and I think this is gonna only so if you were to tie this in a stream processing stream processing could be speech processing and then eventually the context of that right I don't know maybe okay good okay so we have a large database it's a YouTube of video content we have lots of audio content that's maybe as yet unprocessed well major mining problem yeah and that's a you're looking far forward in the future yeah I mean we do that we do we we as people collect data you know as humans as we do that and right now we're collecting text data which is relevant you know right world wide web but YouTube is how many out I mean years of video per second go into YouTube all of that is speech the the transcripts of everything that we do natural language processing pulls context out of and this volumes of data that are out there are gonna have relevance eventually and that I think that's that's just gonna happen right yeah huh so yeah there's an interesting tie there between naturally was processing as a potential way of getting more data out that then can be fed into our machine learning algorithms etc mm-hmm I'm beginning to see how this fits together so yeah I'm gonna based on your skepticism out to say yeah it's useful know your use case but then you probably want to wait for some sort of service to manage it for you I think it's just knowing when to use it not it what it is okay okay what do you got okay well I would like to talk about graph graph databases my feeling is this has kind of turned the corner from hype to a real thing that we're starting to use all over the place now yeah so I think especially when we're talking about customer experience type of use cases really okay so you know maybe maybe getting a start in kind of like social networking world you know very obvious interconnected graphs of people but any of these things where we're talking about interrelationships between people particularly strong use cases so again use cases like fraud detection maybe that's not your frontline when you think of when you think of customer experience but yeah it is a customer experience use case because it affects if your customers experiencing fraud then that's generally not a great customer experience for them so fraud detection being able to navigate relationships between people where they live what places they're frequenting what kinds of activities that they're engaged in and being able to kind of pull out from those relationships things that don't quite fit or that fit known patterns of fraudulent activity it's a great graph use case and that's just one well I in you and I both do talks on graph now I think because it is becoming more mainstream and or maybe it's because we're talking about it's becoming mainstream huh maybe not that all right but if if there is a world out there that needs more relationships and data that's what graph does it's a different data model to understand and so there back to the original premises no you use case right I think that's that's much more of a problem I see where people get into troubles or they they think it's one size fits all Oh graph everything everything is a graph right right okay so yes you have some data that you're gonna put maybe as data developers we have some decisions to make like what kind of data are we gonna store in a graph mm-hmm versus a relational model still applicable versus Cassandra tabular no sequel model document style you know we have these choices to make do do we have to make singular decisions when we're looking at our data like okay this data goes in the graph okay this data goes in the relational tables or how do you know how do we think about that when we are looking at the data that we have to store in process and what kind of data model are we gonna interact with is it a choose one there as well there's different ways to do it right there is if you're gonna go with a pure graph model knowing not data model ahead of time and understanding it is critical but then you look at some of the technology and spark right now the graph frames allow you to do some very interesting things with not in a graph data model data but treat it as if it is it's finding the relationships inside of your data which is really cool that I've said that many times is you know graph lets you find relationships okay and graph graph frames inside a spark allow you to work with somewhat different styles of that those different models of data which opens up that multi-model world in a different way in analytics for sure notnot ltp load okay so good let's expand this conversation it's my topic so I can decide that yeah okay expand it right we're gonna grow these it out to multi model that's what is that also a hyper not hype thing I'm gonna put you on the spot here hyper not high multi model I multi model is table stakes okay if you're working if you're working with the data product any kind of data then like data stacks multi-model should be just the common thing that you get out of it and you shouldn't you should expect that and now it's not always gonna be the case but it's just acknowledging the fact that our data lives in different forms it has different life cycles and the use cases are multi and really we used to use relational databases as almost a multi model but that one-size-fits-all yes where we kind of forced fit it put a put a graph API on top of a relational right it well it's it's the you know jack of all trades master of none problem sure it can do all that stuff but then you start seeing cracks in where your coloring outside the lines a little now I'm use I'm putting a graph data model on top of a relational database relational databases do one thing really well write map relationships and foreign keys and primary keys and that does that really well but when you start doing the multi model on top of that then you're in trouble hmm okay so is that but is that the holy grail then to be able to store your data as if it's an in any model ingested in any model and read it back out and any other model with no perceptible performance degradation yeah I'd say it's a problem that's not Holy Grail as a unicorn I don't know how well how much of it exists you can probably get some Venn diagram overlap on some things this this model and this model work well together and that's a multi model that that fits but you agree on always have an outlier going from key value which is non you know they're like completely not normalized data right D normalized to the most normalized data graph going from a key value to graph the gap is too big and the technologies that are in between there are you know are multifaceted so saying that you're gonna cover everything from one key one value all the way up to a high lick - directed graph no I don't I just can't see that as being one thing okay but you know I'm probably gonna get proved wrong again let's put on official like it's saved at the Internet forever yeah it's on a bunch of roadmap somewhere exactly I gotta play this at my funeral half of the people listening to this podcast just crossed it off the roadmap and then the other half like put three red stars next to and went I'm gonna prove Patrick wrong multi models alive sad that's going here man I feel like that multi model topic I'm sorry I threw that in there but that could be a whole other episode maybe we can come back to that it's you know injury it's it's it's a term you know and I've said this before it's a great term because it's a description but hyping multi model is harder because now it's like I said it's in 2017 when this has been recorded it's is ten mistakes for a lot of ways yeah I like the timestamp there that was good well because you know have you ever listened to a podcast and years and years later somebody whose samples there's in order to shame you is not gonna really on wheels as the future I mean I understand that you think that you know C and C++ are great I love pearl too but Ruby is really the future yeah yeah that's that's the podcast that everyone goes back to and goes but I just did that didn't I yeah but multi-model is important I don't think it's it's not a thing it's just the way that it's thrown out its kind of Heidi now okay yeah was it it's like saying Hadoop ready of course you've read nothing new right who doesn't yeah so on the hype curve all of these things you know it's the peak and then the trough of despair which you write of most of these are probably heading into the trough of despair okay I think graph for sure is heading into the trough of despair because we've gotten maximum amount of hype right Facebook made zillions of dollars off a graph social graph everyone said that's great right but now we're heading into this place where people don't know how to use it in the trough of despair be there yeah is that what causes that is it lack of applying it wrong not lack of developer education like knowing how to use things in any of these any of these technologies evangelists yeah well there's early adopters and that's where the evangelists are early adopters tend to feed the hype yeah and you get the select group maybe twenty people that know what they're doing with the technology that tell everyone however what is yeah and then everyone's like yeah that sounds amazing and then they go and use it and then they hit the trough because the trough is they lied to me great and then when you come out of it usually there's a vendor involved or it becomes a lot more realistic and it's you know okay so maybe we don't apply graft technology to everything and that's that's when you start coming in on that crop right drug crop yeah drop it why can I say that trough of despair word there it is yes so I it's a one final comment on this whole thing is that I we definitely as developers need to be staying up learning with the latest technologies late at night on your own time right as and as you do that there is gonna be a temptation maybe for the solution problem solution seeking problem sort of syndrome but in a lot of cases I think maybe we our instincts are not our instincts are better than we actually think so as we're learning technology as we get good at evaluating technology and seeing where it applies more and more we're gonna be right about what the use cases are about that and I think it's definitely possible that in learning these new technologies that that helps to uncover use cases that you hadn't thought of before and you may not use the exact technology and then yeah that's right but it just the act of learning that technology can open up some new ideas in your head about new things that are possible to do right right and never stop learning no I would hate for anyone to take this as stop learning you know everything never stop learning and even if you do take something that's a little high that's okay and I'm just don't devote your life to it just yet right but it's always fun to learn I all of these technologies I've dabbled in at least a little bit and probably more than a little bit just because I think they're interesting they're there for a reason they're not because someone you know hyped it up this isn't like a Kim Kardashian snapchat you know this is real this is technology that people are using it's it's not famous for being famous like you Jeff you're just famous for being famous that guy what was he on yeah he's great I don't know weren't you on full house then the show no that was not know also that was not me in sixteen Candles fixing the braces oh I thought it was you get recognized for that I do it all the time was it Anthony Michael Hall yeah you do um not anymore my goodness I was gonna say I was gonna go walk around with you we're in San Francisco let's go take a walk around and see anyone recognize it Michael Anthony Hall know if you did the yearbook photo side-by-side there would be a lot but Oh gotcha today you know high school yearbook yeah today not so much okay no that's fine all right yeah that's good well maybe you're not that but you do get recognized for being that that guy what were you in alright thanks Jeff that was uh that was enlightening way to end it if you see Jeff out there make sure you make him feel good and recognize him so you're that guy from the distributed data show aren't you yeah yeah that's me oh great alright great thank you very much and everyone thank you and hopefully this was helpful if you have questions for us don't forget we have a slack room in the data stocks Academy slack it's a it's called distributed data show if you have some feedback you want to tell me I'm an idiot bring it let's talk about it but let's see eight years yes bring evidence but please join us for the conversation and thank you thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on Saxe Academy and tell us what you think you can also find us on the data stacks Academy YouTube channel or find our podcast on iTunes Google Play or wherever you get great podcast while you're there make sure and subscribe so you don't miss a
