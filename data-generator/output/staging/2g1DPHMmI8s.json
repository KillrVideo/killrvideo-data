fight [Music] and looks like we are live hello everyone and welcome welcome to today's bootcamp week 2 workshop nice to see you here is uh stefano it's me and hello alex welcome how are you doing hi stefano i'm very well so i'm so happy to be here with all of you i see there are more than a hundred of people watching us right now that's great that's amazing that's great and uh yeah it's cool but first let's check that the sound is all right so please can you give me a thumbs up if you can hear me and uh alex we're live sounds okay very good yep all good very well so what means we're good we can start yes um that is amazing yes hi okay so uh hello everyone and welcome that's a week two of our uh january or i better say learnery uh bootcamp building applications with apache cassandra building efficient data model with apache cassandra this week is about date model i hope you did attend our workshop last week if you didn't it may be a little bit rough experience for you today but still with our help you will manage to do that and if you did attend the last week then welcome back so let's start i am uh alex vollischnev developer advocately that data stocks and i just happy to be here and talk about cassandra and other distributed solutions to you because uh like i don't like speaking about myself what really matters is i like efficient solutions and i don't like inefficient solutions and today we speak about one of the most powerful database solutions in the world apache cassandra and how to build an efficient data model with it and today with me stefanon yeah hi everyone i'm stefano i'm also a developer advocate at data stacks i like distributed systems and i love cassandra and also i like to teach and to communicate so this is why i'm here and yeah that's more or less it you can see on screen my my contacts so please you are very much invited to connect with me and as far as i'm concerned that's it so let's start yep good so but we aren't only to doing job for this workshop because the whole developer advocates team worked hard to deliver this boot camp to you and there are some of our great friends and colleagues in the youtube chat in discord chat to answer your questions if you are watching us live then ask questions and if you are watching this video recorded that's still not too late to ask questions and discord uh what do we do today first few words about uh boot camp how it works uh what's the status and what do you do next to get your success with the boot camp then shirt week one refresh in just two words if you attended last last week don't worry it will take like 60 seconds then we will speak about the keys because keys are very important working with data and the approach in cassandra is different to the approach you use it to have in with relational databases then we will speak about partitioning because partitioning is a real key to success with distributed partitioning databases we speak about a modeling methodology how to develop an efficient data model step by step in very details and then obviously what's next chris your chance to win the prizes homework and what do we do next week week one going to be uh well it's not going to be it's almost over already but you know what it's not too late not to not too late to join you still can watch the recording do the homework get your page and move forward working with cassandra and the applications we are developing in this bootcamp when week second right now is in progress as you could guess when next week is going to be week 3 this week we speak about the data model because it's a very important part for any um heavy loaded application when a next workshop will be all about coding and working with nosql database and before it's going to be about apis and microservices one of my favorite topics notice every stream is done two times for two different time zones that's the first run and second run we will have approximately in 20 to 12 hours or something like that maybe 16 hours okay it doesn't matter anyway you know where to find this information and with homeworks all together as a result of this boot camp you will be totally able to pass your certification and get certified apache cassandra developer or administrator vive well visa boot camp is mostly focused on developers and become certified apache cassandra developer totally for free because it's all sponsored by data stacks i love working in this company so attend one of our two live streaming workshops same content wednesday on thursday we stream on youtube and our plan b is anything goes wrong with youtube we can switch to twitch on the datastaxdevs channel for the questions you can ask your questions on youtube but primary channel for us is our discord server because discord is uh stays with us even then youtube is stream is over and for game squeezes asking you questions and letting you win our prizes we use maintenance you will have to do a workshop labs you will have to do some work outside of the lab it's a boot camp and you are supposed to work even after that stream we use different technologies places from week to week next week it will be git bots on which it can be katakota and be what really matters all of our materials uh github publish it so you can do them anytime at night in the morning whatever you prefer and when you are what's what's your most efficient time to be complete the learning materials most of them are published at the academy.datastarts.com tom of datastax.com and but again the main repository for our materials are on github and finally submit the homework with the link specified in github and you will be good first attendees of last week already have got their pages right stefano yes absolutely right okay good so you can get one page per each week if you complete for homework but what really matters the most if you do all the homework you will be totally ready to pass your certification for apache cassandra developer in the end and data stack sponsor it so it will be for free for you sounds like a very good beginning of year 2022 to become a certified nosql engineer i like this idea yeah definitely so uh it's meant your time now we have to ask a couple of questions very good so i think that's now my turn to show my screen and there we are and let me start this full screen so um i have to move our we have to cover our bases on the moon sorry about that ah no that's more like it and meanwhile there is a question uh by fairly great tv is wednesday class different from that on thursday content on wednesday and on thursday is the same but maybe different speakers yes not this week yes so this is just to come to to be friendly with more time zones so okay i'm better disappear for a while sorry i will disappear and show you the code in its entirety here hello you can hear my disembodied voice okay so please we ask you to join mendy.com to go to mendy.com maybe with your phone or in a different browser tab and use that after entering the code that will make it possible for us to ask you a few questions which will first be just a you know survey to get to know our audience uh better but later we will use the same connection for a little quiz and the quiz there will be prizes to the winners so we invite you to keep the connection open after these first questions let's see let's see there are already if several of you who joined but i see you're still joining so uh we can start those questions okay it's it's not a competition yet but just uh set up questions and we have a lot of things to cover today we invite everyone to join menti because later there will be a quiz and you will be asked questions and you will be given a chance to win some prizes but let's start so and please get back to the screen i miss you oh right sorry absolutely true here i am ah through the magic of video editing i'm back okay so we would like to ask you a few questions uh just to know you so first uh where are you connecting from you see you can uh you can pin your position on this map you don't need to be hundred percent accurate just you know for us to have an idea i see many folks from all around europe uh i would say most of it is either france of germany but the the blob is too big and it covers now all of europe so india us i think new zealand south america new zealand africa and that must be brazilian brazil right uh alaska maybe wow there are really people from all over the world very good i see people from india joining us uh guys we run this workshop two times for different time zones if this one is getting late for you you can totally jump in on first day because it may be a better fit from time point of view yeah good point another point that i want to make is i see many of you are answering also in the youtube chat obviously we are happy to see the places spelled out but don't forget that the answers in the youtube chat will not go into the map and that's even more important later because there will be a quiz as i said and if you answer on youtube uh your answer will be wasted so please go to menti.com and enter the code you see now on screen at least for later for the quiz hungary so people from all over okay let's uh let's proceed so how many of you uh participated till last week okay very many because this is week two as alex said and we are all obviously happy to see new people coming on board welcome but as we expected many of you are just continuing your journey with apache cassandra and application development so yeah if you didn't attend week one but you already know apache cassandra when you are totally good to stay and go with us we are going to absolutely do some incredible things today if you didn't attend vikwan and you have no idea apache about apache cassandra still no need to jump out because we prepared a couple of slides for you um to stay more or less with us during the rest of the workshop but take a look it's a great technology it's mostly probably the most powerful database nowadays so if you want to be a better as a software engineer or administrator if you want to get a better salary and better job positions then you are totally invited also to attend the previous week which is recorded and available and you even can submit your homework it's still possible and get your page for reviewing yes absolutely so yeah uh we will later give you a a a link to a repository and this is actually a one single repository for the whole bootcamp so you will be easily navigate to week one and there you will find links to slides video and everything so please don't forget if you're interested to go to week one and catch up with the material because it's really a lot of useful and cool stuff to know okay okay next next question uh obviously to those of you who were to week one did you do the homework right i see a lot of yes that's great that's great so if you didn't attend when you can answer no yes also that's okay there are a few dozens of people who already oh my god we are getting closer to hundreds uh yeah yeah you are the best yes well uh we've been grading the homework throughout the week and new submissions coming daily so congratulations well done and i would say the quality of the submissions is pretty high which uh say means we have done a great job last week but most important you have been doing a great job keeping uh up with that but you can still go ahead and submit for week one so don't worry and let's move on to the next question yeah we want everyone to be able to participate even if you uh didn't uh if you was busy or somehow that's totally fine you still can submit your homework the form stays open yes don't worry i see that joe remembers that i reviewed your work yes i did i remind i remember you so yes and there is a great question youssef ellerin asks so the page mainly mainly depends on the google form homework not on the ideas to one exercise is correct so that's a great question i want to say work on that take a look page mainly depends on google form homework totally right but well let's admit that beige is beige and uh what depends on your ds201 homework is your exam if you do your job well with ds201 and then later ds220 you will easily pass the exam and get your real globally recognized certification if you just do a github for a google form homework but don't pay attention to the academy content ds21 and 220 it will be much harder to you to pass the exam so both matters yes that's a good point because the ultimate goal is to get knowledge more than the badge so yes now that's a very interesting question what's your take on the normalization so some of you are like do you know what and well today's uh today's content is aimed mostly at you so welcome now someone is very much against the normalization someone else is a fan of it it's the true way to go and i see a lot of you know moderate positions like yeah there are cases where it might come in handy otherwise other times maybe it's not so much and well today is mostly about the normalization in a sense so maybe you will be able to judge better or any way to make a a more informed opinion after these two hours so uh today seven people answered it's an absolute evil and today i will uh play this game change your mind uh someone yeah i will play someone from a dark side of the force and try to bring you there so maybe i will be i will manage to persuade you but it's not an absolute evil and sometimes it's necessary i see i see that aaron uh says some something in the chat that is very much true but it's a secret nobody has to say that so yeah the normalization is also employed in relational databases and but nobody wants to talk about that because you know it's seen as a dirty thing that you do just for performance secretly without much publicity but we are jumping too much ahead so let's just uh stop here with the questions thank you for the questions and please keep the mendy connection open because later we will be using that again as i say uh with that i think i'll jump back to your screen alex if that's okay and there we go i have to adjust ourselves to the moons again great so well done let's start then it's going to be week one refresh just five slides i promise very short one apache cassandra is a distributed decentralized database management system one of the most uh powerful nosql databases one of the most scalable from my point of view almost uh in the world which is used by all of most of the top companies to handle their scale it was originally developed by facebook and then used by netflix used by apple also developed not only used by apple and fx instagram uber and many many many other it offers an incredible list of very powerful features uh how it works and how it's different from our databases data is partitioned there is no way to store hundreds petabytes trying to fit them all squeeze them all into a single server that just won't work so cassandra partitions data over multiple uh machines into some groups called partitions and that's one of the primary uh ideas to get i hope you getting that uh if you don't then when later watch for week one it will help data is replicated and that's very important cassandra is used by the companies what require 100 uptime they want to have 100 percent of time not like nine nine nine nine nine nine no just real one hundred percent of time and moreover disaster tolerance without proper replication you cannot get that also data is globally distributed so cassandra's trademark is multiple data centers over the world building still building a single cluster and each data center is active so there is nothing like read-only data centers or read-only notes every note able to dispatch any request speaking of that cassandra uses decentralized masterless ruby better say peer-to-peer architecture no single point of failure every node is able to process write or read requests doesn't matter if you have two nodes or 200 nodes still every node able to answer any request an application can conduct any node in case your application cannot work with node a it will just switch to node b or even to data center b if you have multiple data centers beside behind all those features one very important thing to understand on the scale from bicycle and to boeing cassandra is very much on the boeing side so all those amazing features is a shared responsibility cassandra will do its job but if you don't do yours it won't work so that's very important for you to pay attention to this workshop because the primary topic of today workshop is how do you not fail with cassandra how do you reach success with cassandra so ladies and gentlemen past your seatbelts we are starting and first and primary topic for today workshop it's all about each let's start with the smallest unit of data you usually work in cassandra or like you use it to work in relational databases too it's a cell it's an intersection of a row and a column and it stores some data your bank account numbers your name whatever it's still a single cell when a group of cells uh is a single structure a data item in a table is a row that should be not a new concept to you i believe most of you have experience with relational databases right so let's move on then something new comes what we discussed at last week already new item in data structure is a partition it's a group of rows having the same partition token or the same partition key and it is a base unit of access in cassandra important store it together all rows are guaranteed to be neighbors you remember speaking of partitioning different partitions spread over multiple servers but all the rows within the same partition store together stored together so we can easily access them and table is a group of columns and rows storing partitions so far so good how do we create table you have seen some statements like that last week so let's pay a little bit of attention to the things we are going to discuss today in a bigger details this statement by itself looks quite familiar to those who has experience with sql because cql is designed to be very similar create table and we have to specify table and we have to specify key space which is a group of tables we have to give column definitions eta last name first name address all in this case type text but we have more data types than just text believe me then there are some differences coming primary key partition key clustering columns that's what we're going to talk about that today what is the partition key what is the clustering column how do i build primary key and why you should care first thing you need to learn and first thing we discussed already last week is a partition key partition key is an identifier for a partition it consists of at least one column may have more if needed and this one and only job is to partition rows and it also plays place it part as a part of primary key we will discuss later let's take a look at the examples in this case you remember we use partition key to partition data or better say not v but cassandra and how many partitions we will use we will have when we have partition key like that as much as much as many users we will have and that's perfectly fine we can have a lot of partitions this primary key is totally fine if we speak about commentaries on youtube that makes sense to partition them based on a video id so comments to the same video i did will be stored together so we will easily repeat them you open youtube page you get your video and comment street in a single request not in a bunch of them and finally we can have multiple columns as a part of a partition key for example in this case we partition our users not based just on a country but on the country and city as a result we may we will have as much partitions as we have cities per country with our users of course then well we discussed it already first week so let's move on there are some clustering columns and clustering columns are very very very important clustering columns have two duties first of all they are used to ensure uniqueness for example take a look at the first example what would happen if our c users by city will be based just on the city it won't work if the drop clustering comes and use just city we will have one user per city which sounds a little bit like a fallout disaster maybe to me so when we go for city last name and first name will this design work you see already it will have some problems clustering columns are responsible for uniqueness as a part of a primary key and if we use just like city last name first name then every next john smith in new york will make a big disappointment for the previous john smith because he will overwrite data of a previous john smith as long as you don't use lightweight transactions but we don't speak about them today so what's the right way to think about their uniqueness using clustering keys we go with city last name first name and email and we don't really need email in this case as a primary key uh we want very basic on this email but we will use it just to ensure uniqueness of the key so uh even if we have 20 or 30 john smiths in new york uh i believe most of them have more or less unique males let's hope but there is a second job of the clustering columns very important to understand what clustering columns define sorting order so for example if you want to sort uh to store comments for a video and we could go with a key like that partition key video id clustering column command id will it be unique yes it will because every id is unique but this design will have a little problem they won't be sorted and when we load comments for video we want to see more stress and first and then we using created add column as a part of a clustering as a part of a clustering column groups we will as a result have our comments sorted by time and when we retrieve them we don't even have to execute sorting statement because they are already sorted by default that's a very nice optimization so two duties of a clustering column ensure uniqueness and establish sort of sorting order they are optional if you don't need them you can go without them for example here you see the example of a key caving zero clustering columns so that's totally allowed but you cannot define anything without a partition key you need always to have partition key and then primary key as you could guess basically groups those two together partition key and all of the clustering columns if any building together something which should be truly unique so in this case we have primary key of city last name first name and email or here we have primary key of just a user id for just a user's database that's a primary key something what unites together clustering columns and a partition key a primary key is in define identifier for a row and it's obviously required you cannot create table without a primary key because you won't be able to retrieve any data so it makes no sense primary responsibility of a primary key one and only is to ensure uniqueness uh now why keys are so important take a look there is a lot of power in uh cassandra features but there are also some restrictions you need to know because there is always always price to pay for such a power and very important limitations we have to discuss today let's take a look can you execute a statement like select all from users by city where last name equals something can you or can not i hope you got the idea but if you didn't then listen when you are retrieving data and you have petabytes of data over hundreds of servers maybe thousands you need always to specify the partition key that's an absolute must so you cannot retrieve data just by last name because you have to specify city and plus name and if you how do you modify this statement to get your data where city equals something like let's say my hometown saint petersburg russian where city equals saint petersburg and last name equals something ivanov then you will get your data that works but this statement doesn't work now can you retrieve a statement like that the city is bigger than something or shitty bigger than something and smaller than something will it work no why i mean you are giving c theory yeah right you are specifying ct um for uh any kind of integer data or string data that won't work because partition keys always require full equality uh not inequality not range but always equality or in the worst case scenario in statement so it can be like select all from users by city where city in saint petersburg uh new york london uh every year high stefano and so on so yes in is kinda strict statement streets and three equivalent but you cannot use inequalities not equals to something and so on you need to explicitly define your partitions otherwise that won't work because if you don't specify a partition you will have to do what full clusters come and full cluster scan is not something you want to have on your production when you must be curious what's wrong with the next statement where ct equals something predefined and first name equals something and emails equals something we're specifying city right then why this statement won't work because if you are using clustering columns you have to give them in the order they are defined so if you retrieve data where ct equals something last name equals something and first name we call something and emails people something you will get your data if you just get it like city and last name it will work totally but if you do ct and first name won't work you skip last name you will get an exception right and uh basically uh the same here city define it last name bigger than okay you can use inequalities on the class string columns that will work and first name equals something like um that is already sounds better um good so what's our story here uh cassandra is dedicated for high performance on a high data volume but if you will try to use it and search an analytic engine you mostly probably will be a little bit disappointed as we always say as cassandra so good in a fast performance big data queries you may need to partner at optimum up with other solutions like apache spark like elasticsearch like solar to get also search capabilities over your data speaking of keys i will give you a hint we do not use sequential ids in cassandra try to think why and i will give you five seconds to try to answer okay 10 seconds i'm very kind today why don't we use sequential ids in cassandra please answer right sylvain laguerre that is yousef okay okay okay okay okay so partitioning is not the right answer in this case but i see some people gave already uh right answer so let's switch to the next screen why don't we use sequential ids in cassandra the idea is when you work with traditional single host based databases like mysql postgres and many others you can use something like that create table column one integer not null auto increment and then you can insert insert something into your database and get your last insert id so it will be last value plus one that's actually quite convenient feature i kind of miss that but it doesn't work with cassandra and i see some of you answer it cassandra is distributed issuing sequential ids will require collaboration of all the servers responsible for this table and there can be three servers or 13 or 300 or maybe 3 000 and it will require all of them to agree on what's the next number can you imagine storing your data in your database and then waiting for half an hour for all the servers to agree what's the next sequential id because you don't want to have some id issued to two different roles right of course right then how do you get uh ids for different entities in cassandra there is a thing called uuid universally unique identifier and this uuid is usually generated on the application side not on the database side and it's a very very very very long string of different numbers and characters which is universally unique and the chance for them to have a collision is let's say it won't happen so uh working with cassandra keys you generate a universally unique identifier at the application site and then insert this data into the database and your application already knows this id so you can go and work with it already and those as you see are very two different approaches if cassandra you prefer universally unique identifiers instead of sequential ids it's much more efficient obviously for the distributed decentralized databases and why can't you afford centralized database because centralized database is a single point of failure and cassandra has known so we just covered keys and now i have to ask stefano do we have any good questions on the keys we have to discuss life well there was can you hear me yes there was a question about the fifth example of the forbidden queries the one with um if i'm not mistaken an inequality on the first clustering column and an equal sign on the second clustering column because that was a bit uh surprising to some that this is a not a good query so i don't know if you want to go back to that one very quickly maybe it's one it's a one of the uh you want me to switch back to a previous slide if you if we have to one minute maybe it might help of course um the forbidden queries the invalid queries here we go no not too much here yeah the fifth case why is the last red line uh a troublesome query that's because there is um within the partition because see there's an equal sign in in city so that goes to select a single partition and as it is written now uh there is an an unequal inequality in last name that means if you think about how the rows are sorted within the partition that means that still goes to read a sequential block of rows within the partition but then due to the equal sign on first name that implies a jumping pattern in reading the partition so the way it is that would raise a problem now still as cedric remarked live on this chord still this is not a bad pattern in itself because the important thing is that you go to a single partition but then this is one of those particular cases where you can use allow filtering and that's not like it you don't go to jail for that but you still need to explicitly allow filtering in this case and you will be reading a single partition but in a leapfrog kind of way so that's a bit of a corner case that was a question by youssef i think i'm not mistaken so that's it the rest yeah there have been a few questions but they are going to they are have been answered so yeah uh there is a question from yousef but i'm not sure i get the question i'm sorry uh the one at the end only or even once in the middle all that queries um here are wrong queries so inequalities for partition keys are not supported at all and in this case inequalities per se are supported so take a look the last query where ct equals something and last name is bigger than something this statement will work but together with first name it won't work you can have inequalities or clustering columns [Music] there is just a restriction uh well it doesn't work together inequality on first one and equality on the next one that's what won't work so let's move on we are uh uh stefan all right yes i think so yeah so okay i see a few more questions but maybe uh we better ask you to to to go to discord later yeah we have so much to cover this custom later on okay so partitioning in details and uh if it's late for you and you are going to leave stop focus on what we are showing because next slides are the most important slides for you in year 2022 you won't see anything better in the year 2022 i promise because cassandra is partitioned the key to success is to do partitioning right if you do partitioning right it will work mostly pro if you do partitioning wrong well that's the easiest way to fail with cassandra and i want you to be successful i want you not to fail so pay your attention we are going to make a deeper dive into rules of partitioning and there are only three rules very easy to remember you need to need you need to know all of them and those are simple store together what you retrieve together avoid big partitions avoid code partitions let's start step by step store together what you retrieve together i briefly mentioned that already what you tend to retrieve together from the database as a single query you better store together for example our typical use case we open a video on youtube we see all the comments most present first in one single query do you want this query to be executed to ask multiple different servers no you don't you want this query to be executed very fast and of course it's much faster when you need to ask only one server then that totally makes sense to keep all your comments to a video as a single partition how do we do that we decide on the proper partition key so for all our comments to this video you're watching right now you go with video id as the partition key then you are done so they will be stored together very simple to follow this rule take a look at the second example imagine we have a table uh for comments partitioned by comment id as a result it will have as many partitions as many comments you have is it bad per se no it's not a big deal you can have a lot of partitions but will it work well for the query give me all comments to a single video by video id that just won't work because you do not specify video id video id is not a part two partition or a clustering column so that won't work anyway but even uh if it would you still will have to ask most of the servers of your cluster maybe you have comments for the video number 13 no you don't okay i will go ask next server uh thinking of a youtube size of the data how do you think how much time it will take you don't want to use youtube if they would use this approach so obviously store together what you retrieve together in a single partition you know what second rule contradicts to the first one avoid big partitions well i don't really prefer to think of it like contradicting but adding a restriction you do want to consider avoid big partitions do you remember why do we do partitioning after all to avoid too many data per server and to support easy simple linear scaling when your partitions are getting too big you basically running into the same problem we were avoiding with introducing partitioning after all your database cannot be fast if you have two big partitions so what do you want to have you want to have limited size partitions and there is only one hard limit you cannot have other than two billion cells per partition it's a card limit you cannot cross it it just won't work at all but our recommendations like data stocks cassandra best practices are significantly smaller we recommend not to have 100 more than 100 000 rows per partition and we recommend not to have more than 100 megabytes per partition those are soft limits those are recommendations if you go to 101 megabytes per partition uh you don't have to cry too loud about that it's not a disaster we've seen some people with partitions like uh 1.5 terabytes that is definitely a bad idea speaking of examples if you're having a table like country user id for users so your users partition it by currently it's quite a bad thing because you may have in some countries you will have i don't know monaco or vatican you will have very small amount of users but in companies like india like china you may have really a lot of people and that's obviously not going to work well what you want to have with partitions to have a reasonable size and more or less the same size so think how do you partition your data on the example a little bit upstairs comments for video then take a look you might say what hey alex uh there are some videos what may have really much more than 100 000 rows that's technically right but take a look uh comment uh as a tease it's quite a small entity it will have user id username because we go for the normalization comment id timestamp comment text basically that's it five fields well okay six seven fields because there are some more data to store but in general the idea is that's it so each comment is just a text value of quite a small size as long as you don't allow to write comments like war and peace and we don't we wouldn't recommend that so in this case uh comments per video can survive this limitation in general you may think of a better partitioning key for comments per video still paying respect to the first rule we just stir together what you retrieve together but let's move on you also have to avoid hot partitions what that means let's take a look uh what's it about big partitions it's about their size it's about their disk space they're consuming base claim and what is the hot partition what partition means one partition being accessed all the time and some partitions are not being accessed at all or being accessed significantly lesser amount of [Music] any interactions with them and maybe quite a good example of a user's table having partitions as much as users you have well that way that's totally fine you will have a lot of partitions one row per partition and that works usually your workload is distributed over multiple users and normally you have a lot of users especially if you use cassandra so that's fine thinking of videos it may be a different scenario because there are some videos what no one is commenting right and there are videos like ours with a lot of comments or also very videos from some stars top stars getting millions of comments per day obviously some you may say what a partition uh we saw from some i don't know top star is going to be hot partition but let's think as long as this partition is not too big and as long as we have many partitions if at some point we get too high pressure on this partition we can add more servers partitions will be spreaded over bigger amount of servers therefore we will have as a result smaller amount of partitions per server smaller pressure on server as long as a single server can handle single partition you will be fine in the end you just need to have multiple partitions but if you have only 10 partitions and you have high pressure on one on them like really highest possible pressure like you are doing some e-commerce and you went to china and now everyone is buying uh to you like you got some huge success and you have got 10 servers before um but now your system is overloaded because obviously everyone is buying from you first of all congrats but now you have a big problem your system is overloaded you may tell me hey alex we are successful in china everyone is buying from us i mean we have money we can buy i don't know 1 000 servers if we need to yes you can but think of what if you have only 10 partitions 10 countries and one of them are overloaded and you have 10 servers if you add 10 more servers will it help no because partition is the smallest unit of access based unit of access and you cannot divide partition into without migrating data to a different table so as a result uh avoiding what partitions when one is overloaded and all the others are resting and this one is too much that is definitely very very very bad idea so think about data size volume distribution over partitions but also pressure workload distribution over partitions and now i have a good question to you i like to make you thinking danger is not always obvious what's wrong with the next model take a look together we all work in a huge uh telecommunication company very huge it's a real use case by the way from real life real world it happened to one of our clients imagine a huge telecommunication company like one of the biggest in the world with a lot of infrastructure and with the data centers all across the world and there is a very huge internet of things network with very very many maybe dillions billions of different sensors reporting their state every few seconds every sensor every few seconds returns its timestamp so what's a local time its own id of course and the current sensor value what is the sensor value doesn't matter right now it can be temperature it can be humidity it can be a door sensor door is open door is closed so basically boolean value true or false and so on so each server each sensor reports uuid you know what that matters already timestamp and a value and we have to store such data and in the beginning we designed it a table with partition key sensor id because rule one store together what you receive together and we want to see the data from a single sensor of course to see how temperature in the room changes over time right and then reported that as a clustering column uh to sort data by time and to keep uniqueness right and these design works i mean it works but after some time we start to notice some heavy problems with our cluster now that is a question what happened what went wrong and what's wrong with this design please answer in the youtube chat says we are missing reported time reporting location sensor type uh timestamp is the reported time and sensor doesn't know reporting location it knows only its own id and sensor type we just skip for clarity i see the i see the question the right answer has appeared in the chart right yes so answer write answers to a given already it will result in two big partitions uh take a look i mean uh amit says lots of report at the same time i see people with relational databases disappointing experience right with other databases you may be afraid of too many pressure per second lots of reports at the same time but with cassandra which is perfectly scalable for for rights you only have to take care of having right data model and having enough servers and if you have enough servers you will easily handle any kind of pressure you can handle like apple does like netflix instagram are doing you can handle dozens and hundreds millions of operations per second hundreds millions of operations per second so it's not about amount of reference per second that is totally fine for cassandra but the real point is uh what your partitions will be to beat in the end not in the beginning but they're growing every 10 seconds more and more and more so after a few months your partitions will be just too big and there is a point uh volume gets increased quickly by jb akash perumal it's also totally fine you can have huge volumes you can have petabytes volumes you just add more servers cassandra handles that so with cassandra you shouldn't be afraid of the things you're normally afraid of too many reports per second to big data volume this is not a problem anymore but you have to think of your partitions right so many core expressions that's amazing now let's think uh what is the what would be a good solution for that yeah yeah in the right direction very good so in general uh there are two uh typical solutions for this situation first one call it ttl time to leave and there it is in the in the chat yeah right you gtash i see a man of experience here good idea yes first solution of your solution is used to is use ttl time to leave with cassandra when inserting data or even inserting not just the rows but really particular values you can configure time to leave and you can say for this record for this record i want to have detail 10 days and it will be automatically deleted after 10 days or after 10 years whatever you said and you don't have to worry about that that's amazing now in this particular case because as i said it's a real case from a real life it wasn't the option for us because uh this client wanted to keep this data for like for a long long time because maybe of some audit requirements or anything but well uh ttl was not a good case in this situation there is another solution much better solution it's called compound partition keys or bucketing take a look on the update instead of using just sensor id as a partition p go v stands for id and month of a year as a partition then partitioner hasher get these two values bring them together and produce a token as month changes you will get a new token and therefore new partition will be created uh take a look what is a month year month here maybe an integer or a string that doesn't matter and let's say it's it's going to be january of 2022 right so in this case month here will be 0 1 2 0 2 2 or it may be opposite way around two zero two two zero one and then january is over the human year will be zero two to zero to two so year month and year therefore new partition created never partitioned never written again which is quite cool so uh it's called bucketing because we are adding a scientifical field to the partition key and now we can have our data written to that only for the particular month of a particular year a new partition will be created as a result we will have more partitions of a smaller size now yeah it's a composite key or compound key there are multiple definitions uh but uh one about the general idea it is a bucket uh for data by the way i notice it comment them for uh we will have too much partitions because we will have a lot of sensor ids and in this scenario we will have even more it is totally fine with cassandra you may have as much partitions as you want to stephanie fixed me if i'm wrong there must be like two in them uh i think it's two to the sixty four two two available so that's quite a lot yeah let's see yeah good uh so and now one more question someone said uh to make buckets based on the day like first day second day third day and so on like uh counting days will that work let's think i cannot find this comment [Music] i cannot find it but it doesn't matter so if we go what per day partitions it was saved by that now i cannot find it yellow so per day partitions uh will it work on the right time yes it will work uh on the right time you write data you give in a partition not month year but day and that will work but think of that we not only uh store data but we also retrieve data from time to time right and when you retrieve data don't forget you have to always specify what all the parts of a partition key and let's say i want to see data of a particular server sensor for last three months how will my query look like in this scenario it will be the sensor id equals one and one year is january 22 or december 21 or november 21 in in statement it will require to access to access three different partitions it's not a perfect scenario but it's also not so good problem we can do it it's fine but if you give day by basic buckets or hour-based buckets and you have to show data for the last three months can you imagine amount of the servers we will have to access amount of partitions we have to access with days it will be around 90 something and with hours i won't even calculate but it's going to be much worse so that's obviously not the best scenario that's the answer avoid big and constantly growing partitions and you can use ttl or bucketing to avoid constantly growing partitions but that's very important for you to remember what partition may grow over time so stefano do we have anything important uh to answer to comment uh right now before we go to the next slides uh you're muted sorry after learning about ttl joe is asking what do we do if we want to archive data out of the table but still not having it quietly disappear so are there any solutions to bulk archiving data well i think there are a few uh it depends it depends on the format you want to archive data you you can what you can do is to periodically send to uh blog and object storage like a glacier you can send your your raw files containing the the data for example that's a very low cost in terms of technical setup or maybe you can think of a spark job to periodically take a snapshot of all of part of the data and send it to a different uh called kind of storage i don't know alex what would you suggest in this case you can maybe sorry yeah no no no it's all good um if we want to archive like with a backup uh purposes easiest way to do it based on the ss tables files uh the point is is this is a part of administration course so it's not a topic for today but if you're asking i'll answer the story is cassandra is designed to be extremely performant and one of the ways to reach that is basically immutability of the data it's a hidden secret of cassandra and now you will learn that maybe i've mentioned something like that this last big uh create insert update and delete are basically the same all the same operations because cassandra is append only and as a stable files files for assorted strings we store data on disk are totally immutable once it created it never will change it makes backup of the data or archiving of the data very very very convenient you just grab your as a stable and put it to a cold storage like aws s3 or minio or whatever you use and openstack swift and you will be good with that totally so easiest way to do it is to do it based on the as a stable files if you want to have more granular control you may need to use apache spark ds bulk or tools like that and i hope i've answered this question uh one more thing i wanted to mention question from paval does the composite key data store store it in the same node one more time how does a partition uh how does data is partitioned based on the partition tokens how does token calculates based on the partition key if you have uh two rows reported on first january and second january with the same sensor id and with the same month year let's say sensor id 1 month year january 2022 we will have as a result as we have seen partition key they will have same partition token we will group the same partition they will be stored together but if anything changes sensor id or month where token will be different because of the hashing algorithm more more free and as a result they can be stored on a different server totally are there any more good questions um well there is something more about ttl and tombstones but i think again we are better going forward because that goes a bit too much into the details of storing uh physical storing of data so maybe again we would probably direct you to speak more on this chord for that i don't know a discord or better if you really want to understand internals of cassandra you may think of taking a date data stocks cassandra administration course on the academy it's free and meanwhile by the way if you are into administration too don't forget what voucher for certification we give with 100 percent discount it's valid for two attempts so if you take your ds2 one course and you take your ds220 course which will we will do during the next months the next week sorry and you go and pass your exam from the first attempt uh keep becoming a certified apache cassandra developer you still have one attempt left so you can go and learn gears 2 to 10 for administrators and then with the second attempt free you can try to take administration exam and as a result you will have two globally recognized certifications out of one bootcamp and that is the real advanced scenario so please then let me know in discord or on linkedin and i will applause to you and put you and mention you in linkedin that's for sure to get two certifications from what one would come it's really like advanced achievement good good good good and a question ask it but by monika we answered that last week yeah there is a logic for partition token how it's stored but we won't uh discover that during this level i i gave a short account but please go and uh have a look at because that that topic is uh examined in a bit more detail in the contents of last week or as alexander of course okay in short it's not your headache it's not your headache it's cassandra your job is to make partitions even and equal more or less even and equal in the size and the workload distribution and you will be good cassandra will take care of others yeah good so and we are getting to the very heart of this workshop modeling methodology we will learn to build an efficient data model vivapache but before we have to realize two very important things and first thing is denormalization versus normalization there were seven people who told what normalization is good and denormalization is an absolute evil and now wait for it we will discuss it again after a couple of slides but before we start let's let's talk about what is the normalization and what is the denormalization so when we will discuss benefits of each approach what is a database normalization normalization is a process of structuring and data in relational database in accordance we've so-called normal forms with a purpose to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity it was proposed by edward code in like 50 years ago first so basically if you have employees if you have employee management system and you have employees working in different departments or teams you don't have the department name in employees table you have one table for employees you have one table for departments and the department name stored only in the department's table and in the employees going on oops sorry guys something happened with my home good and um employees don't have anything about departments but they have user id department id first name last name and then department id is the lead to a proper department so we see what edgar caught work in department id one so we can go and see what department id1 is actually an engineering department that's it there are a few normal some normal forms defining rules like the deeper you get into normalization stricter the rules on how do you normalize your data that must sound familiar for most of you based on the recent mental question so what are the benefits and what are the disadvantages of normalization now some of you must be like what do you mean disadvantages normalization is perfect it has no disadvantages no normalization is just a tool and as every tool it has some good sites and some not good sites is hammer a great tool yes totally hammer is a great too but if you have to let's say uh take a look at some bacterias or amilbas on as a part of biological research is humber still a good tool yes hammer is still a good tool but not in your use case right um as with that we have different use cases and software development and there may be some better approaches so what are the benefits of normalization first of all it's a simple write when you need to rename a department or when you need to change data anyhow if you want to insert data you need to do just one single simple write right so it's uh basically a simple thing you need to update something change something you do one simple short right second serious benefit of normalization is data integrity data integrity means what uh you can have all the benefits of relational databases uh foreign checks on delete cascade uh and other data integrity cheeks uh checks helping really a lot working with your data but what are the disadvantages first of all slow reads and you can tell me hey guys uh hey alex i have my my sequel with my uh internet uh with my internet project running and i'm getting my reads very fast of course you can have your reads executed fast as long as your data fits into a single server but when you go to uh from kilobytes or megabytes of data you go to uh terabytes petabytes data spread it over over multiple multiple machines your rates are not going to be as fast anymore and basically you will have to go with sharding and sharding destroy your joints completely so slow reads i insist on that uh in comparison with the normalized tweets that's for sure and second thing are complex queries uh one a little bit unusual questions uh i run uh once in an interesting limitation doing some development for my germa for one german company i got a very interesting exception how do you think how many join statements you may have in the single select statement in my sequel version five it happened some years ago so it was version five i believe how many joints you can have in my sequel in a single select statement try to guess give me a number in uh youtube chat uh i had drop a hint it's not a power of two for some weird reason as you would expect five not a power of two yeah it's not the power of two much more than five a little bit less than 64. number this number is 61. no not 60 uh 67 000 for sure 61.61 join uh can you imagine main query with 61 joins like uh i i've got some ptsd uh at this project that's for sure and it was very hard to maintain such a query so joints are great but joints have some disadvantages and the biggest disadvantage of the joints is not shown on this slide i will show it to you on the next one but first what is that denormalization generalization is a strategy used on the database to increase performance not data integrity not data reduplication but performance in computing the normalization is the process of improve of a read performance of a database at the expense of losing some right performance by adding redundant copies of the data take a look now i have my employees table and the department name is stored right in the employees data that is a denormalization data is duplicated notice i still have department tables with department ide department i still need that for other purposes but now when i retrieve data i don't have to do joins because i get department id directly from the employees table and i don't have to do any joins to get a profile of my colleague or my employee and it brings some very serious advantages first of all quick reads now i do not have to execute any kind of joints on the read time i just go get my data show it on the screen boom done second benefit are the simple queries no joins right every query is a simple query i have user id first name last name department it's done as long as i know user id or first name last name i will get the data of this employee we are totally fine so quick reads simple queries much easier to maintain as again a microscope is a great tool uh but there are no perfect tools it all depends on your use case and there is always price to pay for that power what is that negative sides of the denormalization you know that already right multiple of rights so for example if i want to rename an engineering department into something let's let's say blackmagic department because engineering sometimes looks like a black mage then we do what we have to change department name for department tables and for each engineering employee in the table of employees so we basically have to do multiple rights right yeah right uh rock paper data duplication denobilization means data duplication so we have to do multiple rights then uh changing data and second point as it's in the normalized data in non-relational database we cannot have all the foreign keys check we cannot have on delete cascade we cannot checks on the foreign keys all the integrity across stable integrity is to be maintained by application developers so integrity is to uh now think of a manual support and you can say that's quite a high price to pay and yes it is i won't lie to you it's a high price to pay but what's the point as i told you last time cassandra enabled developers are getting higher salaries as long as we get more money for that i can survive manual integrity support but there is one more thing secret thing which changes much more i will share it with you of course because you are the best you are attending our bootcamp let's think when i have to get a data with joins using normalization and i have a table what depends on the table what depends on a table very common case when you have many too many relations can database internally run those joints in parallel like if i have to do three joints can i do them in three parallel threads no i first have to do first join on next available table uh get some data from it then based on this join i have to do the next join and then base it on the next join next join so the story is for most of the cases you cannot database internally cannot execute those joints in parallel and as a result they can be executed only sequentially one by one by one by one that means slow just slow and let's think can i execute with denormalization multiple rights simultaneously in parallel answer is yes because we don't depend on each other we go to different tables and the amount of right of rights grows significantly but i told you already cassandra is a very good fit for very huge right workloads cassandra skills perfectly for rights for clothes you don't have to worry about that every node is a master node so every node can handle bright if you have too many rights add more nodes and you are good again cassandra power so i can execute multiple writes in parallel but i cannot execute multiple reads joint reads in parallel as a result denormalization is significantly faster for all these kind of scenarios because rights can be executed in parallel and joints can not in most of the cases that's the story of normalization and denormalization and those seven people glorious seven who answer it what the normalization is an absolute evil please let me know in youtube comments if i manage to persuade you what it's not an absolute evil and sometimes it's a required tool to reach performance from your applications you want to have so it was the first thing but here's the second thing most of you have experienced working with relational data and you know how data modelling for relational databases usually goes relational data modeling or traditional data modeling first you analyze raw data domain entities their properties relations and so on then based on the results of this analysis you design tables using normalization foreign keys and relations for those entities so we go from raw data from the domain we go to the table design and then we when working with this data we will use joins um to get data from multiple tables so first row data then data models than application guess what with cassandra it goes exactly opposite way no but real in the exactly opposite way actually not only with cassandra because it goes for over most of the other nosql databases you first think about uh user behavior because customer first and we think about what how exactly customer is going to use my application what will be customer workflows i will explain it in a bigger detail soon when we identify workflows their dependencies and needs dependencies of not the entities but dependencies of the workflows you will see soon when we define queries to fulfill those workflows and knowing the queries we will design tables using the normalization and we will use batch when inserting or updating the normalized data of multiple tables so ladies and gentlemen welcome to data modeling methodology developed by amazing doctor archaeology.com and we will discuss modeling process step by step stefano do we have any good questions or points to discuss well there is a question i've been partially answering and also david chimed in about uh denormalizations because you know as as as always happens that surprises many folks and it is indeed a surprising idea in a sense so they asked what happens if there is a department name in the in the in one table that is just not present in the other one so something that the the relational db just does not let you do by design so well the answer is multi-faceted it depends on the application what the application does how the data are accessed and combined at the application or api level at least and there is not a single answer i would say so it might be just that it's not a problem and some rows in one table just remains there stale never read and maybe there will be a cleanup task from time to time and and sometimes this is really might even be part of the design in a sense other times you have to ask yourselves uh how come my application brought the db in such a inconsistent state so to speak such a puzzling state and there might be a bug in the way you handle your uh rights for example but there are also tools to keep that into check such as batches or even periodic spark jobs for example to check for such weird situations but really it's really depends on on the sit on the particular case but yeah so normalized databases do not offer that kind of problem by design but you pay a very high price that is a performance wall and in today's world you just can't afford that that's more or less the gist um there are some questions i want quickly to answer uh first one will be wait a second is there a limit on a number of columns i believe there is a limit of number of columns but it's quite high i don't remember a particular number uh ah home asks is schema evaluation support so there is either table either key space tables statements and i even work right now to make them a little bit more convenient to use but uh schema evolution statements outer table statements and so on much more limited then you use it to have so you cannot use party you cannot change partition key you cannot use clustering columns basically you can not touch all the parts of a primary key and let's think about that partition key defines how data distributed over the cluster clustering columns define how data is stored on disk changing any of those parts would lead to what if you change a partition key your data has to be reshuffled all across the cluster and working with cassandra you have to start to thinking in the dozens hundreds thousands server size you do not want your cluster to reshuffle data over petabytes over 1000 servers so altering uh partition key is not supported and not allowed meanwhile clustering key defines uh storage on how it's stored on disk changing clustering keys will lead to restoring all the data in your cluster or of the table uh rewrite basically back on disk and then you order which is again paralyzed which will paralyze your cluster for some quite some time you don't want to have it so alter table present but it's very limited you can change basically only data columns uh data columns is not something would affect your partition key first thing second thing i wanted to answer uh jitesh asks can you give some example use cases for materialized views and secondary indexes time permits time won't permit because we are focused on the uh more fundamental things of data modeling materialized views are experimental so at the moment in the current state they aren't really recommended for production use although i know a couple of success stories with them and secondary indexes are covered in data stacks academy courses so you will be good uh and sajal goyal says we think in reverse in cassandra and yes totally right in cassandra data modeling we think just not on the raw data but we think of the customers and what we will do with our application if you have heard of the things like user stories like as a customer in order to pick a right goods for me i go to catalog user stories if you have heard of this designing apple watch it's very much matching the cassandra data modeling okay so let's go and we have more things to cover today data modeling process step by step data modeling methodology includes uh four ideas and two steps to join them together first one will be conceptual data model and second one will be application workflow model and third one will be logical data model and fourth one will be physical data model so far it sounds a little bit puzzling i know so let's uh go and walk through that and discuss every step in a bigger details first you have to understand the data and identify access patterns what that means first understand the data we still have to think about the data we have about the entities where properties and relation is still present but uh think what also we do at the very same time is we identify access patterns so basically we analyze customer workflows as we analyze the men the main then joining them together based on their analysis of our result i will show it in a bigger details with example so don't hurry don't ask your questions wait a moment pay attention [Music] we bind them together using the very first approach based on the results of the analysis of a domain and of the workflow we design queries and as a final result we optimize them bringing some nice cassandra optimizations we have and we can create tables after that domain sorry design is done data model is done it still sounds passing i know so let's go practical we will learn by a real use case in this case we will learn how to create an efficient data model for global temperature monitoring sensor network which kind of relates to what we did before but now before real cql code recover conceptual data model application workflow logical data model physical data model final secret schema and query design it will be i o our iot internet of things case so i want you to think a little bit first we do we analyze the domain and what is the domain and what are the entities we have in this sensor scenario take a look we have sensor networks we have sensors and we have temperature measurements each network of sensors has a nickname description region number of sensors name and description region text type and number of sensors is integer if we are lucky enough and no one crashes our sensors into two hulls when what is the sensor sensor belongs to a network belongs to a network sensor has a unique id sensor knows its location in this scenario it knows its location it's programmed for that some characteristics and temperature measurement has timestamp and volume and one measurement belongs to one and only one sensor network can have multiple sensors each sensor belongs to only one network each measurement belongs to one and only one network that must be quite simple case for every real software development experience networks sensors measurements and what do we do with these uh domain definition we go and we create entity relationship diagram based on the data we have it's a typical entity relationship diagram if you know uh this format you already know what's going on right here we have three entities network one network has multiple sensors one sensor records multiple temperature measurements those that's it three entities to relations between them when each network has name description region number of sensors and each sensor has id and location location consists of latitude and longitude and each sensor has some characteristics those may be different from sensor to sensor by the way and every temperature measurement has a timestamp and value let's stop here for a moment and think a little bit that's our entity relationship diagram for quite a simple use case but it describes everything what we have network has sensors and sensors records temperature plus some properties this entity relationship diagram should look pretty simple to you i hope so we discussed the domain but it's not enough now as the part of the first step because they can happen in parallel we decide application workflows or usage scenarios and let's think of the application workflow for this uh story application workflow has an entry point task stroll all sensor network what is an entry point task you will see in a moment show all sensor networks this task requires querying to database device to find information about all networks and show those networks next given a customer has a list of the networks or user of our system he or she can click on one of the networks and we can show all sensors in a selected network or there is also must be a button to show a heat map for a selected network when we have to show a heat map and finally later going away from a display or sensors in the network customer or user can click some particular sensor and see the story of row temperature measurements for a given sensor those are usage scenarios we discuss at the moment we won't discuss writing data but only reading data because it's essential for us when we get to four cases find information about all networks order by name ascending it's query one then query two find hourly average temperatures for every sensor in a specified network for a given date range then find information about all sensors in a specified network and finally find row measurements for a particular sensor on a specified date order by timestamp descendant we have q1 q2 q3 q4 and now let's get back to this entry point task what is an entry point task you may be remember i've mentioned it before what workflows have the dependencies like your packages like your libraries like your applications as dependencies uh to some other libraries to some frameworks maybe workflows also has the dependencies take a look can i execute query 4 find row measurements for a particular sensor without executing any of the queries above query one two or three can i or can't what do you think as always also answering the youtube chat page cannot cannot no okay looks like you got it can't right uh in short in the simple scenario answer is no i cannot why because i simply don't know sensor id and sensor id is essential if i'm going to show data for a particular sensor i need to know this id you see if i don't execute any of the queries above i cannot execute it because i do not know sensor id and we just realize it but there is a dependency on which query q4 depends query 4 depends on q3 find information about all sensors in a specified network but question is can i execute you free stand-alone without no data i mean with no previously executed queries no again because i do not know what sensor network name and now we find out what q3 depends on q1 pipe information about the networks so that's why q1 is in our entry point task and now take a look at the application workflow diagram that is our application workflow diagram those are our data access patterns we defined it already but now we've dependencies if i want to show row temperature values for a sensor i need sensor id i get sensor id when i display all new sensors in a network but i cannot show all sensors in the network if i don't know network id or network name and we get to entry point and entry point is q1 show all sensor networks and that's ladies and gentlemen application workflow diagram and it's not less important than entity relationship diagram they both matter and they both are very important to us so we discussed uh the domain and i describe it by entity relationship diagram and now we discussed that application workflow as you write down as an application workflow diagram uh for their homework by the way it's optional but i do recommend you to sit and write down uh those diagrams uh just by uh paper and pen uh as an exercise for your brain it really helps you to set up your mind in this way but it's optional but you do can make a photo and sent to me i will be totally happy now we have to map those uh ideas together and first do we do thinking of those workshops workflows and thinking of these data we map them together and applying very first approach i just sit and start to write queries tables don't exist but i already writing select statements and for a query one it can be something like that connect name description region number sensors from networks where bucket equals all and this part of the statement select name description region from networks may sound very familiar to you right but bucket equal all is a little bit not clear i will explain it later and for the q2 show all sensors per network uh that's q2 which belongs to heat map we can go with selecting all the data required for our heat maps and um then based on the queries we bro i won't show q3 and q4 because they are very simple and you will see them in a moment on your own but we get to that next step of cassandra data modeling methodology which is logical data model and we write down logical data model in so known is the developer creator of the data modeling methodology and our colleague which we are very proud of by the way so when we start to being bring them together you see it's still the same workflow map you want q2 q3 q4 but now we as a part of chiba code diagram we see also the database tables we are going to use and one will be networks sensors by network temperatures by sensor and so on so we see one q1 we get networks q2 we get sensors by network because we know network name and q4 we get sensor measurements because we know sensor id from queue results of the q3 result and you can see table name so query name table name list of the fields and partition key or in this case sensor by network partition key clustering column or in this case we have even three clustering columns in different order per network or here partition key as you see uses familiar bucketing sensor and d together partition keys they build compound key and as a result we have compound partitions with bucketing and final step based on that will be to apply uh some optimizations and explanations yeah first of all let's take a look at the temperatures by sensor measurement it will be very easy sensor id is just type text or it may be uuid doesn't matter for us uh date the date type time stamp will be clustering column with timestamp and value is flawed that's quite simple then sensor by network network text partition key sensor text partition key latitude decimal longitude decimal and characteristics is a map text text so every sensor may have multiple different uh characteristics and one sensor may have i don't know some uh they may have different types of different sets of characteristics it's flexible and finally here we have name description region a number of sensors that is simple but what is the bucket here and why it's a clustering your partition key where did we get back take a look if i try to get uh [Music] networks without adding any bucketing i will have to do full cluster scan because if i don't have bucket for all my networks well then i will have to ask the full cluster scan all my sensor servers give me data give me data give me data that's not sound good then there is a practice of those buckets as i'm not going to have a lot of sensors as a lot of networks at least in the beginning of my project i create a bucket all or bucket default and put all my networks there as long as i have as every network is small just like description name number of sensors i can have a lot of them within same same partition and have no problems if at any point i will start to have millions of networks i will have to rethink my data model but at this moment put all networks in the single bucket is totally acceptable and finally that's what this bucket makes and now based on these physical data model we are doing very last step we just write down those physical data model in the in the sql statements so it's going to be very simple yes the dda statement for networks that's my network bucket partition key name clustering column description region number sensors here we go create table networks bucket text name text description text region text number sensors into primary bucket name and bucket will be the same for all the networks in the beginning it's totally fine statement for sensors by network network text sensor text logitech quantity decimal characteristic map text text primarily sensor by network network as a partition key so you see when you reach this physical data model you have nothing to do to put that into sql it's very easy good and now one last question and i give a microphone to stefan i want you to think the very last moment today before we go to practical steps and we go before we go to quiz imagine be together all of us were just hired by uh youtube and we have to design a data model for the comments because something very bad happened and you tuned youtube doesn't comments anymore and we have to decide for a new data model for youtube and i have very simple question let's take a look well uh i know i don't have to explain what is a youtube comment because it's a very simple case uh it's just a comment per video one video can have multiple comments from different answers from different outros right by the way thank you so much for warm feedback i was looking for a picture to explain the comment story and i was just got a wave of love right into uh to my heart it's just amazing how you guys commenting our videos thank you so much so and we are designing now please pay attention because it's a question and you will have to answer we have to decide for a data model for three particular use cases we have to show comments uh in a very simple scenario so the user opens a video basically we have to find comments related to this video using its identifier what's present first then user opens a video page uh do we have a video page id do we have a video id yes we suppose we do because the list of the videos was shown already like youtube suggestions for example right so workflow one five comments related to a target video by its id and we have two more use cases user opens his own profile or moderator opens some user profiles suspecting this user in some spam or i don't know whatever publishing bad comments uh so maybe user may must be suspended or something and uh it brings us to workflow too for the workflow one for those two use cases find comments related to target user using its identifier more stress and first for those use cases do we know target user id what how about our workflow dependencies we expect we do if user opens his own profile he must be registered already therefore id is known then moderator opens a user profile that usually means what he has got a report to some particular comment or maybe anyway if he got some user therefore id is known correct so we have workflow file comments related to target video find comments related to target user get more stress and first in first case we show all comments per video in second case we show all comments related to target user even if those who have written to different videos so query one must be looking something like find comments for a video of even though an id and second query will look like uh find comments posted for a user with a known id more stress and first now we are getting to the real question how many tables we will need to serve those requirements and to fulfill those two queries i need some tragic music at this moment right [Laughter] how many tables we will need to serve those requirements do we need to have more than one table do we have to apply the normalization prim okay partition key video any questions or is not enough that's one point yeah uh oh okay i see what was the misunderstanding uh video stable uh exists already how many how many tables with comments do we need let's see comments i will write it down and i will fix the slide usf wrote a very clear answer so yes the normalization is needed and considering video stable exist we will need two tables so if you answer a two counting comments per video comments per user or if you answer it free counting videos you are right and if you answer it for meaning videos comments comments per video comments per user which is also maybe right but for the comments point of view the minimum amount of tables we will need is two select all from comments by user by user id and select all from comments by video of a video id because don't forget you always have to specify explicitly known partition key and in case when we query by user we do not know video in the case we have a query by video we do not know users as long as youtube has more than one user and i expect that to be the case so the answer is we will need two tables and if that's what you needed if it's uh that's what you answer it you just gave me the right answer and you are amazing and you are the best you know what fabric oh sorry this is a big uh well you know what's that tell me it's now your case very good so i am i see youssef is leaving now so he will not attend the squeeze next time so we will try to fit better into the time next week but uh so that was very important example so sometimes you need two tables with the very same rows just so to speak arranged differently to support different queries that's a very typical pattern and well that's one of the important lessons let me know i'm sorry sorry uh before yousef leaves yes first of all thank you for answering and second of all ladies and gentlemen i see almost 150 people watching us now but we have only 60 likes that is not serious and no quiz happening no homework happening as long as we won't get higher number you stayed with us for two hours and mostly probably that's your second workshop so we do deserve a like on youtube you know what to do oh now the number is increasing a lot great that is something that is something already that's smart i know we are doing a good job okay so uh there's a question about the list of best practices for modeling well that's more or less what we have trying we are trying to cover today obviously we can just touch the surface but uh well maybe alex you can put the few links on the chat more in depth but now you know what ah sorry yeah first we have now more than 100 likes and that something what i really like thank you so much our team is very happy i mean you see two of us on the screen but there is like 10 people working on this boot camp so uh thanks to you from all of us and second point uh i believe here because we have more than 100 likes we can proceed and third thing regarding the links to data modeling and bad best practices and so on uh in the third and fourth weeks of this bootcamp you will learn at ds220 data modeling course at the academy next we gave you today was a quick overview we cannot think put all the cassandra data modeling into just two hours it's much bigger than that but we have a full free totally free totally open for you course at the academy.datastage.com and it's a very essential part of the preparations for the exam you get this course you uh will be ready to take the exam so you will get your links in the third and fourth weeks of the boot camp yeah we are ready to yes so let's uh move to the practice part because there is a a small part of a hands-on for you but to do that first i uh okay now it is already float goes it has gone past gone by but uh maybe i'll ask nightbot to paste again so there is a link in the chat but i better paste it again there is a link to the youtube repository where you would find more resources about today maybe i better switch to my screen so you can see it directly and there we go so this is um this is the repository for the boot camp you know that already if you were here last week now i am in the folder week 2 data modeling and again let's go it's an alarm going off um you can see here in this uh readme there is a brief uh recap of what we've been seeing you can download the slides you can so there are a few a few links but and there are also instructions about the homework and important announcement about the homework we are grading them and there is um there are detailed instructions on how to overcome a problem in using virtual machines that we've been made aware of and also some tricks to make everything work so please keep an eye on these homework instructions because they will be giving detailed updated instructions to make everything work but this is for the for the academy for the course part because homework for today will be the second part of the ds201 exercises okay now um you are so in this uh read me there are is there is a recap of the data models you ha we have been seeing so far but what's important for for today is uh i assume okay so i know many of you have been with us already last week so i will assume that you already have an astrodb account and but if you don't don't worry because there are instructions here to create yours but i think alex we are a bit short on time so maybe i can just go through i can go in demo mode and just show you what we should be doing so please refer to the readme for instructions those of you who were with us last week know what i'm showing now i am showing my um my astra astrodb interface that shows my database called workshops and in this database i will create a new keyspace which is a very quick operations operation er again or maybe a switch to smaller heads for us so you can see better so there it's this this small demo is also useful because it will pave the way for next week's because next week you will start building the application and it is a small to-do application that you will start from you will write from the start for that we might already go ahead and create the key space that will host this very small data model needed for that application so i just created a key space called to do's you see it's here and it's just created made available in a few seconds for me uh again we we invite you to go through the instructions and to get some more practice but now i'm just demoing it for lack of time so i have my tutus key space and i can go to the sql console that you know already probably i go to my sql console and get it ready so now if i do desk spaces tell me have all key spaces that are there you see there is this new to-do's that i just created okay so with that i'll go back to the in the readme because we start thinking of the data model the table needed for this to do application uh this is preliminary to next week's uh application so it's pay attention please it's a very simple data model compared to what you have been seeing so far with alex but still it requires some thinking and it is a good example of how to go about designing a table uh you will be creating a standard let's say a standard sample to do application that shows a list of to-do items for a given user and make it possible to tick them as done or leave them as not done yet so you will be able to add delete and edit individual items this will be per user so you will have your own user space to access your list of to-do's so basically that's it so it's a simple application and indeed the corresponding data model is very simple but still uh let's it offers some some thinking so um your any every to-do item will have a title and a boolean flag whether it's been completed or not and that's a given so title and completed are probably uh obviously going to be columns in this uh in this table containing the two items but that's not the end of it because every uh item probably will need a unique id to be able to distinguish them and to identify them for later deleting or editing so for sure we will need an item id something like a uuid that you've seen so far the the unique ide of almost guaranteed unicity that's not the end of it because we would like this application to be able to support several users at once each one with their own list of to-do items and that's a very good candidate for partitioning but let's say that every to-do item has a different it has a user id so my to-do items will have my own user id and alex's to-do items will have a different user id that is how many many users can use the same table and still get each one uh their own individual list of to-do items okay so that's more or less in this case that's how it goes as far as uh identifying entities and their attributes because there is a single entity with four attributes in this very simple case now let's think of the application workflow now maybe this is something you didn't appreciate enough but this is the screenshot of the main interface of the application and this is what it lets you do it lets you access and view all of your to-do items at once and that's simple but still is a good hint because it means that i have to support a single workflow basically which you can see here application access pattern one user wants to see all of their to-do items so i need to think of this as my only query and the query would be get all to do items for a given user which is identified by a user id that is basically very quick and easily translated into a proper sql statement so it will be select blah blah blah from to-do items where user id equal let's say john whatever right so this is the query i need to support when thinking of how to build the table uh other operations such as deleting a single to-do item or marking it as uh done or even just editing the title they are not so important when designing the table because they will be accessing a single row anyway whatever the exact way it is designed so let's this is the only important query when thinking of partitioning basically okay so this is a very simple quick example uh how do you get to the logical data model well again there are a series of steps very quickly we need title and completed when we want to get our to-do items back that's because the i the ui of the application wants them and that's one thing but if you the next step is to look at what is in this where clause if you look at the work close you realize that user id has to be part of the table for sure and it has also to be the partitioning because you see here i want to get all to do items for john with a single query so i have to partition by user id so that all to do items by john will be together in a single partition and i can do a single query very good uh obviously uniqueness has to be taken into account so i have to think of item id as part of the table otherwise i would be not able to guarantee uniqueness of the various entries and that's about it so item id we might use uuid but we choose to go and that's an anticipation of the physical data model we choose to go with a time uuid which is just a slightly different way of having a unique id which has the advantage of being time orderable so we decide that within the partition for a given user id we want to sort by item id ascending so we get the earlier items first why not and we are at the very simple case of chibotka diagram so these are the four call the four fields the four columns in the table and user id would be the partition key as we discussed item id will be the clustering column in ascending order the next step as you see as you have seen already would be to go to uh to make this into a physical data model well in this case there are not many optimizations to do just as it is just about assigning data types basically so let me skip this part you can read that in the readme but basically user id will be a text because we like to have it in clear text item id uh we decide it's a time uuid title is a text like walk the dog or whatever and complete it is a boolean and that's it so that's very quickly uh becoming a create table statement which i just want to run in the cql console here sorry i have to first use to do's in my sql console right i run the create table and the table has been created how can i be sure what desk tables to do items it's a linux way if you have no error output yes that means it's good yes desktable to do items and i will get back the full uh create table statement plus all of the settings which by default are attached to the table in uh in sql so this is uh all good and nice now uh i will just show you that this is a table that works but i will do that very quickly you see there are some sample uh insertions that one can run here just to to see that everything work works uh actually if you care to have a closer look at what what is done here you will basically do a a a typical operation that happens when you are designing an application which is you are trying out with cql what will be the future commands the future uh data access patterns that you will embed in your application using the in the code so now i'm i'm typing explicitly select splat from to do items where user ready equal john very good and this is basically this will be uh one of the very queries that my application will do and that you will see next week basically so this is how i get all to do items for john and just to check that this works and it is a compliant with the requirements of the application and with the partitioning i think with that and you are invited to do that so you have your table already there for next week uh i think with that i can close just one mention in section five of the readme there is uh it is spelled out in all the details what is the data model uh that you are required to approach and to try your luck with as part of the of the lab for next week so there is a particular uh pattern of query and dependency between queries and you are required to think about it and design a proper way to create the tables supporting this flow uh the google form will be available as soon as we uh close as we are over with this live so yeah at the moment it's still being kept closed to keep you focused on this but we will open it as soon as we are over with with today's life okay so i think that's it alex so we can jump back to [Music] your screen or directly to mandy maybe uh we go directly to minty there's no need to swear quiz time yeah yeah maybe i can make us become big again so quiz time be ready keep your uh keep your reflexes oiled because now every answer has to be not only correct but you have to answer fast okay great so maybe you can turn on the music and make the full screen yes absolutely if i know how to make full screen that should be just browser full screen on the right uh top side i know you are not a windows guy i'm not can you imagine the simplification of stefano he agrees to use windows to uh run these to host these workshops yes i'm very not familiar with windows version technical reasons maybe f11 thank you i was about to get to it so i made it thank you so i think you okay i'll show the joining windows a little more so please uh join us again on mentee yeah yeah i agree my windows is very strange every time i boot it it sinks to a different time zone for some reason but i i don't know why okay okay so let's start quiz time right okay so um let's give just i wait a second i see we have 122 people watching us now yeah but uh but i see numbers yeah it was i think a glitch of my refreshing uh whatever so we can start question number one mostly in the data modeling framework we start modeling with the conceptual data model followed by application workflow with the physical data model with the logical data model or copy pastings from stack overflow so what are or what is the first step or steps we need to approach the modeling cassandra let's see i love stack overflow but in this particular case much help yeah yeah so i see many of you gave the right answer that means alex did a great job and let's see and physical data modeling is the last step of the data modeling framework oh yeah so please was the fastest one great okay great job obviously still the beginning and let's move on second question second question denormalization means the same as schema-less or maybe it means that you can overwrite rows in a table or it means that the same piece of data goes to several tables or it is the same as in relational tables so denormalization means i remember at the beginning we had this question now let's see what changed and i see that most of you gave the right answer so yes the normalization means that you can not be afraid of duplicating data if this makes your application go fast let me phrase it this way that is fun enough very good let's see i guess many of the first positions gave the right answer and that's the case but who was the fastest i think antonio was the fastest and he jumps in third position so elise doesn't antonio but it's a close call with the other and let's go to the next question let's see if you paid attention but okay question number three answer fast to get more points what columns together define uniqueness of rows clustering columns or maybe primary key columns or maybe partition key columns all columns of the row or maybe the combination of partition key and clustering columns let's see now we are speaking about uniqueness in a table and time is up and let's see yeah there are two possible right answers that's because they are two ways of saying the same thing and that's the right answer i see most of you good enough gate gave the right answer and that means option two and option five are basically the same primary key is the partition key plus clustering exactly i hope to confuse some of you but you were too smart so that's fastest and jumps in first position millisecond that's amazing yes now question number four let's see a good rule for partitions i think that's a bit easy because we've been speaking a lot on that enable partitioning only when necessary or store together what you retrieve together or make them as big as possible or maybe make them as small as possible well i'm not sure about the right answer but if you make them as big as possible i will come for you as a okay about make them as small as possible that's not entirely wrong in a sense but you might exceed and make them so small that they will not support your queries think about getting all commands together if you make great you will have to you have to think not only on your rights but also on the reads and when you are doing grids you have to specify all the parts of a partition key so don't make them as small as possible that also makes no sense yeah and you will and you have a working query maybe sorry right and you cannot enable or disable partitioning than necessary partitioning is enabled by default and cannot be switched off in cassandra and once you choose a partitioning for the table it's forever so think carefully okay so let's see let's see okay lee's again fastest and jumps in first position great job please great job and let's go on question number five answer fast to get more point again rules for partitioning let's see each query should reach a single partition keep them below 100 megabytes each more or less evenly distribute a write load or avoid ever growing partitions let's see give an answer think about what we said and try your luck and time is up let's see ah very good an even distribution of answers because they are all correct hahaha i code perfect very good so they are all good answers indeed there is no big uh trouble if your query hits uh two or three partitions but in general of course we recommend to design your partitions and queries the way what each query will reach one uh partition it's it maximizes the efficiency hey and leaves as fast as the game you know how do you do that we we thought of confusing uh players with this question with all correct answers but i think our guys here have been paying too much attention for us so very good everyone and let's go question number six answer fast to get more points how do you run a join in cassandra the answer is oh you don't or with a join clause in cql or it's automatically done for you behind the scenes with the join table handled by cassandra itself or you need friends in high places let's see this is also something we discussed at length and the answer is you don't because there is no joint clause in cql and there is certainly kazan has no will to do that secretly without you knowing don't forget cassandra is non-relational database after all yes so there is no no joins no relations in the in the relational sense and the answer okay so lee's again he's the fastest and he maintains the first position i see some movements in second to fourth position and it's there's still time to scramble the leaderboard with the last two questions and let's please do you know we are hiring so clustering columns when querying you must specify all of them or you must specify all or none of them they support inequalities only or if you specify the first ones it's okay that's tough maybe yeah that's not a simple one we didn't discuss clustering columns in two big details so yeah so you oh the right answer is the last one oh my oh that's going you know what now i'm a bit scared yes to turn your agency on the leaderboard we will have a wipe so all must be specified is certainly not right because you might want to get the whole partition why not that's a supported valid query pattern so but i think many of you here in the lead in the top leaderboard gave the right answer and lis also maintains the position very good well done that was a hard question but you were able to withstand it last question it will decide everything answer fast to get more points if you have the same rows in two tables that means that there is still some optimization you can do or that is a typical outcome of a proper data model or it is something to be avoided absolutely or it means that one table is legacy maybe it's there by mistake and can be discarded garbage collected so let's see you seconds to go time's up and it is a common outcome of a proper data model think about the comments in the youtube clone comments by video comments by user that's absolutely right it is the same set of rows just arranged differently i believe i know this distribution and answers uh the story is there are some people who understand the benefits of the normalization but still didn't accept it by heart only by brain when you are small in time when you are in a rush your heart answers faster than your brain so do these two same roles in two different tables is a common outcome of the normalization yes and generalization is a common output a common outcome of a proper data model it doesn't mean you still can optimize the data model optimize for what there is no just optimizing yeah where is optimized for right or for reads uh so this answer is ruined and to be avoided at all costs not necessarily uh be discussing yeah denormalization and normalization the world the real life is not like star wars movie where you have amazing light side of the force and dark side of force is always bad real life is not like that and normalization is good as long as you keep it under control generalization is bad when it keeps you under control that is bad but as long as you keep it under control it's your friend okay there is a comment in the chat by adriano so same rose is different than same piece of rows yes that's right but even there might be some cases and there actually are some cases where you really have the same rows with the same columns so the same table with the same columns just a different partitioning and that's a a case that occurs so even the comments by video and comments by by what was that user they most likely have the very same rows columns and rows just uh differently uh partitioned for different access patterns uh okay right let's see the final result who is the winner that's interesting and [Music] second and third and now yeah sorry adriana but you're we are here to learn more than to win prizes but anyway there's next week right so yeah you still have two more weeks to win if i remember well i added a month here and yes so the the first second and third position please write an email with to gary harvey at datastax.com you see that in the youtube chat and please take a screenshot now with your phone or with your much with your pc of the winning screen on your menu so take a screenshot if you will oh sorry yep and get ready to send it to gary harvey to claim your prize that's right and what i wanted to say we do congratulate lis uh talib and arturo uh first three places is a great job in this greece and we do congratulate all the people on the leaderboard even if you didn't win the prize you still finish it in the top ten of actually many dozens of people almost i believe even more than 100 of people in the beginning at least and that is amazing like you did a good job and even if you are not on the leaderboard you have something to be really proud of you participate in our boot camp and that is the second week and every next week you get better and better joining our learnery like january but for learning and that means what in the end you will get a real price knowledge which makes you better engineer better software developer or whatever your job is and that's what really matters thank you for coming yes very wise words now with that uh i will go further with the mentee because we have a quick survey that i will leave open we would like to get some feedback some free form of feedback and please if you have something to tell us that's the place but in the meantime while this is working i will go back to alex your screen for the last slide okay great that's good hey we have some warm feedback yes yes thank you okay so uh penalizing these things uh first winners first second third place uh send your screenshot and send a message to gary.harvey datastax include a screenshot of your main team and congrats then homework homework is available on exclamation mark homework homework you have to uh completely it's all explained on github you have to complete ds201 course uh second part because first part we did last week and if you miss it the first week you are going to have quite some time learning but it's for good cassandra is on high demand and this demand will only grow so and build a data model with cassandra as all explain it on github now next thing next week we will work with application code and we will build a full stack application with apache cassandra uh using java or python or javascript that's for you to decide we support multiple languages as you see and if you are not so good in any of them don't worry because you can just use code we give and you will define already so even if you are a complete beginner you still can make it join our discord community which is getting to the magic number of 20 000 discord participants it's a great discord server and you will have very experienced developers there asking and answering questions so jump into discord and
