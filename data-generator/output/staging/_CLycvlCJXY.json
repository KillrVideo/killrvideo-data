you are um welcome to this edition of slaying kubernetes complexity from a developer perspective my name is raghavan srinivas and with me I have Edward iron L Edward can you say something just to make sure that we have exactly two voices and no more absolutely absolutely welcome everyone can someone at least put a uh thumbs up in the chat if you're hearing two voices and no more than two please sounds good okay so we are good to go um this is a two-hour Workshop uh where you're gonna be learning by doing uh it's not just like at another virtual webinar uh so you know get ready uh for those of you who have done this before you know the drill we're gonna use gitpart to essentially um you know get your credentials imported and use that you know to actually go through the workshop and again you know that you know it's all available the instructions are self-explanatory uh it's all available on GitHub and um you know you can follow along or if you you know for whatever reason you're falling behind uh no worries because these are going to be available we're going to be here to help you as much as we can um but let's get started so this is the agenda for today we're going to do a quick intro of uh the workshop of ourselves and so on uh then a quick intro of no SQL um then um you know we'll look at Cassandra Astra and how easy it is to be able to connect your application and to be able to save your data there right and then of course we're going to look at quarkus which is our kind of reactive platform uh based on Java makes it very easy to be able to kind of do hot reloading and things like that that you know a traditional Java developer was always longing for and you know we're not going to emphasize too much in this Workshop because this Workshop is really more about containerization which is the next part which is how you build a lot of microservices so you know kind of the routine things you're going to do test your application uh push it to the registry from their stand up your application uh you know basically we get your secrets you know and and make it available for the application all of that you know the traditional inner loop uh that you know was is still a you know pretty complex from a developer perspective we'll see how easy it is it's an opinionated implementation but it kind of gives you an idea of how quickly you can do things and I'll stress that as we go along obviously the live coding is the part where you're going to do a lot of the coding we're going to set up the instance and then there are a few things that you need to do before you can get started on the containerization part and then eventually you're going to deploy to lens um you know which is the nice thing about lens is I don't need to worry about Cube cuddle at all okay and for those of you are using kubernetes before you know kubernetes is one I mean uh Cube color is a thing that a lot of people love to hate right so so we'll talk about that then I'll follow it up with resources uh but before we get any further let me introduce myself my name is raghavan shrinivas I just go by Rags for whatever reason people in the world have a tough time pronouncing my name so Rags is the easiest way Rags not a richest easiest way to remember me uh I come from the Java side of the world and I think you know um kubernetes is one of those things which has a lot of commonality in Java I am a big fan of distributed systems I love to teach and communicate and that's why I like these workshops because even with these workshops I learn a lot you know even teaching the workshops I learn a lot um you know I know that our audience is never hesitant to chat so feel free to chat let me know is something that I got wrong or something that can be done better improved and so on and so forth because really this is about kind of your Workshop right um so I'm a big I'm passionate about Dana Loop which is really what I care about things that we do traditionally 50 times during the day you know like again testing the application containerizing it and and all that and how can we improve that and and you will see at least some flavor of that today with that said I'm really honored to have a guest speaker today um with that I would like to introduce Edward I know um hopefully I'm saying this right and Edward go ahead yes yes yes rugs thank you so much yeah I'm originally from Germany but I'm very much an American here in San Francisco California hello everyone welcome to today's Workshop couldn't be more excited to be here with each and every single one of you and even with rogs today I'm a developer Advocate at morantis specifically on team lens lens is a kubernetes IDE that we built primarily to solve the complexity of kubernetes and this is something that rocks touched on where we're going to be removing the need to work with Cube CTL if you're a developer through lens which is something that's quite unique um a little bit about myself I am a marketer at heart but also very much a developer switched over to that many years ago now and I'm very much focused also on building community so we'll get to the point of where lens is today in just a bit but we've been able to scale this open source project from zero users to roughly 800 active users so it's been an incredible journey couldn't be more excited to be here with each and every single one of you and I look forward to the in-depth presentation as well as Hands-On Workshop thank you um I think I lost your audio I don't know if anybody else can you yeah now I can hear you yeah um it's just a fraction of time there um we have an entire team behind us and there is no way we can do these workshops you know without this entire Team all of them or some of them are actually in the chat and kind of trying to help out um I know there was a question from Sid and I want to get it out of the way right away is this session useful in terms of data science using python I would say not at all so so I I would let you make the call said if you want to hang on um and and you know kind of learn something new uh or you just want to leave you know perfectly fine I'm a teacher at heart when people walk out of the classroom I don't take it personally okay so that's fine and again feel free to chat and let's move on so for those of you who attended our workshops before you know that one part of our Workshop is minty and I'd advise you to whip out your cell phones right because cell phones is probably the easiest way to do this and I'll I'll give you a uh a URL and a code that you can use uh shortly okay so with that said let me go to minty all right mentee here we come so let me present and we are good to go let's see we are not yet good to go okay this is strange but I think we can manage with this usually the presentation mode is a little different but let me see if we can bring that back to that all right let's do the present again and see if it works okay not too much about them all right so so here's the mentee and the code 61104421 and Edward you're also welcome to try it out if you want just whip up your cell phone and try this out okay and the first question we ask every you know and and this is really exciting for me every time um oh yeah having a little bit of issues here but let me see what's going on here okay let's do it again all right so people joining the quiz let's go with the next where in the world are you from just click the closest place that you you know again the code is on the top six one one zero four four two one if you want to use that or you can just um no actually you can't so you know six one one zero four four two one I'll also put this in the chat let's see I have only three people joined yet so let's hope for at least about 20 people maybe at least 10 so again minty.com and use the code 61104421 all right I see some people coming in you can try it from your browser too but cell phone is probably the easiest and I see people coming in from USA India somebody from Indonesia that's cool a couple of people from India three from India uh yeah yeah welcome everyone welcome to see this darts pop-up is just amazing right you know so I don't see you Edward from San Francisco maybe you should put a dart for San Francisco all right um all right eight I'm gonna wait till ten and then you can move on all right so one thing I would advise you to do is kind of keep this going because at the very end we're gonna have a quiz uh and and again the best way to answer the quiz is through your mobile phone again you can do it through the browser but but there is usually a time delay and we have seen that you know whenever we have an audience um usually um you know there are there are really some fast people you know I've tried to answer myself and and you know typically it takes and I'm not really fast so so you know get yourself all Advantage you can uh by using the cell phone all right all right so the link is www.mentee.com okay it's right here and let's move on so what is your experience level with Cassandra are you a beginner or experienced developer or administrator are you like a nosql guru um use Cassandra and prediction okay that's good there's one one person who is an experienced developer or administrator gotta watch out uh most people two are beginners all right kind of you know interesting to see all this right um let's see others answer too oh no SQL Guru we have a different audience today usually we find a lot of beginners but but let's see let's give it some more time um again you know to be able to answer these questions you go to minty.com and use the code six one one zero four four two one somebody is using cage Center and production interesting if you don't mind you know if you put your company's name in chat that'll be that'll be great and the reason why I put Kate Sandra and really we are not going to cover this in in today's uh Workshop but the reason why I put it in was because of the kubernetes connection and we'll talk about all this uh we have a different kind of audience today so maybe we can skip on the uh early part uh and and kind of jump straight to containerization right um okay all right next question what is your kubernetes experience I dream in Cube I hope not I use Cube cuddle a lot but don't really like it like I said you know we love to hate some tools um one person is new to kubernetes development I use Cube cuddle sparingly uh anybody using lens you know if you want to you put that in I have a later question for whether you're going to use I mean whether you use lens or not but um this should give us an idea okay use Cube Carlos sparingly nobody dreaming in Cube I really expect but but you never know right uh most people are new to kubernetes development which is fine and and that's exactly what we thought you know the audience is going to be um somebody who's used Cube cuddle sparingly or somebody who's new to cube kubernetes development and probably never used Cube cuddle right so all right that gives us an idea so I think we are in the right um this thing uh caucus experience oh this something went wrong there oh okay I am not a Java developer I am a Java developer but never used quarkus um let's see let's keep going let's see how many it's pretty pretty even now right a lot of people never use quarkus okay which is kind of what we expected uh and not a Java developer no problem you will still learn a lot uh today okay uh you know we show a app which was built in Java uh but but really um you know it's it's a it's a simple app very easy to understand and and you know as long as you have some development experience or are really an interest to learn you know I think I think it should be all right okay two more questions and we should be done and we'll get get into if you use kubernetes do you use lens have you heard of lens do you use it are people just wondering what is lens let's give it a moment not really kubernetes developer yeah understood yeah understood uh I don't use lens but I'm a kubernetes developer that's kind of the implication there right um for that one person who is not using lens you know if you want to put him are two people um you want to put in chat what tool you use uh oh there's one person who's using lens and I feel like that's going to be Edward or maybe not okay it was not me so that's exciting people that's even more interesting okay that's cool okay uh kind of what we expected right you know we thought there may be some people who are using lens uh and for for those people um you know we only show the deployment on lens but there are other parts of the inner loop that you can definitely benefit from okay all right moving on last question is this your um I should have said First Data Stacks there's Workshop My apologies uh is this your first data Stacks Workshop yes quite a few we know we get some regulars uh I don't know if they are on the on the workshop but you know fifth or more Workshop yeah that's that's kind of um you know somebody that we know last count of how many workshops I attended welcome welcome welcome welcome wow okay we have some fans for sure um but those of you who are here the first time um there is only one um really complex step I should say I mean it's really not that complex but but once you get past that you know once you import your credentials into gitpart and you'll see what that means in a second uh or you know once we get there after that it's pretty straightforward um you know the app we're gonna do is you know we're going to open up gitpart it's a visual IDE uh we're gonna build the communities manifest we're going to take the kubernetes Manifest um you use the secrets and and actually kind of deploy it on lens or deploy it using lens onto your lens desktop so um so those of you who are here for the first time you know don't be intimidated you know it's it's going to be pretty easy to kind of work through this all right so the quizzes later we will worry about that later okay but let's go back to the presentation okay and go to the next all right so here in the mighty part that's done there are other resources that are available GitHub gitpart um our Astra DBA as a service which we're going to use today um and and I think we're going to touch on all of these today okay so so you know a lot of resources for you to help um so this quiz and mentee we already did that so let's move on the objective for today is to create an inner inner loop um particularly from a developer perspective you know we're going to see the workflow um and so on uh we're going to show here tools that help a community's developer particularly Master the inner loop right um so again it's a little bit opinionated implementation but it definitely helps from the perspective of uh kind of conquering slaying the complexity as we called it of the inner loop um and you know it really eliminates the need for developers mastering Cube credible and we're going to build an application which kind of looks like this right you know is to build a to-do app where you can put in your to-do's and and I actually use it myself you know to put in my to-do's okay so with that said that's a great segue into what is Lance Edward on to you perfect thank you so much um frogs I imagine you are sharing the screen yes I am yeah perfect I can see it excellent well welcome everyone um what is lens lens is a kubernetes platform that was built to allow you to achieve full situational awareness of everything that's happening within the desktop application and everything that's actually happening within your kubernetes clusters from the resources to the deployments to the helm charts that you want to deploy and so forth the neat thing behind the lens is we've actually scaled this open source project significantly so as of today these numbers are somewhat outdated as you can see the stats have not been updated for some time but as of today we have over 800 000 active users leveraging lens on a day-to-day basis excuse me over 1 million clusters added close to 20 000 GitHub star gazes which we're very very excited for and it's been installed on over 4 million machines next slide rods sorry give me a second yes perfect thank you so lens is all you need to really take control of kubernetes it's a standalone desktop application it's an electron app with an MIT license that allows you to achieve full situational awareness of everything that's happening within your kubernetes clusters now the neat thing behind lens is it works with any kubernetes distro regardless of the distro as long as it's as is it's a certified distro you also have the ability to managed multiple kubernetes clusters and we'll be touching that um when we do the demo of lens itself you can navigate from a gke cluster to a k0s cluster to a mini Cube cluster and so forth what's also nice about it is we're always respecting the role-based access control from your cubeconfig file so just because somebody may have access to your cubeconfig file does not mean they can actually add it to lens and begin making configuration changes achieve for situational awareness of everything that's happening within the cluster so there's various different security features and permissions that we've implemented to ensure that the person that's working with that cubeconfig file is respecting the role-based access control from that cubeconfig file next slide rocks yes perfect so this is a slide we love to throw up where we've actually gone ahead and interviewed many of our users um roughly 500 users and we've come to the understanding that anybody working with kubernetes is going to find significant value from lens at least this is something that we've understood from our users so one interesting stat is lens helps kubernetes developers learn kubernetes almost twice as fast so at a 95 increase we also learned that lens is significantly reducing the amount of tools that a developer leverages on their desktop machine so lens has a CLI built in and has a terminal you can deploy resources you can achieve full situational awareness you can access multiple kubernetes clusters and so forth so really what we're doing is reducing your toolkit from four to one and my favorite stat here is we've identified that we actually increase productivity for anybody working with kubernetes by roughly 20 meaning if you work with kubernetes Monday through Friday Friday you are going to gain the entire day back where you don't actually need to work uh now that's my own personal opinion but we have actually Quantified this data through our users through various different surveys where we've seen that on average you're going to save roughly two hours a day when leveraging lens which is going to give you a full working day back into your portfolio next slide please good perfect so where does lens fit within that development life cycle of a kubernetes developer well if we think about what a developer has to do on a day-to-day basis they're going to have to write some proprietary code leveraging vs code or whatever um tool you'd like to leverage you're going to need to leverage Docker potentially get command lines and so forth so those terminals those tools and then of course you're going to need some form of cicd pipeline to actually be able to push that software the application that you build on top of your kubernetes environment itself so where does lens come in for a developer lens actually comes in at the end of the development loop it's going to allow you to deploy view what that deployment looks like on top of your environment whether it's production proof of concept development and so forth you're going to be able to test that deployment on top of your kubernetes cluster and it allows you to actually access real-time pod logs to help you troubleshoot to identify why that particular deployment may not be running successfully on top of your environment and as mentioned it works with any certified kubernetes distro regardless of the distro as long as it is certified next slide Rod yeah um I know there is a question on chat side ID is asking how can I um how to add a cluster in lens and I'm sure you're going to get to it later right so so we'll we'll keep it for later absolutely absolutely we will touch on that um just once we get into the demo itself so from here we can navigate to the yep you're on the correct slide excellent so lens isn't just for kubernetes developers it's very much for the operational folk as well anybody working with kubernetes so from um site reliability Engineers cluster administrators they're going to actually leverage lens in the earlier stage of their workflow so if I'm a kubernetes SRE I may have five production clusters within my environments I want to take a look at the health and the status of those clusters maybe as soon as I wake up every couple of hours I want to review the real-time events of those clusters we're going to want to take a look at our deployments here as well is there a drop in life cycle management did a pod fail did a pod succeed is it currently running and of course if they need to they'll also be able to troubleshoot in real time so we touched on developers how Lens comes in towards the end of their workflow for operators and site reliability Engineers it's going to come in at the beginning of their workflow to really understand the overall health of their clusters and be able to manage multiple kubernetes clusters so from here rocks will go to two slides so slide 18 will skip the features at a glance slide and take a look at some of the features from a high level of what we have within lens and then once we get to the demo we're actually Deep dive into these features themselves so the first feature that we're taking a look at is the unified catalog and the unified catalog should be thought of as almost a place where you can have multiple resources to allow you to work a little bit more quickly specifically what I mean by that is in your catalog you can have various different kubernetes clusters you can have various different web links to access documentation you can have different automations within your catalog as well and we think of this as a unified location within lens that's going to allow you to create specific workflows when working with kubernetes so if I'm a kubernetes developer maybe new to kubernetes I can have my cluster there I can have significant documentation that's going to allow me to perform whatever action I would like to perform all in real time so you can create this workflow that you're very much interested in to be more productive and efficient it's going to allow Ed resources in real time quit my um slack as well as my mail because I'm getting pinged and giving notifications so I apologize for that frogs next slide yeah and let me explain a little bit because your audio broke up a little but uh but that's fine go ahead so you want to see everything in right context real time slide yes that's fine yes perfect so here what lens allows us to do is we leverage Prometheus whether you have your own Prometheus or will actually install it directly on your cluster and it's going to allow you to actually achieve that full situational awareness what I just mentioned so you'll see your metrics your CPU your network your disks your capacity of the cluster the deployment metrics as well all in real time so you're going to be able to achieve and I keep using this phrase that full situational awareness of everything that's happening within your kubernetes cluster and the resources and deployments within next slide rocks excellent we also have one of my favorite features a smart terminal which is going to come bundled with Cube CTL and Helm clis to allow you to manage and deploy and adjust configure things within your kubernetes environment the neat thing by about the smart terminals when I switch from my k0 OS cluster to my marantis kubernetes engine cluster the smart terminal is going to automatically sync to the correct version of the cube CTL that is associated to that cluster and that's going to allow me to always work in the correct context when working with that kubernetes cluster itself so I can go from cluster to Cluster while always being insured that I'm in the correct context of that cluster this is significantly going to reduce user error when working with multiple kubernetes clusters yeah I like the Cube part of the fact that you have to use Cube cuddle if you um you know if you're really really stuck or something like that right um so so yeah I think it's cool and the fact that it keeps in sync is tremendous yeah absolutely next slide please 22. cool so another very interesting feature within lens is the ability to identify and deploy Health charts directly to your environment through the click of a button so you can explore thousands of different repositories thousands of different Helm charts and actually deploy these Helm charts to your environment through a click of a button so it's really packaged for you you click install it'll deploy it'll deploy all of the necessary resources um for that particular Helm chart directly into your kubernetes cluster and we'll take a look at this feature as well during the demo next slide please perfect another thing that I want to touch on here is extensions and this actually just expands the capabilities of lens much more than it being a kubernetes IDE or let's say an observability tool or a configuration changing tools to your kubernetes environment really what this allows us to do is work with organizations like data Stacks work like organ organizations like sneak and develop extensions or plugins that is going to enhance the feature set of lens and leverage other Cloud native Technologies within the space to give our users more features so I can give an example here Aqua security has built an extension on top of lens that actually allows you to scan containers and the images within your environment all in real time to identify vulnerabilities within your environment we also have other extensions for morantis container Cloud that's going to actually allow you to connect your kubernetes platform and environment to lens in a second without actually having to add a cubeconfig file add various other extensions that really enhance the capabilities of lens for our users so we like to think of this in two ways one we're helping out our users access more awesome Cloud native Technologies and two we're really helping those Cloud native Technologies access thousands of users right as mentioned we have over 800 000 users so it's a win-win both for our partner organizations as well as our users and that is something that's so near and dear to my heart when we've tried to build a community next slide yes so we're going to talk about two cool features here as well and I just want to mention that we are just doing a high level of all the features within lens on these slides we'll do it much more of a deep dive later today but another fantastic feature within lens is called lens teamwork and lens teamwork allows cluster administrators to create a collaborative space where they can share a kubernetes cluster without exposing the cubeconfig file to a team of individuals so let me give an example here to really set the stage I have a team of developers that may need to access a namespace with some micro services within that namespace I can actually share access to that kubernetes cluster through lens teamwork without ever exposing the cubeconfig file to that particular developer so really what I would do is I have my five developers that need to access that namespace I can send them a link that link is going to open up this collaborative space within lens they'll have access to that cluster and we can create granular permissions on top of that to ensure that they're working within the correct namespace that we have selected another example here is you have a support team that needs to access something within the kubernetes cluster instead of giving them access to the cubeconfig file which we all know has tons of security concerns tons of security requirements to ensure you are working in the proper governance instead we can just shoot them a link they'll never have access to the cubeconfig file and we can grant and revoke access to that colleague to that team in a matter of seconds so this is a very very cool feature where I can have rocks actually access my mini Cube cluster that's running locally on my machine and makes configuration changes view my deployments um edit the pause or so forth so super super cool feature here where we're eliminating the need of developers having to Wrangle one with Cube CTL and cubeconfig files next slide rocks LDK LDK yes so today we'll be taking a look at Lens desktop kubernetes it's a local optimized development environment that you can deploy with one click of a button directly in lens it comes with Docker CLI built in allowing you to build images directly in lens as well which is a new exciting feature and it also again allows anybody getting started with kubernetes to access this optimized development environment without the need to Wrangle with Cube CTL start a mini Cube cluster leverage Docker desktop and so forth so really what we're trying to give our users here is one for the experienced developers and optimized environment for the development needs and for the people just getting started with kubernetes we're able to give them a kubernetes cluster for free um immediately through the click of a button there's some awesome things that are also happening within LDK for example the intelligent auto shutdown so lens is able to detect whether or not this cluster is being used and if we determine that it's not being used we'll actually be able to pause that cluster for you to really ensure that your laptop or your machine is not going crazy lastly I want to mention that lbk is based on a kubernetes distro called k0s which is open source and certified and is also built by team lens and marantis so you can deploy that cluster on bare metal in the public Cloud wherever you really want to deploy it but lens is leveraging k0s for our feature LDK next slide please excellent we just wanted to share some resources for everybody here with us today so where you can download lens it's K8 lens dot Dev here is actually our website it's free to download and to get started so you click download it'll download this electron app on your machine and you can get started and then of course we thought it was very important to also include a getting started guide with lens um that is super straightforward very easy to get started and so forth but we will be touching on all of these features in the demo later today and with that frogs I would love to hand it back over to you and thank you again for pushing us through each and every single slide I know it's probably not so fun when I mention next slide but that was the easiest for me so thank you annuities um all right just give me one second before I switch to the right green okay and again let me know if there are more than two voices sometimes I've had the music running for a while but hopefully it's it's all good now and and Edward you can go and mute if you want for a little bit um you know get some uh water or whatever that case may be right and uh we will be I know that all of you are itching to kind of get your hands um you know uh Hands-On right uh so we're going to do that in in just a little bit okay so just for a quick introduction of nosql um nothing really oh let me see did I get the same okay I have too many things working here okay so so basically it was really a name that was supposed to be a little catchy something that will you know catch on really yeah you know and that was the hashtag that was uh invented uh sometime in 2009 so it's not really something new uh it's been around for a while and like I described uh you know Cassandra uh it was there even before the cloud was there but it shares a lot of properties uh give me one second on this because I think I made a mistake here let me put this back to the right and now I'm back okay so basically uh what it um you know it was there even before Cloud but actually shares a lot of properties that kind of complement the cloud you know there are certain things like for example High availability and all that which is automatically built in um you know being able to distribute your data across multiple nodes all of that happens automatically for you you don't have to worry about any of those uh but really what nosql is is something other than your traditional relational database that you're used to right because with relational database you can scale up up up and up but at some point it's going to fall down right because you know it's just too big with a nosql database typically what you do is you distribute it across commodity hardware and that way you're able to handle it so you will see today how it's a good match with kubernetes because kubernetes also a lot of those things are based on that okay all right so again like I said you know the idea is that you distribute the data across multiple partitions and I don't need to worry about anything my over simplified view of what a nosql database is it's a distributed hash table I don't need to worry about how the data is distributed I don't need to worry about resilience of data because there are multiple copies of that you know usually three copies but sometimes more than that and so on but we asked but as we all know in software nothing comes for free there is something called as cap theorem which talks about three properties consistency availability and partition tolerance okay so consistent and availability kind of you know it's kind of intuitive you know it's kind of what you think it is right but partition tolerance is basically being able to work even when there is a partition in your um in your system for whatever reason and when everything is working fine you're no problem hunky-dory nothing is up problem but when a failure happens which is typical in distributed systems right you have to sacrifice one property you can have only two pick two right and usually partition tolerance is something that nobody wants to sacrifice no no SQL because you know the data looks so inconsistent that even my grandmother can figure that out right um so what generally you see is either a CP system or an AP system okay and with that said Cassandra is an API system and that's all I want to say about that but let's move on to what exactly it means it's no single point of failure it really scales for re writes and reads and one of the cool things about this has been described by some of the users of Cassandra is the linear scalability part it you know you you put you double the nodes the performance doubles you double it again it goes up you go by eight times it'll it's just linear and it's very hard to achieve that in a distributed system believe it or not because you know at some point it becomes asymptotic meaning you know there is really no gain even if you add notes but on the other hand with Cassandra because of its Simplicity it does a pretty good job at linear scaling okay uh one thing we we have a thing in data Stacks is don't let you know don't let your friends Shard sharding is hard okay so let the platform take care of it and that's why you know we we use nosql uh some kind of platform um you know just just let the platform worry about it so a lot of these distinctions between this AP and CP systems and all that that I was talking to you about uh is actually kind of blurring a little bit right because you can make a Cassandra database uh you know like eventually I mean you can make it strongly consistent from eventually consistent eventually consistent is when you know let's say I'm I'm working on leaderboard and for eight seconds or 8.2 seconds or whatever the case may be I am not on top of the leaderboard even though I am supposed to be right which is probably okay in most scenarios and actually even in kind of where you require asset properties like atomicity consistency isolation durability it's probably okay um so but if you really want strong consistency and what that means is you're going to read the last one that you wrote uh you can do that as well the only problem is again remember the cap theorem uh only two of the three is going to be present right partition tolerance and consistency now I'm going to loosen the availability part of it right so but that's the way it works okay some huge logos here and the idea again is not to kind of talk about um I mean this is really not meant to be a marketing slide but the idea again is these logos are these companies are using this because of the linear scalability part of it data is globally distributed we have something called as a astrodb service that you're going to be using today it's database as a service it's serverless it's not a scalable I don't need to do anything I just hit a button I put in my uh um you know email you know in fact you can use your GitHub handle and you will get a 25 dollars per month credit which actually is is significant enough to run some fairly heavy production workloads which is kind of cool right no credit card required which is kind of cool again uh we have a number of different apis especially from a developer perspective and I know that there are a lot of developers out here uh there are a number of different apis that are that are actually supported uh primarily graphql rest jrpc and so on and again from a microservices from a kubernetes point of view um grpc is kind of cool uh all of these are unified in this Target and like I said before you get it 25 per month credit uh this slide is actually not really required today but I guess it's required because you know I'm talking to a kubernetes audience we're not going to go into Kate standard cluster but essentially what Kate Sandra is is its kubernetes or Cassandra running on kubernetes okay I think it's a pretty cool play in the works so at this point what I wanted to do is create the astrodb instance okay to do that pretty straightforward okay I'm going to go into my GitHub repository okay so let's see this is my GitHub repo okay and I'm just gonna make this full screen just so that just easier right and follow along right you know it has everything in there how do I containerize caucus and Cassandra and I'm just going to walk through this okay what are the objective of the workshop what are the materials available so if you click on slide deck you'll get the slide deck and so on and this is the different learning paths what I recommend today you do is just do the containers and then Loop part because if you do slide exercises steps one to ten it's probably going to take you a while okay so so what I would suggest you do is verify the connection and then skip steps seven eight and nine and just go straight to ten which is containerization part okay um so how do I create the astrodb instance just click on this asteroid at datastacks.com okay and you will be dropped into um you know to the link so let me put in the link here you can say either GitHub okay r I can do Astra as well and hopefully it should give you the link as well okay so I'm not going to show you all that I'm already um in the uh in the Astra DB console right so all that I need to do is put my username and password and sign in okay Simon and you'll see all the databases running and so on and so forth okay and I already have something called as a database workshops so what what is suggested here is to be able to create something called as a workshops database okay so again just follow the steps you know it talks about start free now you know and put the database name as workshops and the key space name is to-do list some people ask what is the what is you know so uh cool about or what is what is the key space you know basically that's the question and really what a key space is is a logical grouping of tables and you'll see that today um you know because what in fact we're going to use only one table which has all the turo items but just in case you are having more tables for a particular app you can kind of put them in one key space and so on so you create the database provide the uh the name for the workshop as workshops I'm named for the databases workshops and the name for the key space is to-do list okay so I'll wait for you guys to kind of create this and even if it's an appending State you know you really want to change you want to wait for the status to change to active but even if it takes if it gets into pending it's fine um just uh you know putting a a thumbs up in the chat once you're done okay once it's ready okay if you already have a database uh with the database name workshops all that you need to do is create a new keyspace name called to-do list if you already have a key space name to do list I don't know why you're in the workshop I'm just kidding um you don't really have to do this uh you know again okay all right we'll get to the create Astra token part and all that in a second but let me see some thumbs up of people who are able to um create the database this is typically what we do we we kind of you know have a frequent sync to make sure that you know none of you are running into major issues uh what you're going to do is you're going to pick the region Google regions are available for free um if you want a particular region or a particular cloud provider you know usually Google cloud is available for free but you know and pick any region it really doesn't matter uh you know for this Workshop typically you would you would pick something that's close to where you are or close to where most of your users are and and once you've created the database let me know so that we can proceed and let us know if you are having issues um you know creating the database all right let's give it a couple of minutes anybody being able to create the database and let me get some coffee so that I've been talking a lot so let's take a quick pause to figure out if anybody is having issues creating the database anybody created the database yet or not yet if you have if you're running into issues again you know don't um just follow this GitHub link okay I'll put that in again in the chat okay and you should have all the instructions in pretty details so you create the astrodb instance okay provide the database name as workshops and keyspace name is to-do list okay I will stop talking for a little bit so that I'll let you guys you know nothing more irritating than somebody talking on your back when you're trying to do some work right so so hopefully I'll get at least one thumbs up before I proceed but again you know if you're falling behind don't worry about it you know you can always catch up I don't see any thumbs up yet which is a little concerning but but hopefully you guys are busy uh creating it or you've already created it but if you're having troubles let us know yeah Peter I do deserve a break for water all set done creating DB Abdul Nasir thank you for giving the thumbs up all right so let's proceed because we have a lot of material to cover I mean I think we're doing all right because you know usually by this point I'm OnePlus over in but uh I think we're doing okay today all right let me adjust the uh give me one second all right all right for some reason I'm not able to do that but I'll try later okay I'm not sure what's going on okay it's not too bad I guess but we'll keep going okay so we created the first ASP I mean the aster DB instance we named the um databases workshops and the key space is to-do list you know you can use different names but you know you'll have to make some slight changes to your program okay so let's let's see okay moving on let's look at Quakers because that's the platform that we're going to be using today why quarkus why not another platform you know because obviously kubernetes development you can do it in Python you can do it in whatever language you want right um but this is just again a sample an opinionated implementation like I said before and Quakers is really cool because you will see some features today that make it very easy to push the you know dockerized image to con uh to a registry and really don't even have to do all that you can just stand it up and it will do everything for you it's going to build the docker image it's going to create a kubernetes kubernetes manifest it's going to push it to the registry and it's going to stand up again very cool from a inner loop perspective because I don't need to worry about anything um you know um like having to go through all of the steps because I've done this many times and sometimes I forget one thing and that's kept me you know like other awake for like two hours trying to figure out where the hell did I get it wrong right so so those are kind of the things that you don't need to worry it's really designed for a cloud native kind of environment really about microservices which is why it has some really cool support for kubernetes and you will see that all today in the workshop okay uh what are the typical Java framework do it does a lot of things at runtime unfortunately okay or fortunately because that was the intention because behind Java is to because you want to provide a platform agnostic manner you want to do as minimal as possible at build time but do as much as possible at runtime so that you know it's it's able to work with different platforms but turn it around and what quarkus does is it's you know it takes all the you know the build time um or or takes the penalty at build time and then makes the runtime uh really short so what is the idea behind this you know if I'm starting up my app in a container I want it to start like that right and you can do that because what you do is you're going to take a penalty for building it um you know for doing it at build time rather than doing it at runtime and today we have an example and I would strongly urge you guys to try that out where you're gonna build a native image using what is referred to as a growl VM the growl VM and all that is automatically installed for you when you bring up git power and I'll talk that I'll talk about that in a second um even though it's not part of containerization technically I mean you can you can build a native image and actually you can you can containerize that native image also which we have which we don't go through this in Workshop uh but but you know if you want you can try that as well so again the idea is that you know it enables native compilation you need something called as the growl VM you know to make this happen and we have like I said you know installed it already and all that you need to do is um you know use Maven and that's the cool thing about quarkus is that you know it doesn't significantly change the way in which you do development it's still exactly the same way but it provides a lot of cool features like hot reloading debugging and so on and so forth which you will see again you know if you're interested and that's the cool thing it's just Java after all you know you just use Maven just like you did before you just use IntelliJ like you did before if you can use Eclipse ID if like you did before or you can use just via dbx if you're you know if that's exactly what you want but the whole idea behind this is about inner loop and developer productivity and you will see this yourself so I'm not gonna you know really talk too much about this because seeing are doing is believing right so we'll see that um I don't want to spend too much time on this but again you know you can do Native Java so now the last part that I'm going to talk about is the microservices part which is using quercus and Cassandra and if you have seen the evolution of how programs have evolved you started with monoliths then multi-tiers you know you had the three-tier applications two-tier applications whatever right and then you had what are called as service oriented architecture right you know where everything is Services microservices is kind of a similar concept but but really the idea behind this is that each micro service um you know not necessarily tiny but has a limited functionality and only that functionality so that you can kind of plug and play them but more importantly what you can do is you can deploy them independently so let's say I'm using some kind of login service I can I can you know keep the entire product just the same but I can deploy it to only 20 of the user population by changing the login service and all of that is facilitated using microservices there are a number of advantages number of disadvantages as you can figure out but but let's not worry too much about that one of the primary things that you uh that you kind of inherit is the complexity of microservices right but there are a lot of tools a lot of things that are evolving you know to make it easier okay we have written a extension which is why you know which is what you're going to see here and again automatically installed for you you don't have to worry about any of these it uses a concept of what is referred to as reactive programming and what this means is it does a lot of things asynchronously meaning a thread doesn't have to wait for the function to complete uh you know there are ways of getting around this okay so this is reactive programming and all that you need to do to use quarkus or so to use uh Cassandra and quarkus is to provide the credentials and that's exactly what you're going to be doing in your Workshop today you're going to be providing the username and password and what we refer to as a secure connect bundle so you're going to take the secure connect bundle and you're going to import it into gitpart and I'll show you all of that in a second um and and once you have done that you're good to go uh and there's hope you know let's let's not uh spend too much time on this but you know suffice to say that our code base you can walk through this there is driver session support and there is object mapper support where you can take your data and convert it into objects because that's how you want to deal with in many of the languages there is support from Mutiny types again you know everything got to do with reactive programming so I talked quite a bit about that and you know I think once you start using it you will like it more and more and see how it's applicable to a kubernetes slash microservices environment okay so with that said the whole goal for today is to create a to-do app and I was blown away by the support for to do from the community there are a there is whole bunch of languages where they have to do apps so you can just use the to-do app or what you can do is you can create a rest service for to-do and then you have a built-in like a framework or a platform where you can test this service pretty cool okay so so you you know that's the reason why we do this and again you know very simple table um for those of you who are Cassandra users you know that there is something called as a partition key where um you know here you can see that user ID is the partition key and that's how the items are distributed and then within the partition key you have another key which kind of sorts and that's where the item id comes in as well but again you don't need to worry too much about this once you're in development mode you can use a slash Q slash Dev so if you're going to exercise 7 or exercise 8 you can kind of walk through this not necessary for you to do this but I I have a suspicion that especially if you're developing this application for the first time you're going to use this quite a bit and then once you're ready with that then you start containerizing it pushing it to kubernetes and so on so take a look at this slash Q slash Dev you know it talks about the rest API and all that but but we're going to underemphasize that in today's Workshop because we want to focus really only mostly in the containerization part and like I said before you can select all kinds of MVC Frameworks you know you just go to to mvc.com and I'll be happy to kind of bring that up but I really don't have too much time here there are a whole bunch of examples okay angularjs [Music] I don't know there are so many platforms that I've never heard of before okay there is something in Rust you can see here um uh Salon Django I have no idea you know you can look at the front end the back ends uh but but the goal for today is like I said you know to be able to create something like this um so what we're going to do is we're going to have the front end um then the back end and the database is going to be in Astra service and this is the cool part um you know in fact uh when I uh was working with uh Edward uh all that he did was uh you know kind of create the astrodb instance um get the secrets deploy it into his lens and he was good to go he didn't even have to build the kubernetes yaml because what he did was he used mine right you know something along those lines so it makes it very easy to be able to plug in the services okay believe it or not the most complex step is step two where you're gonna take a um you know you you're gonna adjust the tokens and like I said you're gonna take the security secure connect bundle and drop it into gitpart okay so maybe I'm going ahead of it ahead of myself so let me show you how this actually works in action okay again same thing as before right I'm gonna I've already created the Astro token uh oh no I haven't showed you that so what you're going to do for creating Astro token is go to organization settings okay and I'm not going to go through all of this but but essentially you can you can see here you're going to organization settings okay and then you look you click on token management okay and then select a role okay and we just kind of go with uh administrator okay you can make it um a little bit more uh granular but but you know uh for the purposes of the workshop you know you can see I've already generated a lot of tokens and what you're going to do is you're going to do a generate token and here's the part you're going to copy this client ID and this client secret and keep it somewhere okay because this is something that you're going to be using you're not going to be using the tokens so don't worry about it but one of the things that happens and this happens quite a bit to our Workshop attendees is if you navigate away from this page this is lost okay so your client ID and client secret is gone okay and there is really no way of retrieving that uh but again not to worry because all that you need to do is create a new token right and again for the purposes of Workshop it's okay and as you can see I myself have a lot of tokens that I play around with okay so I've I have done all that right so I've I've copied the client ID I've copied the client secret what is the next step again go back to my GitHub right so so it talks about notice the clipboard icon you can take client ID the client secret copy it and keep it somewhere okay and now you can launch gitpart and again this might seem a little confusing but what you can do is you can open this in a new window this is which is what I suggest but you know it's really up to you if you want to open it in a new tab that's fine too and actually I have opened it in a new tab and when you open the link in the new window okay it's bringing up the window right and you know it's going to create new one okay it's preparing the workspace and all that but I'm not going to worry about this because I've already created this right so it's going to take a few moments and it's going to drop me into a git pod um so I'm going to open this workspace okay and typically what happens is um you know it's it's going to come up uh pretty soon it's a visual IDE it's actually a you know vs code for those of you and uh who are using a vs code uh it's it's exactly the same exact except that it's in the cloud okay there are some features which may not be in an on par but for the most part you're good okay uh so the thing you notice here is that I have this pretty much Explorer window as you know it's referred to you have a editor window which is in the top right okay so you have the Explorer window on the left uh on the top right you have the editor window and then this is the terminal window where it's doing some setup right now as you can see it's installing ground VM okay um so it's installing Cube cuddle so that I can use Cube cuddle if I have to but you know I probably don't need to especially if you're using lens and so on uh but it's this is probably going to take a little bit of time okay so um not to be concerned you can bring that up and and and you know just let it go uh and then you will be good to go at one point you can bring up you know new uh bash Windows here okay so if I if for example I do git uh remote minus B for example it will tell me what Repository uh what is it oh my remote it's not going to help so this is my you know the the git repository that I'm using for my code okay so it tells me all that uh if I do a git status it'll tell me that my application properties has been changed you can see here my application properties has been changed and this is where I'm gonna inject the credentials okay and you will see that so what I will do is I'll show you the application properties okay um Maine resources you know you can do all this there are other ways of opening this which is suggested and if you look at the application properties all that I do is I add the username and the password and that's exactly what you want to do you want to add the username and the password on the appropriate line as you can see here okay just add the username and the password and you're good to go that's pretty much it nothing else needs to be done oh I I lied there is one more thing that needs to be done okay and let me go back again to the GitHub repository okay once you launch the git pad you're done with everything know your gitpart you know take a moment to understand it right and then what you're going to do is set up the application properties which which I already showed you if I just do a GP open it's going to open up the um the file in the editor window and you can you can change it you know put the username and the password and you're good to go okay but there is one last thing that needs to be done and this is a tricky one okay so what you need to do is you want to create um you want to import the security bundle okay and I've done this already for my git part okay but but this is a little tricky and what you want to do is you know you want to click on workshops okay and you want to go to connect okay and you will see here you know you have a Java node.js python whatever it doesn't really matter which language because you're using the same bundle but you know when you click on this language it shows you the download bundle and what you do is you just download this bundle okay so it will download the secure connect bundle and what it is going to do is it's going to download it locally okay so once you have it running locally and all of this is explained in the GitHub reposit uh you know in the in the GitHub instructions then what you're going to do is you're going to drop it into um into uh get by okay so how do I drop it into gitpart so let me go into gitpart okay and let me show you that I've already done this before so I I don't need to worry too much about this okay but for you you'll have to do this oh secure connect okay and you'll see that it's roughly about 12K okay that you um you know we have simplified this process but I have not adapted the workshop yet for that but you know um it's it's all that you need to do is fighter finder window or something like that uh take the secure connect workshops right and drop it into gitpart okay so let's do it let's try that again I'm gonna get get out of full screen mode come on okay and now I'm gonna bring the finder window okay I'm going to find that zip file and you will see that this will be highlighted right and and you can drop it in there I'm not going to do that or maybe I'll do that what the heck right uh and it's asking me do you want to replace it I'll say no but if you want you can replace that as well okay so the critical part and again this is explained in the instruction is that your zip file should be roughly about 12K otherwise you've done something wrong just go ahead and kind of do it again okay all right so we are getting very close to be able to kind of work through this the first thing I would recommend you do is make sure that you have the right connection okay to be able to do that all that I do is run this Maven command and when you run it the very first time around it will take a little bit of time uh because um you know it's as as everybody says you know Maven kind of downloads the entire world right so so it's going to download the world and you will be ready to go um but I have already done all that so I'm gonna run my test and see if it's working if this doesn't work then something is wrong either you've got the application properties uh ID password wrong or you did not import the zip file but if you have done all this then you can move straight to the containers part if you get a success on this you're good to go you can go straight to the containers part but if you are like me you know a little bit curious about quarkus then what you can do is you can kind of go through this um you know the the other exercises as well and you will see here you know it gives you a lot of information about what kind of Frameworks are being used uh if you're really interested in all of this you can kind of look at it you can see that the vertex framework is used which is uh for uh um you know basically the reactive programming and so on but one of the things you're looking for is to see if the stable got created right uh it should if you get a success but never hurts right you know to be doubly sure so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to grip for table okay and all of this again explained in the instruction okay because you can run this any any number of times it doesn't matter right so grab line inside table all right coming up in a second and the awkward pause moment here right so you can see here table is create table created is true okay and really if you're keen and kind of following along what I would recommend you do is run this app as a local app in a quarkus Dev mode okay so to to be able to run this all that I do is I run it with qualcus Dev and Skip test you don't really technically need to to containerize this but it doesn't hurt right so I'm going to go into gitpart again and I'm going to run this okay and hopefully I haven't done this in a while because I'm speaking I was keeping straight to the containers part so hopefully this is going to work we'll see all right so this is a port that's uh used by the debugger um so I'm not going to worry too much about the debugger part but here's the service itself available on Port 8080. I'm going to open it in a browser and see what happens okay and you can see here Firefox prevented the site from opening a pop-up window so you know what you can do is you can just allow pop-ups and hopefully it'll come up now okay and there is my to-do app okay uh presentation and live coding okay sorry I can't spell um and you can get rid of some of these you can mark them as complete so there it's a fairly sophisticated to-do app um that that we are going to contain our eyes um pretty shortly I'm not going to go through the instructions of containerize because it's pretty straightforward okay um so let's go into the exercise 10 and if you want to skip straight to exercise 10 you know you can start from the index okay but make sure you have the connection tested and all that okay because again it's all about test driven development right you can skip quercus Dev mode you can skip debugging you can skip packaging but all of them are cool believe me okay but you can go straight to containerizing so for containerizing I'm just going to have to talk a little bit we use something called as jib container extension this is the one that makes it happen Okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create something called as jib slash workspace quarkus intro demo right and all of the the contents of jib are going to put into the container and that's how I move the security bundle into the Container right so so I I copy the secure Connect workshops.zip into this jib subdirectory right and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create the container okay so so let me show this in action all right so let's not worry about this I'm going to get rid of this because I'm not interested in that right so let me do a Docker images okay and you'll see that there's probably uh git part quarkus Cassandra I'm going to get rid of that docker is it RMI get powered slash quercus okay I'm gonna get rid of that uh what did I get wrong oh okay so so I've gotten rid of that okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to build the docker image okay so to be able to build a dragon image again the instructions are pretty straightforward all that I do is I clean the package and Skip you know whatever right um quarkus is a great framework for doing testing but unfortunately we don't do too much testing here okay the first test verify the connection and then we're good to go okay so we clean package build through so this is the um thing that I was talking to you about okay so here all that I'm doing is I'm doing a build okay uh but after that there are ways in which I can push it to any registry that you want any Docker registry right and then stand it up from there okay all right let's see this is going to take a little bit of time and and actually if you go into the native image part uh that takes even longer uh so just be patient but but let me go back and look at Docker images now okay and hopefully this this should be built this was built just 27 21 seconds ago right and you can run a Docker from here itself okay so this talks about how to do that and again you know sometimes I remember I don't remember the instructions myself so oh what is going on here okay so what I do is uh I again go back to if I want to run it here locally okay I run this and you will see how this works you know again typical things that you do in the Inner Loop development right so I run the this thing a service is available on port 8080 okay and again I open browser and this time it shouldn't ask for preferences and there you go there is the presentation complete all of this is you know is in my persistent in my Astro database okay all right so we are doing pretty well in terms of time um so I did all the two three four uh and actually I did um five and six as well so in two three and four what did we do you know just to recap we created a token right remember to copy the ID and the password right which is I think believe the client and secret or something like that okay but all of the instructions are in there uh keep it somewhere handy um once you bring up GitHub gitpart then what you're gonna do is you're gonna plug in the ID and password in the application.properties file right remember that and then what you're going to do is you're going to take the secure connect bundle put it locally and then copy it into gitpart and I've showed you how to do that right or the instructions kind of go through that as well and now you've set up the application you're good to go just make sure it's good to go by testing the connection we did the testing the connection as well and then what we're going to do is you can try some of the quarker stuff if you're interested but what we are really keen on is the deploy to lens containerize and deploy to lens and again the instructions kind of go through this um so let's kind of take a brief look I'm not going to demonstrate this because I really don't have a whole lot of time here you're going to do a Docker login okay you'll need a Docker ID obviously okay and it's going to use that Docker ID to actually push it you know we add an extension curve for kubernetes and here we're going to package and eventually we're going to push it you can see here Docker container image pushed is equal to True okay so once you do this push is equal to true it's going to push it to the registry and actually um I think here somewhere here we probably also say um yeah build is equal to true and push is equal to True we'll stand it up okay so you can you can you can kind of take a look at this uh and and what's gonna happen um initially it may not work because you know you don't have a a kubernetes uh um uh cluster up and ready right so what it's going to do is it's going to generate a kubernetes yaml file okay and you will see this in the Target directory okay I know a lot of uh things to worry about but all of these are explained pretty well um so this is the kubernetes yaml that was generated and you can see here the same quercus Cassandra 0.01 but it's also gonna use my um somewhere in there should be a raxiness okay which is my oh maybe not you know because I haven't done the push uh once you do this it'll it'll do all the the push properly and and uh actually let me show that direction maybe that's useful um let me go with this and see if this works okay so no more so what I'm going to do is I'm going to push it and let's see what happens here oh I didn't do a Docker login so this is not going to work so let me do the docker login all right so this is good now let me see if I can push it at least the Manifest should look a little different now okay you will see that you know a different kubernetes yaml will be set and this is the ammo that you're going to use the Manifest to be to be able to deploy it in lens and all of the again instructions are in there so you still have about half an hour to be able to do this uh I have an error which is that's why they say you know don't try from the um okay let me do this all right if you follow the steps I'm uh I think you should be good but I kind of try to skip some steps which is always bad idea right let me see if this works all right to do the skip test but that's fine all right so so let me go back and and we'll get back to that in a second um you have two options one is you can deploy to lens so basically what you have to do is you have to download the lens um you know and then you have to download install and run lens desktop which is going to be running on your local system okay and and you know maybe what we can do is we can uh ask Edward to kind of talk about this a little bit okay um and once you have the lens uh up and running desktop up and running you should see something like this right you set up you know what CPU how much memory and all that and this is the LDK that he was talking about and you will see that you know it's one of the Clusters and and again I think there was a question right at the beginning of the workshop how do I add clusters sometimes or most of the times it's automatic okay and again um you know Edward we'll talk about it then you'll set up the secrets okay then plug in the deployment file and that's all that there is required okay so you create the resource and then you know you do a port forwarding right or maybe it's automatic and and we'll look at you know how Edward does that and once you have this all up you set up the port forwarding and and you're good to go so that's how you're able to connect to a cluster IP okay so this is a nice segue into seeing if my kubernetes yaml got built it did get belt which is Miracles Miracles right um so let me go into Target kubernetes kubernetes Yamaha okay and bring that up again um okay so something is wrong here let me get rid of this and try again sometimes it's all right okay oh there you go uh it's still still gaming Docker IO which it should not be should be giving my uh my correct kubernetes yaml and I will figure out what's going on there but but if you follow the steps I'm sure it'll it'll work just fine okay um but essentially It'll point to my Docker public registry and you're good to go from that point onwards okay oh I know what what I did wrong which is like I said again don't skip so that's the problem because I never said Doctor like an ID even though a doctor logged in I never did that okay so so again you know uh my apologies for having to bear with this but this is a workshop where we are troubleshooting on the go right um so so what I forgot to do was it wouldn't make sense if you didn't run into it exactly right exactly right yeah yeah so um so let's do this okay and now if I Echo the docker login ID it should be all right so now I'm going to go and uh what I can do is I can run the same thing okay which I did before which is clean package and minus these skip tests actually let's do this let's push it let's be brave enough and push the registry okay so I'm pushing it and here you notice that I'm using the docker login ID and it should it should work just fine okay um so while this is going on um Edward do you want to show like maybe in five minutes how you deploy it to lens um and and then what we can do is we can let the uh attendees lose we have about half an hour and and let them kind of go through the steps and give us some some thumbs up as to where they are um and we can kind of help them uh with the workshop yeah absolutely absolutely okay yeah let me let me take over from here I could start off by sharing my screen one second when yeah I have to set up your screen for this okay um uh all right I can see you and me so now we're good to go I think can you see my screen yes excellent welcome everybody okay so now we're gonna actually take that yaml file and deploy it to lens this isn't necessarily the traditional way how to deploy an application on top of kubernetes but for this um Workshop today this is the approach we are going to take and again asrog said it's opinionated it's a bit biased and so forth but I think it's excellent to Showcase really um how you can deploy the application you just built on top of your environment very easily so to start I'm just going to take this a step back it's extremely important to keep up and actually go and download lens which you can find here at our website kateslens.dev click download as I showcased earlier today it's an electron application it will download directly to your desktop once you have it downloaded you can launch lens and you're going to open up lens and you're really not going to have anything within lens initially and what you'll have to do from here um in order to actually move forward with the workshop is you're going to have to create a lens ID and the reason for this specifically is because you will be leveraging the lens Pro trial which is um a trial series of lens Pro that actually gives you the ability to leverage LDK it's free for 30 days no credit card needed and just ping me directly if you want additional access I do want to mention though that lens is very much free it's just if you want to leverage this um optimized development environment you would need to have to have the free trial so in order to access the free trial it's quite simple you'll have this login here you're going to need to actually click into it it'll open up lens It'll ask you what subscription you would like um it's the free trial you will not need a credit card and so forth and lens again is very much free to achieve full situational awareness it's just when we give you this cluster that's when you actually would be on the the lens Pro trial so I just want to make that very clear but if you bring your own environments mini Cube octo on k0s MP MKE gke um Rancher and so forth you can add those clusters directly to lens you don't need to leverage this LDK environment what we wanted to do for this Workshop is give you an environment that you can leverage um instead of spinning up a mini Cube cluster for example but you could take that approach as well where you could do the exact same thing we're about to Showcase now with minicube with k0s with any certified kubernetes distro without the need to actually have a lens Pro trial cool I'll stop there and actually begin to move forward with the workshop and the portion on lens so real quick what we see here is actually a morantis kubernetes engine cluster currently added to lens I just want to talk real quick on some of the capabilities lens has prior to finalizing the workshop so here we can actually see how my cluster is performing in the last hour from the master to the worker node the CPU and the memory you can see the capacity you can see the number of PODS and of course you get real-time messages here at the bottom really allowing you to understand what is happening within your current cluster we'll touch on this in just a moment but I want to Now navigate actually back to LDK so on the left hand side here is where all your kubernetes clusters will be added to I can click LDK and I'll have it running there now for y'all to get started with LDK once you have your lens Pro trial you'll be able to view it here it will say lens Pro trial and on the bottom right hand side it should say lens desktop Cube clicking onto lens desktop cube is going to allow you to configure your optimized development environment for your particular needs from the CPU to the memory to the disk size and of course the version now I do want to reiterate that this is a k0s cluster so LDK is leveraging the open source k0s cluster built by team lens and marantis now once you have LDK up and running it usually takes about a minute to go from the stop say or not running state to the running State you will have to enable this click apply select your specific configuration I would actually just go with what is out of the box for demonstration purposes so I'll click Escape it'll take a moment again about a minute to get up and running once it's up and running you're going to see a screen like this we currently don't have our metrics available but of course we can actually add them through Auto detect Prometheus bring our own Prometheus and so forth there's no permit this on this cluster that's why we don't see it but we can add it if we choose to do so so from here and I just want to navigate back to the steps just so everybody is very much aligned actually I got rid of them but that's okay um so we won't do that from here what you're going to want to do once your kubernetes cluster is running you're going to want to click secrets and within Secrets you're going to click this plus button that's actually going to allow you to create a secret and again you want to leverage the secrets you created earlier in the workshop that rog's demonstrated from here we'll give the secret a name Astra we'll add the data right so Astra username and this is quite important correct and then you're going to add the value that value is unique to your specific environment I want to make that very clear you can't use my value it's going to be unique to you so it's very important you actually have the secrets handy both the username and the password so from here you would do Astra password and you would click create um I don't want to copy and paste the secrets here um because then you all will see it I actually have it deployed already but this is the step that you would take once you give it a name select the namespace insert the data ask your username and again enter the value ask your password enter the value click create is that it encrypts the username and password right so what do you see that is is not really the value but but it's it's encrypted so that you know if you want to demonstrate it it's fine right exactly exactly so here this is not the password that's why we have this show and remove um so you can actually very easily showcase it remove it and so forth so it keeps it quite secure which is excellent now once you've added the secret to your lens desktop kubernetes environment you're actually going to want to take that yaml code that you've developed and create the resource directly into lens on top of LDK so as mentioned earlier lens is very much a kubernetes IDE it also allows you to achieve full situational awareness so from here we'll navigate to this plus icon and there's two items you can do here you can go to the smart terminal now this isn't part of the demo but I just want to showcase that we are always leveraging the correct Cube CTL version of that cluster so I'll navigate to this cluster real quick Cube CTL version we can see that it's always going to be unique to the cluster that you're currently connected to and the cube CTL will be in the correct context at all times this is ensuring that you're going to be eliminating any user error when it comes to working with multiple kubernetes clusters is there any chance you can increase the franchise or you know okay but I was much better yeah yeah so you can see the version here the Git Version I can navigate back to my other cluster and you can see it here right and you have that ability to switch between cluster and cluster while always remaining containing that context super important when working with multiple kubernetes clusters I'm going to zoom out now it's fine now we took a look at the terminal but really what we want to do is create a resource so the neat thing behind lens is we actually provide all of our users with out of the box resources as well that you can deploy so if I want to deploy an nginx deployment in real time without actually having to wrestle with yaml you have the ability to do so now we're not deploying nginx we're going to deploy the application the to do app um directly in our environment so what I'm going to do and I'm going to zoom out again is I'm going to navigate to my notes grab the yaml copy and paste it click create a resource and you can copy and paste it directly from git party no if you want to put it in notes that's fine exactly exactly so I would recommend exactly what rocks that just grab it from get pod um and to do so you will need to run that command line that is within the workshop to actually grab this yaml file now everything is listed in the workshop within GitHub so I accidentally closed the screen there but um just run that command that we provided for you it'll generate the yaml copy and paste the yaml and all you have to do once is copy and paste it here is Click create and close so I've actually already created this deployment or this resource in my environment and to Showcase that I can navigate over to my workloads click into pods and see that this has been running for the last 52 minutes so I actually followed along in the workshop as much as I was able to and I was able to deploy this roughly 50 minutes ago on top of my environment we can see the namespace that this application is deployed to and so forth we can see the deployments the Damian sets and so forth so really what lens is doing is it's giving us that full situational awareness everything within this environment from our pods or deployments our staple sets our replica sets um and so forth so here we'll navigate to our pods we'll actually take a look at this pod we can see again in a granular view from CPU memory Network file system we see a drop in a file system that'd be worrisome we can see all the labels all the annotations what replica set is controlled by the status of the Pod the node it's running on the containers that are associated to it and of course we can view pod logs if we choose to do so and this is going back to what we showcased earlier within that development environment that Lens comes in towards the end of a developer's workflow here I can access logs I can navigate between containers and see what owns it so this would help us troubleshoot now what we want to do from here now that our pod is running we're actually going to navigate to network on the bottom left hand side click services find the service and here we have the ability to port forward directly to this application without running any command line now that we've Port forwarded into that application I could say Workshop data Stacks slash lens we can say lens is pretty cool welcome everyone and so forth right so the application is working we deployed the application to our development environment we reviewed whether or not that pod is successfully running what the state of the Pod is we are able to view all of the details Associated to the Pod that labels the annotations the namespace It's associated to we can view our logs we even have the ability dependent again team on your role-based Access Control to edit this resource through the Apple and so forth so we were able to port forward into the application which is fantastic um we also have some other very cool features within lens and if you don't mind rocks I'll do a little bit of a deeper demo of lens lens real quick here um you even have the ability to actually scan any images and containers within your environment um directly through lens oh could not scan image vulnerabilities I wonder why that's happening but let's take a look here navigate to our images in my other cluster and it's actually going to tell us the specific vulnerabilities of these images and we can actually showcase the vulnerabilities see the cves see that they're critical click into this particular cve read about it understand it why it's happening and we can also give you a detailed guide on how to fix that particular vulnerability so again lens is providing you with that multi-cluster management switching from cluster to Cluster while always maintaining the correct context we have the ability to view everything in our cluster from the workloads to the config maps to our secrets or resources our Network persistent volume claims all in one place and access all of the details necessary to be able to work with kubernetes at scale here we also have the ability to deploy Helm charts directly into our environment so I can look for like Argo CD I can click here it'll open up the helm chart it'll tell us all about the helm chart we'll be able to actually click into it see who created it and so forth all of the details step-by-step guides I can click install click install now I have no idea what the sound chart is but again LDK it's a local development environment I'm not too worried about installing something directly here I can view the helm release which is going to actually tell me everything about this deployment where it sits so we can see it's in the default namespace we can click into here you can get all of the necessary resources the secrets that were created the config maps that were created the cluster roles I mean everything that you would need to access when working with kubernetes is visible in a graphical user interface within lens itself so I'm going to stop there I know we went through so many different things today and I'm going to hand it back over to rogs but I love want to thank each and every single one of you for at least sticking up to this point with us it's a long session and I'll hand it back over to you perfect yeah that's a nice segue into what I was going to say next which is like you know we have had a few people drop out so I think you know your chances of winning a swag is pretty good if you hang on for about maybe 15 more minutes right uh maybe just before the top of the other I will do the mentee but for now what you can do is you can you can kind of try it out yourself but before we do that I wanted to show you this that you know basically what the image you can see here you know has the rags and S which is my um you know my container registry right so it's pulling the Right image and standing it up in kubernetes like I want to okay um all right so enough said about that let's go through the presentation okay and I'll give you guys a little bit of time to try this out if somebody is already finished I'm going to pause for Hands-On so you know because that's the part that I know that most of you like so if any of you completed exercise 10 I see a couple of Thumbs Up Abdul Nazir and Chris and nald um and I know that Moises Salazar you're having some problems that get part and Edmund bet copying to get part is proving to be difficult if you're still around let us know and we can we'd be glad to help you out okay but let me give you give it like five maybe 10 more minutes and again you know hang on you have a good opportunity to win swag okay and again if you want to recollect what we talk in the workshop we're going to have teach you with some questions but it's going to be pretty easy you know so uh so the I'll talk about the quiz um in a little bit but for the next five ten minutes I'm not gonna talk and I'll let you guys kind of try this out again remember if you created the astrodb token um what you're going to do is you're going to copy import the credentials into gitpart and from there you're going to build it you're going to take the amml file and deploy it into your kubernetes cluster I mean if you have another kubernetes cluster Henry uh you know you can do that there as well if you don't want to use the lens desktop you know that's fine but if you know if you have lens desktop already running I suggest you kind of do it there as well but but kind of gives you an idea of the entire Inner Loop and and I think um you know Edward talk about this Argo CD there are a bunch of other kind of robust CI CD platforms but we're not talking about that we are talking about kind of the inner loop here today where we do this over and over and over again right and that's what I wanted to stress here so so um just just to kind of round that up okay I will not talk for the next nine and a half minutes this is the time when we don't do anything and feel free to ask some questions and chat if you want just a quick interrupt uh if any of you completed exercise 10. please put a thumbs up or just let me know which um you know step you're in I don't want to wait for too long you know if you guys have decided to kind of do it after that's perfectly fine you know so lamina in the chat so anybody wants to put in the chat uh if you want a little bit more time otherwise we can go straight to mentee just let me know if you need like maybe three or four more minutes you know to try it out just put it in the chat and I will wait for a little bit otherwise we can just jump straight to my tea and try to wrap this up okay I don't see anything in the chat um so I'm not quite sure if you guys have decided to kind of do it later which is fine but let's try to wrap up you know if you do get done earlier so be it um so let me see start some music here hopefully it's not too loud if the music is too loud let me know you guys hear the music at all or yeah all right this is hold on alright so in terms of resources um let's do mentee and then we'll finish up with the resources all right so again use the chord all right let's go into gonna do just give me a second [Music] can you guys hear me okay you may have to we enter here and try again my apologies for having lost the connection I have no idea what happened there can we try again um so the code is 6110-4421 hopefully you guys can hear me thank you thank you Peter I definitely lost my connection so my apologies something to do with my service in the waiter it's never happened before we lose everybody let's give it a couple of minutes for other people to join as well we can skip all this because we've seen this before okay we have 10 people so now I'm good to go all right so we finished this now is the quiz all right so let's see question one of six see how many people are ready to fast but most importantly answer correctly what is the cool feature of today's Workshop Astra quarcus gitpart Hall and really only one person playing um can we try to connect again see if there's a problem here okay [Music] moving on let's see what happens next leaderboard is built because he's the only guy who wanted for some reason nobody else could vote okay but uh let's see what happens you still have two and three positions um again use the chord six one zero four four two one I believe six one one zero four four two one I'll give people again a little bit of time um two giant okay anybody else joining okay we have a few more people joining let's give it a couple of minutes if you want you know just go into mentee.com again and do six one one zero four four two one okay um almost there you only have one person joining in moving on to question two I am going to be starting the question again six one one zero four four two one you have a good chance of winning um you know just if you have trouble just go back to minty.com and put in the code again because again my apologies I seem like my network uh had some issues yeah I'm seeing more and more people joining in I know there are quite a few people watching uh it's just that you know because the networking difficulty uh you may have had issues so let's try again um going to mentee.com and put in the code six one one zero four four two one okay all right a few people running let's see how this goes I think bill has a good chance of winning because he was the only one to end first question all right answer fast but most importantly answer correctly okay foreign modified and added credentials to connect to the Astro database securely was it application property dot properties palm.xml Astra to do.java or none of the above which one did we use that we modified under added credentials to connect to the asterisk securely perfect two people got it all right let's look at the leaderboard and we have Dylan Ricky in a close competition there no maybe not bill is far ahead because he answered the question number um one all right moving on next one you still have an opportunity all that you need to do is if you go to mentee.com put 6110-4421 all right so we have tight people now so I think it's going to be interesting now okay I'm gonna start the count and which container related Maven plugin did we use in the workshop you know I kind of alluded to that plugin and bomb plugin was it a maven plug-in Maven is a tool or was it a chip for specifically for containers [Music] a few people answering what's up let's see how you guys are doing uh two people got it wrong only one person got it right it was a chip plug-in that we used um you know for containerization uh you know remember we copied everything into a subdirectory in gym and all that all that was possible using the gym plugins let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up you see your bill is still on top one seven four one Wiki is 725 and John and Holly hope are zero and zero but you still have a chance of winning because you persisted uh you stayed with me so we just got kind of cool all right next one question four of six we have three more and we're almost done answer fast but most importantly correctly I alluded to this native image generation with carcass requires what kind of VM does it require a Linux VM does it require a crowd VM or does it require a job again right right and the answer is two people got it right uh of course you need the Linux VM and the Java VM um you know for other things right but specifically for Native image generation you require the well-being and that's the thing that I said was already pre-installed for you and so on so let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up I don't know I've still got it wrong or right or constant learner is back and constant learner comes into second tuition John you still have hope there are two more questions so let's see how it does question five or six answer fast but most importantly answer correctly what kubernetes distro is lens based on is it k0s is it k3s or is it k something s it has to be the correct meaning it has to be exactly and some people got k0s some people thought it was k3s a good guess but it's not based on k3s it's based on k0s somebody put kiss on today right let's see what is Bill doing wow it burns the ball Turner Vicky and John are very close out of a constant leather and Ricky are close let's see how John is doing the last few last one actually which is question six of six and John you still have a chance to kind of LeapFrog let's see and so fast is more importantly answer correctly what facilitates connection to the app running on a cluster IP within the cluster is it the gate Sandra cluster is it NG rock is it port forwarding or is it pink um I think we did this and probably saw this yes two people got it right with port forwarding case Center cluster is good but it doesn't really help you with app running on a cluster IP you still have to do port forward all right so let's see and the leaderboard looks like this bill is the winner congratulations will tell you exactly what to do how to get and constant learner and Wiki you know if you haven't uh gotten your swag before um you can you can uh basically take a screenshot and I'll show you exactly how to do that in a second don't take this screenshot but take a screenshot from your phone or something and send it to us and we should be able to send you or ship you the swag to anywhere in the world okay so with that said we also have a open feedback you know feel free to add things here what would you like to improve the next Workshop I will leave it going for a little bit to see uh you know if any of you have anything give it a little bit of time then I'll move back to the presentation Point here at some of the other resources and then call it a ramp call it any any feedback that you have happy to [Music] do is here all right go back and look here so this is what you're going to do you're going to take a screenshot and you're going to send it um and basically what you're going to do is you're going to send a screenshot which has your name in there you are the winner right um okay screenshot and fill the format datastacks.io Workshop swag again if you want to take a screenshot here too so that you remember or just write down the form URL and with that if you want more detailed discussions you know we have a Discord Channel which kind of goes through all of that more sustained discussions we have number of different workshops that you can sign up to uh you know datastacks.com on a number of different topics you can you can also do like I said you know participating in discard and as you know you know we have mentee but if you don't want to use or you want to run know attend the live workshops there are other resources as well I call myself as being in the Golden Age of developer where we have a lot of resources and most of these are available for free we even get a badge for doing what we're supposed to do right you know you can try that out um you can prepare you know there is something for quarkis Cassandra as you can see here so if you complete the homework which will grade then you can get a batch some workers for spring developers is something that one of my other authors wrote authors of the workshop Eric deandria getting started with serverless functions is right here as well or you can try Cassandra yourself there are a number of different ways you know the easiest way is just go to parkas IO guides Cassandra or github.com data Stacks devs or shopping Cassandra which is this one okay and with that said thank you very much apologies for the network disconnection that happened very abruptly it had nothing to do with that um with that said thank you again and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops from the goddess of Cassandra and put those Powers until she can multiply it will move with Limitless speed and unmasked hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
