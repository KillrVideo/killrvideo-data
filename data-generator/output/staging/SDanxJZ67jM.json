    "text": "well hello everyone and uh and welcome to uh another data Stacks live stream um I'm Aon plz and today I'm joined by an ali um hyago did I did I say that right did I already totally butcher it I think you got two of the letters right two of the letters right well yeah I suppose out of all the letters that's pretty terrible is Ali please introduce yourself thank you so much Aon hey everyone it's great to see you I'm Ali hanol or you could just use Ali H that's fine um and it's great to be able to join your webinar today Aaron um I guess we'll do some little bit more introductions and and everything a little bit right yeah yeah absolutely um you know um you know I I I was just going to say I I I have some sympathy for you with a last name that's that's hard to pronounce I I tell you I've I've heard every possible mispronunciation of of PLS is is possible like plots is probably the the most common one yeah yeah yeah anyway but um but yeah you know for those of you who don't know I'm I'm Aon from data Stacks um you know been here for uh I've actually been at data Stacks about three years now um but uh but prior to that I I led the uh nosql database engineering team over at over at Target um and before that I was I was on the Cassandra team at Granger um so I've done an awful lot in terms of like you know retail and e-commerce um and and yeah that kind of leads us to our discussion today with Ali from amplience um Ali could you tell us a little bit about amplience and about what you guys do Happ happy to do that so um the the short short short version of what we do is that we are a headless content management system that's probably what we are known for but what is that mean exactly well the slightly longer version of that is that our platform helped uh marketers merchants and developers of Brands and retailers and other Commerce businesses be able to generate manage and deliver all of the content and assets that they need to be able to sell products on both their owned and unowned properties and connect with their customers in meaningful ways my role at amplience is I lead the product marketing team um I've been here for about two years now but I've actually been in in well I've been in tech for a long time I won't say how long it will age me but I've been in Commerce Tech now for um I think about 15 years now actually and I've been I've been in attech I've been in search I've been in uh in Pim and now in CMS I feel like I've been in sort of uh every aspect of e-commerce technology business side and the marketing and technical side um except for the e-commerce platforms themselves that probably will get there around to there one day um so that's a little bit about what we do and and a little bit about me okay well excellent excellent well you know for everyone else uh joining us you know um I you know just to kind of quick go over our um our our plan for today um you know now that we've got got some introductions done um Ali and I are basically going to talk about um you know kind of kind of some some trends that we're seeing you know in terms of uh you know like AI gen AI development um inside of inside of retail and e-commerce um and we'll do that for a little bit and then you know I'll have a a quick demo on um you know putting together an an AI shopping assistant um I know that's in the in the title so we we kind of do have to uh have to make sure that we we hit that one pretty touch on that oh yeah yeah but yeah and I can show you how how easy it is to uh to put something like that together with um with our stack here at data stacks and you know then we'll we'll take some questions and I think that'll that'll be about it so yeah that's that's kind of the plan awesome all right well I guess we could start with um you know a lot of uh a lot of folks that that uh you know look to get started with um with with building AI into their stack and and seeing what what kind of business value they can they can drive from it um they they tend to tend to focus on on certain use cases you know Ali are there like certain use cases you've seen kind of you know kind of fall more in line with um you know something you could use to drive business value with from uh from AI yeah so um we have been you know we we are a a data stack customer of course as well as a partner and um and we've been using that as a foundation for our platform and one of the things that we realized was yeah we could use AI as a means to be able to automate the workflows that marketers and Merchants and others have when it comes to working with their content that drives retail experiences oh sure and so you know we like nearly everybody else went let's have a look at geni about a year ago and let's see what we can do there and so what what we've been seeing is that there's so many players out there and I'm sure you've seen it and everybody who's watching right now seen this which is like let's have that button that basically would generate a product description in one way or another that passes over to an AI service and then gives a result back and we're done we're good right realize no it actually has to go beyond that and so um we've been looking at other areas where we can leverage AI not just to generate content but to bring levels of Automation and optimization as well um throughout that entire life cycle of working with content specifically so that'll be things like using S using AI not just to generate things like titles and descriptions that could be Ed for SEO purposes right but actually using AI to evaluate and analyze how effective that might be and score it appropriately oh okay yeah so what we're seeing out there is well first of all I mean Aaron you know this and I'm sure everybody's watching this like AI is not new even actually geni and are not new right they've been around for a long time and they've been used in retail in many cases already as well so are other areas that I've seen personalization is a one big one right and it's been using AI in one flavor or another I I mean I'm going back I remember when it was actually not using AI it was all rules based and you have to Define complex rules um whether you did that through some kind of workflow tool or you hand coded them um but then you know through using machine learning broadly maybe deep learning techniques most recently around genis being used as well with llms but that's typically where most people think of and then of course the topic of today around AI chat Bots right um but uh what you know what other custom are looking at is actually how can they use this to automate many aspects of the experience that their customers have will them as a retailer or a brand who's providing them experience in some way and that touches now things on customer service for example um it's being used as a way also for the employee experience how can we actually help our inore staff using AI to be able to provide a better experience um so it's It Go goes beyond just what we immediately think of around personalization and chat Bots it actually touches every aspect of the customer Journey oh excellent excellent I I really like that um that that part you mentioned about about using it as like kind of a um kind of like a test a system of checks and balances on like you know SEO or content generation like hey you know this is what we put together you know how how does this how does this look in comparison to like other you know um uh things things that we things that generated in the past how would it score for SEO you know is it basically is this going to is this going to is this likely to work if we use this to our our desired intent exactly exactly again AI has been used for that in the past in one way or another to be able to do that kind of analysis especially when there is lots of data to be able to churn through the difference now is that with Gen the the recommendations or the results can be provided in a much more humanlike sounding oh yeah uh formats that a user can then take action on yeah yeah you and you know to play off of another point that you had too um you know you you talk about personalization as like a common use case for uh you know for AI applications and and you also mentioned too that yeah you know this this isn't new you know we've been we you know ai's been been around for a bit but it's it's been you know in one form or another but you know a lot of a lot of rules based you know it kind of evolved out of that um I I could tell you that uh that kind of along that that same line um one of the the larger Cassandra clusters that that I worked on uh backed a recommendation system like that and um it used Cassandra because the data set was really really huge it it it was basically a crosssection of all of our product IDs and all of our customer IDs and you know what they'd added to their cart or what they what they'd bought and and it was kept mapped like that in such a way um so that you could really quickly just hey with this customer ID know what what other U what what other products you know would would would they possibly need or have they bought in the past and you could do it the other way around too of like hey you know people who bought this product also bought this there there are ways to kind of kind of map that yes and um the the way that that was used and this is like 2015 when I I first ran across this uh this this um solution um was this this was the result of a Hadoop job a giant ma ruce job that ran and I'm not kidding it ran like at least for two days before get anything meaningful out of it and and in and it was like and that and that was that was where I mean it's funny but that's where the state of the art was the was that was that wasn't too long ago as well and that was the thing a lot of early AI it really wasn't it was actually pattern matching right is what it was doing and so in that case what it was doing it was processing all of those coming up with some potential outputs and essentially a developer would come along and say well based on this query it looks like it would match that that seems the closest yeah um so yeah no we've come a long way since then very quickly right right and and it's like you know you look at how much time you could you could save for for something like that now you know like maybe maybe you had a way of like um you know quick loading you know better results or or sales data you know into your into your recommendations model and um you know you you could you could make it so that it refreshed that so it was it was like nigh real time like just about real time you know ver versus versus that solution where it's like you know your best data is already two days old as soon as it makes it out there no exactly that's that's not never good enough because that's not going to help someone be competitive thankfully now there are Technologies and vendors out there who providing phenomenal tools to help with things like product recommendations um or what sometimes called as search Andis um right right as well you may have heard of that expression um and and it goes it leverages actually multiple AI Technologies um including things like natural language processing to better understand what you're looking for because we're humans and we're dumb and sometimes we just don't know what we're looking for so when we say we're looking for Red Sneakers what do we actually mean and those are able to leverage multiple data points massive sets of data and interactions to be able to recommend something that is relevant to you based on your context as well um and so that way they they ultimately you know this is my thing is that we aren't using AI for the sake of AI oh no technology It ultimately has to be something that is either going to drive a specific business objective or it's ultimately there to help help improve the experience that your customers have with you because that's how you differentiate right and so that is that is sort of like the fundamental thing to always keep in mind is just because you got some automation doesn't mean you're dumb it has to deliver on a result no for sure for sure um you know another thing that you know you kind of mentioned before too was that um you know when when starting to like starting to like look into you know like like gen Ai and and how it can help is is that uh you know we we're at a point I mean maybe a year ago and and you know it's probably likely still happening where where everyone's doing it everyone's out there doing some kind of doing some kind of R&D um trying to figure out well hey this is this is a thing so I should look at this and you know now we'll see we'll see how it how it kind of drives value and um you know in in talking to developers I I get the I get the general feeling that the the success rate of that is actually pretty low that that of that of all the people I've talked to out there I've maybe like 30% of them actually have something running in production and maybe even that's a little generous you know I I I still think it's just been my experience that that most of the folks who say yeah we we tried this we're looking at it um they never really get out of the try this looking at it phase have you heard something kind of similar to that we've heard similar things from our from customers and others in the industry which is it it well I would say you know through probably this summer I would say like people will saying yeah we're kind of trying it out experimenting with it seeing what we can do we're not sure what the use cases maybe we'll find one and and first of all I always W to say like I've heard this before when the cloud came about oh right right way back okay again I'm aging myself here I still remember when the cloud was a thing and people like I don't know putting on somebody else's computer I don't know we've got a nice data center here let's just use that people were weren't sure and now it is the thing like you don't think of any other way to to operate and build right um and there's a similar analogy with that but I think what's starting to happen is um a couple of things first of all when geni kind of really took off last year right away the hype was all around it's going to replace human work right I being used to write code and it' be like that's the end of the developer and I'm a bit controversial statement right now but that's what people were saying that hasn't really happened smart developers have been like actually I can use this to my benefit so that I can actually get to a result faster at the end of the day we've seen marketers saying oh my God just use gen is going to take our job I don't have to they're just going to write the content for me it's going to organize the content for me it's going to publish the content for me uh it's going to track it all for me I'm out of a job actually no that that hasn't happened either that hasn't happened either and so that's what we're going to see happening um and you're going to start hearing about this more and more I think which is what's going to happen is these are essentially machines and we're going to collaborate with them it's what's going to happen they're gonna be more and more of them and they're going to move they're going to shift from being Point solution kind of things that maybe do or do not work to actually bearing a ser of agents for us and we shift from being users to use a Tron term um to actually being supervisors and what we're doing is the grunt work will be done by AI agents but we will be there to monitor supervise audit quality control what they do and so our role with AI is what's going to change in the future yeah that's a that's a good observation yeah AB absolutely absolutely um you know you kind of mentioned that uh you know the the agents will will kind of will kind of take over a little bit and we'll be in we'll be in more of a supervisory role um you know that that kind of leads to you know where where a lot of folks think that you know kind of the kind of the next step is like you know fast AI communication collaboration because agents will be talking to agents instead of the humans and that agent to agent is is really where a lot of the magic could happen I totally agree and that's one thing um I once worked with um a leader on the AI front who was you know came from Academia and one thing I learned from him he used to say was he says you know thing about artificial intelligence is that it's really dumb um and and I get what it means because that's the thing AI is first of all remember it's just a tool secondly it's good at one thing that's that it's good at and so that will probably continue we I you can read books out there and some may disag agree with me but I think we are a long long long one way from artificial general intelligence we're a long way from that if at all instead what we'll have is independent AI agents that are good at doing one thing and the technology is yet to come yet but it will be coming that will essentially coordinate AI agents for us and do that grum work so when I say something like I really you need a vacation there'll be different AI agents that will go and book my flight book my hotel take care of restaurant reservations make sure I've got a rental car get my calendar in order those are different functions they won't it won't be one AI that does all of it there'll be different AIS that work together and coordinate and bring that all together in there but we still supervise it we still coordinate it we still need platforms to manage all of those and make sure that they are singing and dancing correctly so that we get to the result that we want which is have taken a vacation yeah you know that's that's a great point you know you mentioned the having um you know an an AI assistant to you know take care of your flights you know kind of kind of manage your your personal calendar and work in you know collaboration like that um I remember earlier in my my career I went to a uh conference in Phoenix and um I had accident booked my return flight on the same day but a month later it was it was March and April and and with with the the number of days in the month it just lined up perfectly that the same date was the same day of the week and it just didn't dawn on me and I just kept thinking of oh wow wouldn't that be great if if I had a personal assistant to take care of that and wouldn't rely on me to exactly exactly and that's the thing is that I think that I mean others have talk about this as well this this we're going to be into an age of human machine collaboration is the sort of the next Industrial Revolution essentially um that is f the energy behind it is aium and and I think that's going to be the case whereby yeah you know what we the best of humanity will combine with the best of these machines and and the mistakes that we make as humans hopefully will just be gone we won't even worry about it anymore because we can focus on the good things that's my utopian view of it and see me from having to plead with a gate agent to let me on a flight yeah good luck with that my friend all right well um you know why don't we why don't we shift over to the um the demo portion let's talk about chat Bots I chat Bots yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so you know I'll I'll go ahead and uh you know be be working on on putting this together and I'll I I'll kind of talk through um you know what I'm doing as I'm doing it but you know Ali feel free to jump in you know commentary make fun of me here and you know what whatever you know seems to work at the moment and uh yeah we can uh we can make this happen here I'm seeing this okay here let me now somewhere around here okay there we go and then let me present and I'll say screen and you know while you're doing that I'll share with everybody while we're on the topic of chat Bots you and I when we were by the way we do actually prepare this stuff just so you know we do oh yeah um and we we were you asked the question of What will what will chatbots if I AI is replacing anything what will AI chatbots replace and my ask if you remember was FAQs oh right yeah chatbots will get rid of FAQs something I as a product marketer cannot stand usually because they they're not actually asked questions and they're definitely not frequently asked questions AI chat Bots is a way to be able to get rid of those and provide something that is very relevant and specific so I'll let you show how we can build those oh yeah for sure for sure um oh I see someone in the chat as like are others able to hear yeah okay okay all right well it may just be Vanda having an issue with her um yeah with her sound all right okay so you know what everyone's looking at here is is data Stacks Astra our our dashboard you know I can go down and and um interact with my uh my database if I want um but instead I'm going to click on this build with langlow button and for those of you who haven't checked out langlow you absolutely should um this is our our um component-based guey for um for assembling um AI applications and of course it's it's a it's nicely integrated with with asdb so you can use that as a storage backend um for Vector of course um but it's it's not tied to that you can absolutely swap in other data store components as well um so as you can see here I um no cheating I don't have anything pre-built uh this is the this is my uh my blank slate here so I'll um I'll say new project and I'm going to say Vector store rag we're going to build this as a rag application which is uh for those who haven't haven't um worked with that yet is retrieval augmented Generation Um so I'm going to click on that and it's going to give me this template of components that are that are kind of U you know connected together um what I'm going to do is for for those of you who who may have been um you know um you know maybe taking some of our our older older webinars that we've had with um you know like like Ali mentioned you know during the pandemic time you know we were doing a lot of um a lot of webinars you know they were really common maybe maybe people got some fatigue well you know we used to do a webinar on building an e-commerce site and what I've done is gone and taken the product data from that site and I'm going to use it to build a shopping assistant um so if I go to my um my file component here and I can click and I'll go to go to documents and here we go products CSV there we go nice and simple um now that's going to go into a text splitter um for those of you who are familiar with Lang chain Lang flow um does actually sit on top of of um you know a lot of Lang chain based libraries kind of the cool thing is that I can actually go ahead and look at the code that's behind it you can see yep it's it's pulling in that that Lang chain um Splitters library and that's what we're gonna going to use for this um I'm actually going to drop the chunk overlap normally when you you split text out from a file um you want to look you want some overlap in there to um to help help the um help the model maintain context um or maintain yeah for the conversation I'm just going to drop that to 100 instead of 200 um I see a question in the chat about uh which llm are we going to use today we're actually going to use open ai's text edting 3 small and um you know I apologize for those who may have a have a hard time seeing here but I've zoomed in quite a bit um so I've got that selected kind of the cool thing about langlow is that screen is almost invisible oh no well that's unfortunate um I I was going to say the cool thing about um about langlow is that um okay oh that's good someone else can see it um what you can do is you can set your your credentials for the different um components as environment variables and that's what I've done here so when I when I have an open AI component in there it knows to grab my open AI API key that I have kind of set in the background there um so I don't need to touch anything here now if I go to the asdb component um I'm going to specify my Vector database um just called Vector DB I wasn't having a good creative day that day but um if I have a look at my Vector enabled collections you can see I have this AI assistant vectors here um and really you know if I I can go ahead and um you know jump out to a cql shell terminal here and jump over to that key space and there's my AI assistant vectors table and you can see it's it's completely it's completely empty um so if I did everything right here when I run this um hit this Arrow here on the the asdb component which is on the the far right it should um trigger the rest of them yep I see the uh the building message over here and you can see each one of these kind of goes through and hopefully you get green check marks all around now if I go ahead and I run run a select from this table hey all right we have uh we have data um and that's text and um Vector data a lot of vector data [Laughter] actually all right so that's our that's our data loading flow let me um you know go ahead and and zoom out a little bit to our actual conversational flow um I'm going to start with the the chat input component um I'm just going to ask a very very simple question and and I'll say um can you help me find a purple shirt just like that easy easy um I'm going to use the same text three embedding small llm I'm also going to make sure that I'm using the same um Vector database and uh collection my AI assistant vectors uh the parser is okay um I'll get to the prompt in a second but the open AI um conversational component here is going to use the uh the GPT 40 model um and yeah and that'll Send It On Through To the output so now if I go to the prompt um this this is where it can get uh get kind of fun you know where you can you can put some things in um for the prompt I actually am going to cheat a little bit here I do have um you know some prompt rules that are that are pre-typed here um I'm just going to go ahead and paste those in but basically um you're a personal shopping assistant for the Astra Apparel Store um Shoppers will ask you to help find certain products and you are limited to provide the product information for Astro apparel's products and you may not use data from other sources that's important you got to you got to set some guard rails with uh you know some of these some of these models um but but prompt engineering is is a fascinating thing in and of itself I mean I I could go ahead here and say you must answer like you are a pirate and it' be like you know and then kind of kind of and it will do that we we've actually been finding the same thing um which is there's a lot that you can put into into a through engineering that can really give far superior results on the on the out like you said if you want to do it in a pirate voice it'll do it but more more interesting you know if you put things like make sure you use you in the result third person it will do that and it will sound great um by the way you're using chat GPT 40 um we found that actually to be phenomenal in terms of the results but also the performance too it is well worth check out yeah no I absolutely agree all right so that should be the last piece of this that I need um if I go ahead and um hit the uh the play Arrow here this should all build up there we go oh green check marks all around all right all right so now I can have a look at the playground here um and if you remember the question that I put in that it kind of started with was can you help me find a purple shirt and it's like sure here are the purple shirts available at Astro apparel um and it has um basically it's it's coming back with um I I put inputed one of the products that um we use as a booth shirt um earlier this year and it's it's like all purple with a little graph Vector thing on it but uh yeah um and then I can ask for more information on any of these options um you know so I could say tell me more about the medium shirt I think that's the only definable difference maybe this isn't such a hot example I could go ahead and uh and run that and it should um you know come back and maybe give me a little more information here let's see certainly here are the details for the medium oh oh okay it didn't limit it to the the purple shirt so yeah you know it did off for medium it gave you all the options it did do medium that's true that's true yeah yeah oh you're right I may need to give it some more some more parameters um but um let now now that I've I've kind of we've kind of built our our AI assistant um let me show you the uh you know the other cool part is is how you can how you can integrate this as well um so if I click on the on the API button down here um you'll see what it does is it um it gives me a cur request that's uh you know for an HTTP post so that I can send my shopping messages into this you know from whatever service and it'll go ahead and uh and bring them back um so what I have here is a um a Java front end that that I've built using using voden um I know there's probably better ways to to build a front end but um you know at my at at my core I'm a Java guy so that's what I I tended to fault to but um you know here as you can see I've got my shopping assistant controller and it's pulling in the the langlow URL um along with a bearer token that I'll I'll pass as a header variable and really my um my shopping assistant is pretty simple it's just you know I have an Astra image um and um you know I have a a like a message list and a message input and then a listener that just kind of kind of sends a lot of this through um and that's I mean it's pretty simple there's there's not a whole lot of complicated code here so what I can do is I can say run as and I'll go to my run configurations and yes I know I'm one of the few people left on Earth who prefers Eclipse over over vs code I might lose some of my nerd crit on that one but I've I've been using eclipse for like 15 years and I just I don't want to use anything else hey as long as it works I I haven't seen a clipse in years either all right let me add the URL and then I can go back here as well I'm going to generate a new token and copy that um and then I can go back here and I can paste it in and we'll apply and run all right so now if I did that right ah look at that we have our our Astro apparel chatbot okay so I can say um let's see here can you help me find a hoodie so now this is this is um sending that request out to my um my instance of uh you know my Vector database and uh and Lang flow and with any luck it'll come back with a oh hey look at that certainly here are the hoodies available at Astro apparel um well you know I guess I could have done a better job on the uh the chat output here to uh to maybe convert some of this uh some of this markdown language that it's coming back but uh but yeah you know we have a data Stacks black hoodie and oh a vintage MVP 2015 hoodie how about that you know so then I could say hey tell me more about the 2015 m VP hoodie all right and let's see this process a little and here we go officially known as the data stack vintage 2015 hoodie is a special edition hoodie giv out to MVPs at the 2015 datax Cassandra Summit warmth and comfort making it a cozy choice for any occasion that's pretty awesome right there that is awesome to say it awesome to say and that's and a couple of things that's great about this and why using langlow gives you sort of that flexibility as a developer is you can incorporate things like a tone of voice oh yeah in the response that you're getting back which you're seeing there like you know it's a cozy Choice maybe you don't want to use Co cozy you maybe use a different word and you can do that too replace words and emit words um and I think the other thing is what you're showing here is just incredible flexibility from what can be built AI chat Bots don't have to live in the bottom right hand corner of every single screen that you have on your sites and app if you want to put them inline flow above the fold with the ux that you're presenting on the rest of the site there's nothing that says you can't do that try it out see what works for your customers usually trying to keep it in context with what they're doing rather than moving over might be a good choice but that's the beauty of using this you have that choice to determine what works best for you and your customers for sure for sure all right I guess I can I can stop sharing now um oh hey and then you and I are back to normal all right super cool good stuff well hey um you know really just let me say Ali thank you so much for uh for coming out and uh and joining me in this this conversation and uh you know kind of talking about um you know some Trends with AI that we're that we're seeing in retail and e-commerce um and and thank you so much for being a good sport I know the last time we tried to do this the uh the the presentation software kind of kind of bit us a little bit so I I really appreciate you you coming back a second time around and uh and you know helping me helping me get this out here so an absolute pleasure eron I'm so great glad for thank you for inviting me and I'm glad I was here and and thank you for everybody for coming back and joining us as well we hope you found that uh informal insightful and fun absolutely yeah yeah all right um well I guess that's about it um unless there are any questions that um that anyone's asked here um I see Michelle's posted the resource link um I think the only other question I see is someone asked about specifically about which llm model and that was the you know text 3 embedding small um and then the chat for chat GPT 40 for for conversation yeah um you know I I guess I could add to that and just say that um you know you don't you don't need to be you don't don't feel like you need to use um you know chat gpt's models or or open ai's models if you don't want to um if you prefer an open source approach I've had some really good experiences using um using hugging faces models um and and a lot of them are are just as good and they perform really well um and you can get a um a free account with hugging face that um you know will kind of get you around some rate limiting as well so yeah it's definitely a viable Choice our Engineers have been finding the same thing they actually will go out and evaluate not just the common models like an open AI or an anthropic or something like metal Lama but they've been looking at many of those very very Niche and specific open source models that are very good doing one particular thing um and that's what they've been going for as well so they've not been holding back on any particular one platform at all right right uh oh looks like we have a couple other questions coming in you know someone asks um Andrew says um how can we work on continuously improving the results um you know with like you know with testing and refi refinement um I think that's uh yeah that's definitely something that that needs that um you know you you'd need to do you know one thing that that I find helps a lot too is um you know kind kind of like you mentioned Ali with some of the the the rules and guard rails and tone that you can put into your prompt engineering that's certainly a way that you can you can help um influence your results you know to uh kind of better fit your context a little bit um yeah um I yeah I mean I'm sure others will have ideas for any specific automation tools to to evaluate for that in many cases we've been finding you will need to get a human here to be able to check it um make sure it's on brand that it sounds right for example some of the early work their R Engineers were doing with respect to text Generation Um we were finding it was using a lot of superlatives and things like that a lot and a lot of buzzwords which it kind of it actually starts to become repetitive and not very con ing you start to being like this output looks like AI when it should be sounding like a human really many cases you need a human to be able to check for that and then tweak on back you how you're doing your prompt engary yep no yeah definitely definitely let's see another one here um should we use common llms like chat GPT for this kind of task or use task sorry task specific um and Tiny llms um you know that that's a that's a really great question and that's kind of the way that um this kind of brings out the way that I I kind of see Enterprise adoption of um you know gen and llms coming is that you'll see a lot of you'll see places that'll start maybe with a with a common model but you'll see them move eventually I think to uh to more like custombuilt um llms you know it'll just um you know like like for instance there there's a there's a a project I'm working working on with my uh with my wife right now um you know and she's into um like holistic healing and um crystals and things like that well I I kind of built a um a crystal identifying app um so it'll identify like different properties of of crystals and things it'll identify it by images um and it's using um hugging one of hugging Face's clip models to do that um contrastive language image pre-training I think is what clip stands for uh but the but the idea though is that that model has not just been trained on pictures of crystals it's been trained on like pictures of dogs and cats and cars and and kind of everything and you know eventually we might get to a point where we want better results then maybe it's time to bust out P torch and kind of train together our own Crystal specific model and maybe get some better results that way yeah we we envision a very similar thing in the retail side of things especially like you said at the Enterprise level you know big Brands and retailers they aren't going to share their product catalog and other things um with a publicly available llm that's just not going to happen so we and some larger organizations are already doing this and more will follow which is they'll take a common model um and then and and then train it inhouse essentially with their data that they can then use that is relevant to them and is not being either leveraged by the competition or doesn't take into account their competition anyway um and so yeah we're seeing a similar thing happen in the retail site yep y all right so let's see do we need to copy the entire product database into a vector database or could you have just used an existing like product API oh yeah you absolutely could have um could have used like a like a product API to get a lot of that information um I don't know about a specific like component or adapter inside of um inside a langlow for that you know there there might be one um but you could certainly write a custom loader to pull together a CSV from from a um exactly whether whether it's coming from a pin or or an Erp system or something like that most of those will support the standard apis whether it's rest API graph ql if they don't have a direct connector in any way and you'll be able to call and retrieve data that way if not just do a good old fashioned retrieve the CSV data in that way and use it they they all support this so it can absolutely but be done to to to basically um fuel your rag development yep all right well I think that just about does it for our questions um hey Ali one more time thank you so much for uh for joining me this is this has been really great um really enjoyed the conversation likewise it was so good to be here and I hope to see you again soon yeah hey you too all right hey thanks everyone bye bye take care everybody",
