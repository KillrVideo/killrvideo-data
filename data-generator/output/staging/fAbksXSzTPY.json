    "text": "good morning on this late in the week Thursday I am going to get back into some of the Cassie's schema migrator today now I've got a lot of different things to talk about just getting right back into it so let's get to split going on here and just talk about some of where we were and where we've been here's the repo cassie schema migrator github.com slash adrienne slash cassie schema migrator we have a project in here which we've been using to keep track of things and been making some progress and working on time I think this and this are the two things we've been working on the user wants to process cql files for schema migration user one cql files to be executed in order by date time so let's uh just actually click through Sinese could've sworn I had one specifically assigned to me so let's look at that real quick so that build for applications our documentation for application determine outputs I feel like maybe we should set up the build today or at least try to let's jump into the code and see where some of that was I need some fixings real quick repositioning the IDE right now there we go all right Cassie scheme migrator consists of the core lib test core lib Cassie console so far we have what we have here migration exists we have the path that determines so I believe all that exists and one of the practice that I actually want to start here all right so we got we got some tests and got a fair bit of helpers which I started putting together to build up the test tear down the test because we need a little bit of an environment setup to do these tests so if I go in sir can I just click and run run all tests yeah run unit tests Oh looks like okay we got next success aborted her if I selected path file does not exist or is true expected true got false migration fogs is let's come back and look at that this is a good way to good way to start is to start with your tests to see if the tests even work so setup migration for tests I set the path create that directory create a list add this range of items to that list and then I create those file dot create and then return to migration now let's do this and this come on put in the debug symbol yeah anyway that's right click and do it alright well let me break point there but if we go into let's do the tests let's actually take a look at one of those oh is it still running is that the problem that could be no that's not still running okay all right let's do there's my list of filed process this is kind of like got all of them combined together so let's yeah let's do that so just right-click here I just want to run the 1 unit test I don't do that yeah there we go debug the 1 unit test there we go so now steps and let's go to let's go to this declaration of this and it will run to to run to here so we got migrations migrations directory migrations migration path and migrations create these is empty and let's run it let's run to this statement run to statement so that means yeah all of these are but directory migrations could not get class of a type a class is not loaded okay this is a problem I mean you can't get a class of strings in a list yeah that's super weird so maybe string.c let's go okay got a breakpoint there important that let's stop running first that is super strange string so there's a system one with the uppercase and then there's this other one which is always kind of confusing exactly what everybody wants you to use because it doesn't it's not supposed to be it's not supposed to matter though that method should be uppercase sure let's rename that is the other one that way yep all right there we go so let's run that's available and he says let's get into this one again I'm going to get to here though debug unit test for this unit test whatever matter okay so now I should be getting into there very shortly [Music] that created but I want to undo that and just check it out again so let's do it with regular old string and try that again if it says test test succeeded alright nyan cat is running let's see where we get here cannot get a class of the type really all right so again that seems like a really stupid error I think that shouldn't wouldn't think that should occur it should go to either or tight I guess maybe it depends on the interface that that one actually inherits from for the base object okay so that's that's not working either you know all this stuff okay to the docks my last English nativist new string array this provider no cat okay I don't know how that's gonna play so that should be okay oh do I need to do far oh but it's listed up okay it's created up there as an out program [Music] we but it returns so this unknown type but it says it right there list string Oh what I instantiated here I can't be doing that so this needs to be no let's try that and then let's try this actually yeah all right you're still not gonna let's stop that and rerun the test because I was recreating it when this is this access to the declaration here in the out so I shouldn't need to recreate it right how about I need to yeah that's tricky I wonder if I should do let's do this and do this what's it fussing about the turn migration path right so to return the string that is the migration path and then this create these well is that gonna that's a bad design pattern but this is a test so like the design patterns even matter I don't know let's do this or create these equals new list strained of it uh and then we're just getting the create these what am i do it create these oh right should I do so like I should do maybe a public property of the create these oh wait list string create these kit create the ad Gator yeah there we go so get I do this again let's do the auto implement properties while you get set jeez public can I do this I know we're gonna find out that does make the test all inclusive here so that's kind of good I don't like that design pattern at all though okay so let's let's get into that see if that actually gives us the variable or I should say the list of list array there's not even arrays just list object it's got squiggly lines everywhere still is anything happening did it bomb out do not build oh yeah I've got all this all busted up let's look at teardown again now I should have used a refactor during it because yeah now it's just migration path stuff like over here you dip that one let's get rid of that it does cleanup I mean it's always no no it's not okay I don't know what that means but we'll figure it out in a second so that needs fixed this needs removed yeah I should have used to refactor would have fixed all that for me and that doesn't need to be there all right let's run this puppy now see where we get it it's gonna run all of them nyan cat scooting along for us then stopped its running it's not stopped I feel like I'm missing a status of what's actually occurring did it die again what the fubar I broke on another one that's what it probably did it's let's just do the one test like we should still running okay god it takes forever whoa what where oh do I need to crap that is super nasty yeah like the static let's do this let's so it's the value isn't being instantiated but on since your c-sharp static class constructor so you just say okay static something class let's back over here what did it say just said oh yeah okay so static test helpers so that'll create it it'll have no none none of this stuff in Auto property can be made get only why is that it's not set create these Oh cuz it's okay let's try that let's try and get on anyone because he writes but oh you're only getting the object but then the object itself is having the things added not okay that's kind of confusing but I get it all right so let's try that again and that one really takes forever build of this one test it's kind of ridiculous it makes me wonder if there is a way to speed up the tests in jetbrains rider and if not what actually makes the test run fast can I run it faster from the CLI or from Visual Studio code that is that is my question don't really want to switch I want to use rider for a while and kind of get used to it it's a mill you're with the inner workings of it or I should say the workings of its features and capabilities but at some point I will swap out and try some other ones like see visual studio code maybe even dive in and do some windows dev on it be a visual studio but right now I'm just just using Jed range Rider I'm gonna stick to that for a while longer still did it just not run oh it's sitting there okay so it says nine items in and they're blah blah blah this long thing and stuff okay so then get down to this create point keep running I do just say keep running I don't even know there isn't a keep running button them say Auto Start tastes on all tests successful test felt a supported test come on group by laps all jump to source over moves I can't spin test maybe this no that runs the whole damn thing dad burn it just wanted to keep running resume execution I remove that so let's forget that yeah hello world works freaking great let's debug all the unit tests oh so it's not no not no actually let's do not empty right verify migration files do not exist oh these two I need to actually let's let's comment this out this is actually the next stage of what I needed to work on that's why those tests failed left those failing tests for me to figure out so let's take this one commented I thought I was gonna come in it stopped running what's the comment Control Alt / what Oh God okay so where's the other test that passed the one that verified past verify path available exist okay we do that that's good then we need to verify migration colleges files exist I'll do not exist okay so let's do verify migration files exist set up migrations for test and file system migration path search through so that that should actually be true let's debug that real quick because the test is supposed to run the file selection object that's supposed to be picking this list of files to execute for our schema migration so the migrations should exist but they don't exist right because that needs implement it doesn't it all right go to all right how I stopped running the test oh it stopped but it's such it mmm not sure about this sometimes so path selector let's rename that to pad selector to follow the convention all right so file selection file selection and path selector operation migrations exist ah ok so what is implemented alright this is one of those weird if-then-else statements so it's gonna return a bool let's see what it does tonight this although they do exist now because oh I see what I need to do the core love is verified migration files do not exist so if I migration files exist that works oh that's that okay so I was looking at that one but that one that works okay so we had verify migration files exist or if I selected path available so that one passes it says let's try that again oh right so that should give me the current directory instead of that path that does not exist even though it's passed it yep okay that works so this is the one that don't work right here and it shouldn't so it's your verify my creation files do not exist so let's do here and we need we need the thing that basically says [Music] you bore setting up yes setting up and then we're going to do yet that and if they don't work else yeah so if that else don't create things well let's let's do it smart like use the refactor to change signature add type bull I don't know what it's doing that again refactor James signature add boolean do that we'll call it setting up modifier is what it's like a no modifier can I just go let's go bowl over here bull yes next so that's what I want the value to be now okay so that edited here already added it right there invert it's inverted oh that's I'd rather have them nesting and read the nesting another thing if you miss it you don't realize it beeps out of the method alright so now we're over here and yep see it refactor actually but true in here for us all of them are set to true for now but we want to do the verify that do not exist so don't build so let's run that sucker and it passes alright so that's all good networks so now uncomment this puppy holding o inspect no I guess I can't do it from right click pace of code I want to uncomment comment with line comment comment with block and that control alt / undo it will see ya okay so control it / undoes it - all right so now this one doesn't have this we want to put the files there this time and then we want to we basically want to make sure that we have this and yet a test create these well but that's not we want to do we want to actually test and verify that oh yeah so let's here files it so I call in here we go let's do all system file system you do that you want to do this file systems or a file system file system dot yes so let's do bowels proc files for now I don't know if that's the best name and that's gonna be a list and that actually needs to be compared to I think I can do sir to equal let's do that compare it to test helpers great T's so the files that we expect to create should be the files that are here let's get in here and we'll create the property sure but we don't need do a list it's false election we'll do a list of path operation path migrations exist so in so did I need the same code in each of those a path selector a path selector so now I need to instantiate this park cause property and the thing Oh actually I don't need to do it here I need to do it I select your operations path migrations exist yes or no get that figured out operations path it's just setting that well so I should do it process it then mmm so now what I'm curious about is so good Falls like if I have this function and pass that in and I pass in the operations path to do to set fra files to that and files so if I go in and do it get files great message there we go I don't even need to do that actually because I have access to that method so just to get Falls this will be equal new list string or should I return a list of yeah it should just be a list of strings because then I need to step through those and actually process them but right now we're just trying to get a solid list of them so we'll do return and here we need to set them up so let's edit rename the name to match there yeah all right so now that's green so here I'm just adding the range oh this this I'm adding arbitrarily and then I'm doing father created so so I need to do basically this operations at there we go no recent spat but I'll need to create the directory I do this and then directory dot get files I wonder if I if there's like just a list they get files whoops it falls all info files equals that and so do for each bar thing in info files and let's do that so then yeah we'll do files died add all dot name oh come on damn it this team right so I want to do I want to end it add it to the end of it like Falls never used but I'm trying to do fall diet Oh yes no hmm all right so what the heck is this this is what I'll fall info array turns it follows from the current directory so what is that all I just want to list it all the files maybe I need to do that then I do that for each fall in line so files ah file info no so I need to do for four or hi equals zero I is less than file info files dot length I plus plus so we got now we can do it so we do files dot ahead Wow info files whatever in the index point no dot is it full name it's a full path of the directory file name gets the it's the name of the thing directory name is like a string representation of directories full path well let's full name it's to string do to string let's try that so to see how this function works okay so that puts that together and returns false actually let's get rid of this you don't want that we wanted to have the actual function because we want to get it at time of use we don't want it to be a property where he just whimsically go connect to it that's that's silly talk but in the constructor we do want this path set up initially and then we can do get files ok now this makes sense but now we do need to add the filter let's just get this oh did I know it I guess it's a private public get files there we go ok so now let's run all the tests alright we're cooking don't come back here I want to get here what is that did it another nice situation though I just stopped whatever well there we go okay just needs to go away it's like stuff is out of sync there we go failed assert oh it stopped everything I wanted to look at it let's do this so we can see them easily and we need to do this totally forgot to be that far result equals file system die it falls we call it test no one Falls so we do test helpers whoops test helpers dot create these and this will be that one known the files and this will be result or should I flip them around well whatever expected yeah result actual known files yeah yeah yeah that's what we want so let's get to that point let's run that one again debug unit test all right so what we got here I've known fall crazies nine is it saying so does that that's a list of strings and this is a list of strings that order is as such which is not ordered [Music] so we're gonna need a word room it's one thing we do need to do so that might be the next thing so let's just do result that count yeah known files count see how that goes because really we don't need to test that intimately that the thing is exactly the same we just need to know that we got all the files that we were after okay so that should come up in a second here and B should be all green right ending running all these others you access our a success and what do we got we got counting on cap so that should be fine yes so now let's let's get these puppies sorted so now to keep keep runnin keep runnin stupid thing and make it good now it's still running so here the other thing it builds the other thing but if I do the test it's so unbelievably frustrating anyway stop stop running and let's just go here on all tests in solution and let's try that yeah that does it here and that should clean up this messy thing it goes I don't need that one Explorer that's cool okay and then alright these should pop up and verify it just a second unbelievably long time to run though know what cannot exit cannot access copy copy fada migrations why is it being used by another process it's dumb it's running again that works and just all their multi to probably running them all out of whatever sequence and they can step on each other because they're using the same underlying files hmm that makes me wonder so to make these isolated tests I would to meet need to make sure the configuration path is actually unique per test so that's another problem for another day to fight through yeah all right so let's get this say fact public void verify list of files to process list of files actually to verify process files are ordered all right so first thing we'll need to do is we want to get migration path set that up with the Falls and then we want to make sure that these known Falls are ordered so I'm basically gonna write this test twice so let's hear test helpers okay then so test helpers test uppers I order known Falls and test ordered order created balls under that it's far result people's so let's hear let's learn was to c-sharp order list Betty there's just like a function or something [Music] that's a nice let's go look at it whoa you're thinking about there no no I don't sign that geeks for geeks oh you can do a compare interesting [Music] so let's just go with plain sort and see what we get here so really I don't even need to do that that's and that's good I don't want to gonna have to implement more stuff so I put the test date in there and get it done so let's do test pumpers dots whoops great these Falls and then I sort yeah all right we can assert equal to basically it's a test above [Music] it's kind of crap put that in and then we'll do file select create these with sort and we need to get rid of the count and the count well let's do oh yeah do a couple of these so we need to do for our I equals well actually we need to do it's your if results dot count it's equal to known files dot count count then this happens else throw new not know throw new Oh multicast platform what would he get here road and it fall something a new file file not found exception sure let's do that and then say files expected or not found oh I account expected one that fell yeah ok should throw an exception in a test really that's kind of blowing up stuff you've used structural navigation please shut ok so then over here I'm gonna do four actually did I need to check that if just blow it up it's just it's just gonna air it I don't need all that crap yet let's just do the four statements a for VAR i 0 i is less than let's do known files dot counts Oh interesting downfalls needs to should still get it done no false don't count know what his known files become hidden files sort said act on the things in it I guess count okay and then I plus plus oh yeah it is deep duh so so then known Falls zero or index cert taught equal known falls under weight result index point equals known Falls come back there's no files the same index point because it should literally be the same ordered thing it's good to hear see what happens I mean it shouldn't pass because I didn't order this because it it needs to be ordered in the get files is what needs to be done well there we go something what do we got there it's a result it's nine nine as expected in this one let's take a look at all these files actively see if they're actually in order so one two five eight twelve twelve sixteen two three and okay that's not an order Oh question then how do we order these looks like this is a bit more than and they're not quite sorted it's sorted by the first digit but these should be it's a 421 you know - that should be like first so I guess maybe maybe we should take the dates off and then sort the dates or sort the files by dates but then we got to have a map and yeah that's just sorting by yeah okay so the month there is four so I need to the month can't be sorted unless I take the month and sort the month okay so that means that I need to have some way to sort the files based on parsing the month first and then oh that's tricky that is super tricky so yeah that's a little brutal so we're gonna have to have a way to sort based on month and the month needs to be parsed because the regular sort function isn't going to be able to parse that some may be looking back at this help file of what to do with these I can use an interface comparer to parse it based on date like this thing so if I do class and he's like it's an Eric here just like this I say file name file name we're int X and int Y R and then do you the comparison but have the date processed first theoretically theoretically that'll work I'm not 100% sure there's the official docs on this oh yeah there we go this is basically what we're gonna want I compare box that's not just training the main method is provided only to show how to implement the interface it is recommended to derive from compare T instead of implementing icomparer T all right so our hour is up by a few minutes so the deal is tune in next time and I'll have a pull request we'll have a pull request I don't know so that's I just looked that's not in that framework for eight I wonder if core even works the same might better check but anyway next time we're either gonna have a pull request or we're gonna straight-up solve this sort problem for the file list because the file list definitely needs to be sorted per the date time in there the other thought is we take the file list as it is okay we read it all in but I build objects with the cql that needs to be executed right and the file named appropriately parsed and attached to the object with the code that needs to be executed okay and then I sort those objects which can be more intelligently sorted because then they gotta have properties that would have the various dates already parsed out and ordered appropriately so that's probably what we're going to do but tune in next time and we'll find answers so until then have a good one cheerio [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
