    "text": "hello everyone Hi Betina hey good morning Alex good morning everybody very good to see you all yeah great day today very much great day today we have last day last workshop last Workshop of series yes it's the last it's hard to believe it was such a long way and now we have all these people still with us that's great that's amazing thank you so much for for being with us throughout the whole eight weeks that's the 16th workshop for us today and um it's the grand finale where we bring our application to the cloud and we have some theory for you today and some practicals where we show you how this actually works supporting the application to Cloud so thanks very much for joining us yeah today is very special topic today we work on the really application into the cloud and we are going to do a lot of things with Google compute platform and to be more specific Google kubernetes engine but also with some other services as well and just few words before we start so that's bentina suon our developer Advocate and maybe you've seen me already Alex WN developer Advocate as well but behind us there is a very big team so don't think like there are only two people for you but all the developer Advocate special unit here to help you depending on their time zones let's not forget our other helpers from data Stacks right we very often get Yoshi from Japan and Jeremy from Australia helping us as well so a big thank you to those who help answering questions on Discord and YouTube so thanks very much yep good so let's review where where we did we start look with how far we've come right so first we were weeks one to where we covered the aachi Cassandra fundamentals and data modeling and we asked you to do a lot of work in terms of um video watching and reviewing then we put some of it into practice by building um crud Services vest microservices in week three and four in several languages mainly Java and python we then took you on a real sort of like two to fource showing you what cassander looks like and kubernetes introducing these new Concepts to some you know or to a lot of people New Concepts like Docker and kubernetes and then how we use the cast operator to manage um Cassandra in kubernetes we then showed you how to deploy our application into kubernetes um we documed our UI and our backend we roll it out we connected to Astra and to the uh kubernetes cassander installation that we had managed by the cast operator and last week uh David and um team we showed you all the the various methods that you have to stress test uh your application um simulate load simulate data in order to understand how it actually behaves under load and this week we want to make your applications really cloud native so let's go away from the development system that we use with kind and really roll it into the cloud and make it publicly accessible so you can share it with your friends and let them let them play with uh this application and connect to asra and today we are going to do this in uh Google Cloud um platform as an example there are other opportunities and other other Solutions available but we just had to stick one to for the example we had to choose one and we we do not ask ask you to do it with us at the same time because there are setup steps involved but we give you all the instructions so that you can do it in your own time after the workshop yep and don't be afraid to do it after the workshop like so so many people are trying to do it live by while we are showing something and they are distracting distracted why because we're afraid we will not help them after the workshop is done and that's wrong we have Community dat sts.com we have Discord so even if you are doing exercises after the workshop you still completely may have our help absolutely we are here to help you and um we're here to help you live now but as Alex said after the workshop we can stay on Discord I personally like it when you put your questions into community. data.com because then other people can learn from your questions and from your answers and we have a little bit more of a reference but these Avenues are totally available for you if you want help after after the workshop and please please ask us yeah we want you to be uh trying this out and develop your own applications so we're looking forward to that good I think we really need to address this early on and probably a few times during the workshop certification vouchers a lot of people are really really keen on getting these vouchers and what needs to happen so you get them so in order to get a voucher you will receive an early next week an email with your coupon right oops so make sure that you fill in the form that's required that comes with the email so you can uh request this coupon so it's um yeah don't miss this step look out for the email if you don't get the email you can always get in touch with us on Discord especially or email Jack frer directly so we want to help you you will not miss out on your coupon okay okay so let's have a look so we streaming today on YouTube and twitch there were a couple of technical issues in the workshop that you did yesterday so bear with us uh if you run into this again let us know if this font is too small if you're not seeing it properly or if the screen is Frozen that happened a few times yesterday we will want to work on it and get it right for you uh we stream on Twitch as well we answer your questions YouTube Discord and as said before you can always go to Comm we will be using Astra today but very very little uh just to complete our full demo cycle where we enter our details through the UI in our example but other than that we don't use asra very much today and all the instructions are published on GitHub uh for today and we've put a lot of screenshots in there so hopefully you find it easy to follow along if you do it um after the workshop um uh let's go into a cloud computing overview where we present you basically what is cloud and you know what uh what do we mean by that what other terminology and this is a this is a common joke there isn't really any Cloud right it's just someone El's computer it's someone else's Hardware installation data center um you know all managed for you so oh that's sorry sorry sorry sorry MH so the the big thing about cloud is that you basically have computer system resources at your fingertips it's on demand it's available and it's usually actually really affordable and you do not have the management overhead so you do not need to take care of power supplies cooling um installation uh upgrades and uh management and all these kind of things so it's um something that was first created by Amazon and has become famous as Amazon web services with their first elastic cloud computing and now we have several players and the biggest are Amazon and um Microsoft with Azure and Google Cloud platform and these are the three that we go into more details there are others and I'm sure there will be others in the future uh because this is really a growing Marketplace the principles um it is on demand it is self-service you do not have to talk to a salesperson to get access um you can it's usually very publicly available with good network access it's very elastic you can scale it horizontally vertically in terms um and you can scale it down it is uh very very fair pricing typically it's really what you use and it comes of as well with that you're sharing the resources you're basically getting time slices or slices of larger Computing resources and so this is other people might be using exactly the same machine at the same time and this is all this sharing is all managed by the cloud provider and the advantages I think I mean really cost savings it might appear expensive right but if you compare it with in buying the hardware yourself installing it managing Etc um you really can get access to some very powerful resources um at a fraction of the cost that you would need to have spent sort of like 10 years ago um in order to have it on premise um security is solved for you it's very flexible it's accessible from lots of different places Disaster Recovery is handled um you know there's there's guards again against data loss and catastrophic losses of your applications the updates and uh often you have a lot of different uh monitoring and logging solutions that help you to gain insight into what is actually happening in this what is ultimately a remote remote resource right so these are these are the biggest advantages uh from my side I would add a little bit like from my professional background uh I would add for for most of the companies uh we communicated regarding the clouds the biggest uh benefits were first like imagine you have one or two times per year uh like the highest amount of consumers of clients uh like I don't know if it's a e-commerce we can speak of a Black Friday and then um Christmas uh and all the things like that so you have the highest pressure and a lot of visitors but in the other days the amount of pressure of your on your production maybe three times less or four times less but you have to be ready to work with uh all these black Fridays and whatever events happening you have to be ready all the time so basically you are paying you are or not having enough infrastructure to handle Black Friday or you have too powerful infrastructure for the most of the time so clouds give us some very serious elastic today I want to have 1,000 application servers running boom I have them and tomorrow I don't need them anymore because I don't know it's Sunday and everyone is sleeping and boom and I have 200 applications servers and I'm not paying for these 800 that's amazing that's first thing and second thing what also yeah yeah go on please and usually you can spin this up very quickly right you do not have to plan this a month and ahead and say on that Sunday I will need exra resource no you can just go and and add it in right yeah well of course it depends on the workload and kind of the servers you are working with but in general yes uh if you did everything right um then it should be spawnable and the commission it in just some seconds then uh second point was it was just really cool for us for very many clients it was just great possibility to have data center in a very far away city um to have some deployments in completely different country in the uh United States if we are speaking about Europe or in Australia and we can have our data center and applications where with ease with no problems deploying any kind of applications all over the world beforehand with mostly on premises things uh or at least manually manageable uh servers it was not so easy to organize so that was the be best features from our side cool so deployment models it's just a couple of terms really so um public cloud is basically what we' just of like started to cover uh private Cloud it's also common right so that you organize your on premise resources in such a way that um they are they function like a cloud for you they're almost like a you know a remote Cloud but they're all under private management um hybrid Cloud where you mix those two approaches and potentially for example deploy your Cassandra database into into both these uh these clouds multicloud same reason you don't NE necessarily want to be just put all your eggs into one basket and just be on AWS you might want to be on some other clouds as well in order to minimize the risk of a single vendor so um so these are different terms that you might come across um uh when talking about clouds and it's worth asking the questions right what do you really mean right what kind of and as I just sort of mentioned cassander fits very well into these deployments because we already have the concept of the data center uh that allows you you know to deploy into different into different regions in different availability zones or into different clouds so it fits really well this model and then to take it a little bit further drill in to demystify the whole term of cloud um uh there are different aspects of the clouds that you might want to use right and there are a couple of terms that come up in this context one is infrastructure as a service which really relates to the infrastructure uh the networking architecture everything related really to your to your bare metal hardware installations then we have um platform as a service which is one level up which is um already has the run times in order to run new applications that has the various languages installed uh so at the operating system so it's it has the middle there it has the additional layers that you need in order to provide uh to deploy your application and then on top is something that we actually use every every day in our daily lives now is software as a service if you think about all the different cloud services that you might use that be using at the moment you know we have GitHub we have um Google um email we have Google Drive we have we might use Spotify and and photo applications every all these are examples of software as a service or for example data sex AST is software as a service that ad that uh everything is handled for you you just bring your own usage you're the user you bring your data uh you bring your configuration perhaps but uh you do not need to take care of the management and the all the plumbing underneath in order to make that to work so there's a couple more examples as you said AWS Azure Google Cloud platforms are currently the biggest players in the infrastructure as a service but there are you know rack spaces in there so there's other other providers and I'm there will be more uh than in the application um stack here we've got app engine for example we've got um elastic bean store we've got Euro which I believe is part of Salesforce open shift Etc so these are examples of um the platform as a service and then you know the examples for software as a service they're really really countless we have a lot of them uh I would like to make three very very simple and short examples so if it's not going so easy for you I want to explain in just a couple of words infrastructure as a service cloud provider is when you go to this cloud provider and tell give me a server in this uh Europe West one Frankfurt or whatever Paris and I will deploy my operating system I will put my own application and it will work with my clients so you ask for sorry oh yeah okay that's a good slide as well so we exactly just just keep talking Al yeah so for infrastructure as a service you ask for a server when with platform as a service you say this is my application Cloud provid your cloud provider please put it somewhere and when I will work with this application and my clients will work with this application so you don't care of the operating system any runtime things you care about your application there and then software as a service uh then you just can assuming something will delivered by our company like in our example you can run Cassandra on your own uh with uh with whatever your data center you are using but you also can go to Astra and Astra is a Cassandra as a service in this case you don't care of the servers you don't care of the um operating systems you don't care of the application of a Cassandra by itself it's taken care by data stocks so that's the best example of software as a service okay thank you thank you very much for making it clearer so and this is just don't don't get your glasses out this is uh not meant to be red it's just sort of shows you a little bit variety it's what is available in these clouds um and in these offerings so it's it's huge and I'm sure it's growing there is a very good qu there is a very good question in YouTube chat can we call can we call GitHub P platform as a service no GitHub is exactly the example of software as a service because it hosts uh GitHub repositories so when you communicate with uh software as a service you use API of this software in this case we use G to work with GitHub and GitHub could have been a platform as a service uh but in this case you should be uh the one to install something on this platform so you would be the one to install like git uh mirror rep or there and take care of that so no GitHub is a very good example of software as a service exactly and also um I think these Storage Solutions like S3 or um Google storage uh these are all software as a service right Google Drive because you don't you don't deal with any of the uh the run times underneath or the um you know the operating system so you're basically using a fully configured application right you bring you still bring your own data and your own usage yeah that's absolutely fine right but it is really already software as a service that's why I think it's actually so much part of our daily lives now we don't even we don't even recognize this anymore right so um there's another term containers as a service uh which you didn't have in the pyramid before but it kind of sits on top of the platform as a service um where you know where there are certain Services here like virtualization and devops tools like chef and then the various components that we require in order to successfully deploy containers right so kubernetes and Docker for example and so let's go into a little bit the uh the different providers and we will zoom in on um AWS Azure and Google Cloud platform we cannot cover everything these are the biggest you see I mean Amazon has by far the biggest market share Amazon had a real Head Start um in compared to everybody else the started early something seven years ahead of of people Microsoft of came up at as a next player and has quot out quite a bit Google and Alibaba for example that's really growing and then there's a um you know there more more coming up but it's um that's really the picture how it looks today and the revenue is um there is a lot of Revenue basically in this offering and I think it will attract more players but um Amazon is really dominating then again Microsoft Google and the other players and what is interesting here that is mainly infrastructure as a service and software as a service that are really bringing in the main Revenue uh so platform as a service that's sort of growing slowly uh it's growing and but uh we anticipate that with the how popular kubernetes is getting that this will increase in the future so let's talk a little bit about AWS so all the cloud providers public their availability zones and regions um you know as a you know as a benefit to you in terms of to bring your your availability Zone close to your application and close to what you want to be doing but also as a sort of like to demonstrate the spread um and power of their application or of the offering and so it's you know mainly North America and you see that Africa and uh South America we see this picture everywhere that this is really lagging behind but we expect changes uh this might already I think someone picked us up yesterday in the workshop that this is already a little bit out of date and it might actually be a different picture already um so things are growing things are coming um currently you can get access to 219 services in AWS I'm sure this will also increase but it's a lot you have a lot of different services and tools at your fingertips so this is what it looks like when you log into the aw Cloud uh console and it gives you an idea of the various services that are available and for example storage um you know there S3 sits in this area um database Services um analytic Services tools whatever you know so we are you know probably most interested in the in the compute services and the storage uh but you know the world is your oyster with these things so you can really explore and get lost in in in the variety that you have there exactly and don't think like that's the all of the services or what AWS provides those are groups of services for example we speak of storage as it's like our data Stacks professional interest and when we speak about AWS storage there is a glass gear there is an S3 and many others actually so there are different kind of storages for different kind of purposes and for every group you are seeing in the screen there will be definitely some services and S so Al together it's like up to 300 different services at this moment exactly so there's a couple that you should know we think um personally you know I haven't really worked that much with AWS um but I've certainly come across those Services I mean first of all this is the one uh to configure to you know get your instances um in structure as a service elastic compute Cloud ec2 um elastic beant stock I haven't worked with this at all but this is um you know the platform as a service offering to to deploy your applications then something that Alex will cover later is functions as a service which are serverless functions Cloud functions uh where you do not need to have any infrastructure at all in order to run those functions we all know S3 I think um if you don't for example the images for the VMS that we that you get for um uh for the data sex academic courses you basically download them from s3e so this is um a very simple accessible storage um then we have different networking Solutions the Russ private cloud is probably the um uh the most prominent there and then of course for the purpose of our um of our Workshop here what is important is the um kubernetes service and the content container service and you will see that a lot of the um Amazon services are prefixed with elastic so you have elastic uh storage you have elastic um um Services elastic analytics these kind of things and then you know how would that look with Cassandra on AWS so and it's basically different layers again of of ease of management so you can just do it all yourself you you get um ec2 instances and you install Cassandra these are just Linux boxes you put Cassandra on them you manage everything yourself you can get pre-build images um where you do not uh need to install it yourself so you can just basically just deploy the image um you can get it from the Amazon Marketplace we used to offer data STX manag service for um Cassandra we now prefer that you go to Astra uh so that um as a more convenient offering uh on UT instances Amazon has also their own Cassandra or cql compliant um um Cassandra like database offering which is Amazon key spaces you can use our drivers for example theander drivers to to connect to them and then in the uh container as a service you can use the cast operator in the elastic kubernetes service and deploy your Cassandra instances this way yep uh one thing to add people often ask like okay uh so many ways to use Cassandra in the cloud on AWS so what's the best one and the there is no simple answer because it very depends on your company approach on your project on your workload how many qualified Engineers do you have if you are a startup maybe and you don't have so many Engineers you may maybe go with Astra because it's like the smallest amount of efforts to make your database running you click the button you have Cassandra and data Stacks Engineers so very qualified people will take care of that but for some companies it may be we want exactly opposite to go as deep as possible and have 100% full own control and then they can go with infrastructure as a service and have their Linux machines there and set up everything including like very deeps of Linux networking and have full control and have the deepest uh whatever configuration they want to have with Cassandra and Linux and whatever application they are using so there is no simple answer and like it very depends on your situation yeah I mean you could for example in here that allows you to install a Cassandra version that you forked right or you have your own you have your own um or an out ofd version that is still in used you know in your company so um so you have the most flexibility here but the trade office you have the management overhead versus here it's been made much much easier for you or here right so it's depends there is there is it really depends on your circumstances okay Azure same picture for Azure what's the spread right what regions availability zones is a similar picture to what we saw with AWS and in fact I don't think we will see significantly different picture for for Google Cloud uh so this is this has a little bit more traction in in Africa at the moment um so it's later came on later four years after after AWS um but it's catching up uh the console looks very similar you have or you know it looks different but it's sort of like the function is similar you have basically groups of different services that you can access again you you probably want to um the ability to get your instances up but then you have a lot of different things that you can plug in and um additional AB action in order to make your life easier so very similar again something I haven't really worked with uh very much and when I prepared the demo for this Workshop I have most experience with Google Cloud platform so I just chose Google Cloud platform for the demo all this should be you should be able to do it all in these different um Cloud the general idea is the same and that's technically one of the benefits on of kubernetes so you may have multiple clouds within the single kubernetes cluster it's not going to be easy to manage Frankly Speaking but it may bring you some benefits if you know what you are doing exactly and then you have the same Services um you know the you get the machines get your instances the infrastructure as a service they have an app service again you have serverless functions um you have kubernetes Services the cloud U the the container support um different storage options again sort of like blob storage for simple storage as we know it from SV for example we have all the networking services that we would expect and need very similar and similar name to what we have from AWS and a um Azure also have or Windows sorry Microsoft they also have a cql compliant database cust so again you can access it via the cassander drivers but the underl implementation is uh is not Cassandra so it's it looks different uh just for the record people ask us is there Cosmos DB a Cassandra the answer is no Cosmos DB is not Cassandra but it uh supports some features of cql exactly and then if you want to deploy cassander on aure it's exactly the same picture as before you have these different this different layers of abstraction and where the management is taken for you again you know you can do it with just the instances install install entirely your version of cassander that you want to have we again have pre-built images we can get managed services from the marketplace or you know I'm not entirely sure whether we offer this still but um we have customers you use data Stacks manage services you can get asra anazur is currently in beta stage but we're working on deploying it fully um you get the Cassandra is access via Cosmos and um you can again deploy via the C operator and in this case Azure kubernetes service oops that was WR okay now Google Cloud it's again a simar picture you know this it's just um it's the youngest kid on the blog started in 2008 um you know has not quite as many regions and availability zones probably as um AWS but is coming app um lots of different Services um it's growing this is a very growing field and I think um personally when I started to look into Google Cloud this was for me the most confusing aspect is all these different services and the flexibility you that you have it's really a combinatorial challenge of like combining these different services and which one to use for which purpose uh so it can really take some time to sort of like go through all these uh different solutions and decide what is best for you um so they are pretty strong in in analytics and um and machine learning and the big data support um you know and those two things working together to get to get the most out of your um data that you store there so there's um there's a lot of interesting stuff happening in Google cloud and constantly adding more um services in order to support these different um applications and use cases we will really concentrate on window those this layer here we will use the kubernetes engine today and that in turn uses the computer engine in order to spin up the instances that we need and we will actually also very briefly touch a little bit on the cloud storage um so you get an idea of how to manage your uh your work in in Google Cloud platform and keep an eye on the billing and the cost so I basically touch in the demo a little bit on that the 10 services that you should definitely know again compute engine these are your instances application engine if you want to very quickly deploy apps uh serverless functions and the kubernetes engine um and we will be really exploring that today then we you know the different storage options that you have and the different networking options that you have and Google big query is very popular and um the the integration is made very easy for example if you really wanted um you could just export your your billing into big query and have analyze it there and really work out what uh where does the cost go where if you have a really big deployment in Google Cloud platform okay and then similar you know as before it's really I think it's really by Design right so those two those three Cloud offerings really um don't give you any that you can deploy a cassander in similar ways on all those three right so you have the uh the you know the very basic access by getting the computer engines and then you have uh the marketplace launcher you have the ability to use it as a manage service you can use um Astra targeting Google cloud and you can also um directly connect to asra from the Google Cloud console so and then what we are doing today actually we're not going to demonstrate the use of the C operator in Google Cloud engine today but you could if wanted to take the exercise a step further and connect your application again back to a locally within the cloud installed um Cassandra cluster yep and I would say it's not a bug but a feature and moreover a very very good feature so for example uh we mentioned that in the beginning but haven't explained it you can go you can go multicloud um and we usually mention like disaster tolerance or things like that but that can be um another point of view like on some clouds some kinds of workloads might be significantly cheaper than on others and then you can prefer to uh V to do some kinds of work Lots at one cloud and do another kind of work Lots in another cloud and just to save your money and sometimes Cloud bills are really really really heavy so in this case we will work today at the cloud application so application we work at last week but we will deploy it on the cloud um and we will use Astra so basically we will use Cassandra as a service running I guess as most of you are on free tier it's mostly probably going to run on AWS but your application will be running on Google compute platform and it's perfectly fine because you are free to choose whatever works for you and combine them as different bricks together and that's great exactly good so this is what we're doing today so datax Astra is um Cassandra you know as a service um you can work at a multic cloud multi region it can be you know it doesn't have to you're not locking in with a particular vendor and it's just it's just a good example of a um software as a service in this context here of the application of this presentation I let you handle this Alex if you don't mind U because I actually haven't really used the serverless functions very much yeah so um would be great uh so uh the idea is very very simple when uh uh could you switch one step back sure y perfect so uh from containers to function as a service or I would say better from applications to uh management configuration to containers to uh functions as a service so what's the trick take a look with the platforms as a service like Heroku maybe you know Heroku uh some Services of AWS uh Google application engine and others they provide you a platform for you to deliver the application and this application will work and communicate with your uh clients and in this case you still have to take care about a lot of things about your applications but you also has to understand what's going in behind the hood and the second thing is when we go with some simplifications we are moving on to container management what's the trick first when you are working with platform as a service and your application mostly probably have some dependencies so let's say you are working with python and you need to have some python packages you have to install all of them you have to take care of them and you have to have them not only locally but also at the platform for you are using to deploy the application then container comes and container as you've seen uh allow you to pack all the dependencies of your application together in a single package for example Docker image there are some more uh tools and ways but doer is the most popular for now so you pack the things into the doer images and then you can run it as a container everywhere on every platform which is just supporting containers and you don't care about with dependent anymore and the last thing but with containers and with Docker with kubernetes you still think of the uh bottom of this um platform you are using you have to understand what that's Linux there are some Linux functions and so on and so forth so you are inside the operating system and if you forget about that you have troubles and then final thing is like uh completely serverless function as a service you deliver something to the cloud uh like uh Lambda for example Amazon Lambda you deliver the function like a packet um well function is the best name I mean really like an application uh processing data you give and you don't think about is it Linux or I don't know God bless windows or maybe something even more special doesn't matter you have the function and this function will be executed when you call for that so you don't care about even about the operating system you are working with and that's like the true essence of the serverless thing the highest level of obstruction you just think of functions like in the your programming language and you don't think of anything below so that's in some cases very very interesting approach alha it's not the most widely used for now because well let's say at this moment um it doesn't fit all the use cases so I actually have a question if you don't mind um because as I said I haven't used that feature match is there actually a repository of pre-made functions like you know for example heavy analytical functions or would that be something that you create yourself um and then use it when when when needed so uh basically both but um the most widely spreaded use case is to develop your own functions at least from my experience okay cool thank you thanks very much for um actually yeah that was another thing that um there are some best practices if you want to use them with the uh with our drivers um can you talk to that as well so it's not something that I have done and you know if if not we might just deliver the content later yeah well so today we don't work with serverless uh as it is uh with function as a service so I will try to be brief we cannot feed 300 AWS services within a single Workshop as long as this Workshop is not one week uh duration so uh the main things uh working with serverless we create driver uh connection to a database outside of a function entry point why because if you do it within the function entry point every time function is colored you will create a new connection and if it's kind of a function you use all the time 1,000 per second yeah 1 million times per second when you are going when your Cassandra going to be unhappy because it's going to make too many TCP connections it will be easier with candra version 4 but as it's not uh finished it yet and most of you are going to be at version three or maybe data stack Enterprise it's definitely going to make some problems with TCP connections uh don't forget to be aware of a number of client connection to the database so uh the same thing you have to recognize uh the limits of a system that's not about Cassandra but more about Linux networking first of all but well about about Cassandra as well um don't forget what it's a special runtime so we have to consider query characteristics and think of it like running in a special conditions we uh has to try to reduce startup Time by disabling uh some things so driver is a smart thing driver considers when you start an application your driver does a really a lot of work under the under the hood it connects to any of the seid nodes uh a lot of metadata Shema allocation which note is responsible for which set of tokens partitions and so on and so forth and as you could guess this kind of uh startup may take really a lot of time in some case you want may want to disable that because well otherwise your function will be just too slow um another thing disable the driver heartbeats what uh work with idle connections because well obviously that's not always going to be the good idea to keep the things working like the traditional way because yes it's a special environment move the data access and business logic away from the function end point um that's a very often mistake when people start to put business logic into very weird places um and these kind of function the functions they are not for these kind of workloads so uh don't forget what you don't want your business logic to be in the function function entry points anyhow that's not the best practice for sure okay I think I'm beginning to understand what this could be used for so you could Point basically your function at uh at the cassander database to get some data out for example processes in the function and write it back in would that be for example a use of the function yes yes that sounds pretty good okay okay yeah okay cool thanks very much Alex I think you really put it home to me today so we all Learners especially I so thank you we all learn all the time that's why we have so a great team of people with very different specializations yeah thank you that's wonderful okay so I think I'm now moving into the more comfortable uh presentation for me which is the demo right I think we want to get started with deploying the application and Google kubernetes engine and we've basically split it into two parts and between those two parts still will be the m so you know it won't be too long and then you can do the M again um but pay attention because some of the questions will cover what we do in the uh in this first demo and uh at first we um review our architecture again so um for those who've been with us for you know all these eight weeks um you you should be pretty familiar with the architecture of the application that we have we basically have a UI which we call getting started with Asa UI it's running uh with node and react and it's communicating via rest API to the back back end and we normally use um a Java version of the back end and a python version of the back end um you know to be very honest Cedric was on holiday last week and he's the Java guy so I did the python I just did the example for python today you are absolutely welcome to containerize your Java um uh application and deploy it the same way as we did it in week six I won't be showing that today um but this is this is the basic architecture and then from the back end we have various choices we can um communicate with Astro or we can uh put it into another Cassandra installation uh for the you know to keep the demo simple uh we just uh do it with asra today if we have enough time we can obviously go and uh deploy the cassander operator again and install the Canda database but um otherwise I would say try it you know try it yourself and ask us if you have any question questions um also a few words the you know I think we've said this a few times this is an example application that just show how to connect to Astra it's not really representative probably how you would want to write your own application and we've run throughout the workshop into certain certain problems like with uploading the credentials to the connection dialogue and all these kind of things in a real application you would handle this very differently right you would not want to send you a secret stuff of post request in order to connect but um it's just a demo application and uh for the purpose of um showing you the different interactions between youri backend and the database okay so let's go into the first exercise and I'm going to introduce Google Cloud platform for you and for that let's split UPS that's the wrong one is it has that crashed there it is sorry yeah there we go so I put a long read me together we put a long read me together here uh on the in the week eight of the cassander workshop series first check because we often get so many complaints about the small font is this readable and if not shout now and I zoom in a little bit more or stay quiet forever yes your chance I just quickly check slack if I if there's any feedback sounds good okay then so um let's go really into the beginning of um of um Google Cloud platform I show you a little bit around what the console looks like and I've also put a lot of screenshots in there and as I said earlier this is not um something that you can probably join us right at the same time as we're doing this because um you will need to sign up this is this is this is uh to you this is unique to you this is with your in this case I signed up with my data snx email address and when you sign up for the first time you will actually be asked to enter a credit card right so it's both for verification and also um to enable billing and you might feel a little bit uncomfortable about that that is really entirely your choice but ultimately all the cloud vendors work that way right um ultimately they're selling you slices of their infrastructure and their resources and there is cost involved it's not a free service even though a lot of them have their own sort of free tiers or free offerings uh where you won't be charged but still a credit card sign up is required and when you start with Google Cloud I think really nice um so I started six days ago with u with this account and then you get a a good chunk of free credits so that you can really the experiment it's $300 I live in the UK so this was converted to 230 and since in the six days that I since I started I've used up um about 13 pounds um with my various experiments and so you know it's not this didn't cost me anything because it's my free credit uh but obviously if that runs out after I've used up all the credits or after the time after you get a full year for this kind of experimentation then you would have to pay right and I think it's something that you probably while you experiment with um with the fre tier I think it's worth getting your head around dis spilling and where does where does the money go and um and what costs and what doesn't right so I think it's um important hope now you start to appreciate Astra even more because Astra doesn't require you to entry to enter credit card data and just gives you a free tier does give you a free tier it's actually 10 gigabytes of storage you know so it's actually actually quite generous so uh yes I hope youate we tried to choose the easiest Cloud platform for you and we tried to find anyone you requirement for your credit card but sorry that doesn't exist any at least major Cloud platform for you to use without entering the data but uh we may have to stay forgiving for that because well you know Cloud platforms are very often abused uh by fre tier usage and people are trying to I don't know mine Bitcoins uh for free and then run away actually that is actively for forbidden in the in the free uh Tia as well here in the free trial with Google Cloud so it's actually in the terms and conditions you cannot mine Bitcoin right so but um otherwise you're fairly unrestricted in what you use your credits for and so this is uh when you first when you first start working with Google Cloud U platform you will be asked to create a project so this is uh and by default it just created for me the my first project and this is the homepage of the project where you see what what you currently use for example here's my project name project number and then there I can go to the project setting in this case I have actually these are the resources that I'm currently using um these are the three instances that were required in order to spin up my kubernetes cluster and and then I'm using a storage bucket and I'll show you in a moment why I'm doing that um and then you know you have a lot of help actually it's really nice lots of really good articles um how to get start start it and you know for example I will probably after this Workshop think create a cloud function and experiment a little bit with that and see whether I can connect it to Cassandra based on what I've learned today um so one thing that I've included in the v me is um you know take control of your billing and I'm going to show you that today um so you have you can access billing here and So currently I have not incurred any cost because everything has been deducted from my um for my free credits so there has been absolutely no cost and but still I was sort of like a little bit thrown by this initially so like where did all the money go right so I've used the money I thought I was using very little where did it go and I wanted to get a little bit more visibility so I decided to set up a a billing export simply because I couldn't get to the I couldn't really get to the details you know where it was I could see here that there's something here something was built but I couldn't quite figure out where you know how much money and what what uh happened and for example the forecast here that I will use 41 pounds um over the you know based on what I've used so far over August so I wanted to understand a little bit better so I set up billing export and in building export you can actually export to a file and then in this case I've you know said it so that it every day exports to a bucket you know and that's that is like your S3 um container this is a a bucket that I set up in the storage and this now holds all the daily CSV files that I get for my billing and to do that you would go into storage so um storage and there's your browser and then you can create a new buet you can create a bucket bucket names are really funny they have globally unique names so if you were going to do even if it was for your own project if you were going to call your backet Workshop bilding that wouldn't work so you would probably have to call it something slightly different like Workshop building to or I think sric use Workshop building test um I wonder what will happen when we run out of names but I think we're very far from that so you can then browse your Workshop billing bucket after the daily export and you see here I now have a lot of CSV files every day um to look into them and I think I have One open from recently that I looked at this is very small but it shows you a little bit that this is actually quite cryptic in you know what is the date when the was incurred what was it you know so there different Services bandwidth forwarding rules you know I got charged for forwarding port forwarding for example I got charged for external IPS and it's actually you know these are you know it tells you how long this was used you know and what the total consumption was how much measurement uh uh and then how much was I charged right so not everything incurs a charge and everything that is disch charged is very very small at this stage right so these are really fractions of um of a pound you know it goes down to very very small fractions but this is um I think it's good practice while you have the luxury of the free tier that you that you get a grip on the building so you understand what costs what and where does your money go and you will actually find that the biggest components you see here we are actually in in over quarter of a pound um this this is for the for the um compute engines so this is uh here for example compute engine the EC core the ram you know the different VM images they they cause they cost money so that's something to bear in mind um so it's a lot of detail I think don't don't skip it I think it's worth um you know staying on top of it so it doesn't at some point become a nasty surprise and I think that's especially important also for AWS right if you if you do it and yeah so I just I thought it was important to point that out set up the biding you won't see something immediately if you do the file export it's every other day it's it's the next day so you would have to wait a day until you see some uh some details do I okay yeah that's important for every cloud because all of them are going to build you and if you do some mistakes they can build you very seriously so I would suggest uh also to add a very simple approach watch your steps disable um units you are not really using right now for real watch for that watch for that exactly exactly just uh watch it uh and just keep a good eye on it and I think while you have this free trial you know you can really look into this but don't forget and actually you need to refresh your browser sometimes um here in order to see how this is actually going down in um in terms of so it's not kind this little bar that pops up you see it was 270 before now it's 200 uh uh and uh and 16 so it's going down um just keep an eye on it do us a favor don't don't run into nasty surprises okay good so that was um the the main project how to get started how to set up the building how to keep an eye on it now we will use you know everything the console is you can have everything on the side all the different services and we will use the kubernetes engine today so let's go into that and I've already set up a cluster for you and which I've used for the last couple of days I show you how to create a cluster and but I will not create the cluster now because it takes time right so it has beenin up three to five minutes in order to do this and we probably don't want to do that during the demo um but you would go to create cluster and even that takes time and it offers you sort of like a basic uh you have limited options what you can create when you're in the free tier actually in the free tile so I think you can have a maximum of two clusters um two kubernetes clust and you have limited options actually there how um how beefy your notes can be that you want to set up so I've not actually seen much of a possibility to configure that this is the default setup and it's actually a little bit more expensive than the very first cluster that they set that they give you a setp so if you go on to create cluster don't go with this one just go to my to a very afford cluster here to set this one up here on the side so I show you again so you instead of doing create here this will set up a more expensive default cluster for our here you can just click on create your very first cluster and create now and this is the smallest one and you see the differences here it uses machine type G1 small instead of E2 medium right it has a smaller boot dis it has it has less Ram it has about half amount of the ram that you get with the with the E2 medium so it's a it's a more it's a cheaper version and it's plenty it's plenty for what we want to do right so however if you want to run the Cassandra operator and deploy a cassander cluster then go with the default cluster that uses the E2 medium machines right so because the very small one won't be strong enough for that okay and then you would click on create now actually I can just show you what happens if I create this because it's creating a second one now um but we will continue using this one um in order to sort of like skip this but this is what happens you see it's sort of spinning and it takes a bit of time and then after a while we would expect to see exactly the same kind of resource allocation that you have here we will get a three note cluster and we have three vcpus across the whole cluster so that's one vcpu per worker node and we have um 5.1 Gaby of RAM available for us and um as I said that's that's not enough to run your C operator but it's very enough for our for our purpose today don't forget don't forget what today we run today we work with Cassandra is a service today we work with Astra that's why we can use we spray the small cluster exactly so it does take some time to set up that's why I wanted to stop so I've prepared Oh I thought I had prepared prepared this earli for you but this is expired um so I'm going to connect here using the connect I'm connecting to them to the cloud shell and then just click this run and Cloud shell and it's populating everything properly for you so it's selecting my first cluster what zone it is what is the project and you can run this in the cloud shell and I'm going to put that into a new window and is the font okay or do we need to maybe one click maybe one click bigger but yeah it's okay so you can do this and um go to largest okay that's the biggest that I have okay yeah that's all right okay I close this one down so cool okay so let's have a look what I got actually with this first cluster so it's um Cube CT oops Cube CTL get nodes and here these are my so you see how they're named so GK Google Cloud uh Google kubernetes engine my first classer one default pool they're ready and I actually don't see the master nodes here these are all worker nodes and I have my this is the this is the kubernetes version that is being used here and if I want more detail I go to the minus o wide option oops my typing and now I see also the networking so I see the internal IP they all have the internal IPS and I see the external IPS we have a bit of a line break here because of the font size but this is important so everybody in kubernetes has their own sort of like IPS in this internal Network and then we have the external um Network the external IP addresses of those nodes and if you want to later connect to our ports and our services from outside of the kubernetes cluster we will need to use the external IP addresses in order to address them okay so right so what we want to do is we want to use our um we want to create a name space first of all let's start with that and and then we want to deploy our ports as we did two weeks ago into into this kubernetes cluster so first create a nam space and we're staying with all the conventions that we used before so this is familiar for you so we create Nam space my app sorry okay that's created and then we want to create um the various um the various ports right we want to create a port for the back end and we want to create a port for the um for the UI and in order to do that we need to download images right we need to download the container images and now different to what we did before we need to have those images available to us publicly right we need to point we need to download them from somewhere that's available to this to this Cloud um engine and in our previous exercises we loaded them ourselves into kind so they were available in this kind cluster and then we just loaded them from there so this is a little bit different today you have different choices there you know you could create your own repository now in this um In This kubernetes Cloud and you could load your images into this repository and the pods would then take those images from there uh today we're using uh Docker Hub so we've deployed or we've pushed those images into Docker Hub and we can actually tell you a little bit how we did that um Alex set up some automations in GitHub in order to automatically push uh the images whenever we make some changes to the code and um so they're available I want to show you where they are yep uh actually uh if you want I I could show something uh about how it works and why it works this way so I'm going to switch to my [Music] screen hopefully yes and now you watching at my terminal so take a look uh I have here a Cassandra Workshop series Cassandra Workshop series I hope you can see what's going on yes that looks pretty great and that's where Cassandra Workshop series The repository we are working with at GitHub so first I'm going to update it so gpol there are there should be no big changes definitely I last time I updated it tonight hey there get okay good so minor changes now I'm going to go to uh week 8 and we have some things here so um materials um information instruction and getting started with asra python getting started with asra UI so web application python application python is a back end UI is uh web interface so we go to python getting started with asra python and I will clear it up so we will lost nothing and now I'm in this folder and I want to build an image how do I do that first thing we have to remember is doer file Docker file has the instructions how to build an image for Docker so I specify the base image I copy the current folder I set a working directory I install requirements I open port and I'm specifying the command to be executed when we starting the starting a container out of the image we will build that's stop Alex very quickly sure you need to zoom in uh zoom in even more so yeah okay um okay I thought I was big enough okay so good so that's a very simple Docker file to work with just few instructions now I want to build this file so I'm going to do Docker build I'm going to uh tag it so this will be not just an image with ID uh but it will be an image with some name I will be able to use and I can call it like whatever howest architect that's my Lin at doer Hub test python up it's still too small come on I okay okay okay okay I hope now it's enough um so let me clear that clear so we are going to do Docker so I'm calling for Docker I'm saying Docker to build I will call my application first that's my name my login at uh Docker oh sorry I have to change the size yes and this name application will be test up Python and I going to build it from the local file from the docker file in this directory so I set the uh pun pun oh my God uh dot never mind I'm pushing enter and oh oh my god of course Docker is not running so I say Docker build and Docker will build it for me and then as soon as it's ready I have to say Docker push to push this image to a hub. do.com what does that make it pushes my image to hub.com and as it's a public repository and Public Image everyone of you or uh everyone in the world will be able to pull this image and run it okay but then uh you see every time you do any changes you have to rebuild this image every time you do any changes you have to rebuild this image and if there is a a comment of 10 people working on this project 20 you are going to rebuild this image every time and when you push it and build it not in the best case scenario but with conflicting with some of your colleages where can be a real problems so instead of doing it manually every time which is a very wrong approach there is an automation there is a thing called it continuous delivery it means what everything what you are doing regarding the delivery of your application must be automated and deliver it wherefore automatically without your personal um work on that I don't see if my Docker machine is running already or not hey there Docker Docker is starting okay so meanwhile while my Docker is starting I will show you something different we go to data Stacks Academy Cassandra Workshop series looks familiar because you spent last eight weeks here and here we have a nice tab called it actions what's that it's a GitHub actions uh and that's an automated builds for your application so GitHub can build um everything for you there are very many different tools and different applications to make this AO build some of you maybe know Jenkins my favorite tool a little bit old school but well still powerful Some people prefer um how it's called it now um what's the most popular here so some people go to with GitHub actions but that's new we have Circle C we have some others maybe my colleagues will remind me in general there are very many different ways to build your app and for this one I have two builds configured Docker build front end master and Docker build back end master Docker build front end Master will build Docker image for the front end part of application and Docker build backend Master will build backend part of application wherefor and there are some builds and I can open any of them and watch your results and I see I guess I have to make it bigger again yes and there are actions done by this build and I can open any of them like first first what happens when GitHub action starts it's setting up a job so prepares everything for you to do then it check outs your repository in the current state we worked with Master Branch when it executes the command I give so run doer build blah blah blah blah blah so build successful and we are installing all the dependencies and we log into to Docker hub.com using some secret credentials and finally we push the image and the image will be at data stocks deaths CVS week 8 backend and it's done automatically how it works very simple in the Cassandra Workshop series folder we have do GitHub workflows folder and there are two files build back end build front end and if I open any of them there's a very simple file that's a special configuration file for GitHub how to do automated builds so just a name well whatever you want in which situations which build should be executed that's a very simple example that's not a production ready example in this case I'm going to build that on every push to master branch in your case situation may be different you may have some pool request release on Tech and so on but I want to keep this simple small to keep it simple and then we have four steps so it it's going to be executed on a latest machine First Step will be to check out the branch Second Step will be to build this image and I explicitly write what I want to do I want Docker Bill set T what I'm going to build when I'm logging in to uh Docker Hub with Docker Lin username password and then I push the image there if everything is fine those steps will not be executed is build fails and usually in right here you want to have some tests we don't have test for this image but in general that's a very good place to test the test and now I don't have to build things manually like okay my Docker is running so now I can do this job on my own I can say Docker build blah blah blah blah blah and it will pull python Alpine image do the things install requirements and I have to do it manually and you know what good engineer is lazy engineer automate with things don't do the job manually if you can automate that very simple okay and uh I will not show you how I push that because it's just Docker push and image tag but anyway I don't have to show that because why well well well well well GitHub now does it for me perfect and it's free for open source projects I love that I'm done cool hand it over back to me and then I continue with demo just a second I'm on that switching to you okay now we see your screen perfect so actually in the meantime as you see my second cluster has been created we're not going to use it today uh I just wanted to show you a little bit the process of creating this cluster we're staying with this one here um and back to my cloud shell and I hope the font is all right I cannot go any bigger there so I hope it looks okay uh right so what do we need to do let's have a look at our at our read me so we explored the cluster we saw the three worker notes uh we checked for the external IP addresses these are different probably now that I've set up several clusters again and again they change every time um Alex has showed you how to get these um how to build um your your images and push them to dock have and we're just going to use those the latest ones so this is the CWS week8 front end and the back end latest and now we create um actually I'm not going to create the yaml um but I have given you instructions how to create them we're just going to use them and I show you how to inspect them so I actually have everything here so this is a um these are the yaml that we use today perhaps not even all of them because I did some experiments and what is really nice in Cloud sh you can actually open an editor quite easily here and then um explore them and edit them and other than gitpod for example this has um um autosave enabled so let's remember what we need to do um in order to launch our parts so first we need to have a configuration which has the environment variables in there and we call this the config map is it or is it this one that looks good so that looks like a config map that we can use um so we use the environment variable use Astra and we're setting it to true we want to connect to Astra and the python the python backend will only use this environment varable it will only use use asra this might be actually a bit small am I right so let's make this a bit bigger here see what I can yeah that's that big enough um and then um the for the UI we need to provide a backend um address a base address and that will change so we will populate that later so what we're going to do now is we're going to start the um the the we apply the config map and then we're going to apply the um yamel for the for the backend part and then we will expose uh the backend part so we can and actually address it from external you know from and then that will give us the new Base address then we will update this config map so that is ready for our UI and um this is for the first exercise in the second exercise uh we show you a better way right so we show you the easy you know way just sort of like guiding you from where we were in Big Six where we used port forwarding today we use here um something called a service called not Port uh but then in the second part of the exercise we do it in a better way okay so let's have a look here um and apply this y so can you still see this I think I got out of here so um so Cube CTL minus n my app for the namespace and then apply minus F config map to Y there we go and that's applied and now let's have a look at the [Music] um at the backand Theo so see we can make this a bit smaller here I hope you can read it so this is the part definition that we used before um again these are the typical tags that we need to have in kubernetes API version kind metadata and spec the kind is a part we're defining a p oops this has the wrong one in here actually we need to change that so we going to use the backend T so what you are say sorry I forgot to uh show it to you but thanks Betina so that's our data Stacks deaths repository at the docker Hub and that's where we store our Docker images and that's the exactly oh sorry could you switch back for a sec oh okay yes you can just put there that's data tax death SL cassander Workshop series week eight backand so that's exactly what uh is being built for us by GitHub actions yeah and it's tagged with the latest tag and I put that in there um I'm not entirely sure whether you need to specify the tag um but if you don't specify the tag it will default to latest so I just put that in there so and we exposing the we will be using or we will be serving on the container Port 5000 and we've built our application this time to use the port 5,000 again remember in week six we worked around the fact that the 5,000 Port was not was blocked on the ec2 instances so we built it for Port 1990 but the default port for this flask um application that we're building is Port 5,000 we staying with that today I want sorry Bettina I want to notice one important think notice what in general direct usage of the latest uh Tech of the latest image of your Docker images is uh the bad practice because is it yeah absolutely because take a look then you may release an untested update anyhow and then you restart something and then the new version will be pull it in and then you may have some uncompatible uh changes breaking changes of your airp API and boom you application in cloud is not operational anymore so in general good practice is to specify the particular version you want to be running right now instead of a latest but currently we have only latest tech and that's a demo application so that's very fine but for real real application you don't want to have latest tech in the most of the use cases a that's an excellent point thank you so much Alex that's brilliant I'm so glad you're here so with AUD your experience um good so let's um close this editor and just apply this so we have q minus n my app apply minus F backend yeah and there we go we have to as pod as backand pod is created let's check how whether it's running so C CTL um minus n my app get pods and it's running this is very quick with the Astra pod uh with the Astra backend pod for the ASA UI pod the image is a lot bigger I think it's about a one gig image I don't know why um it's must be the various UI elements and it takes a lot longer to create the container and get it up and running so if you want to really check whether it's serving so you can go Cube CTL and do the logs so um minus n my app logs and then you do ex the full name of the part there you go so put that in there and that's what we seeing this is the output from the flask server so Ser flask app getting started with Astra debug mode on this is serving right so this is this is looking good but um now now we cannot access it right we cannot test it we cannot see it from outside so what we need to build now is we need to build a service that allows us to expose this externally for external access and a very simple service to do that is called a not port and I'm going to show you that in a moment so let's go to so there's not Port here I think that's a uip port look not not Port back end there we go so not Port is a different it's a different kind it's another you know we have the same tags again that we have actually we have them in a slightly different order as I would normally use them I don't know where this is came from I probably copied it um so we have the kind of service API version uh V1 uh we have the metadata for it which is just the name the not Port back end we have the type it's a not port and not ports basically map pot ports to external worker node ports right that's basically what happen right so we're mapping the Pot Port which is currently serving on Port 5000 to a port on the worker node machine where the port is deployed and it has a reserved address range I don't know exactly what the address range is something 3,000 up to um 3,000 I think 500 something in this area and I just picked 3,00 30, 355 um you know because I'm serving on Port 5,000 something with fives in the end looked good um but what I also need in order to tie it to the Pod I needed to use Astra I need to select a label that I've defined earlier in order to establish that connection this service belongs to the ASA back end and I'm doing this because of the selector which which I specify asra backend and I've defined this label earlier in my backend yo so here is my label Astra backend and now in here in my noteboard I'm using the selector to select this label and the label can be any anything right it can be anything I just chose that asra backend but it can be my P name Betina whatever right it can be anything it just needs to match right it needs to match that you selecting the label with the selector and this is a mapping mechanism in kubernetes you will see the user selectors throughout right if you want to connect services with other resources uh just a second just to notice what uh in general there are different ways to do this job and to set up this connectivity so uh now we work with Note ports but there can be another options just for you to consider exactly so we do this actually in the second exercise we do different things there are actually quite a few different options right we have notep puts we have cluster IPS we have um Eng services so there's different ways of establishing this connection from outside and it's a frequent question right what is the best what is the best way not Port is very easy to set up that's why we thought we show you that you know you can set it up for for test in previously we just did it with port forwarding right we just forwarded the port um with the port forwarding rule uh the not Port is basically very similar to that it just does that um for production use um the big drawback of the not Port is it ties you to the worker note where the port is running right um so if the port goes down and you um and it it get laun gets launched on a different worker note then that that binding uh won't fit anymore right so you need to specify a different um IP address in order to address your port and um so something has to change that's not ideal right cool so let's uh let's deploy that and then we can see whether we can access it from the outside so we do um no let me just remember what it was called I called it um no put backand Amo so Cube CTL minus n my app um apply minus F notep put backend Y and the not Port is created okay so now we can inspect it if you want to um have a look at um get Services um and I think I need to be in the name [Music] space and O there are and you see it is a clust IP right and now we need to understand how we can actually access it from the side um let's have a look see what I'm just not losing my track here so uh right so it's it's bound to this so we need to look up now where the um we need to look up the IP address of the worker note where our pod is running so this is what we need to do and this is this kind of note binding that we want to avoid later on so we go and go again into yes uh sorry uh while you are opening that I wanted to add uh why we uh try to avoid no node bind binding the point is with the node Port this uh Port will be opened on the particular note this boort is running and uh this infrastructure is born to be uh Emeral and today your Port is running on this note tomorrow your Port is running on another note that's why not Port is a thing like for special use cases we show it just like the easiest scenario but we have something better for you in just few minutes okay I'm getting a bit slow actually do I need to spe speed up a little bit I wonder whether we've got enough time I think we have enough time right so I wanted to just quickly check where is my port actually running so my as backend is running here on this note GK my first cluster one default pool and then it has this this unique ID bmj that is the node that is running on so now I need to check what's the IP address or what's the external IP address of this one so I go to cube CTL get nodes minus o wide again and I'm trying I'm finding this bmj um so this is the bmj here right and the external IP address this is the external IP address here so this is so if I try this now and with the port of 30355 oh it's not connecting and you know why because I need to establish the firewall rule that this port is now accessible from the outside because this is not a default Port right this is not like Port 80 which is by by default open uh in most uh in a lot of deployments but 30355 we just we just decided that and there's no way that Google Cloud platform knows that we make this open for for Access so we need to establish the firewall Rule and so I've put that into the uh here into the so I call the firewall rule test note port and we need to run that first as well in order to be able to have the access so it's creating the fire rule takes a little bit of time to do that not usually but it's there so it's creting and then try again see whether that comes to now please I think for the first access it always takes a bit yeah this is very small but you see this is the very very simple um serving page that I've put in there so that we know yes we are connected we are the python that API and please connect me to ASA via the UI so this is external access to the part that is deployed so it's going from my browser I'm contacting the verco node and the port on the verco Node is mapped by the notep service to the Pod and I'm seeing the traffic that the Pod is serving does it make sense perfect so this's do the same for the UI so we want to um you actually want to give this address now to the UI so this is in the architecture of our app which I continue to say it's not ideal you probably want to do this better but in the architecture of our app this is how it works we we specify the UI in the config we use the same config that we did before we just specify the right Port here the right um IP address in the right port and we use this as the Base address so in the architecture of our UI this is essential we need to set the basee address and we need to set the Base address to the externally accessible API address right so this is this is non-negotiable the way how this is designed um so and then we can um this we do the same for the UI yo right so we again updated with the right images so these were my test images until um um addex came up with this wonderful automation there so we need to put the image in there yeah Alex Alex Alex is very lazy Alex automates everything I love it and so much is awesome uh so we put that into uh into here and I'm still using the latest tag here and we then need to reapply the config map um and so that that the config map service basically had the config map ele in kubernetes has the right values that we updated and then we apply the UI and then we should be able to serve the UI so let's do that here so um the Doom so you can see what I'm doing Cube C minus n my app apply minus F the config map and you will see something like we configured or configured right so because it's not the first time that we applied we we updated it and that doesn't that doesn't bother our backend Port right that's up and running that's configured that's up and running and now we um do the other one Cube CTL minus n my app apply minus F UI and the UI is created it takes a little bit longer so because the image is quite big so I show you the parts you probably will see something like container creating there you go it's container creating it takes a little bit longer until this um is up and running and yeah so and then it will also take a little bit longer to um uh to serve it later so now we need to do exactly the same thing as before we need to create a noport for the UI and we will expose the UI on a different IP address um potentially because it might be running on a different um on a different worker node um so once this is up we will see where this is deployed so it's up and running and let's see where where this is this is now deployed on a different worker note this is on the 7807 right so remember that 7807 but let's first uh create a not Port um so the not port for the UI is here and it's the same as before it's just using a different port this time right so I'm tying this to The Container Port 3000 or to the PO Port 3000 and I'm mapping to the port 3 30,000 333 in this case because of the threes um I'm using a different selector I'm selecting ASA UI this was the label that I had in my in my UI yam so as UI so I'm again establishing this connection and um let's um let's apply this notep so let's get I think out of the so q c minus n my up F uh not Port UI there we are that's created now we need to look up where it's run so um it was under seven OR7 whatever so um Cube C get nodes minus o wi we have here the seven that's CB this one this is the one so this is the one here and again we must not forget I just put that in there already we must not forget to Expo um set the firewall Ru so so let's do the same as before simar firewall rule we need to name it differently that's the firewall rule this time we're linking to port 30333 and it needs to have a second name because we cannot just add to the previous rule that we had so we're exposing this port and there we are and now if I Ser it this does actually does take a bit of TRS what was the name again of the seven this one 27 [Music] 3 and it could take a bit of time because um it's a small machine that's serving and oh no it's fast it's nice actually it's up and now you can just I won't in the interest of time I won't actually show you now the connection to as you could just put it in the same way um I can actually probably do this while because the next step would be the Mente right we don't want to lose you on the Mente so Alex if you want to quickly set up the mentee and um reviewing what we've done so far and then after the mentee I show you how to do this in a better way right so instead of using not ports which has this obvious binding to the worker node in the next exercise we will deploy our ports in a different way so we will deploy them as deployments so we don't have this detailed binding and um we will install Services load balancing services that use an Ingress in order to root external traffic to the deployment and which then picks the m p you ready to do mty Alex just a second mty is behaving as usual but then in the meantime I show you just um the connection to the the Astro database so test the connection takes a bit of time which is a good sign because it means it's not immediately falling over with any for policies or address not found or refus ports so we see that the test is successful we can save our connection as before saving and then we can um launch a New Journey so hello we are going to space and we can then check in Astra whether it's actually getting there KV user KV password use video oh I think it's probably a bit small than but um I just want to show you that you can see something and select star from spacecraft Journey catalog that's what I always use and there we are that's our spacecraft hello and we're going to space launch just no it's working wonderful ready for men uh I'm sorry it's still loading uh could you maybe proceed with the next steps and I will tell you as soon as it will be ready that's the only thing I can suggest sorry wonderful that's that's that's brilliant okay good right so the next steps so this was basically in the this was the first exercise in the read me I hope you should just be able to follow it along and um if you have any questions um let us know as I said don't forget to set these firewall rules otherwise you won't be able to connect right so in the next exercise we want to remove the node binding right we don't we want to so let's first clean up our clean up our space here uh so um we have a clear um name space we just delete the name space I've also put put the instructions here to delete your firewall walls um you don't want to leave them open forever right you don't have to do the delete for them now for this next exercise but we don't use them anymore so it's good practice to uh to clean everything up um so just clean it up after this is deleted and um okay this was the notep and and you need to say yes you could also clean them up via the console so you can I show you this quickly how to do that in the console you can go to VPC Network and in here you see your firewall Ralls that are set up so you can also clean them up here um so these are various firewalls that are just there to support the working of the kubernetes engine uh and the class but here is the second one that I did here so the test notep two and I'm deleting that now here so we don't have that anymore so there's two different ways actually there's always two different ways at least two different ways to do something um in Google Cloud you can always go through the console you know and but if you cannot remember the commands um you will almost always find a way to do it via the the graphical user interface with the um with the Google Cloud platform console like here so let's go back to the um uh kubernetes engine and we will actually use the Google Cloud platform console a lot more for this exercise because it's actually I thought this is the real power of using this hosted kubernetes service for us because they made it so much easier in terms of I don't have to write the Ys myself I can just use the services how they've integrated them and use it um to create those necessary yaml for me and create those necessary services for me here okay so just to show you a little bit what we're going to do next um we're going to use a different concept now to launch our pods and these are called deployments and here is a yaml deployment I hope it's legible um let me just see whether I've got any feedback um Alex you any feedback whether it's too small I don't know uh nothing yet looks pretty good okay good all right then um so we have here um a kind a different kind is deployment again we have the typical metadata uh where we give it a name we call it ASA back end but in this case you're setting up a so-called replica set um we're setting up what is the minimum availability we want to have for our um for our pods and um we here we have the opportunity for example to set up a replica set of three and that would mean kubernetes make sure that we always have three app and running three parts and I wanted to show you that but the the architecture of the backend doesn't allow that I'm afraid because you know how the backend takes the credentials in order to um connect to Astra in this case if I have more than one replica only one of them has the credentials and the other one say hey I don't know what you're talking about I don't know anybody in Astra right so it it doesn't work unfortunately with the architecture of our back end um but that shouldn't stop you from trying a different app where you might want to have several several parts running that sort of like back each other up in case one gets overloaded or goes down or whatever and then it's the health of the um the Health Management of kubernetes that would recreate them in order to keep the replica set available for you for your deployment perfect okay let's go on let's quickly do this uh so this is the Astra back deployment as I explained where we're setting only up one replica which is our limitation because of the architecture of our app um but everything else is really the same port definition that we used before right so we're basically telling it spin up one replica of this port and use this container with this image and this port and again use the same uh the config map uh we actually do a different config map in this case I split out the config map for um for UI and for um for back end in this case because they should really be independent so the config map for the back end is um only has this environment variable and the config map for the UI only has the environment varable for the back end and for the use asra right okay so let's do this we want to First apply the config map for the back end then we want to create the deployment and then we will use the console the Google console UI in order to expose the um the deployment and create the necessary services so we can address them externally without having to use a notep uh so let's do that we go and apply the config map remember what it's called the config map is back in config so we go um Cube CTL so minus n my app apply minus F back on config so that's should hopefully get created done whoops oh I didn't create of course I deleted the uh namespace so let's do this again Cube CTL create name space my space key is a bit broken um my app and then we can create the config map here so okay there we are it's created and now we want to create the deployment so we do Cube CTL minus n my app again n is specific the deployment is specific to a names space and then we apply the minus f um and in this case it's the asra backend deployment so and so that's created and then we can see what's happening here Cube CTL I think clear the screen so you can see everything behind our heads Cube CTL get pods in the Nam space my app and you see that's already app and running so this is now a different ending this is not the name that we gave it right this is the name that the deployment gave it and you might recognize that from the cassander uh cluster that we set up because this works in exactly the same way so the C operator created a deployment and in the deployment we have the different parts and so they have they have some autogenerated names at the end um so let's let's go to the to the console here and see how that actually looks here so first in our we see now that we have Astra backend this is a deployment it currently has one of one parts and it belongs to the namespace my app and I can now click on this one and I can choose to expose it and this is so I think this is so wonderfully made easy here this is wonderful so for example you can do here to let others access your deployment expose it to create a service or I've always been doing it like this right so I click here on the Expose and then I say okay so I want to map it to the Target Port 5,000 and it will create a service type load balancer and it will create a service name ASA back and service and I am going to expose that now and it's taking a little bit of time uh to set this up because it's under the hood is basically creating the Ingress rules and it's also this is mapping to Port 80 um so it's not creating any firewall rules probably for this AIS but it's creating all the plumbing underneath and all the to make that happen that we can ex address it from external so I'm running over a little bit again I'm so sorry I hope you have time and patience and we also stay on a little bit after the workshop for all our ask me anything session so you can just ask any questions and I'm sure Alex and the team in the background are collecting the um the questions that have been accumulating right so so now it's given us an external Endo so this is different now right it's different to the uh to the port that we had before where we had to specify the exact Port this is just an external endpoint uh that links us to the uh to the um to this part now or to the deployment which then in turn links us to the replica uh set and to this one replica and I hope it's going to serve please what's happening that's it take some time I wonder whether I made a mistake somewhere in there no it's there wonderful again so to to the so we are actually now connected again so it's different now yeah so we not connecting to a specific Port that is bound to a specific worker node we've got our own IP address simply for this load balancing rule right for this load balancing service and that now lives in the context of the service so we can change the deployment underneath and we can change the pods underneath um that won't affect this IP address however if we change the service and stop it and create a new one then the IP address would change so we shifted The Binding to The Binding of the Ingress right here of the load balancing service away from the actual deployment um onto the kubernetes worker nodes yep and uh notice when you work with pods directly and Define your PS you work very low level it's good in the beginning just to understand the basics so I do recommend you to work with the PS beginning in the in general but when if you want to have more instances for example of the same application you have to go and manually create the things like that and with the deployment you may specify some rules uh you may specify kind of I want to have uh five instances of these uh deployment and you will have very four five instances for that and it's great so it's automated already supported uh by kubernetes and you have to think of the services in deployments and replica sets in general not in the pots exactly so now while um in order to be be running out of time a little bit so I just started already I updated the config for the UI with this new and point that we have right so that's the Base address that we need to use and I'm just applying the config now so the uh UI config oops apply minus F UI config and then I will run a new deployment for the UI and then I do go through exactly the same steps so I do a minus in my app apply minus minus f Astra UI deployment and create that and as we have before it will probably take a little bit longer until this is um created because of just the size of the IM oh no that was really quick perhaps because we had the image already in there so it's in there the uh the UI and then we do exactly the same as before we go to our workloads and we see the UI is running and we go and expose it we wa we map it to the Target board 3,000 and we expose it we vade a little bit and then we will be able to access it externally and then we can do exactly the same things before uh we populate our connection dialogue and we connect again to Astra so not sure I need to show you that as well but yeah and that was basically it so this is now our application is fully available you can if you want to if you take a note of those while this is up um you should be able then to actually connect to this uh to this UI uh because it's fully available right so this is the new endpoint and um so this might take a little bit of time to to load um just depends on what it has to send over the wire and but then we should get the connection dialogue up pretty quickly and you should be able to try it out yourself just remember this is being served by very small machines right so um not a lot of CPU power um uh not a lot of memory so it might actually be quite easy to overload it so um but then here so this is KV user KV password I hope I didn't make a mistake here and connect with the and test the connection oh I probably did the wrong password here so con now yeah I felt my finger slipping when I put the password in um so uh that obviously would cause a mistake but this is looking good now it's connected we can save the connection and then we can again connect to Astra and now we don't have this particular note binding so it's it's slightly better practice and that was it for today so I think Alex what do you think so we just take two minutes break and then we we come back online to answer any questions that might have accumulated actually one quick question I think I do setri a favor if I point this out here um where is the it's all in the presentation as well I just was worried that I would run out of time so all the different steps that you've taken so if you want to review the presentation everything how it's working is in the presentation and um the entire architecture sort of like how we set up set this up so uh so I hope that will help you to visualize it and review it when you go through the various exercises okay um just before we break perhaps ason technically the deadline has now expired um so um two hours ago two and a half hours ago um we are absolutely delighted we have received some submissions um and you know so you know just if you really haven't just send it through as quickly as possible so hopefully that's still enough and then we can um we can uh take it into account and review it and we will announce the winner next week and next week will we will have an ask me anything session with everybody who's available at that time in that time zone uh where uh we we answer any questions uh that you want to that do still burning after being with us for eight weeks okay yep and then certification voucher um I think yeah I think the process might have changed I quickly check can I come back to the uh to this and but anybody who wants to get a voucher will get a voucher um just make sure that we know that you've attended the workshops and uh that you want to claim it and it will be sent next week okay good so let's have a quick break I suggest and um and then come back and for the ask me anything and I will switch to Discord and um take your questions from there okay two minutes break Bettina could you please switch to next slide yep and next slide this one yes perfect perfect per you can put some music on Alex uh I would uh but I haven't prepared anything so we we can just have 2 minutes pause I think it will be fine so I switched to Discord as well so we can see what's waiting there so [Music] um for [Music] s d so I see no new questions in chat uh so far only thank you data STX Developers for wonderful Workshop thank you uh data stack team uh thank you all the data stack developers has been a great journey of eight weeks really appreciate the efforts taken for knowledge sharing we want to say thank you to all of you because well it's a great it's a great experience to be here with you and that's amazing I will some more questions rajie son will there be a hakon next week so the time for hakone by itself is over so what we have right now is uh we accepted all the submissions and now we will review them pick the best there will be some team of Judges uh I don't remember who exactly is going to do that b it was Patrick I believe Patrick F in VI president of data STS yeah and all of us really I mean like we we all we all going to look into this yeah um we might pull in some other folks you know to if gets really tired yeah but yeah so it's we've got some great submissions so far I can say that yeah definitely uh so and next week we announce the winners so there's always um feedback about the music the I think if you go to data sex accelerate you will find an episode called Data stack radio that has a lot of really wonderful databased songs and tracks so you can um just um check out the data Stacks accelerate page and have a look at the various episodes and there was one episode called Data stack radio it's really hilarious lovely music and but it has also some Technical Training in there so it's uh I recommend watching it and I also want to say what Alex said I think it's been an absolute pleasure uh working with so many of you we after week uh you know it's you've just been a fabulous audience it's been a wonderful experience working on this Workshop series and thank you yes uh we do a lot of uh workshops we do a lot of events before it was most before the 2020 it was mostly on site and this year we stay it online it was first Workshop series or maybe a course to say so and it was really great experience so we lik it it a lot all the team so we will do it again we are shuling some things and we will we are announce them to announce them very soon and said uh by the way Betina as long as you are sharing your screen could you maybe please uh show the event bright page so everyone will know where to subscribe for the events oo I will help you just open Event bright okay I think I was on this actually yesterday I remember this one yep and it's going to be data stack so but you can simply open Event bright and find uh data stocks where and there is a button called it follow so you definitely should press this button this exactly and uh you will get the notifications for the upcoming events we are very about unknowns of course uh we also have Twitter also helps data stocks deps and another important thing is again I say subscribe button directly under Betina if it's not press it yet make sure it you will press it right now now cool okay so let's see what else is there in the in terms of questions in uh Discord I don't watch the Youtube uh comments while I'm presenting because I just get overload but so I haven't seen any questions there hope I haven't missed anything uh question is can we also so get few client challenges what you face as case studies so in general you see Amit as we before we're working mostly on site and travel it a lot we also took care of um well very many different stories but now the Main Place For Us is this YouTube channel you're mostly probably watching this video right now and we are working to deliver very different kind of contents it takes time because we don't want to deliver uh row unprepared content and of course it takes time to prepare a good one but we are working so we definitely have some very nice talks almost ready from the restent Cassandra day China and Cassandra day Russia so we have some great speakers from very famous companies like for example for China it was tensent it was Alibaba and so on so like very huge companies one of the biggest Cassandra clusters in the world and they very interesting use cases to share so we are working uh for w talks to be translated to English and delivered also at the YouTube channel as well and some nice stories from Russia of course also very interesting so yes use cases we are also working on that as well and by the way we have so many people from very different countries and languages care I'm working to run Al to keep running Cassandra days Global so we also will have Cassandra days in different languages and maybe you will be a speaker or definitely at least an attendi for wandra days we will also announce soon so far the be first contacts for us upcoming Cassandra days are going to be in Spanish Japan uh Chinese one is done already and where were some more contacts I can't remind right now but uh it's again all to be announced at the event bride and all of them will be at our YouTube data Stacks deaths okay so our time is almost over looks like do we have any more questions I will try to scroll up maybe we have um some of the questions I would like to answer from today's Workshop like in the voice regarding the environment for these uh for this Workshop if you want to do it again so if you want to do the exercises and we do recommend you to do exercises it works much better it puts in your mind in your memory much better if you do it with your own hands uh but you have used your gcp voucher already or something else I don't know you cannot use gcp the instructions we gave for the uh Google kubernetes engine will be very similar for example on the AWS kubernetes well not completely there will be needed some minor adjustments um but it uh will work also on the AWS and AWS gives you also a free tier for one year so it may also fit for you if you cannot use Google compute platform for any reason and and you know just to be fair as well just myo just appic again I've been using it for six or seven days now and I've used um 4S ounds right of the credit so I think if you want to um set $10 $15 aside for a good you know two days of exercise three days of exercise that should cover it even if you've already used up your free trial uh so you know just um you just make sure you switch everything everything off again right at the end so nothing keeps spanning and Ticking yes okay so uh it's uh on my place 11:31 uh Betina is in the United Kingdom so it's 1030 correct it is 10:30 and it's exam day so I will go and check with my son whether he's actually pass his exams okay thank you much everybody to to uh to tune in it's been a real pleasure have a great day yeah have a great day and we will do more workshops for you it was exciting Series so we are very happy to have you here and uh last week next week will be no real Workshop but it's more about having fun running mty and so on and so forth one important thing for next week we us it to have workshops on Wednesday and on Thursday and that's today's the Thursday Workshop same content different speakers but that's the idea you know for tomorrow or for next week I'm very sorry for next week we are going to have only one meeting uh for me it will be wedness day evening so maybe bit another time zone and uh so see you next week I hope it fits your schedule and time zone I really hope it will be shorter when we usual Workshop we don't need two full hours we will try to do it quicker and we will run some prizes and we will announce the winners of asra Kone show so nice code and so on and so forth thank you so much paty it will be a party yeah it's kind of a party okay so some we all have something to celebrate much effort and incredible team to work with thank you so much and last song for you and we are done for today you are amazing and thank you so much for being with us love you all chiao",
