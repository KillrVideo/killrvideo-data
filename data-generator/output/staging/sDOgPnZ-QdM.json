    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems but before we get into the episode please help us out by taking our quick survey at bit dot ly forward slash DDS survey thanks and now for the episode hello I'm David Gilardi a Technical Evangelist with another episode of the distributed data show I'm here with Sequoia Peltier okay I'm gonna we're gonna dig it in support like let's talk about support and the kind of things that maybe support deals with on a regular basis okay go right into it okay so just anything about some or anything we spend a lot of time chatting with each other you know just about what's happening you know how their day is going stuff like that it's a constant kind of evolution each day is just like a totally different experience right you're trying to kind of figure out what's going wrong with someone's environment right what's going on with the node what's going on with their application right and each time a ticket comes in it's just it's something new it's kind of like getting a present each time but you don't quite know that's actually if it's gonna be like ooh that's what I wanted or if your grandma got you some clothes again okay okay so sometimes you open it up and there's just a whole can of worms you spend a lot of time digging in but that's kind of part of the joy of working in support right is you get to experiment on stuff go in and try and replicate situations and then you know see if you can figure out what's going wrong and then get it fixed or if there's something wrong with the product you need to go get that fixed okay or if it's just you know hey you didn't do this you know go back and do whatever so it's it's just a constant just change are there are there particular types of issues that you guys see a lot or you know common issues things like that yeah so there's there's certain sort of like I would say categories of things we run into so a lot of it will have to do is say configuration and tuning right okay so people have things just set to the wrong parameters or they just go with the defaults out of the box and figure all right I'm just gonna put you know 500 million transactions per second at just barebone box it's running four gigs around right so it doesn't usually work out too well so we spent a lot of time with situations like that and then there's a lot of times where customers will kind of go at it from like a lot of customers that we have these days or just people coming to Cassandra DSE in general right they come from relational background right so they come into it and they see ooh key space tables that's like a database and tables and I've got a primary key I'm just gonna kind of set it up the way that I had before and there's no over here I'll get back to that later yeah okay we just we just go for it and then what happens is nodes are just fallen over because they didn't do things right or their application is just super slow because again they didn't do things right they're trying to go in and read from the tables and do joins on the outside yeah you getting stuff like that so just the kind of Education thing seems to be like the biggest hurdle we're at right now right so back in the old days when people were first starting to use Cassandra they were committing code back right they knew the ends in the outs of it so when they were starting to use it they had a really good idea what was going on in the hood right like what Cassandra expects you to write right but now it's becoming you know more mainstream right it's the cool thing right it's it's the it's the little skinny sweatpants and stuff like that you know yeah I tried once and they got like to my calf and they just stopped and that was the thigh and that was like many sizes bigger than yeah I don't get it that's not that's okay hey that's for if anyone wants to do that no judgment right no judgment I won't even try because I'm gonna end up looking like Lloyd Bridges and then he's got those pants is just like too big I'm not gonna happen oh I just totally totally that's okay but we were talking about how Cassandra's become normal oh yeah right so it's more mainstream now so you get everyone using it that doesn't know the insides an ounce of it might come from something else and they're just trying to take the understanding that they have of what they've been used to okay and try and apply it and we get a lot more you know just how many errors that you wouldn't you see a lot of issues around data modeling like oh yeah oh yeah we we actually have a contest in support no way yes and basically it's to see who can find the largest partition so you set up your data model wrong you're writing a bunch of data at the same partition right so whatever that token is it's just getting pounded and to date the largest partition that we found inside of support is three-quarters of a terabyte right Wow it wasn't that long ago that the biggest one we had was about 150 gigs so it's moving rapidly so you know maybe we'll get to a terabyte this year we'll see huh so yeah I mean if people would actually just kind of before they just start running up systems one of the biggest things they could do would be to look at our documentation they'll be a huge help and then the Academy courses you know that's a great starting point for anyone especially the data moment I have to admit I'm just gonna say that yeah and probably like kind of like totally so we just released the new DSC six versions of the 200 courses I believe and and we have a bunch of us all in it and so I'm you know I'm not even gonna say shameless I'm going for it yeah just watch them because they know honestly that to go off of that a little bit the DC courses either free right or the DSA courses right there they're free they're there there is a ton of material you of exercises you have I mean it gets deep into all like the fundamentals and everything so there we go that was our advertisement there's plug done but but but essentially though your net is a resource that you usually point folks to so the documentation DSA course is definitely so any any of that educational stuff that they have the DSA the documentation also I mean if there are customer bars I'm not sales guy or anything yeah pushing stuff but if you are bringing up a brand new system it's in development that you want to go alive at some point engaging our services team it's probably one of the most crucial things you could do okay okay I'm not sure how contracting all that kind of stuff goes I'm sure you know in general services cost money but I think in some cases there's some built in time that they have with every contract use that yeah because other guys can come out and they can kind of take a look and at least give you a heads up if things are kind of looking like they're going in the wrong direction okay there's lots of instances where people just kind of go with what they think is right they do their own a little bit of testing and then once it goes live natural production you know they get a higher volume of traffic in there and I can just things go down right yeah okay engage services okay no now I want to change it a little bit I'm curious so can you give me an idea of the background this is I know it's gonna be kind of a loaded question but like the background of a lot of the support engineers like as but and I don't mean individually I mean like do they go through like a training regimen or like you know how do you get built up to get on to that team and become a support engineer okay well obviously you have to have a little bit of previous experience right so we're looking for Linux administration experienced because that's important any experience with distributed systems in general okay so always a plus ideally maybe know some Java because anytime we're looking into what's going on you might be doing a co dive so if you can get at least kind of read what's going on yeah that's helpful but every support engineer that comes on now actually goes through a regimen and training program okay so we first teach them all the tools that we use internally for you know supporting the product you know our actual interface some tools we use to actually transfer data but then they go through actually based off the old academy your videos okay of core Cassandra okay right core operations and data modeling right right they go through all that stuff and then with each of those we actually have it constructed to where instead of just learning how to use it we break things along the way because their support okay right so only a little chaos monkey kind of yeah yeah somewhat so when they're learning just the basics of DSE right they learn all basically on a single note system but in there there's a few exercises where things just don't work out okay so you set those up like this that's there they don't know this is gonna happen right and you just kind of oh look a fire yeah fine and then once they've gone through all that okay I have a little what I call a capstone kind of exercise for the school where they get five servers that they have to install DAC on get it all working right then they bring up another cluster on their own using one of our internal tools okay then they have to start merging things together and that doesn't work right you have to go through and reconfigure a whole lot of stuff to get it to work right and then once they're feeling really confident about themselves and they've got this nice multi data center cluster up monitor with OP Center they tell me and I go in behind their back and I break everything so then they have to go through it's great what's wrong and there's different scenarios on each of the different notes you know I'm not gonna say what it is in case they're watching this at a point because I don't want them to cheat but a variety of things they actually have to dig through the logs dig through the file systems to figure things out and once they've actually got it all back up and running again that's done they move on to working with another Support Engineer as a mentor I already have at least some interaction with trying to fix okay so what I'm hearing overall though is that like generally speaking when someone comes in to the support team and they're gonna be a support engineer it's not like hey go no it's I mean there there is some time I mean cuz I know going through the courses myself right when I first came out idea stacks actually went through all those same TSA courses I spent weeks it's a lot of material right right and just doing that and so it sounds like they're they're given some time to ramp up and to get into to actually use it and figure I mean breaking things is a big deal right get it just launching it and going good isn't isn't enough right so it makes no point for us to not have something broken and work into it right okay so yeah they it's generally about depending on the actual engineer right their competencies okay two weeks to four weeks before they ever even look at a ticket okay and then from that point they take the very lowest level tickets to start out right right and they work with the mentors that way they can just kind of answer stuff be productive learn more as it goes on right develop their skills and eventually they're kind of on their own but then they're at the exact same level as everyone else that's working there so okay no that's that I did not I didn't know that you guys kind of put them through that particular regimen right I figured that they would look at some you know look at DSA and go through some materials I didn't realize that they actually had to mess with their own clusters and then have you go back there and just kind of just yeah they really have to invest mess around with stuff learn things my whole goal because I'm in charge of all that training stuff now is to try and get each engineer into the fetal position three weeks crying because if they've gone through that and they're fine tickets will be okay you know it's actually kind of a fun Segway because then I know that you know we have that we have one time a year right where well we'll invite other people from within data stacks to actually kind of get into that little apprenticeship if you will yeah and got some first-hand experience and some of that I was in the fetal position in a couple definitely was in the fetal position and actually speaking that so I guess one thing I guess before audience right as as maybe kind of best tips on when you are putting if you need to go to support right you've gone through the documentation you're just not getting where you need to go you know and you need to actually put it into support like some best tips to give them as far as the types of things that they need to be putting into it or something like that so one of the things I will just kind of address is the fact you mentioned looking through the documentation stuff like that first that that's always huge we've got a knowledge base inside of our support portal - so if you've got a problem you can go the knowledge base you can try and search to see if there's something similar to what you have Oh Oh might get the answer right away right and that's gonna be faster than putting in a ticket and waiting for responses to come back right because especially if it's not you know your data center is on fire type issue right it might take a little bit longer for us to get back to just because the way priorities go but once you've gone through that right when you're submitting a ticket don't just submit it and say I got this error message right right you know the biggest thing you can do to actually help out is context context is key and because generally I'm not saying always but generally when something goes wrong and it's just kind of happened something else has changed somewhere right so having the context about what's been going on right did you you know all of a sudden changed like the number of connections you have coming in did you change the number of noes have you done upgrades recently have you flipped right right something changed right yeah that's the biggest thing did you developer release a whole new version of their app or something like that do you just work fine then just stop right right unless there's some bug in it okay see what I'm hearing those you don't want you probably don't want a case where you have like a fully escalator ticket and it says note down that's probably not getting much comment it could you could yeah that's not really gonna get you the response that you want right away right and you may incur you know the ire of a support engineer that's just like having a frazzle day you'll never see it yeah plenty of support organization yes it's a hard job honestly it's it's our job yeah so I mean if you're if you're submitting the ticket note is down that's great but let us know was happening right before the node went down right right and have you looked through the logs or is there any information there related to it submit the logs at the very minimum you know because that would be a huge help because probably one of the first things going to happen is if you send something like that we're gonna ask you what's going on more and we're gonna ask you for logs because the logs have a lot of really good it's to that point I mean for that for that little stint that I spent there and my like a little support apprenticeship right I actually got a ticket just like that that's kind of why I mention it it's the first thing I ended up doing right I just asked ok I need the logs and then we look through the logs and we start figuring out what's going on you know we try to do that so we know at a minimum we're gonna need that information most likely did you ask them if they tried to turn it off and on again no I didn't actually do that yeah actually do that too yeah ok well that's good you know I didn't know that was still a thing yeah well I mean it's it's always a thing alright so from a standpoint of um not just the information maybe the initial information that someone might provide in a ticket are there other other other things that again from the best tips standpoint that you may give or are like I guess maybe even how to like think like a like think like a support engineer is that something like you know how to get in the mind of what a support engineer might need for you to get the best the best response that you know out of your ticket right okay so I'll just kind of take this as if I was a support engineer it was not the support engineer no the customer okay yeah so all of a sudden know goes down okay it's the first thing when to try and do is figure out if anything has changed right what's actually going on with our entire system here so for me that might be pinging other people in my department to see if they've done anything if they know of anything about it I mean the note is down so it is a very serious situation first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna go on the logs and see what the logs are telling okay so generally if it's not just some type of a silent failure there's gonna be error messages inside there and there's going to be stacktrace information now if it's something that is you know not open source you're not gonna be able to kind of dig through that stuff okay but if it's something that's based off of just you know the Apache Cassandra and you're getting errors inside of there one of the things you can do right away is to actually go out and look at the Cassandra github right I can do a code dive and see what's inside of there if if you're comfortable with that right right if you're not coming what happens you're not a developer you don't know how to you know that's not your thing if you're not comfortable that gather up the logs get as much information as you can about what's going on and then you kind of have to start taking whatever the particular problem is in trying to kind of investigate the different pieces that are inside there so it's kind of hard to give you a really good explanation as a from a customer side but yeah there's gonna be a lot of stuff they're not gonna have access to absolutely so I mean utilize the information you get from no tool because that can actually help you out a lot or some situations so net stats and TP stats are really good and kind of telling you you know what's going on as far as communication between the nodes or if you're different stages or kind of failing mutations or dropping things like that and kind of get an idea I would suggest anyone that is utilizing DSC to really study up on no tool really okay so no tool is kind of a big deal when it comes to good information that's inside of that you can get out of any particular no tool commands like status is obviously you know one that most people would probably know are there any other ones in there that are kind of interesting it's it's gonna kind of depend on your situation but obviously the TP status is probably one of the biggest ones okay okay info will give you good just general info about a node but the easiest thing to probably do that I would suggest to people is just to go in tight node tool yeah nothing else yeah but it spit out everything right secret anyway through the help commands yeah because if you're have any issues with compaction yeah compaction stats that'll tell you a lot of information you kind of see how compaction is running if things are being held up and then you can compare that to what's in the logs so there's since I started a node tool up it used to be like that ya know it's like that right right and we've got things from you know all the different setters and getters and all the different bits of info and then we even added in the Swiss Java knife like t-top so you can actually analyze threads and stuff over there that's actually been rolled into the product as of I think it was 5.1 okay so that's got some really good stuff there so if threads are hanging stuff you can actually utilize that and figure out what's going on a lot easier and instead of having to do an entire thread dumping managers kind of go is that now is that available also through no tool it's it's in yeah so it's I can't remember the exact command but I think it's no tool like sjk or something like okay but it is won't it is in there it is there so really what I'm hearing is that like as overall Swiss Army knife of cool diagnostic information especially things that might be helpful to like diagnose issues that are going on if you're seeing something you're closer no tool I mean I'm hearing no tool yeah it's so no tool logs and then any of the other just kind of standard troubleshooting stuff you might have going on so learn all of your basic Linux tools you know top I owe sad maybe I'm sad you know just have a good understanding of those make sure you know how to look at the kernel log if you need to okay in certain situations you know just just the basic stuff right a do it do a simple little course on Linux troubleshooting right learn that stuff and then a lot of what you need to figure out inside of DSC you can kind of get between that and the internal tools of like no tools though okay all right cool cool well thank you so much Sequoia for coming to this episode of the distributed data show and giving us all sorts of cool information as far as like the support group and some tips and tricks in that kind of deal and thank you all again for listening to another episode thank you for joining us again for the
