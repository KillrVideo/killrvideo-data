    "text": "[Music] hello my name is bob breity i'm a software engineer and dev manager for the studio project here at data stacks we'll be talking about graph data modeling today this is a big topic so let's jump right in process of graph data modeling can be broken down into a few steps to get started you will need to collect and analyze your data requirements this will enable you to decide on the entities and the relationships in your graph model clearly you will also need to understand the data access patterns for how you plan to query those entities and relationships once you understand your entities your relationships and your data access patterns you will use all that information to motivate the design of your graph schema as well as any optimizations that are needed to achieve the desired performance data stacks enterprise graph is built on the property graph data model if you're not familiar with that term then you may want to go review section 2 managing property graphs before you continue with this section but all right you're still here you're solid on property graph data model that's great there's just one more important thing i want to point out before we get too far along which is the difference between your schema graph and your instance graph we'll be discussing and looking at graph drawings of both so it'll be important to keep them straight your graph schema describes your graph data model or in other words the shape of how the data is modeled the primary elements in your graph schema are your vertex labels and your edge labels and then also the property keys that apply to each of those lastly indexes are also considered part of the graph schema when talking about the graph schema you can expect to see abstract terms such as vertex label user or vertex label movie edge label rated or property key name notice how those are all abstract terms so the graph schema describes the abstract shape of your data model cool the instance graph is where that data actually lives so in this graph you expect to see explicit instances of things such as user bob edge rated or the movie jaws the instance graph is what folks typically mean when they refer to their graph so that should feel pretty natural the key takeaway here is that we'll also be discussing the schema graph and that's a separate thing refers to your graph data model so you're going to want to keep that straight let's take a look at an example property graph schema to get more familiar with the idea this is our killer video graph schema we have four types of vertices movies users genres and people they can be related to each other by different types of relationships users may know each other and can rate movies movies belong to genres movies can have actors directors composers screenwriters and cinematographers and of course we have various vertex properties and one edge property in this schema user-defined vertex ids are underlined we have no meta properties in this case but we do have one multi-value property that is the production property please take a moment to study this schema it's the final product of the process that we're about to work through so you can get a sneak peek at where we're headed right now under the hood your graph schema is mapped to cassandra database schema you can see how that mapping occurs here vertex labels correspond to cassandra tables and property keys correspond to columns that make up those tables graph indexes correspond to materialized views secondary indexes and or search indexes depending on their specific configuration having an explicit graph schema is beneficial because you get better performance automatic data validation and improved data and domain understanding plus as we all know the schema has to live someplace if it's not defined explicitly then that just means that it's hiding in your application sprinkled around in your code let's take a look at the schema creation code for the killer video example here you can see how to define the properties and their types as well as their cardinality which is used to indicate the production property as a multi-value property here you can see an example of how to define a vertex label and an edge label we start by creating the movie vertex label using movie id as the partition key and then also assigns some of the properties that we previously defined then we defined the rated edge label we'll make this a signal cardinality edge because a user can only rate a given movie once then we assign the rating property to the edge label we also define the vertex labels between which this edge can exist using the connection method based on our data access pattern research we know that we're going to want to be able to query movies by title and by year so here's an example of setting up a materialized view and a secondary index to do each of those respectively now if you come from a cassandra background then it might be helpful to understand what the underlying cassandra model will look like in this example if you don't come from a cassandra background and this is foreign to you then that's okay too just hang tight for the next three slides here's what the property table definition would look like in our example we're looking at the movie underscore p table so you can see that we have our movie id as well as other movie properties such as country duration title etc you might notice that there's some additional fields in here that were not created explicitly by our schema creation code they have two tildes at the front and those are used by dsc graph to identify key fields that it needs to use under the hood similarly here's the table that corresponds to the edge adjacency table for the movie vertex label this table is called movie underscore e and you can see critical fields that are used by dse graph again as well as the movie id field and the rating field lastly if you recall we defined two indexes the first shown here is a materialized view index for movies by title and here is the underlying secondary vertex index creation snippet so again if you don't come from a cassandra background then don't worry understanding the schema mapping isn't critical in most situations all the heavy lifting is performed automatically behind the scenes by datastax enterprise graph but on the flip side understanding the schema mapping can help advance cassandra users who are transitioning to graph and want to understand how their traversals are being executed and what the performance implications are let's take a brief moment to mention the two different schema modes that datastax enterprise graph provides the first is development mode which does need to be enabled explicitly in this mode explicitly defining the schema is optional dse graph will automatically generate the necessary schema based on the data as you write it this is especially useful if you have an existing data set and you just want to get up and running quickly in production mode explicit schema definition is required schema evolution in this mode is challenging and can be expensive from a performance perspective in production mode explicit schema definition is required schema evolution in this mode is challenging and can be expensive from a performance perspective",
