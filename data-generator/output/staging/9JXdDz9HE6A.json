    "text": "all right well hello everyone um I'm Aaron from data stacks and um today I'm going to take you through building a gen application with Cassandra um AWS and langlow um so yeah that should be um yeah this should this should turn out to be really cool um let me just figure out is this the Shar screen button no sorry we um oh it'd be the button that says share you know that's that's probably uh yeah that'd probably be good to start with all right so anyway yes here we are welcome um yep building Jenny applications with Cassandra AWS and langlow um the idea here is that um you know if you've if you've been paying attention to um everything that data stack has been doing with Lang flow over the you know the the past um you know past while you'll you'll notice that a lot of langlow um at least the examples that we've shown have worked with with astb um you know we've we've brought up a few we've created a few lately that uh work with uh dsse you know data sax Enterprise now the thing is that that those are all those are both using the the data API and of course with traditional open- source Cassandra you don't have the data API available um so essentially this webinar is going to show you folks who are still using open source Cassandra how you too can get in on the you know get in on building a really cool uh generative AI applications with langlow so all right here we go so again you know kind of the the main thing um we're not going to spend a whole lot of time in in my slides here um we're going to go over a little bit of the architecture and then um you know yeah I'll demo the rest of it out just um just how you would stand the rest of this up and get Lang flow to run with Apache Cassandra all right so some quick definitions of terms um this is going to be based in AWS um and our cassander cluster is going to be running inside of um Amazon eks or elastic kubernetes service um you'll also hear me talk about Amazon ECS which you know a little different elastic container service that lets you take like you know dockerized images put them in your um your AWS account and run them actually as containers out in AWS Cloud resources pretty seamlessly actually um and then of course there's the ECR or Amazon you know elastic container registry um which is basically where we're going to send all of our um all of our images that we want to run as containers inside of inside of ECS and the reason that this is important is because these last two the ECS and the ECR are how or or anyway we're going to use them to actually run langlow out in AWS so that's that's why those two are important all right so I've gone over this before you know in a couple of the other live streams that I've that I've done but um with Amazon eks we are using data Stacks Mission Control to um you know kind of abstract kubernetes away a little bit just to make things a little bit easier to uh you know create new clusters manage new clusters you know handle things like uh you know like repairs and backups and and whatever else that uh that you might need and on top of or rather yeah yeah on top of data STX Mission Control we can we're using that as like a deployment platform for things like uh data Stacks hcd or hyperon converged database data Stacks Enterprise and of course Apache Cassandra so that's what we're going to go with today additionally um you know just having something running out there in the cloud isn't enough on its own we need an application um like I alluded to on the previous slide our application is going to sit on top of Amazon ECS and actually that application is going to be langlow so I'll show you how you can pull down a Docker container of langlow or a Docker image of Lang flow and then we'll go ahead and push that into Amazon ECR then build a new service in Amazon ECS using that that um that image and uh hopefully this will all work together great now you might be asking you you can't really use um Lang flow especially if you you know you want to do something that um that requires embeddings and you know working with with llms without a vector store well fortunately Cassandra has been a vector store as a version 5.0 um we can thank our founder Jonathan Ellis who uh who has gone out and created the uh J Vector library that we use inside of Apache Cassandra um and I have his uh the link to his GitHub project here it's just you know out at GitHub J bisj vector and uh you know you can see how uh how Jonathan put this all together um he he did have some help of course too but um the the idea here is that that this is what uh astb is running on top of I think I think Astro DB is running on top of J Vector V3 and then uh currently in Cassandra 5 is uh is J Vector V1 um so this is what actually kind of makes all of this possible today when we're when we're building like um like applications that are built on the retrieval augmented generation or the or the rag Paradigm um it's it's important to have a vector store underneath um and Apache Cassandra does that okay um of course without the data API we have to connect over 9042 now those of you who have used Cassandra for a while uh this this should not be you know Revelation at all you know cql over 9042 is a is kind of a kind of a known thing uh the the way to get to that in a a kubernetes environment you can see I have the the cube control um command on the bottom there is we're going to take our cluster service and we're going to expose it as a load balancer um with that Target Port of 9042 and that's going to allow traffic to um on that on that port to get to our cluster so this is that's a key step and we'll uh we'll walk through that as well um additionally to connect up we're going to need our username and password um now I know I've shown this before but when you create a um excuse me when you create a cluster inside of Mission Control your credentials get stored as a kubernetes secret and the way to to get that is to go ahead and do a cube control get secret and then the name of um you know what user it is and you know by default um you know mission mission control will create a new cluster with a um uh like the the name of your cluster Das super user and um you know that's what you would we' log in with initially anyway um but the uh the username and password for that secret um are actually like um like base 64 um encoded so um they'll actually come back in the encoded fashion and then you have to go ahead and like you know kind of like decode them in order in order to use them and that's important too because we will need our username and password along with our endpoint to uh connect up all right like I said we weren't going to spend a whole lot of time on slides um so really this is what we're going to do for our demo um kind of what I just talked about in the last few slides we're going to create that load balancer um on Port 9042 uh we're going to pull down the langlow docker image retag it and then push it to our Amazon ECR uh then we'll create a new service inside of um you know ECS using that image and once we get langlow up and running we'll create a new flow that will work as an AI shopping assistant so hey you know lots of stuff uh coming coming your way here now let's go ahead and uh and push forward all right so to start with I'm going to go to uh data Stacks Mission Control yeah maybe I should get slack out of here huh that's that's probably a good idea um I will need my terminal yeah this should uh let me just see how much room that all takes here let's jump to a a data Stacks one that'll be good okay got that set all right so mission control um if I go ahead and click on the uh the Clusters option in the left nav here you'll you'll see that I get a a little more detailed overview of the Clusters that I have available inside of Mission Control and you can see I have this cluster named fly by night that is running on Cassandra 501 and that's the one that we're going to be using today um I also have an older version of DSE out here that I've been I've been messing around with but we're not gonna we're not going to touch that today all right so if I go and have a look at this cluster you can see I have a data center named Anthem um I have three nodes and all are all are up and running so we should be uh we should be in good shape here let's go ahead and have a look at the services that we have here so I can do a cube control say get service say namespace um and my namespace is eron CR and then it has a unique slug of like what is it 5H C6 U XP all right and then just to make sure that we're getting the resources back for the cluster we're going to use we'll just throw on a GP of fly by night just like that okay um so you can see here that uh that we have our uh our Fly by Night Anthem service um it does go ahead and throw out the um or offer that Port of 9042 uh available now you'll notice I actually already do have the load balancer out here um you know there are there are some things that uh I didn't I didn't want to take chances on a live demo so I I did make sure that that I do have that out there um but I will run through the command here quick without running it just so you folks can kind of see what it is um so if I was going to do that I'd say let's go Cube control and we'll say expose service and we'll be we'll be doing yeah it's going to be this um this Fly by Night Anthem service like that there we go and we're going to say Das type load balancer um we're just going to name it well as you can see there I already named it you know um we'll say fly by night um lb that should be that should be fine um and then again we'll go ahead and uh make sure we paste in the right Nam space and then also important make sure we specify our Port of 9042 and our Target Port of 9042 just like that um this should go ahead and expose that that Main Service um as a load balancer that we can go ahead and we can hit later um the other important thing here to remember is that um when you when you connect up to Cassandra with langlow it can't hit a DNS name um you know so if I have have this this is what uh this is what resolves out from that load balancer this is the DNS name well you know I I can go ah and hit that for most normal applications but um but langlow is not going to allow to allow Cassandra to connect up that way uh so what I need to do is get the IP address and again just a quick trick to do that um I'm just simply going to do a ping oh not pint ping all right and of course that's going to fail uh because we uh we block the Ping Port by default but excuse me what you can see is I do actually get uh the IP address out of that uh load balancer so I'm just going to go ahead and save that off here for later that's that's going to be important all right so um the other thing I need remember I did mention about um about the credentials so let's go ahead and do a uh coue control and we'll say get uh secret [Music] and would help if I spelled secret right and we're going to say fly By Night super user to get the default and let's also go ahead and uh make sure that my name space is pasted in there properly and we want to Output that say- o as a yaml just to kind of format that appropriately okay so if I run that you can see up here um that secret shows up I have the uh username and password there are both there um and code base 64 now if I actually want to see what that is um I can go ahead and do a echo and let's just let's just demo this with the username I'm not GNA I'm not gonna um decode my password here um I get yelled at by security when I do that so um let's just go and and say yep we'll Echo that and then I'm going to pipe that to B Crypt oh no I'm not that's Java sorry I was thinking with the wrong part of my brain there um base 64 that's it and then I'm going to pass A-D for dcode and you can see when I do that I get the actual username back here um so of course if you're going to do the password going to want to decode the password from this up here you would take that exact same step and uh you could decode that all right okay next um let's go ahead and uh and have a look at at Docker here so if I say Docker pull and we're going to pull this from langlow oh I need to spell that properly langlow AI Lang flow there we go as you can see it does pull that down uh to my local this might take a little bit uh depending on your connection but not too much longer um and you know I'll just kind of talk through this too the next thing we need to do is retag it um with our um Amazon ECR um registry endpoint so I'm going to do that next as well excuse me almost done hey there we go all right so we have a newer image okay outstanding all right so now if I oh there's a window I forgot to bring over here if I have a look at Docker um you can see that I do in fact have uh have Lang flow here um and this was uh yeah this is the uh this is the most recent one um and you can also see that uh I've gone ahead and um and retagged it already um so that you can see that it matches up with our um um Amazon ECR um endpoint um and that and that's important because you know then we can do a Docker push and it'll actually end up inside of our inside of our registry um all right so let's go ahead and [Music] um let's see here I'm looking around in my notes and I'm wondering where I got this one well let's see here let's just go how about um prep and then we can say Docker actually there we go all right so you can see that the um the last time that I I had to do this is right here actually um so this is the um the identifier for um you know that uh that image on my local um I went ahead and retagged it with um you know this URL right here that goes to my uh my Amazon on ECR and um yeah see it goes to data Stacks actually I'd built this registry for all the demos that we ran during Amazon reinvent um and that's that's why that's still out there so that goes to data STX reinvent 2024 and then in the end I have the you know the mention of mention of langlow um so normally this is where where I would do like a um you know like a Docker like a Docker push so I could say like uh let's go ahead and read up that and say push yeah there we go so you can see this is where I've gone ahead and sent up a lang flow in the past um so if I actually look out here now in um Amazon ECR and um you can see that um out in our repositories we have a couple I'm going to pick this data Stacks reinvent one here and yeah we have a um we have an image out there for langlow that uh that we can use um so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to copy the uh the image URI right here so I'm just going to click that and um kind of store that off just in case um usually the the ECS the Amazon container service does a pretty good job of like Auto auto dis Auto um sorry of like I just got caught up in the comments for a second there um yeah yeah usually Amazon ECS does a pretty good job of like kind of autofilling the the available um image Uris um but I like to copy it just in case because I I've had it not find it all the time in the past anyway so let's go here and we're going to click on ECS or Amazon's elastic container service all right and out here you can see I have the aptly named reinvent cluster from again all the the demos that I I built for uh for reinvent um there's currently nothing running out here though see if I if I go ahead and restart or refresh I should say nothing nothing shows up um so what we need to do is create a new task and I can go to test definitions and you can see I actually do have a a lang float task out here but let's create let's create a new one let's say langlow let just call it langlow live stream because well that's that's kind of what we're doing here all right let's let's go down um make sure that when you run langlow uh to use Linux x86-64 the uh container or the the docker image itself um is not built using an arm processor so um you know I know you've probably anyone who's used Docker a bit on the new Max like the the M1 through M4 um with the arm processors has probably run into like an invalid OS at some point um so again with Lang flow just make sure you're using Linux x86 that's that's going to be kind of important okay um default task roll is fine task execution Ro is fine let's name this langlow I'll just call it langlow live okay remember we copied off our image URI um this is where we're going to paste it so I'm just going to go right here yeah you can see it it has a bunch of them that come up um oh you can see the uh the different names of them kind of pop up there in there as I scroll um there's the langlow one so we'll we'll go ahead and use that um it absolutely is an essential container uh we don't really need Port 80 exposed so I'll just go over with um 7860 um that is the default port for Lang flow uh so when you're you're running Lang flow on your own um that's what uh that's what uh you're going to want to make sure you you have there um we don't need any environment variables I think the rest of this is all good let's just go ahead and create okay so that's given us a new task next we're going to deploy this task by creating a service and same thing it's going to autocomplete a lot of this um for yep for our service name we'll just say langlow live that should be that should be fine um the main thing we're going to have to adjust here is in the networking tab uh the default VPC should be okay subnets are okay um the security group name uh the default Security Group is usually not going to be enough we're going to want a security group that has um that has an opening for Port 7860 so um I have that named aptly AWS reinvent demos and I know that that security group has the has the ports open that I that I need for it um so that should be okay let's go ahead and do a create all right so that's that's spinning up sometimes that takes a it takes a couple of minutes to uh to come up um if I go down and I hit the refresh here you can actually see that uh that yep the Lang flow live live service is on its way up um zero one tasks running so yeah this should uh this should be along in another another minute or two oh huh Tanya I just now saw your your note about uh wanting to increase the uh the screen size I do apologize for not noticing that until now um I hope you've been able to um you know at least kind of at least kind of see what we're we're doing here um you know at least a little bit um the good news is that uh this live stream will be rebroadcast later um it'll it'll be available on um on our our YouTube channel um you might even be able to watch it on I don't know if LinkedIn live lets you lets you watch watch something that that has already happened but it will be on our YouTube channel so you can go back and you know watch it on a big screen or even even zoom in a little bit and that should be you should find that helpful all right let's see how our service is doing here well still on its way up so anyway once this um once the service comes up we'll go ahead and go into langlow and create a brand new Vector store rag flow um and then we'll go ahead and um and use that as kind of like the the scaffolding if you will to um you know build up our our AI shopping assistant shouldn't take too much longer hey there we go one of one running outstanding okay all right so now if I go into our service uh I should be able to look at our tasks yep here's our task that's running and if I click into that I get a public IP address um so I'll copy that now I'm not going to say open address because that's going to try and open it on um like the standard web Port of like port 8080 and we definitely don't want that so let's go ahead and create new HTTP there's our IP address and then we'll go to 7860 and if we did everything right oh oh it's doing something all right outstanding there's langlow that's that's going to be one of the more one of the more um you know um like shaky where shaky random weirdness things can happen inside of a live demo so I'm I'm glad we got this far all right so if you've never used langlow before um essentially this is a a component-based gooey kind of sort of like a like an IDE actually um where you can drag and drop different components and build an AI application I it's it's really slick if you haven't messed around messed around with it at all uh so let's do a new flow I'm going to say Vector store rag there we go all right and you start out with with Vector store rig you actually get two flows inside of one um we're actually going to build out both of these here uh the top one here is for um the actual like um like AI assistant interactions um as it goes back and forth with like the the llm and the chat model um and the the vector store and you know kind of gets you your results the bottom one here is just to load the data and generate the embeddings so let's go in here and uh here you go Tanya here I can actually zoom in quite a bit so I I hope that's uh that's enough for you okay so we have some components here that we're not going to use first of all this AI embeddings one we're not going to bother using today um under models over here I'm going to grab Amazon bedrock and I'm going to uh drop that in oh actually that one's going to go up above yeah you know what we're still going to use that one let's let's put that up here because I got to get rid of the um I have to get rid of this uh this a open AI one that's that's yeah that's more of like the uh the chat model what we want is the embeddings model and if I go down and then grab Bedrock all right there we go there we go we have Amazon Titan Ed V1 that is what we want oh and I can delete that that's not a big deal all right let me go ahead and fill that out real quick uh oh all right let's try my uh axis key one more time there we go outstanding um now if you use for for AWS you use your access key ID and your secret access key you don't need to mess with the session token um however we are using Us West 2 so I'm going to want to switch my region there okay that should be good next uh Lang flow defaults to use um oh I can move this a little so you can actually see just based where my my head is showing up here um I can go ahead and get rid of the as Master DB connector because we're not going to use that and let me go to Vector stores and if we just grab Cassandra um that that should work okay so let's go let's connect up chunks with inest data and yeah we can drop our chunk overlap to uh to half that um and then let's run embeddings to embeddings there um remember before when I went in and did a ping of the load balancer to get the IP address that is where we're putting that um username let's see here I'm just going to do a username of [Music] um yeah here we go fly by night super user and then my password oh all right um for keyspace um come on in my notes yeah here we go I'm just using blf flow test and then a table name I'm just going to say Astra um Peril AI just like that all right let's let's double check something in Mission Control quick so if I go ahead and in my uh cql console here and we [Music] say and all right and we say what did I say Lang flow test just like that okay so the key space is empty but but the keyspace has to exist with this component before you can go ahead and run it okay so we got that the only other piece here is that um you know for our for our shopping assistant needs to know about our product data so what I'm going to do is click on our file component here and documents there we go products 2. CSV so this will take just a standard like CSV file um this has all like the product data you know if you've watched any of the things that we that we did any of the live streams we did on um like our our e-commerce Workshop that I used to run a couple years ago that's where the product data is from okay so if I have all this and I click the Run button on Cassandra over here and I've done everything right it should go through the components and build everything successfully okay ha that did it all right so oh of course it logged me out here so let's go in and check our table real quick or check our keyspace real quick ah I yeah fat fingered my password all [Music] right there we go okay all right now I can say use langlow uh test say describe keyspace bam you can see it created the table um using uh two SII indexes um and we actually have our our Vector column here which is a float 1536 that matches up with the um Amazon Bedrock Titan text Ed V1 okay um now if I check this table out let's let's just do select star from Astro apparel AI um there should only be like 20 rows in there so doing a select star isn't isn't too big a deal but if I run that hey 24 rows outstanding and you can see yeah all of the um all the embeddings came through um our product descriptions are all are all right here so yeah this worked um this worked really well actually okay um and now just the last piece of this uh we have the um the loading flow working um now let's go ahead and create the um the chat flow uh so again I have this open AI embeddings component here that I'm just going to do a delete on so the cool thing though is that inside a lang flow I can duplicate components and I'm going to do that with Amazon Bedrock to avoid having to retype everything so let's take that and go there and hook our embedding model up just like that um I can also do the same thing with this ASB component as well so let's just go here and say delete then I can go to the Cassandra component and I can say duplicate and let's run that right back to here all right so I can go embeddings to embedding and then search results to data and then I also have to run the chat input to the search query node okay so that should be that um yeah we have to we have to fix that let's have a look at the prompt here real quick um so if I go to the prompt and kind of Click into here you can see it's just a generic um you know like AI chat prompt um I actually have some rules or you know what we call guard rails that we that we put in here that I'm just going to go here and I'm going to paste them in so essentially I'm telling the chatbot hey you're a shopping assistant for the Astro apparel online store um you must only answer questions about asro apparel products you may only use the product data in the provided context and cannot use any other sources for answers that part's really important by the way so this is going to force it to go ahead and use the data that's inside my Vector store inside of Cassandra um and you must format your responses about product data like product ID comma description comma image um this was actually really important for building a demo at reinvent um just so that our our frontend designers kind of knew what the format of the data was going to look like coming in so that they could parse it out appropriately um yep and then question and context um very important you still have that context up here because that's going to tie back to the vector store and the question of course is going to come from the uh the chat itself so we should be able to check and save I don't need that okay so our prompt should be all right all right last step here um let's get rid of the uh the open AI llm component let's just delete that uh we have our Amazon Bedrock component um which our prompt is just going to tie right to our um oh ah does tie to the input okay I just had to I had to double check that oh by the way you can do uh you know alt or command Z to backspace over your actions in in Lang flow as I just um I just uh learned myself so let's send prompt message to input um we're going to go text coming out of here to go to the chat output um for our model I want to use uh anthropic Claude Sonet uh let's see [Music] here yeah 2024 1022 V2 that's the one I want to use okay so I've got that um and then let's go ahead and paste my AWS [Music] key and secret and I have both of the Bedrock models I'm using um authorized in US West to so I'm going to want to switch my region I think that's it um so let's let's back out a little bit here and if we hit this little run component button on the chat output or whatever is the last component it should build a whole flow and if we did it right it should work or it should not throw an error how about that okay I'm seeing a lot of green so far that's that's good outstanding okay um one thing that I could have done is that in this chat input is has a sample question of what is the document about um I have a feeling that the that the AI assistant isn't going to handle that question very well but what I can do is I can go to the playground here um oh yep and it it actually did say hey this is a you know a product category or inventory list for Aster apparel you know you can ask it you know all of these things um what I'm going to do is I'm going to say um can you help me find a hoodie and it's going to think for a little bit um sometimes these answers are uh are you know they they come along faster than others but um you know for for the most part it's it's um it's usually it's usually like a little less than 30 seconds oh yeah here we go here we go look at this so we have these products such as the data Stacks black hoodie um and there's also the um the Vintage MVP hoodie as well um and it has details on like you know how many sizes it comes in um you know so so again I can ask the shopping assistant I I can say please tell me more about the Vintage 2015 MVP pie um and again it'll go ahead and you know kind of look at that at that last answer that it gave um and then based on you know the the context and what we have in the vector store it'll kind of come back and have a little it should have a little bit more detailed answer about that hoodie specifically yep here we go it's it's very warm and comfortable um you might find yourself falling asleep while wearing it um given out to MVPs at the 2015 Cassandra Summit um yeah so so this is um this is totally working um excellent all right let me uh let me bounce back to my slides here um so yeah thanks for um thanks for thanks for joining me on this one I wonder if I can move well I can't really move my uh my um picture and picture around can I maybe I can well that doesn't really help either does it no well I mean this is okay um we have a Discord server so if you're using any of our products or you know and maybe you're having some issues with them um you can head on out to uh Discord g/d Stacks that'll get you an invite for our Discord server um and we can help you out there if you have questions with um you know like Astra or dsse or hcd um or even Lang flow and uh as well as any of our uh any of our libraries and things that you're using to build like an AI application um we can totally help you out there additionally I mentioned our YouTube channel data STX developers uh that's where this video is going to be and we also have a whole bunch of other videos and content out there um for you to check out so again if you get stuck on something or you wanna quick tutorial on like how to do something with like mission control and DSE and maybe build an application on top of that we have we have lots of things out there on that we have great detail out there on on langlow as well and how to build on top of that um and of course I mean feel free to check out uh data.com as well um I know that there's there's one one URL in particular here that uh oh and no I'm not uh I'm not finding it of course um oh yep here it is here we go it's our it's our modernize um Apache Cassandra Oh I can add myself back in now probably yeah yeah this is our our modernized you know Apache Cassandra workloads page we have all kinds of resources out here um you know whether you're um whether you're using you know fully managed Cassandra out in the cloud somewhere or like DSE or Cassandra on your own kubernetes um you need Enterprise support for open source Cassandra we can totally help you out here um if your Cassandra you know footprint needs to go through a cloud a cloud migration um we have all kinds of of steps and resources here that can that can help you out um so I highly recommend heading out to this modernized Apache cassander workloads page um I'm pretty sure that that Michelle has a has a link to that that she she's added in somewhere here but um you know short of any technical questions or anything I think that's uh that's about it me just click oh Q&A tab looks empty I don't see any more in the um in the in the chat um I suppose we can we can just end it here so um so yeah like I said um you know this is this is uh just a great way to show that even with and open source um like Voltron in the background yeah outstanding I was just gonna say that that even with open source Cassandra um you can still get in on building out you know all all of the recent um you know applications with the recent AI developments and Cassandra can totally support that and um you can even use something you know that that's cool and schnazzy looking like like Lang flow on top of that so yeah thanks everyone for joining and um have a great day we'll talk to you later",
