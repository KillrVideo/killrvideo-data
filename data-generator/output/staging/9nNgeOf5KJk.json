    "text": "all of these things and just to break down a few oh we went back so just to break down a few um it supports unstructured data really well it efficiently stores our high dimensional data so vectors so it's in the name Vector databases and embeddings and again we'll go over the difference and the S and the what those two things are the complex queries as you mentioned just kind of skimming here um but the one important thing or one of the main important things is this last one here allows for fast data access and retrieving relevant results and that's where we kind of go back to our rag applications so in rag applications again this is not a rag Focus tutorial but we need a vector database to be able to handle this data that we can augment to our llms and our data sets to help with our generative AI applications and maintain relevancy in our results um how many times have you asked chat GPT a question and it's given you kind of a irrelevant results or it's hallucinated um Annie and Andy I'm sure you can both kind of relate or think about time that you've done that exactly right and and that happens a lot with our um with so much data sets that are only trained to a specific point and to help fix with that help fix those um inst instances you need a vector database and no more technical difficulties here um so what exactly though are vectors oh we're flipping back and forth sorry that's not me guys so what exactly are vectors if we think quickly back into our math classes from before um maybe your fifth grade math class we learned about these kind of line graphs and Vector spaces um and before and we could tell by here just real quick um we have a one-dimensional space a two-dimensional space and a three-dimensional space and um going back to the definition that we use for Vector in math class versus how I Define it now I think one common way that we can describe both terms um or both contexts is that a vector is a term that refers to a quantity that cannot be expressed by a single number so let's use this in the concept of a two-dimensional space and representing our data so let's take for example I want to represent um this puppy and I'm going to have my x axis represent um wild and domestic oh we're going back and forth and the in the y- axis be feline versus K9 so if I want to represent this puppy here um maybe it'll be more on the domestic side and the canine side and if we want to do a search query back into our Vector space back then in math class and we wanted to see how similar two points were to each other so for example if I introduced maybe a kitten back then in math class we would do what's called the distance formula and calculating the distance between these two points same idea goes for finding the similarity between these two in a vector space so what does that mean when we introduce multiple points of data now we can kind of mentally group um some of a group of data sets uh sorry data on this Vector plane so for example on the top right we have all of these kind of home domesticated dogs on the bottom we have kittens but maybe on the left side which kind of s more on the Wild Side we have a wolf but it's still a canine or on the other side it's a wild um feline a lion so we can kind of see how this uh groups on a vector space but if that's still not kind of making sense about how vectors represent our data let's do a quick demo so I will share my screen here all right thank thank you um Amy Amy thank you so much all right here is um astb it is our Vector database as I mentioned previously and we are looking right now into a collection so a collection is where you store your data and I have actually the exact data points that you saw in that last slide and again we have our librador puppy we have are tabby cat etc etc lion and wolf and I want to do a search query let's just use the German Shepherd for example so if I want to do something that's a bit similar to German Shepherd we might suspect that we'll get the domesticated dogs we might get the wolf before we ever get um recommended the cat breeds or the feline breeds um notice here how they're kind of out of order and once I do the similarity search which I can just do by press ing this button here we can see how um they reorder based on how similar they are to each other so let's do a search on the German Shepherd and see how they reordered to show the German Shepherd as similar similarity score one following that as expected we have the labrador the Corgi and the Wolf and then the feline breeds on the bottom and notice how the lion has the least similarity to the German Shepherd but again this is only in a two-dimensional space we're only we're describing our data only with two Dimensions um and that was Wild versus domestic and Feline versus canine what if we kind of expanded further from just the two-dimensional space in describing our data let's hop back quickly hey Mel I think a really good question came up in the chat from ran mentioned how did we get these numbers that were calculated for these animals over here yeah um Rajan great question um these were all completely arbitrary vectors that we did um and that's just to kind of visualize what it would be on a two-dimensional space and we're going to kind of get to where or how we can actually represent the properties a bit deeper so it gives us a better description of the data points that's a great question so um yeah keep in mind the two-dimensional space can only go so far and that's why we must think about nend dimensional spaces what if we had many many numbers within our vectors Beyond just the two dimensional space beyond just describing them of Wild versus domestic or Canan versus feline what if we were able to dive deeper than that and describe other properties maybe their habitat their lifespan um how big they are how small they are Etc and we get into this realm of embeddings and I'll hand it over to Andy to talk a little bit more about that thanks so much Melissa that was great so I think we have a good understanding of what a vector is and what it you know semantically means but let's dive a little bit deeper and get more into embeddings um and and learn more about them so let's get started um so perfect what is a embedding how is it different than a vector so on and so forth well first off vectors and embeddings are often used interchangeably so definitely don't freak out out if you hear them kind of being used for one another um because often times you will hear um a vector and or an embedding in the same context um and that usually means that both of them are referring to the numerical representation of a piece of data and that's exactly what you've been seeing in our demo um with all the different um animals here on the left hand side but if we want to get a little bit more specific um or a little bit nuanced well an embedding is actually a um more of a technique to actually represent a piece of data um via a vector and so although what you see here on the left hand side is an arbitrary numbers um embeddings are what we actually hold the semantic meaning through this array of numbers AKA vectors um and so that's great um the key difference is that embeddings are designed to capture two main things first off the semantic relationship and the contextual characteristics of a piece of data um and so we go far beyond just canine and Feline um but now we characterize all the different aspects of a piece of data and here you see just a quick image of um different you know items and data points um that are characterized in the 300 dimensional space so you can see chicken wol so on and so forth um we can characterize this through embeddings so what does an actual embedding really look like um well an embedding really is far more intense than you know these these examples that we're showing you this is an example of a real life Vector embedding of a computer terminal um and so what we see here is not just two Dimensions or 2D um but in fact actually 1536 dimensions and luckily for us um it's actually uh it's very easy to generate these vectors um and these are these embeddings through embedding models and so in this case we actually generated this uh Vector embedding through open AI text embedding Ada two model um which then outputs the vector that you see here and so this is a onetoone match between our computer terminal and our you know embedding um and so that's kind of where you know how I like to think about it is all embeddings are vectors but not all vectors are embeding um so that's kind of one one way I like to frame it hey Andy um great great explanation and I just wanted to call out rajan's question from earlier um that you actually answered through your explanation real quick um so yeah just to hone in again like he's asking what how do these vectors even get um calculated right and so Andy talked a little bit about open ai's embedding model um but yeah embedding models are how we do this and just depending on your use case um you might use a specific embedding model so there are a lot out there from different providers um that are able to do this across different dimensional spaces so this one in particular is 1536 but others might be even larger some might double that just depending on how you know granular you want to get with um your data Andy I don't know if you want to add to that no you're exactly right there um also keep in mind that the more Dimensions the more specificity you're kind of defining your data as and so um the less Dimensions you're kind of keeping it more generic the more obviously you're holding more of these characteristics or properties and attributes um so something to keep in mind while you're doing your vector surfes um and looking at inventing models um but yeah great question and so awesome we've learned about vectors we've seen a quick little demo and now we learned about you know embeddings but how do we find the similarities between these embeddings and how is that really useful um this is where we actually come into a new term called Vector St um and with that being said I'll pass it over to Annie to kind of give a little bit more in-depth overview of Dr St and it's import great thanks Andy um I think one one other point that I kind of want to make about like embeddings and how the values are created um like these these embedding models are kind of like a new wave of AI and ml there are still traditional ml techniques where you can say like I want to Define this number of parameters and I want to use this model to assign them based on like XYZ and all of that can be like still done but the power of embeddings models is that like someone else has created this extremely powerful model that abstracts away all of that sort of decision making in a way that's like really reliable and Powerful so it it's still it's still ml you're just like assigning weights to different things um but whether you're kind of defining that yourself or allowing like providers such as open Ai and vertex Ai and all of these other companies who've trained vast amounts of data to do that that's like kind of the major difference there um just just to kind of expand a little more that's a really good point Annie and and adding on that kind of um going off of depending on what use case you use you might test across multiple embeddings models and determine how well they're doing for your use case based on how deep the uh based How deep the similarity research um is so if you saw in the example we had you know German Shepherd ranked number one and you saw the similarity score of one and then you saw how the others ranked under it right um so depending on how your data was embedded you know one might calculate um all the canine breeds as the most similar and then maybe on one you might get the lion more similar to The Wolf um you know just based on how it's weighted domestic versus wild or can9 versus feline so it really all depends um and you can use all of these embedding models pretty much with the single API call to be able to do that we'll kind of talk a little bit about more how it's ASB but that was a great call out Annie so thank you oh we do have some questions here um let's see Steve how does a model assign a vector to a flat panel display so that it appears as similar to the CRT monitor shown in the example can you can you expand on that question a bit more Steve I think I think I kind of know what he's getting at here um so so if a model was given like flat planel display how how is it assigned something so that if you were do to to do a vector search that you'd get that as a similar result um if if you wanted to go ahead and answer that got it yeah so so Steve so maybe the the visual part of it won't be the only thing that it's being characterized on right so it'll still have the context that these are both computers and then it'll grab properties from the fact that they're both computers and also include that in the embedding um but you know to your maybe you'll see more um this flat panel displays as ranked higher similarity versus the older mon s um and then those will have like kind of less but contextually they're still um ranked maybe the same based um on the fact that they're both computers I hope that makes sense um another question and also Annie did you want to add to that um yeah I think I think um like the way the vector itself is assigned is um like the model that you're using is trained on a ton of natural language and Text data um and then based on all of that training the model has a way to kind of represent the flat panel disp display as like this large array of numbers that are created based on that Foundation of huge amounts of data um so however that that's like generated through the embeddings model that's like a bit abstract the numbers themselves like it's hard to know what they mean but like when paired with the model it represents like this is a green that's used for like viewing like XYZ you can connect it to blah blah blah all of that is like represented somehow in the vector um and so that's how like once that representation is created that's how you're allowed to do those similarity searches and have those two items be um kind of related through that model there there's a ton of questions coming up let's let's uh let's keep going yeah hopefully your answers get get um sorry hopefully your questions get answered through this next part with Annie's explanation cool okay um so so let's talk a little bit about Vector search uh which is interchangeably called similarity search um so something that you'll need in order to conduct this similarity search or vector search is a vector database um so let's revisit some of the slides from the beginning of the live oh of the live stream sorry are uh Melissa are you able to do the slides for me I think we were maybe both doing them great um cool so we Melissa talked earlier about a traditional DB versus a vector DB uh traditional databases such as relational uh old old Cassandra for example um they're really good at storing highly structured data uh you can Define different columns and query based on keyword search or operators such as Melissa mentioned um but they struggle with querying these high-dimensional vectors and unstructured data uh they also struggle with um retrieving this type of information from a large data set and scaling efficiently as data grows uh but a vector database will allow you to um find data that's similar to XYZ so once you've taken your unst structure data and created vectors out of it uh you need to put it into a vector database so that you can do those similarity queries uh next slide um so again these are the qualities of a vector DB that are important for Gen projects uh a few that we want to highlight specifically in the next slide um are one uh we want uh Vector DB to be able to efficiently store High dimensional data so vectors or embeddings like these things are being created by these power for models uh we also o want the vector database to be able to support high performance searches using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms so um when we're trying to search for related vectors related data within the DB we need some sort of algorithm in place to make that efficient and quick uh and also accurate instead of doing like a scan of every single Vector in the entire DB we need something implemented so that you can pull only the most relevant and an efficient way um and then that's also related to the third Point uh which is allowing for fast data access and retrieving relevant results um one example of a vector DB is data Stacks aser DB data Stacks is the or that we work for um and a few of the algorithms available within it are cosine similarity dot product similarity and ukan distance uh these are all different uh metrics that you could use um for calculating the distance and conducting your similarity search um if you want to go to the vector search visual um back a few slides here at this one um so if we bring it back to this visualization um this is kind of what it's a visualization of what your data would look like after it's been placed in a vector DB um and so every data point is stored in a vector DBS embeddings from there you can run Vector search query to find similar points based on those embeddings using semantic similarity or proximity um and then Vector search uh if you if you implemented this with Astro DB you can make these Vector search uh Vector based searches in real time um a few points about Astra DB um it's really quite easy to embed your data with Astra you could either bring your own vectors or use the vectorized integration to create embeddings as you're uploading your unstructured data uh there's a variety of easy ways to connect to your database from your application so there are tons of different clients and drivers available there's a really simple API the data API which you could use um in Astra uh using using all of those different connection methods it's easy easy to store your data in the database uh if you want to include additional Fields Beyond just the vector and the text itself uh it's really flexible and you can store different data types as well uh and then if you want to perform both complex and simple Vector searches or just traditional uh searches that don't use Vector similarity all of that's possible um using hybrid search via the UI using our apis using the clients using the drivers kind of whatever method you want to do so that that's kind of why Astro DB is a pretty powerful option in terms of a vector DB um cool so so that's kind of an overview of like what is a vector DB why we need it um moving let me see so up until this point we've discussed vectors vector embeddings vector search and Vector DBS um all kind of in general um maybe we want to address one or two of these questions before we uh go to the demo uh which uh in a second Melissa can get into showing the UI and showing how we do it with code um so any anything we want to address from the Q&A yeah we can start up from to the top so one question um that I see right here is how much does the embedding actually impact a model's response um and so just to kind of shed a little bit of light into that um your your model and your embedding model is very important because that's how your data is going to be characterized and classified um so that kind of digs into a little bit what I was talking about regarding the number of Dimensions um obviously the more Dimensions that your embedding model um returns back to you um means that it's kind of characterizing the data in a more fine grained way um however there's always this balancing act that you want to do where um how many dimensions is too many right we don't want to um do any you know searches that are you know across you know millions and millions of vectors or Dimensions long um and so usually you know once you you find this Balancing Act we we see that you know anywhere from around 700 to 15 you know 26 even a little bit beyond that is kind of what the the status quo is um and then obviously like Andy mentioned there's multiple of these third- party um you know companies that have come out with their own embedding models so it's definitely something that you do not need to set up right out of the box um don't know if anyone else wanted to shed some more light into that no that was awesome Andy um and just for the concept of time um we will go into the demo just really quick um because I did promise that we're going to show you how to get started with astb or your database um in general but thank you so much for the questions and we'll be happy to uh follow up with these after if you'd like to um keep in contact with us but anyway let's let's quickly do the demo and we also have the quiz at the end so I just wanted to show a little bit more of astp to you all and how you can get started um with a vector database in particular creating a database is really simple in our platform all you have to do is go down to where it says create a database and give it a name and then select your region and literally create database you are on your way um it does take us a few minutes just to start up so I will go into one of our existing databases that I already have and go back into our collection um adding data is as simple as Annie was mentioning which is just pressing our load data right here and you can select a file let's see actually let's go ahead and create a new collection and then selecting the embedding generation method Annie mentioned that we have a key word called vectorize in which you can bring in an external embedding source and then use that in your vectorization process so it does it for you just in one go on insertion and you can select the model that does well for you the dimensions here um in the example we used Ada here it is as well and again as any was mentioning we have the similarity metrics built into astb also and you can select that based on your preference once that's done um go ahead and see you can see that it's creating the collection this only takes a few seconds and then uploading your data is really simple as well um you just have to load your data drag the file that you um use so in this case we will go into our new collection and I actually have a kind of more flushed out CSV file for our uh K9 and Feline breeds let's do that this way here we go and perhaps the demo Gods aren't on our side right now for this let's TR there we go and then on the top it says field to vectorize and again that just means creating the generating the embeddings and we can select which column of our data that we want to turn into the vector so this is where it's going to be grabbing the context from um turning it into that large string of numbers or an embeding and this is what it'll be performing the similarity search based off of in this case I will do it off of the description column and then once you click low data in the background it's doing all of the work pretty much for you and then creat The Collection um based off of which column you've selected to vectorize and then the rest of the columns that are there present what you should see at the end there um is all your data then loaded into your collection and then you can see that a new column has been created called Vector I'll go into this Json view right here and it creat large dimensional Vector for you based off of the description and it actually updates the description column to the word vectorize and that's just how you know that this is the field that is being vectorize and converted into the vector um and for all my people who like to do it through code again this was just through the UI it's showing how easy it is to get started that way but I know um we're here because we like to develop and we like to get Hands-On code well we also have that available too within our quick start guide which um I'll have linked um as well this will be able this will allow you to connect to your database via code I personally use Python um but in our docs we have already python as well as typescript and Java for you um in our code once again sorry for all the screen flipping but in our code we will have um here on the initialize the connection with your database and you grab your token and your endpoint directly from the Astro UI and this creates the collection between your app and astrab and then you select which key space you using as well as which collection so we were using the animal collection in our example and here is where I can actually insert my documents um I grabbed this again from another Json file that I've had and notice how my description um field here is titled vectorize so simply just by changing the keyword um from what it should look like which is description changing that to dollar sign vectorize and giving that into our insert statement for our Astro database it knows to use that field to vectorize and then basically get that Vector embedding at the end um so if I go ahead and run this let's do comment this out real quick and run this you'll see the three items that have been inserted should be Sid Cal and Scottish terrier and let's see that reflect here on this side I can actually do a hybrid search here up top and do some wood and boom we see that actually appear here within our data set just like that so really awesome how quick we're able to do that and through code um let's do a fun example really quick because we have a little bit of time I have a minute here um I can do this I can go into my Json actually I can go into my table and then I can grab a vector here copy that to my clipboard hop back into my code and now I can do a search through code here as well I'll give my query vector here that large embedding that I just grabbed from my UI and then what's happening here it creates this results it does a collection. find and it's doing a vector search based off of our query Vector so again it's using the similarity algorithms to find the most similar vectors or results based off of our query vector and then it should give us some results here in the output so let's see if we're able to see that here really quickly and there you have it so um I did my query Vector I think this was a Alaskan Malamute so let's see what's the most similar to that we have a fox we have a poodle we have a German Shepherd Australian Shepherd um a beagle so you're able to see the vectors search results here via code as well as how you would in the UI and that's it for my demo let's now hop into the fun part we'll do the quiz so oh sorry but before that let's do a summary um today we learned about vectors how they represent our data um we learned about the challenges in gen with traditional databases and why we need a vector database um we introduced a little bit about embeddings and how we use that to store into our Vector database um as our data um for our generative AI applications and we also did a quick look into astb as a vector database and hopefully um you have a little bit of confidence of get getting started with the vector database and um thinking about applying that into your generative AI applications all right that was a summary thank you again uh for bearing with us let's go into the quiz if you have your phones uh you can just use this QR code to scan but if you're on your uh computers or laptops you could join at m.com and then use this code to um to get into our quiz so feel free to join actually give me one second there we go okay so you should be able to join now everyone cool I'm seeing I'm seeing a thumbs up I'll give you a few seconds here to get started and once everyone's in we will start the quiz okay five four code not found with the code I'm not sure why you're getting that Andrew um maybe refresh your screen some people are having issues cool okay sweet yeah maybe try this QR code here cool and then I'll give a few more seconds I will start the quiz in three oh yeah it looks like the code did change sorry folks yeah here's the new code 9958 3196 Annie just sent it in the chat all right three two one let's start the quiz cool cool I'll start it now answer fast to get more what was the first animal used in our very first Vector example was it cat dog wolf or lion dog was the correct answer all right it was very close I know the cat was there as well who's in our first place right now we have the Hustler sweet sweet all right next question what is a vector so this is a definition based question Point represented by single number the name of a formula a quantity that cannot be expressed by a single number or a portal to another Universe 3 2 1 yes yes most of you got it right awesome a quantity that cannot be expressed by a single number yes Andrew it is definitely a portal a a metaphorical portal okay agent X9 you are now in first it's getting close all right what is not a characteristic of a vector database it handles complex queries it efficiently stores High dimensional data it allows for fast data retrieval and relevant results or it's limited to only structure data yep and most of you got it awesome I am super happy about that and who is now in first we have Sakura okay this is this is going any way right now next question what is the name of data stx's Vector database I hope you all know and I'm going to scold you if you don't know just kidding oh okay I'm glad no one astronaut DV or aid but okay you were you were close sweet but most of you got it right hey we have a race first oh man I know I know let's see agent X9 is back on top wow wow wow cool okay we have the last two questions here and then we'll wrap up true or false both vectors and embeddings refer to the numerical representation of data this one could be a little bit tricky answer was true correct and then who is at first now we still have agent X9 all right one more question agent X9 let's see if you could keep it up okay and last question this one's a bit trickier so please read this one blank support efficiently storing blank which represents data that captures meaningful information and semantic relationships so is it vectors support efficiently storing embeddings is it embedding efficiently storing vectors is any of the others and it was the third one that was a bit tricky so Props to anybody who got that correct I know with the amount of time it was a bit pressured so let's see who came out on top oh tiger baby with the last minute first place all right if tiger baby is still here please uh leave a comment there so we can get your for uh full first and last name and we can reach out to you and give you your swag as your prize yeah tiger baby please give us your information um and we can we'll have everyone we'll have our team reach out and that was it thanks for the folks who held on till the end I know some parts were just a little bit Rocky with the technical difficult so again thank you thank you very much oh claudo congrats awesome here are some quick access QR codes and resources um for your uh own convenience so for astb as well as more about data Stacks um please email Michelle claudo for your swag um any Andy any last remarks I thought this was a a very great session it was uh it was blessed um being with you all minus the little technical difficulties here and there but hope that you guys all learned something um um and always feel free to reach out if you have any questions and we're here to help out in any way we can yeah um the recording will be shared thanks everyone for your participation uh it's really quite fun to do these with such an Engaged audience even though we can't see all of y'all so yeah I I had a blast today I hope that folks learned things um yeah had a had a great time yes yes echoing off of them again and apologies again for going over to time you guys have been amazing for bearing with us um please keep an eye out for the next live stream and Annie and Eddie thank you again for joining me today um I hope you all learned something and yeah keep a lookout for what data sax has coming up next to offer thank you again take care everyone bye",
