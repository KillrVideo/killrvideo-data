    "text": "[Music] [Music] and hello everybody welcome to our previously recorded workshop on building microservices with spring data cassandra and stargate dot io i am david jones gilardi one of the developer advocates here at data sex joined by cedric bloonvon hello cedric hello hello david hello you watching the video so yesterday it's a recoded episode hope you will enjoy we will keep all the energy and you will do a bunch of hands-on with us we're gonna definitely do it together all right so with that let's go ahead and just get into some of the content here today uh so the first thing we want to point out are just some of the tools and things that we are going to use as we go through the workshop on the hands-on material today um so for one um you can watch uh the lessons as a matter of fact you're watching one right now up on our youtube channel um so you're you're probably watching it there right now i'd assume um but you'll find as well up on the youtube channel uh the data sex devs channel we have all sorts of other videos and workshops and everything for you to uh go through now if you take a look down there at the bottom of that slide you'll see a set of tools right we'll start with github so we will use a github repo today so all of the workshop materials contents and everything are in the repo right so the slides that cedric is going to go through the hands-on exercises everything is there then next is astrodb so in order to power our spring microservice java based app we need a data layer right so that's where astrodb comes into play so aster to be along with stargate we'll talk more about what those are as we go through the materials that is where you're going to create your database to then hook your app up to and everything we do by the way today is all going to be free there is nothing there's no need to you know have a credit card or anything like that and then finally the last piece there is gitpod so if you're not familiar with gitpod it is a cloud-based online ide it is also free it is offered by github so what's really cool is we have this integration there where right out of the github repo we can then just launch the development environment with all the prerequisites all the libraries dependencies and everything downloaded and ready to go so those are the three main pieces that we're going to use today now something else kind of exciting for those of you who are gonna do this and do the exercises you can earn yourself a really cool badge right how do you do that well for one you watch us right now right and then you go through the actual workshop exercises itself and you'll find that there is a specific homework section in the repo right and if you just follow the steps right there it'll show you how to submit and do all of that and then once you complete that we'll we'll actually get notified we'll go through we'll review it once we approve you earn yourself a badge now what's really cool about this is you can take this badge and you can put it on your linkedin page like in the features section or you can share it around and you know kind of gives you bragging rights um i think cedric what do we have at least a dozen badges now i think we have a bunch of 13 badges now so okay maybe this one would be your first but there is way to go to have your full collection of batches break yourself yeah we've definitely seen some folks on linkedin who are getting them all i like to talk about getting them all so yeah so it's cool but it's really there just kind of um an acknowledgement you've done the work right you've gone through this and hopefully from that you've learned something okay so then yeah if you do have any question uh here is the you know the previous slide you you see that the link of the discord with the qr code so go for it we will be there to answer your question the full advocate is almost 24 7. we are all across the world so yeah drop your question there and we were happy to answer them there good point cedric i totally forgot to mention discord so i'm glad that you mentioned something there yeah all right with that so looking at the the agenda today and you know the the topics we're going to cover the first thing we're going to do is we're going to introduce more about cassandra right talk about cassandra why is that well astrodb is built on apache cassandra and it's important to know what makes cassandra so cool why is it used by so many of the big players on the industry and some of the disruptive players today right so we'll talk a little bit about that and then what astra is and how that comes together um then we'll move more actually cedric is really going to be taking you through the whole conversation on spring spring boots bring data and so on and so forth then we'll move over to stargate so stargate's really cool stargate pairs very well with astra you can also use it with open source apache cassandra or really any of the versions of cassandra that i know of um and it it applies a nice kind of api gateway where it it allows you to use ubiquitous apis things like rest api a document api for json documents graphql grpcs and beta so on and so forth and you can just bolt that right on top of your cassandra right and astra comes with it so we're going to explore that today and so is the app right you're going to see where the app comes in play and then the last part there is the sdk so the software development kit that hm who developed that one cedric i wonder where that came from i don't know that's that's probably a very good developer because it's working yeah yeah so i will get get you through that uh yeah just to build cool apps yes so so then that'll be the tail end and after all of this um you will have gotten a chance to play around not only with the app but with the apis and kind of see how they work [Music] okay so let's do it so hey welcome to the stargate command so we will use the tool called stargate so let's reuse the full stargate theme the tv show so the mission of your mission today is to find the coordinates of planet 2 lakh in the galaxy milky way our own old galaxy to save tilt which is uh jaffa from the go hood up office so astra and the network of stargates will help you there and on that you can tell who the stargate nerd here is you can't say that [Laughter] okay so let me take over the screen and you know yes let's do it thank you exciting because i will uh you know start the application in front of you and i hope you will have fun so as you can see i do have my head id here open it's a eclipse sts it's a java application using a spring boot and spring data we will explain all that over the coming videos but hey it's there i just started the video and here this is what the demo look like so i will pick the planet chulac loading the coordinates in my stargate the destination using the chevrons so here we go the vortex is open who wants to step through anyone and here we go i'm not sure that you are listening to the music right now but as soon as you you as soon as you play the video it will be so cool so let's get starting so what i would like to do now is uh to start with lesson one introducing cassandra and astradibi so before even starting the application we need a database so that database for today will be apache summer created by facebook more than 10 years ago it's a nosql distributed database so you can install the on a single machine single node and have about two to four terabyte of capacity it's all depending to your use case and a lot a lot of transactions per second per core multiple thousands it's a distributed database so you want multiple nodes in this configuration there is no master this is what we call masterless all communications are peer to peer and it's called gossiping you can then group those nodes as data center also called rings pretty cool right so what do we want to do with those rings well the first uh key capability of cassandra is the linear scalability if you need more capacity or more throughput you simply add new nodes so what is important to see here is really the trend uh you really add more power just adding nodes how much can you add do you think well this is some reference that we do have from april and netflix uh for first for april so 160 000 nodes 100 petabyte of data online and for netflix 98 of the streaming data is stored on cassandra a wide range of use cases a lot a lot of clusters and again petabytes of data store and millions and millions of operations per second so it can scale a lot so the data is distributed in the cluster and among the nodes in the cluster each node is in charge of a subpart of your table and you will split the the data using some hashing system and each node is in charge of a token range so the data is there it's replicated it's replicated x time x is the replication factor so as soon as i write the data in cassandra it would be replicated here three times and with that the data is distributed the data is replicated there is no master hey you can lose now any of the node and it's a big deal with cassandra you can have one ring in a cluster but also multiple rings so you can install a ring wherever you like in multiple region start reading and writing for ev from everywhere and that's cassandra job to replicate the data for you pretty cool huh single data layer available everywhere super fast because the data is closed to your customer what is true for the geographical distribution can also be made with multiple cloud you can easily install a ring on the cloud provider and make those ring part of the same cluster it's not magic you still have to open the port do some vpc pairing to enable inter cloud communications but still that's totally doable pretty cool so that brings us to uh the youtube case of cassandra if you cross somebody in the street say hey cassandra no secret distributed database uh you can use that to do event streaming internet of things log analytics why because those use case really need some heavy read or heavy rides and you will leverage on the scalability part if you want to leverage on the availability you will have no data loss the database will be always on and to be honest everybody would be happy to have a database that would not stop right it's distributed like previous slides so global present probably why the web giant like uber netflix or apple are using it but also having some rings whatever you like could be good for the compliance you know gdpr you need your data to be in your country here you go you can have a dedicated key space only located in your country and let the data flows uh everywhere for not sensitive data and everything in the single customer cluster so all the regular all all the yeah all the industry that needs the regulation banking retails insurance as well it's cloud native and you will see in a minute that kassadin is running very well in the cloud so castle is running very on the containers and at data stacks we put a lot of effort to make it smooth to work in kubernetes as well and it's the same logic in cassandra you want to add node it's scale out and so does kubernetes so enough of theory you will start using cassandra very very soon but you don't have to install it we do have astra db for you today it's a custom razor service in the cloud made by datastax and you will have the database running and not only that also some apis and we will come back to those apis later because now it's time for our first assignment so let's go to github look at the qr code scan read the instruction over here do the exercises and come back with us for the walkthrough [Music] all right so this is the github repo uh that you can see in the top you should uh once you scan that qr code um it'll bring you over to um data stacks our data sets devs github um and the workshop spring stargate that's where you want to go all right so here's what we're going to do i'm going to work through the repo belong with you right and at any point don't forget if if something if you need a moment or something just pause the video or you can go back you can reread a section or something like that as far as going through the repo i'm not going to be reading all the instructions or whatever that's that's really more for you to go through we put a lot of kind of supplementary information and such but i am going to be going through the steps and stepping through those hopefully at a pace that you'll be able to follow but like i said at any point just pause and catch up if you need to okay so the first thing we'd like to do um you already saw the demo from cedric so you should have an idea what um that is going to look like now that just to point something out is yes that's just kind of a funny front end that we put on um just to make it work along with the stargate tv show theme and all that but there's a lot more going on under the hood right so it's a very simple ui and everything but under the hood you know we've got and you're going to experience this today um there's examples of using the rest api of using the graphql api using the document api like all sorts of stuff um using the database directly with cql um you know so all we're going to work through all of that i just want to kind of point that out that from the ui standpoint it's actually quite simple but underneath the hood there's more going on all right so as i mentioned before um all of the materials so if you're interested in like the slide deck that cedric is going through that is here our discord chat is there as well if you missed the qr code earlier so if you want to be able to reach out to us at any time do it by all means as cedric mentioned we have a whole team of us where across the world um we tend to you know we at least have somebody in at some point um come come reach out right so if you need any help whatsoever come reach out okay so here's what i'd like to do let's go to step one create db astra instance right we want to go to that first step and we are then going to if you notice in step 1a here there is a link to astro.datastax.com so i'm going to go ahead now by the way something i want to point out anytime i'm clicking on a link or opening something i just middle clicked but markdown doesn't allow target blank so in order to go to another tab you could either right click say open like a new tab or middle click or control click or command click it all depends on the os you're in right but just make sure to be putting stuff into its own tab it'll make your life a lot easier for sure now once you do that the first thing you'll be presented with is a page that looks something like this this is the registration step right so if you've never registered before if you don't have an astra account um you can sign up with github or google or you can put in your own credentials if you'd like that's totally up to you so go ahead and do that now i already have an account um i will sign in now by the way um this is completely free everything we're going to do here is free registration is free we're going to use free tier of the database so you should at no point you don't have to worry about paying anything all right so while you're all signing up i'm gonna go ahead and log in and again if you need to uh it might just take a moment for you to go through the signup it's gonna ask you a set of questions um we ask that you fill these out it's not very long you can skip it if you want right um and now i'm actually going to skip them even though i just asked you to do them mainly because i don't want to see the data with uh you know fake stuff um but again it's just a couple questions in here but you can skip all of them um it is to help us understand better where you're coming from because those types of things then have a lot of impact on what we do with astro moving forward right so again we we definitely encourage you to answer those now once you've registered and then you've signed it you should come to a page that looks similar to this right this is going to be the the main dashboard now i have a set of databases yours will probably be blank but you should notice the plan is free right there is a free plan that is where you start so again you won't have to worry about getting any charge or anything like that now on this page what i want you to do and this is by the way in the instructions right this is in the instructions as i'm going through them but i'm going to just lead you through what to do so what i'd like you to do you see this create database button go ahead and there's probably another one over here just click on that and you'll be brought to a page it looks like this says create a database now you can technically put whatever values you want here however for this workshop and for to ensure that you get on a happy path and everything works for you we ask that you use the values we've provided here so for the database name i want to use workshops and for the key space name i want to use stargate now some of you might be asking if you're new to cassandra what's a key space right especially if you're coming from the relational database world a key space is just the container of tables right it might be equivalent to like a database or a schema from the relational world right so it's it's just how cassandra calls the container of tables so all the tables that we're going to create today for our stargate app they'll be in the stargate key space that's pretty much what that means from that standpoint now again i mentioned a moment ago how you can use whatever values and why we're asking you to use these values is because later on as we start to work with the app the app's been configured to use the stargate key space and so on and so forth so again just please use these values for now then you'll notice here at the bottom you have a set of cloud providers right so what's really cool one of the things about astra is that you can choose any of the major three cloud providers you could choose google cloud amazon or azure i'm going to take aws today and then as far as the regions just pick one close to you right so i'm in north america i'm on the east coast um so i will take the virginia one over here once you've chosen once you've filled out the details your database name and your key space name and you've selected a provider in region you'll notice you get this create database button that lights up and you can go ahead and click that now while that's going one thing i want to point out about those regions you might ask you know why do you have different providers partially it is in fact for flexibility you have flexibility on what provider you want to choose um and not only that astra takes care of all that for you you don't need a login for a provider you don't need to have an account with them or do anything astra is totally handling that for you uh behind the scenes and even one of the one of the newer features that's actually been released in to astra is the ability for multi-regions so within a provider you could actually have as date as cedric was talking about how cassandra can span multiple data centers across the region or for different regions astr also has that capability it's not there in the free tier um but it is something that you can do okay yes or so oh go ahead to you and the reason is just to redo the latency between your application and the database just to be as fast as possible also multiple cloud providers offer you're probably already using a cloud provider so having that you can enable all kind of vpc peering between you and the database to do uh you know more advanced stuff right we're not doing that stuff today but that capability is in fact there okay so once you've hit the create database button you'll be brought back to your dashboard and you should see something like this here's our new database and if you look over on the right hand side you see it's impending now your database may be impending or initializing at this point it takes a couple minutes to start it up right now you're actually starting up a full-fledged three-node cassandra cluster right um so so it does take a couple minutes to do that's totally fine if you're pending up mine just pop to active as you see right there um and and that's fine if it's pending or initializing that's all right um we can just move forward a little bit and by the way you'll throw you'll find out throughout the repo we have these nice little animated gifs and stuff that'll kind of show you what to do as well if you need but we are kind of doing a video of that right now so you're probably good with watching the video all right so once our database is active and mine did go active here just a moment ago what we want to do now is click on the name of the database whether you do that here or if you do that on the menu to the left totally up to you it's going to the same place it's going to bring you to the database details page at the very top of that you'll see these tabs here and one in particular called cql console let's click that by the way if you're not familiar with cql it's actually a subset of sql if you're coming from the relational world um so if you're used to working with relational databases and used to using sql language cql is cassandra query language it looks and feels just like sql right so again if you're coming from the relational world this should feel like home from that standpoint uh and this is one of the ways that you can use the interact with your database all right so i'm going to scroll down now to step 2b so just a couple initial commands that we have that we're starting with first thing i want to do is i want to find out what key spaces i have so i'm going to describe them and by the way you notice i have a little copy widget here you can just cut and paste this right over into your cql console notice i have my stargate key space now there's a bunch of other key spaces that are there some system key spaces we don't need to worry about those those are things that the system is just using to provide the service but the one i care about is stargate the one we created a moment ago now the next command here this use stargate what is this about so i'm essentially telling cassandra hey instead of you know being in the context where i see all the key spaces i want to issue a cql command and i want to do that in the context of the stargate key space so i just say use stargate notice that my prompt now changes the stargate so i'm now set up to work within the stargate key space now before i create any tables or anything real quick i just want to say just describe tables notice it's totally empty right we created the key space i don't have anything in here yet so let's go ahead and create a table so now moving on to step 2c create entities i'm going to create a table here now again if you're coming from the relational world this should look pretty darn familiar you'll notice i have a create table command i'm saying create table if it doesn't exist i'm fully qualifying it so saying here is the key space dot the table name so chevron's is the name of the table i have a set of fields columns right and each of those are gonna have a type so areas of text code is and so on and so forth um by the way if you are in fact coming from the relational world you're probably used to a varchar in cassandra you can use either varchar or text matter of fact i believe that varchara is alias to text anyway it's the same but the one thing you might notice is that you don't have to have a constraint on the number of bytes you don't need to do that in cassandra it is technically unbounded um so that's just something you don't need to worry about um and then after i've set my fields i'm going to have you know a primary key right so that's kind of how i'm going to key my data and then i'm going to set some ordering so if you just copy that and paste it into our cql console right that's it i just paste it in boom it creates the table now as step 2d i want to insert some data so if you remember um this is a an app based off the stargate tv show right so uh cedric has actually done a lot of fun work here and actually brought in the real chevrons from the tv these are the actual chevrons from the show so it's kind of fun if you'd like to geek out on that um but we're going to insert those you can even do yeah you can even go to the wiki and just check that this is actually the real chevrons and the real coordinates for each planet yeah so if you want to kick out a little bit yeah totally have fun with that so if you take a look at the commands here these insert into commands so now we're putting some data in the table again if you're coming from the relational world this should look identical to the way that you do it in sql um so i'm going to specify my table i'm going to specify which fields i want to put data in i'm going to then give values and then here the actual values right so now we've inserted a bunch of values into the table and then finally moving on to step 2e i just want to validate that i have val you know data in my table so i've got 39 rows here with my select count from stargate.chevrons um and then if i wanted to say select something find specifically the chevrons for the milky way galaxy then i can perform the query here and ah okay good so i'm just really just validating that i've got my table i've inserted data i can now retrieve that data with the select statement and i see it in front of me awesome okay so that's just the start though right that's the start for the chevrons now we need to load a lot more data so instead of using a bunch of insert statements right um there's another feature here where you can download a csv and you can then load that asynchronously into astra i think it's as long as it's within like 40 megabytes right so it's for smaller data sets but it's a nice little tool that's right there in astra so you don't have to use anything external to do it so what we want to do going to step 3a now is again i'm going to right-click on this button this big download data set button right and i want to say save link as now depending on the os you're in you may have to specify dot csv right make sure you do that um again in mac i've got to do that um but just to ensure that you in fact have the right files so it should be destinations.csv that's that's important from that standpoint now once you download this file you can see i have it down here in the lower left i want to go back to astra and up in the top right hand corner you have load data go ahead and click that and this will bring us to the data loader screen so simply enough i'm going to say option one i'm going to upload my own data set right so if i go ahead and click on that you'll see it brings up the uh the dialog here i can choose the file that i just downloaded destinations.csv say open and once it gets that file it uploaded successfully i'll get a next button light up once i've done that i can hit next now a couple things are going on here in this screen number one you'll see the table name is destinations where did it get that from it got it from the file name something important here right for the application the table name should in fact be destinations we want to ensure that that is in fact destinations if um let's say for some reason you downloaded the file more than once a lot of file systems will kind of tag a one on to it or something like that and then the file name will be destinations1.csv and then it's automatically going to pull that up into here right so just make sure that it's in fact destinations then it's going to give you a sample of the data right it's going to show you a sample of the data maybe what columns you have in the data what the data looks like it's not going to be the whole set obviously that would be a little absurd if it's a bigger data set but at least it's a way that you can just validate that you're getting what you expect at the very bottom here under the keys and clustering section we do in fact want to set a partition key and a clustering column now if i scroll down a little bit in the instructions you will see that it specifies it does tell you which ones to use i'm going to do that now as well in our case today for the partition key we do want to partition by galaxy imagine there are a lot of galaxies in the universe um many billions of them so we're not storing all of the data into a single partition we are going to partition by galaxy and you'll see here in the sample these are all milky way but if we had more data or something then we would be storing other galaxy data and other partitions and such we also want to order a little bit right we want some ordering in our data based off of the name i selected partition key by accident don't do what i just did select the clustering column piece let me scroll down here where did it go i can't there we go i've got things zoomed in funny and i kind of got stuck there yeah so um um so the clustering comes what this will do in cassandra if you choose something like an alphabetical type you know something that can be alphabetized or whatever and if you put it in the clustering column it'll automatically order on it so when i select my data out later by my galaxy all of the responses that i get will automatically be ordered right it does that naturally so it actually in cassandra that's kind of a cool optimization it pays the cost of the ordering on the right which is fast where later on in the read i don't have to order then i get the data already out in that ordered format okay so once i've chosen my partition key and in this case our clustering column so galaxy and name i'll get my blue button to light up let's say next last thing is we want to then ensure that we're injecting this data into the correct database and key space now we started with the workshops database it knows that so it did that for me the key space though you should probably only have one most likely is stargate we want stargate in this case and that is exactly what we're talking about here in step 3e again once i've chosen both a database and a key space i will get my next button that'll light up go ahead and click that now what's going to happen is astra is going to load this asynchronously in the background right so it says hey your data is being imported you're going to get some kind of notification so you get an email right so once the process starts you'll get an email that the process has started you'll also get another email when it's complete right so now for this next part we do actually need to have some data um so yeah and these are these are examples right here of both of the types of messages you'll get when it starts and then when it completes this should only take a minute and then once that is there we will go to our cql console and go back to our cql console and then we'll validate that the data is there [Music] all right so now i've gotten my emails i see that the data set has been loaded so i'm going to go to my cql console here at the top and let's validate that we have the data that we expect so i'm going to pull the query that you see the select star from stargate destinations i just want to validate i have data wonderful right so we know that our data load worked and i have more data populated from our milky way galaxy okay all right by the way i want to point out i'm not going to do it right now but there is a special question for you if you want to try to do something a little bit more advanced i'm not gonna open the solution you i encourage you to do it on your own and then if you uh want to check your work click to view the solution all right so last thing in this section here is going to be to create our aster tokens so great we have a database we have a table right we created a key space we created a table we inserted some data in the table we've validated we have it but now we need to create a method to authenticate to our database for our application to use right so i want to go to step four create astra token right now you're gonna notice i'm gonna use different tabs for a lot of this right um so i do like uh to open things in different tabs because we're gonna use this a little bit later um you know so so i i'm gonna open up another tab in my dashboard here and there's a couple different ways you can do this the instructions will actually bring you through uh going to your current organization on the top left you can click on organization settings and in there uh you can there's a there's a token selection also in your dashboard on the very right you'll see this ellipsis if you click that you can just say generate a token right um so that's a kind of a quicker way to get there now you'll notice in the instructions says pick the role database administrator we're just opening it up let's just keep it everything no really though when it comes to the app the app is using a back-end devops api that's going to has some really nice features for us and that part of that requires the administrator role but once you choose that you'll get generated token click the button and boom you're going to get all of your credentials now something to point out here for security reasons if you then navigate away from this page you will not get these again you'll have to generate a new token now the cool thing is you can generate as many tokens as you want that's fine right but i suggest for now and this is a reason why i opened another tab just leave this up i also highly encourage you to download the token details that way you can reference them later if you need just know that again if you navigate away from this page you're not going to get these again but leave this up we're going to come back to these uh pretty soon all right all right with that i believe cedric we need to go back over to you don't we and talk about some stuff before we get into the code i think we are done with assignment one and we can move to listen two so see you in a minute in lesson two [Music] all right so you did everything you need to have the database ready and rolling now it starts to coat something on top of it and to code we will use a framework spring so spring has been created 16 years ago already and to be honest i have used spring for 14 years in the beginning it was called interface 21 the id at the at the very core of spring is what we call inversion of control you will define an interface and multiple implementations of the same interface and this is at runtime that the framework will decide which implementations to pick based on the name based on some tips you can give to spring so the first use case for these inversion of control was mocking provides some service working and doing some response very very uh early in the development even if the service is not ready yet but now there are multiple flavors of how to use these inversion of control especially in between layers of your applications so the best website to to go to to learn about spring it's spring.io itself it's pretty cool it will explain you more in detail what it's spring and all all the different product because now spring is huge does have a lot of parts micro service reactive cloud web apps serverless even driven batch uh we did a couple of session live presenting cloud reactive micro services today we will focus on micro services and a framework called spring boot micro service and spring boot so spring boot is kind of a run time for your micro service instead of deploying some war file in an application server good old uh web sphere vr weblogic and so forth and so on yeah we we love them we miss them memories [Laughter] yeah instead of that it will be just a jar an executable jar standalone application and so with that it's pretty easy to spawn as many as you like because it's just a standalone applications so spring boot is the runtime under the hood there is an application server embedded like tomcat or undertale but you don't have to worry about that that's spring boot to handle so in the spring boot app you have the spring magic context you see in blue here invasion of control in between your layers what is cool with spring boot it's that is provide you some starters you need some matrix monitoring add the proper starter to your project you need to do else check you need to do special configuration you need to use a database in particular simply add the starter you need with the starter it will initialize what we call the spring context with everything loaded for you so what do you find in the spring boot context or a spring context in in a spring boot app well multiple layers so the persistence layer also called dro or repository will handle all the interaction with the databases business layer on top of the persistence layer is there to do some business logic aggregation computation your business rules and compose some data coming from multiple persistence layers and finally you find the presentation layer that could be just a rest controller if you want to do a rest api or a view controller if you want to do a web page and guess what today in the spring boot app you will find both because we want to show you as much as we can in the small time we do have in spring boot you can have a normal stack the servlet task uh as we used to do stamlet api spring mvc and you can also go the reactive route but as soon as you use something reactive the full stack should be reactive again today let's focus on the simple servlet stacks so again this is our application let's say we do have import what we need for security monitoring configuration remember those are starters we want to use cassandra as database in the spring world to interact with data you will use spring data spring data will provide uh you some dedicated repositories where you only have finally to in the end you only have to define your entities and the repository and all the code requests will be generated for you you simply have to do the declare the interface and all the magic we will be done for you so no surprise we will use spring data cassandra and even spring boot data cassandra yeah it's all composed you know it's like the lego in the names to expose the data so you will see the data and the webview remember my demo well we will use mvc to do that and to pick some data from the database and using some javascript sometimes we need to invoke an apis the data is exposed using rest here all right so enough me talking it's now time for you to start building and reading this application again you have nothing to install go scan the qr code to go to the step 2 if you're not already set up and come back to watch the walkthrough with david alrighty so i'll give you just a moment to scan that qr code as cedric just said and good okay let's go on then to the second spot so where we should really be in this second set of assignments what we're going to do now is we are going to launch gitpod that's going to be our online cloud-based ide right out of github right so it's a really cool piece of functionality and then we're going to use this to get our app set up we're going to configure it with the values from our token and then we're going to launch the app right and we're going to see it work so we should be on step 5 launch gitpod now again i want to there you see this opening gitpod button right here i want to open that in another tab right so i'm going to middle click in my case now here's something really cool if you've never used git pod before um by the way you do need to be logged in to github if you're not it will ask you to log in here's what's seriously neat about this gitpod is now launching essentially vs code in the cloud and we have in this case we've pre-configured it a little bit to handle pulling in you know dependencies and stuff for the app and such and it's going gonna you'll see that once it pulls down the image and it starts building all that you'll see that go it's really nice from the standpoint especially if you want to share workspaces with others um or colleagues or whatever it's a really great way to do that and from the workshop standpoint this allows us to ensure that everybody has the same experience right if you want to do by the way all this stuff locally in your own you can that's definitely a more advanced path though you kind of have to know what you're doing to set up your ide and such we're here we kind of get to give everybody the same exact experience right so i'm going to zoom in just a little bit on this as it's building and you can see it's already building right it's already kicking off uh the process to build the app and we're going to let that finish and it takes just a moment maven doesn't download as much of the world as mpm does for those of you who are a node yeah if you haven't done javascript and node and stuff in in your you complain about maven downloading everything npm will download the world the whole world i'm not kidding i'm not kidding all right so once this completes right you'll see a little prompt like this here you should by audi by automatically you should be in the workshop spring stargate stargate demo directory and then at that point we want to go to step six know your git pod uh so the first thing we want to do here though is you see this command this gpurl8080 what is this about um so by the way the first time you go to paste a command in the terminal it's going to ask you if you allow it that's what i'm doing there since we are running in a cloud-based environment gitpod has its own endpoints that it generates right it's not just some like random ip open or something and publicly available so in order for us to get access to those you know those endpoints so we can do things right um you have this gp command and we're saying hey get pod url give me the url at port 8080 right so that's what this is we're going to use this here in a moment um but that is that is one way that you can use to um to get access to in our case our application is going to be running on port 8080 so we're going to want to be able to get to that later all right so moving then down to 6b so 6b i want to build the project and download its dependencies so again i'm just going to paste that right here in our terminal we should see it doing a bunch of build stuff and such and giving us nice messages that all look green this should only take a moment boom right so now our building our building our application is ready uh for us to configure it and start into the launch now i'm going to move on to step seven right this is the part where we want to then take the credentials that we got when we created our token a moment ago and we want to put those into our application yaml so our application can use those to then authenticate against the database and start doing things so this is all spelled out for you here in the instructions but what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to stargate demo source main resources to my application yaml for those of you java developers you're probably used to that kind of structure um but if you're new to it or whatever like i said we've actually spelled it out and you can see it in the image as well so you'll find that the uh the the variables that we need to populate are down at the very bottom of the application.yml and notice how in each of these cases um you'll see that we we have these kind of like placeholders here so we want to replace those with the data from our database right so now another reason why i opened another tab if i go back over to where we generated our credentials and such before you'll notice that we have three things client id client secret and token and if we come back to our application yaml you should notice we have the same exact thing so those are going to be one to one replacements i'm just going to click there's a little copy widget on the right hand side make that easy so i want my client id first i want to replace the whole thing right don't leave those greater than less than signs in there then i'm going to move to my client secret replace the whole thing again and then get my token and yes the token does include is aster cs colon and such you want the whole thing okay great now we've got the residential set but we need to do just a little bit more right um when we created if you remember when we created the database initially we picked a cloud provider in a region right so we need to tell it hey which which one right so now if we go back to our dashboard so i went back to my normal astra my astra dashboard i'm going to click on this dashboard here and you'll go back to where you see your database that you created earlier notice the database id here i want that id i want to click that id this one specifically i'm going to put that here in my database id field then the last thing you need is the region right so i'm going to click on the database go back into my details page and you'll see this region is right here in this case because i chose aws right it's going to be us east one you'll notice that the regions will be different depending on the provider you choose but you just want to copy the value you have there put that in your cloud region variable and that's it now the cool thing is this application's configured it's automatically saving as we're going through um so once you have all of those things filled out here is the moment of truth right um so if we go to step 8 run some unit tests you'll see this first one here so what this first test is going to do um this ex1 this is actually going to run through a whole a whole set of tests that's going to test the rest api the graphql api the document api it's going to test the devops api all the apis right and you'll see this in the log output there we go yep you'll start to see that if this is working or not now if this is configured correctly you should see messages just like what we're seeing right where i'll scroll up a little bit here where it says you know is enabled is enabled so on and so forth right so it's confirming for us that our configuration is good it even went so far to kind of do a simple select pull out the chevrons right we know that we have performed a successful test we've connected to the database and we've gotten some data so wonderful because honestly how many of you here building apps and it's that one of the hardest things is getting the plumbing working right um so we've just connected it up great we know we're talking to the database we're ready to move on by the way if for some reason you're following along and you get an error here right if you see an error with one of the apis or something the first thing you want to do is check did you miss a character right i've actually done that or maybe i miscopied something or i fat fingered something just check these values if you do see an error otherwise you're good to go all right so moving on to step 8 b so this one here this test now by the way i should point out and cedric you may have more that you want to say about this is that these tests are really here so we can kind of validate and confirm that things are working as we expect but as cedric mentioned we're using spring data cassandra if you want to see an example usage go to the test right you can totally take a look at the test and kind of see what's going on from that standpoint um you know the code you can go and maybe open just one of the repository to see what it looks like you will see almost no code there you define simply an object that look like exactly the table we created together in the first lesson and boom that's it now spring data is able to look at values in the table and do some search and insert and delete right away all right so now you can see in this case that this time uh you know for this test we're specifically testing um using uh spring data and that our tests are successful so again so far so good right from that standpoint so again these tests are really nice to use um as examples and just kind of validate things and then the last one here we're just going to go ahead and validate that we have our destinations remember we created our destinations when we loaded we remember we did that data load we loaded data in the background right so we're essentially just testing that all of the pieces that our app needs our chevrons our destinations those are all there those are all working and yes we do have a successful um test and we were able to test the destination so we know that our table's there it's got data and so on and so forth if for some reason you had an error here on the destinations you might want to check is your destinations table named destinations right remember when i mentioned on the import if for some reason like you had like multiple downloads or the file name was different it's going to imply the file the table name from that file name so if that was different than destinations right the applications expecting destinations you might want to check that out right so that's that's exactly why we have these in here so you can kind of just validate that all of the previous steps were done correctly all right finally let's run the thing right this is this is we're gonna have some fun here so step nine run the application i'm gonna grab the step or the uh execution from step nine a i'm to paste that in now at first all it's going to do it's it's going to start up the app and it's going to run the background right and yay you know you'll see it once it runs but it's you're not going to see much anymore what's going to happen though is once the application starts up it runs at 8080. so gitpod is going to actually open up 8080. it's going to say okay 8080 is ready to go and matter of fact once you get to this this kind of once you see this output right here you see started stargate demo application right so it is ready to go and it is started now what we want to do in order to you know launch this uh is create a new terminal right uh so we're gonna leave the application running in this one if i go up into the hamburger menu here up in the top left hand corner of my git pod i click on that you'll see terminal and new terminal we'll click on that great and once we've done that now remember this gpu gp command we were talking about before this is saying gitpod url 8080 right so we want to get what url is exposed there for port 8080. one other thing i actually want to show you real fast for those folks in gitpod notice in the lower right hand corner that any of the ports your application are using will be exposed there if you click on that you can actually open up the urls and stuff this way as well uh you could do it both ways but we're total command line junkies here let's just do it this way all right so i'm going to copy that i'm going to now put it into a new tab and hit it at um enjoy the music right right exactly so i'm actually let me i'm gonna reload that i want to make sure the music loads here yeah you need to select two luck now you know you need to save chill so please click chew luck and then the music will start there it goes all right so we have some music oh and then i'm gonna hit my chevrons and you need to do it in time because i gotta do a quick amount of time to select all of them so suspenseful there we go [Music] the music is just so epic there is there are not a lot of workshop where we travel to another planet all right and then yeah there we go nice all right so now we've gotten at you lock and you can see that over on the right hand side now like i said before um that it looks a little simple you know from the standpoint from the ui but in order to do this it's actually using the back end apis and stuff it's actually talking to the database to pull up the data and get the chevrons and all that right you are doing two um so first is retrieving all the planets inside the galaxy um based on the the the first uh destinations that you enter and then for this fourth destination you will find all the chevrons you know that's yeah a couple of yeah action direct connected to the back end exactly so a little little fun kind of friend that we just threw on uh to all the stuff that's actually going on in the back end so hopefully you got to this point where you have the working app and by the way um as the instructions point out when you click those chevrons you got to do it fast you got to make sure you get the timer they're going to time out on you um so you can have fun with that all right so hopefully you got to that point again if all of your tests ran successfully you should be good from that standpoint the app should just run just fine so go ahead and get to that spot and then cedric is going to bring you through some awesome see you in lessons [Music] hey hello again let's start now lesson number three introducing stargate the product this time not the demo so stargate is a data gateway on top of the database a data gateway will introduce some decoupling between database and the way to interact with data so you want we want the developer to be able to use the apis they like to interact with the data so you know if you don't have this gateway as the developer you need to learn sequel castle highway language spring data can help you but in the end you still have to know what how and what to do at the dba side people do not like to let you execute the query they like sometimes it's rational database they gave you some store procedure just to exactly limit the kind of request you can do but instead in with with casanova is not always the case and if you try to execute something that is not allowed you'll get some error message from from casanova so to come with that hey this is come the gateway so introduce losing loose coupling in between the persistence extension and the api extensions so add the persistent extension no surprise you will see some multiple distribution of casana 3x4x release this year super exciting uh great improvement in performance and the dsc enterprise 6.x as apis and this is the one you will use in assignment 3 the rest api the graphql apis json also called document api how to interact with cassandra as is it was a document-oriented no-sql database even if in the beginning it is a colon-oriented database sql is still there and as david stated in the very beginning grpc is coming very very soon so before as a developer you will have include the drivers spring the spring data using the drivers and the driver connect to the nodes using sql okay but the drivers need to be pretty clever keep the connection open do the load balancing failover else check so if one node goes down the driver's nose and and will recover but again you still need to know sql and you need to have those port open for sql now with stargate in front of it you will have apis and by the way stargate is the node is the cassandra node without any data cassandra will join the gossiping and will be aware of the token range as well and be able to root the request exactly it's a proper replica stargate expose multiple interfaces i keep saying that press graphical grpc sql and you can add multiple stargate if you wish now you will have a load balancer in front of the stargate and load balance your stargate nodes and like that for the first time you have an easy way to scale only the compute layer you can only make skagit scale and not the database you know with astradb do not worry you will have three nodes in cassandra to start with and three nodes of stargate as well and the load balancing is already done for you at astra level this is what you will do in a minute so the rest api you have anything you can do with secure already so from ddl working the schema and also dml cred create reader they delete at the data level notice that you can only clearly buy the primary key which is the best practice if you start to do some selecting something that is not in the primary key in cassandra you will get an error by default so we want to avoid that and keep the services as fast as possible the document api is really a way to do schema-less or at least validation validation list you know a json document does have a schema but very loose schema so you will see that you can insert any json and retrieve the json and the term now is called the namespace the collections and the document but again you will do that in a minute last but not least you also have graphql which is super cool graphql is getting some traction creating in 216. what you can do with that is having only the endpoint you can discover all the methods that are available and when you interact with it you can shape your request in a way that will only retrieve what you need because rest is pretty chatty uh here you can simply retrieve exactly what you need super super useful for both mobiles and web application when the bandwidth matters meaning all the time right so fortunately as i told you stargate is included into astradibi nothing for you to check or configure you will simply use embedded tool provided by astra namely swagger ui and graphql playground to play with those api and with that your turn go to assignment 3 number 10 and 11 in the github here you see the qr code and of course david will do the walkthrough with you in the next video [Music] assignment three now this time we're going to uh use both we're going to explore both the rest api with swagger and then the document api also using rest and swagger actually i just got to say too like right off the bat that um the document api standpoint i recognize for java developers you know i i wonder how many folks are actually using document apis it's usually more of a javascript json kind of thing but i will say if you don't already have a schema if you're prototyping an app or something like that the doc api is a really neat way to start because you can kind of just get going and then as you kind of fill out what your schema might look like and stuff then you can kind of you know migrate over uh to something else but it's all already there for you with uh stargate and aster and all that all right so where we want to go then is step 10 using stargate rest api now something really really cool here if we go back over to our application is that swagger has been included in the application as well like i said there's a lot going on under the hood with the app to expose a lot of the capabilities that you have even though the front end looks like it might be kind of simple and one of those is this and the swagger so if i just copy the value here from step 10a remember we created a new terminal right we want to leave our application up so our application is still running in the other terminal and we're going to go ahead and paste this though in the new terminal it's going to go hey i'm opening up swagger it's going to open it up in this simple browser right here in gitpod now it does this getpod has this nice simple browser it's actually pretty cool i find though for swagger i like putting it in another tab because we're going to need the screen real estate so notice what i just did there up in the very top right hand corner in the simple browser you're going to see this little launch open in browser button that's what i did so that should bring us to something that looks like this for swagger okay so what we want to do then is we're going to be in the data that the data section here in the data block and i want to go down to [Music] v2 v2 retrieve all rows right v2 retrieve all rows then if you notice it's not going to let you do anything yet you have to say try it out right try it out you want to click on that it's going to open up these fields and then this first one here this extra sander token that's where we need to put in our aster token right it's that one that has aster cs in the front i'm gonna put put this right in here if you remember you need that right you need to every time these are publicly you know this is a cloud-based system these these endpoints publicly available you need a way to authenticate you want anybody just walk into your database right so you provide this token in each of our calls to rest so that's what we're doing here now the rest of the values that you need the key space name table name we give them for you we'll give them to you right here so the key space name is stargate table name is chevrons i want to leave the um the page size and stuff blank i'll just use the defaults and then if i click on that blue execute button hopefully aha there are our chevrons right so if you remember we inserted these earlier right we inserted these we created the table we did this with the cql console but now i'm able to use the rest interface or the set of rest endpoints that have been created automatically for us with stargate in astra it's just provided for you right so so you already have these rest endpoints that are already ready for you one thing i want to also point out here in swagger notice that i have this code 200 it was clearly successful if you scroll down the bottom you'll see the list of responses that you have these are just potential responses these are just the list of what you could get a 200 is okay right so don't don't get tripped up on these thinking something went wrong these are just the responses that you can get what you're looking for is what actually happens so we got our chevrons wonderful okay so now moving on to step 11 here using the stargate document api this time we're going to go to the document block so a second ago we're just experimenting with the data block and by the way i'm going to cheat and grab that astro token because we're going to need it in a moment so i'm going to collapse my data block go to the document block right and i want to find create a new document v2 create a new document so create a new document v2 that one right so again i'm gonna hit my try it out i'm gonna fill out my apparently i did not copy that properly that's okay i've got my token right here there we go all right fill out again my ex cassandra token i need to authenticate every time i'm filling it out with my token we give you the value of the name space now the namespace is essentially the key space right a little bit different nomenclature when dealing with the document api this time though we're going to create a collection called sample doc right that's what we're doing here and then notice we have this json in the we have this json here you want to copy that completely overwrite what was there you want just the json so we're going to create a collection called sample doc and then we're going to use this json to create our document again i'm going to click that blue execute button hopefully i get a 200. there it goes wonderful and now i have a document ib id so the return you're going to get any time you create a new document you're going to get a document id back right that tells you that you've created that document now something to just kind of you know just point out here is that through this rest endpoint we actually were able to use a document api and underneath the hood in stargate it takes this document it takes this json object and automatically shreds it and essentially you know it does all the parsing and everything for you and it has created this in a document format in astra right just with that one step um so it's really quite powerful and that's what i meant before like if you're experimenting prototyping this is really kind of a good way when you don't really have your schema all set up yet you can just create an object like this and just go and use that to kind of work out your application from there all right so then what we're going to do now is once you've done that you know again that was just to kind of expose you a little bit to using swagger with both the document api and rest endpoints um by the way one other thing i do want to show you we launched swagger from within the application right so you can do that and that's there if you go back to astra and you go to your database you'll see this connect tab here and notice the rest api right you'll see this you have your own swagger endpoint you can actually launch that and work directly with swagger that way as well right out of your database it's really cool um all right so with that we'll go back over to cedric to talk about some more things okay all right hope you enjoy these apis right it's you know easier now to connect to to casama but you know what there is a lot of api and you know i hope somebody just do the work to create the client to wrap all the api so it's done in something called a software development kit so stargates provide the rest api in multiple versions document api doing a lot of stuff graphql apis even two apis one secure first one schema first to do graphql federation ski sql and even more coming so that is a lot and this is the reason why we created a data stack three sdks one for java one for javascript one for pit python yet maybe more to come and we do have uh created the client and wrapper to use the apis so the api for the start gate and also apis in astra because in astra there are some devops api to create a database from the api create a new region create a role new profile uh doing some to to to create some security links just just to create some privacy between you and the database secure everything and so everything is wrapped for you to use with these sdk boom okay and in the code i created a couple of code for you to interact with the sdk so final assignment for just have a look to the walkthrough sdk number 12. and again david will do the work through with you alrighty so again scan that qr code if you haven't done it or if you're already following in the repo you're probably good so we're going to go back over to our repo we've experimented a little bit with um you know the swagger and the rest endpoint and document api and stuff like that so we want to go now to step 12 and we're going to do the walkthrough of the sdk right so as cedric has kind of alluded to the sdk is included as part of the stargate demo that we've been running that's obviously what we've been using in the back end to really make it a lot easier to talk to all these apis and stuff in java so what i'd like to do then is go to step 12a using devops api with the sdk we're going to go back over to our gitpod and to that terminal that we had open from before all right so i'm going to copy the commands that are here i'm going to run another test that's going to test out the sdk java sdk in the background and there it goes we should see some wonderful tests let me see all the different things wonderful tests wonderful tests yeah i mean honestly there are a few things for my fellow coders out there there are a few things more satisfying than when you have a full test suite and you run that test suite you made a bunch of changes and it all it's all green and it goes by that's that's actually quite satisfying so all right so so really what we want to see here right is when we ran this we want to see that we're using the devops api here notice the difference here i'm actually scrolling through it actually went through the different databases that i have right so the device api is actually kind of powerful there now you may only have one database if you just started with this today i have a bunch um but you see it has this ability to be able to kind of query and in the back end of master this could be really useful in a lot of ways yeah maybe you can open exercise for just the source code just to for everyone to see what what is what it's look like so an sfc test java exercise for the one we just run and you know look look at the code so the astra client the main class has been initialized for us by the starter looking for all the parameters in application.tml and with this object with this test what we do is astra client dot api devops databases dot search databases and this is how we got the result so the sdk has been designed to be to to be a fluent api and we will see that with in the next two uh tests all right awesome yeah it is really simple it's really simple to use the sdk that's kind of the idea right all right so let's move on to step 12 b and so i'm going to run another test this time the sdk rest api and while that runs i'll open that up so we can see an example here again real not a ton of code needed okay great so we see now in this case right um that it went and pulled the chevrons uh using the rest api but via the sdk right like cedric is there any there's there anything you want to talk about there as far as this goes for this one yeah you know um the search shogun class is a raw mapper and if you already have used a spring gdbc in the past that's totally the same logic you will execute something against the rest api getting back a list of raw data and here we will marshal back the result as an object so now that's pretty cool you can simply do astra client.targetdata.keyspace to focus on our keyspace.table focused on the chevron table dot search provide a filter and get the result exactly as you expect as objects awesome all right moving on then to the document api so this is going to be step 12c again all these are using the sdk and the very last step we're almost done i don't know how i feel about this right all right and while that's doing that i'll bring up the code again for this one there we go see you have a little uh just a little air handling in here just in case you didn't create the document right you didn't do that so you got to make sure in order for this test to be successful right yeah you have to go through that previous swagger step where you create uh the the document and everything um this is another reason why as well we ask you in the very beginning to make sure you use the the the value of the database and key space that we gave um you know so all these all these work and from the standpoint but you can see here you can see i've got the document id remember we just created the one document and we have that email uh see luna c lemon at sample.com right um if we were to go back to the workshop what's that no wondering who will who write the workshop yeah who wrote this workshop i wonder right but if you notice in our json object when we created this document earlier here's the email right um so you see that matches over what we're getting here what's really cool about this as well though is that you know when you store a document here like this via stargate whether it's open source cassandra or whether it's in astra or something like that this is automatically like i said all being shredded you get access individual access to all the subfields and stuff like that that are in here um so you can you know again if you don't have a schema or anything yet and you're working that stuff out it's it's nice you can use the documents to kind of get started anything else you want to say about the code in this one cedric um just looking but no i mean this time you don't need any mapper based on the json that will be retrieved using the jackson framework i will try the framework will try to get back to the document you ask because as a parameter this time you provide a class and so the mapping will be automatic this way also you know document api is really really cool to create what we like do not think that much about the the schema this time exactly all right so hopefully you've been able to follow along with us and you've gotten to this point where you've kind of explored some of these i would really encourage all of you to take a look at the test take a look at some of the implementation code um and it'll give you some uh you know definitely you know kind of give you examples of how to use the sdk and everything like that with that moving over to the homework section here so this is the part if you remember in the very beginning we talked about uh the ability to earn a badge so if you go through and you do this homework and then you follow the instructions that you see that are right here right the last link that number uh step three submit your homework here you click on that that will actually create a github issue is what it'll do we've got it all set up for you you just fill this out add in some of the screenshots and then we'll get notified and we'll review it and you know once you're once you're good you'll automatically you'll get your badge and then you can use that for bragging rights and everything um right now how many i think what do we have like 2500 badges we've issued or something cedric uh yes uh 2200 i think 22.22. when we recall this video but hey yeah please do please also share the love share this video we provide some link in the end yeah please share with the us hashtag datastaxdev workshops for us to know uh if you enjoy or not and always the feedback is also good to to be provided on the discord we will link in the beginning absolutely absolutely so with that um just wrapping a couple things up um so again we just talked about the badge there so you'll see it at the bottom of the repo follow the instructions and we will get it graded and get you your badge and with that thank you thank you so much for for taking some time and spending with us going through um the awesome fun stargate demo yes again the feedback is very important for this one this is a one of the first recoil with this format and we would like it to be the best so your feedback would be super valuable this time so absolutely so thank you everybody and we will see you when you submit your homework and get those badges everyone take care see ya [Music]",
