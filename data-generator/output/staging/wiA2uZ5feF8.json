    "text": "let's see here where are we at today that is the question alright so the thing I'm gonna do today is continue let's recap where we're at with a lot of this stuff right because yeah but a bunch of things have happened since the last time we were on here so that's what we're gonna recap I'm kind of wondering because I'm clicking through some stuff to get that get it wrapped up or whatever there's some crazy screens that just are not couth one has my face so giant everywhere nobody wants to see that much in my face huh yeah I guess well whatever do-do-do-do-do-do all right oh there's new OBS features - I'm gonna get tripped up all right so where we were last time I've opened up jetbrains rider here open up Chrome what is trying to get up-to-date okay that's great so it's called like Microsoft no it's called Azure DevOps server and I dive into this a few days ago trying to figure out how to get a build happening with this so I'm gonna dive in here if I can't see it writer cuz there we go all right gonna I don't know what is the deal here all right so y'all we're gonna look at this screen for just a second while I log in just bear with me here this might take just a second because it is two factors sitting I have to go through the whole the whole process Oh almost done here all right so so we're signed in now and if I go to my account I think this just shows the azure this is this is the part that's a little tricky I want to I don't want to download it I just want to use it well that's okay that's pretty yeah start for free I just want to go in here yeah as your dev ops with github still not a huge fan of that name but that's where we are it's just sitting there start go there we go all right all right had to check chat there for a second okay so this is the build that I started to set up a few days ago I went in and I just you know I'll show you what I did real quick so I went in it create project name the project something then I said it to be a public so that anybody could check it out should be able to go to this path and check out the thing it's a good basic work item process sounds great plop apply got that started there you go so it created this project and then I went in added a repo that pointed to our github repo which go look at that real quick and then I set a pipeline up over here so I set new pipeline pipeline in this particular situation it's just a it's a build that's all it is Sony there isn't one here because I didn't set it up in this one just yet let's go back here and we'll just take a look at here how do I delete this one actually delete thing okay delete this is probably going to be hard to find I ever got retention ah there we go wheat always hidden somewhere okay now what we want to do is [Music] and it bounced us to another screen here so you see little bit better but bear with me just a second trying to get it to trying to add to the screen the video capture that was on here before it's not showing up hi there we go okay tada they're fixed it go get a cookie okay so that's working out bouncing - Cassie schema migrator and let's check this out so here's the repo that I added it's out here on github like I was saying so if we go to Cassie schema migrator there's that okay and then you know it's got a good thorough history and everything shows the the gate commits um okay that's nice then pipelines going here and here's the build that I set up so the build is it points at the git repo let's here dotnet SDK 1061 the project was restored using something-something so is restored using 1.0 but we don't even want that the project stored using 1:1 the current settings something-something control to follow to link all right let's take a look at that build error there we go dotnet core contains self-contained application includes the dotnet core libraries and runtime certainly not net core to one is self-contained okay so basically it's a self-contained build application for deployment and everything I'm not really sure what that has to do with the error yeah let's look at this of course something's on Stack Overflow woohoo that's something money github issues to microserver is made in c-sharp a web api dotnet core - oh so I have done a quarter to two in this and it's just a CLI so it's basically like it would be building a micro service or something like that target latest runtime patch attribute Oh so let's worse at runtime framework version and runtime identifier and CS proj oh okay so let's go and take a look at those things so in the project let's open that up my emails and everybody's trying to get you to sign up to everything I only do so many things at one time all right there we go schema migrator I have the console cord live in-court s so hmm edit yeah let's edit that I want to see it so this is just the solution file that has the various project files in it so these are the ones that actually need to have that change though so let's go to edit edit the CS proj file target framework was the second says - how old is it - it's just August of last year would be used instead or set right over time identifier I don't want the identifier I just want framework version really yeah target latest runtime patch runtime version my workaround check please check more workarounds on the investigation issue all right we're gonna look at that in a minute but right now let's see if this works let's take this one and we're gonna add it to core Lib and we'll add it to core Lib tests no I really don't know if the tests need it it's packable all right so with that done let's see where we get here okay it add adding target latest runtime patch to the property group in the CS proj files okey-dokey yeah yes no okay so that's pushed now let's see if we get this I don't know if this is gonna update or how it triggers in the pipeline so it's your builds oh this is a it's not gonna get the I don't know if this actually gets the changes because this is a yeah this is this is a let's do an actual pipeline build new new build pipeline and we're to go from github this time instead of local repo path we'll get the github path I'll probably need to actually let's change to HCPs so I can just get it publicly your path lines jeez yeah sure have access to everything we're gonna do lots of lots of building okay clearly it on my password give me a second here here we go okay select a repository okay I'm gonna go with that one yeah we did that so approve install on your personal account yes please install this as your thing lots of verification going on here taking you to your Azure DevOps okay it is a do dot NIC might run for minimal pipeline you can customize a building to pull your code let's go with this one I think build a universal Windows platform pressure no it's not a desktop Windows it's a CLI so should be that but let's just go with a starter pipeline now I gotta write this crap then okay run script display name okay no how do I go back I want to go back go back can I do this in cheat let's do asp.net core there we go so VM image Windows latest solution solution file CPU nougat tool installer and put solution file it must build args platform blah blah blah so I guess that's passed on from whatever's let's let's go with that give it a try setup CI with Azure pipeline so let's do kasi schema migrator build all right and while that is I guess we'll wait for it because it kind of makes it modal an agent is ready for the job cool okay so that's running vs build vs test checked it out did I don't even know what that just did so version 2.1 52.1 seems like everything that it did before so maybe we're on the same path maybe we're on a new path I'm not entirely sure except this definitely has the CS proj changes to the configuration files or the CS proj files that we just made so hopefully that'll make it do the deed correctly I kind of like this jump out follow tail previous task nest task that's pretty cool and then it's got the little like if you have more log you can just drag it up and down that's pretty sweet there we go something's happening now let's go back over here now I blew up again same get a curve the runtime identify our properties set during build or publish but not during restore okay so this it's doing it for each yeah so each of the things is getting error so I got to fit it fix it if I fix one error it's gonna fix them all 2.2 to 3 would be used project how do you right so how do you set the restore so that that's not the case all right back in it Bob bomb but um okay so this this mess didn't work and actually just get rid of that all together let's go back out here and take a look at ready to go this has all this of runtime identifiers property to semicolon separated list of all our DS target latest runtime patch running restore as part of the publish operations may be done desirable for you scenario to avoid restored during publish while creating self-contained applications do the following set the runtime identifiers and set that okay so maybe it so let's actually keep that and then add this runtime identifiers where is this where else is this mentioned oh so as of February runtime identifiers not needed anymore further ok let's go look at this runtime identifier no longer has a desired effect in prefetching runtime specific packages for self-contained deployments so it's the automatic patch version roll forward and runtime identifiers would for example only fetch the two point 1.0 package but when you do that thing publish - rrd then the role ford kick in a newer patch version will be fetched website contain a doubt without having it changed this though it doesn't build it what happens is that new dia collects your package reference and generates a graph for each restore target right targets if you add runtime identifiers in the mix nougat will create separate graphs for each R ID so additionally so you'll additionally get a blah thingy for instance targets targets no self-contained runtime for that thing during the restore this package will be downloaded this may be beneficial blah blah I'm not sure yeah this is hoping docks that okay so this should be what we were just look looking at it's pretty cool that the docks is connected to it that way yeah yep right so let's go in here and let's add a comment and say here from the docks per piece-- message that those dots need updated after reading through this not entirely sure what needs to be changed if I'm getting following error which redirects to this docks page that's not it let's go get that error and we can just give that give them that error okay I don't always want that to happen I wonder if I can turn that off want this to happen yeah there we go and then see how do you know I don't want to do that I just want a blockquote it there we go okay oh damn it that's what I just did there we go oh that's right it's Chevron 1061 that's like the Viking invasion of England um all right so this one is that what I just looked at oh no this is some old this is actually more akin to my RA you need to set the same publish and building run times let's do this run time frame version it's a target framework they're saying there and then here package reference update I don't even have that in the thing Oh dotnet what are you doing oh if you use as your dev ops don't edit project file use dotnet restore instead of nougat restore oh let's go see if we can change that then cuz that's what that's doing it's doing a nougat restore and I want to do not that I want to do sir this is this is the old one how do I delete this not that way I'll edit no but it's this yes delete Cassie schema migrator okay so in this one and let's edit a master and then I here's what we need to do steps SPS build as your DevOps set yeah mole fall stuff that's what I need pipeline stage a job one job to you okay that it uh containers posit or ease that's pretty slick but what we need to do is we need to just run a thing here that's just triggers pull server check out pull steps I wonder if I can just do yeah let's not do that let's do well maybe there's something over here build yeah let's do this you get push no a restore path to project let's just do solution like that needs to use feeds I select here at feeds yeah let's do that use packages from nougat org he did I guess I don't know where else to get him from oh there we go okay so let's get rid of this and let's get rid of that too okay so that's how you get this stuff done let's save that update yep that looks good beautiful then well that wasn't what I wanted to do I just want to start to build again oh it started again okay that's intelligent so that should just just pull it right check out whatever that is dotnet core CLI so is it okay Deborah Deborah Deborah this is well let's do let's do another build from scratch let's go a new build pipeline let's go with github do Cassie give me my grater of course a lot restore oh did that just oh it chose that based off of what it read in the thing so let's see how that goes maybe we just build it that would be beautiful if it did I mean it it should be able to read it and just determine that type of thing you would think all right so huh okay same thing that's why did it why can't it determine where the files are it's a standard solution file okay so back to pipeline to the build this is the new one this is the old one let's edit this I'm just going to delete it for now no no no how do i how do I edit it again oh yeah here we go that's the build I do that I want to do yeah delete this one no all I have to do the whole thing projects right in solution that's well maybe this is maybe just needs to be this see archive files Android signing oh that's pretty cool tempted to just do a batch build still I say thank you NPM msbuild okay well that looks that looks fine and dandy so in the meantime how do I change my so that sends me in here I want to change the name of it though rename there we go I'll wonder if this hole duration 13 seconds keep saying the same crap okay what did this other message say about this build project team I should I have one project that is under I'm using this but I'm not sure about the path this pattern is completion you help me well that's it's useless path to project TVs you should specify the project path that's below for dotnet core tasks from your TV secret pillar repo folder structures like that and get resources stuff if you leave the local map path empty you should specify the path to project as that thing this is this is pretty ridiculous this should not take this much work honey humans here set up build on Azure DevOps for dotnet for CLI create your first pipeline alright yo okay let's do this we're going to do this one so this is their pipelines net core so it has a CS progr eight here how do I need to do a build for each projects build for solution file yeah that's what I want after the build word if you scrip you do it after the bill word okay to use tasks for the build pipeline aquarium will build tasks you specify the following inputs okay well I have that okay actually what did theirs look like now let's do another one let's do dot net core build I don't know what the path is I guess it's should I do that because it's a solution build right there we go I don't know what that even means variable solution is this thing is it even okay it's used right here oh that's nice okay since the case sensitivity is I guess irrelevant triggers master let's let's do that see where we get to there's an old one that started started too everything works this is skipped because this doesn't happen I guess oh let's let's rename these steps like this there we go oh I guess this is can I rename that no looks like it's gonna flake out I mean if I toss the restore what happens in do not find expected key patron Cassie scheme migrator all right new pipeline let's look at this for a second so it's saying do this for a build oh maybe I actually need to do a vs build because it's solution not an individual that mmm so let's do this all right let's just run what it has here dated my mind not sure what that just did did not delete that one and then go do this Oh weird okay well let's do know two points for found for this build whatever and you see sir visual let's look down here visual studio test visual studio test platform installer let's let's see what this does solution studio version sure Visual Studio 2019 msbuild arguments oh that oh [Music] sure let's do that let's see what happens I clearly didn't put that in a good place why is that not it's not working all right let's get this straightened out try that again don't need any of that don't need that I do want to restore do get packages whatever it will do that architecture record project details yes and then save what is it gonna say there's the squiggly line so is that actually an error is it an error I don't know run [Music] yeah I don't know what to do this is this is not working very good so I don't really want to do this I want to do yeah this is what we want to do right here maybe [Music] push you don't want push don't want custom can I not build a CLI with the.net core it might be the problem oh wait optional path for the CS proj files to use you can use wildcards that means all CS proj at all subfolders yeah let's do that why not right I mean kind of want to build all of them let's do a restore first path to projects well this is where I think I'm getting messed up here because these packages from this Azure artifacts tf-x feed I don't know if that's four feet outside this organization collection okay we're gonna leave that use packages from let's do that too and then local cache destination directory we're both City sure it sounds great and then does this work CS brush maybe it's not validated either okay leave build let's do new pipeline github kasi pipeline restore NuGet packages okay let's do false see what happens criminy okay I don't know what VM image even is that's so annoying nougat Pushpak publish restore restore it's got to be restore just do a restore this this is pretty pretty bad okay multi Azure DevOps build multiple projects maybe I should just do we're going to try that just do a script command-line now configuring a build pipeline on Azure DevOps for asp.net core API yep No I create a pipeline whatever get so asp.net core okay let's do it for one then towards tasks oh man so we could just do this and then we do Cassie right and then restore select so all that says is restore that's what this build comes with you Oh piss me off so bad so that should break right that's what I just ran that's the code that's what it puts in there a minute ago though I pointed it at the thing and it says it's a frickin solution file thing it's a good hub Cassie Cassie schema migrator and then yeah what what to flip in hell sure save and run yeah I don't have any idea what the hell it's doing we're just gonna run long though because I'm gonna figure this out no tests no nothing there okay so that let's go back to this one let's edit this puppy yeah okay I guess it is doing that I guess I'm just tripping out all I want is restore oh yeah and I want to do what the heck is it it's let's do Cassie core Lib Cassie core Lib slash she got CS crash let's do this task dot net core CLI at two inputs come in store let's do projects when they do this dot this of CS proj and the docks something like that right it's right up here in the I'll do this for all the ones in those sub folders and it feeds to use does that does that even need to be there I don't know why is it an invalid yamo structure it's gonna take this and let it put it in there so we need dotnet core we do a restore we do path the projects and it's still it's still not the right thing all right well what is in this damn thing what failed the load Oh cuz it's got this oh because of that let's get rid of this and let's get rid of it here let's try it again from that point of view maybe that's causing confusion to the build so get it status git add git commit changing back for the build yeah sure I have a pipeline build in here now that's cute okay read me I'm gonna close that for now let it restart go back in here well that should have triggered one right what what what is this green stuff come on stop focusing oh it did nothing there that's that's why that one worked it hey at least we get a successful build of nothing all right I gotta get rid of some of these okay there we go open that back up [Music] just still not what is going on here the responsiveness of this thing is not very good sometimes oh there it goes because I just had to click on it 10 times so where are we at here so yeah here we got a little music in the background I sit here pondering exists okay so we got this all here and if let's let's actually do a build here so wanna do a build okay so build succeeded there ran the console [Music] so probably is since I'm using JetBrains Rider it probably needs core Lib I mean a visual studio build so let's go let's do that route one more time I just want to see what it says again I didn't want to do that I wanted to do this edit what do we got in here got restore all the CS proj files let's do this let's do the actual name so classy core Lib kasi core Lib slash and then I guess file would be called kasi core live das es proj okay oh did that just I don't know it doesn't know can't know but then it's all squiggly up there it's gonna air out on something problem let's do this let's go down so we'll try and try to do still I'm sure latest sounds great it's solution builder has done platform all yes let's not get the new packages right now i frickin craps out invalid you in the structure [Music] all right so let's just do this crap we're gonna do this one so building me build leave here you build pipeline it says what let's get up so we could just do the github right and I neither for the first 40 [Music] got it for console project as your DevOps building anyway okay we're gonna fork this to here so this is this is a web one though I don't want a web one I don't wanna do the web one I'm gonna do web stuff I'm gonna do it with node or something else I don't always corrupt so we're I want that updated because I don't want yeah I don't I don't want windows [Music] let's save it yet knock that out so here though this is one proj I need to add your pipelines actually sign in your browser goes to blah and displays the thing here protests oh so here's the for your project does that still need to be there don't even know beats to use config let's do this let's do this so we'll do paste that in and then we're gonna go over here though and we're gonna say this the store and then Pat the project let's just do this and we'll put in the one in a minute so feeds to use feeds I select in my config so let's do you get dot and fig root of the repository okay so then this should probably be not that because where is there is no nougat files in any of these a bit yeah there's no do this yeah external feed [Music] oh I keep missing the stupid steps is what I do steps there we go so be restore CEA's proj select or config VSDs feeds let's try that save run [Music] then pending that doesn't build how do you do let's do this so dotnet build solution file right that is that is a thing you can do that build solution yeah let's go over in my thing here and actually do a build that way just to see dotnet build no build kasi schema let's try that let's do a script and try that run a Windows command or bad script and optionally allow it to change the environment I'm gonna do that it's pretty easy on - lets do - no I don't want to do that I would have run okay so stuff and then it's Cassie schema migrator dot that's Helen earning filled so let's just do at adding a script to try to run a script let's try to build with that and let's take out this No oh I need to step still that's right just run the dotnet bill okay so now we got three these suckers right oh the other ones still running traceless in our data core command line pending okay - exited with code two unexpected in the font Oh did I see it all failed ah let's try this and actually let's try 1804 set up for build on Linux with dotnet build solution fire [Music] okay don't want to fight with that right now [Music] or what what okay so the script builds [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that okay we have a good build it's working on Linux her tables is off on the road so I'm just checking Twitter to verify this stuff while I'm doing it all right so we got this one's good yeah it builds good okay so really see the point so well let's let's check let's try this out let's get edit in here and then we are going to add we're gonna add we're gonna add let's let's do another script now it's due to this task command mine too right yeah and then inputs script we're gonna do dot that store I just let's see if that works let's test out the command dotnet restore a kasi schema migrator solution nice okay so it should work for that - Cassie schema migrator diet solution adding the restoration to the process and then [Music] come on build build show victory so restore succeeded how do you fix the I do this [Music] can I do name store the task huh a weird try to run that testing name property okay there somewhere I saw somewhere there was get a badge [Music] huh that's it okay so let's go let's go make our stuff fancier let's give it a name okay restoring dependencies or kasi scheming migrator no oh I have to do hmm yeah oh there we go that's it's kind of crap actually let's just call it this let's call it build restore adding more intelligent names to these steps [Music] just let the other one building all right clear there's the readme [Music] alright now what we want to do let's get the get the actual build in there [Music] let's add to my favorites yeah that's gonna be one of my favorites [Music] it was years add two team favorites status badge that's what I want yeah all right boom holy crap oh that's huge that's cool though [Music] adding a badge a bill badge [Music] all right [Music] all right so that should be a oh that's a sign from that's pretty freakin weird actually store and build did I actually case them that way is it just being weird about that too yeah let's do that that build store they kasing the names of the steps [Music] why am I getting nothing oh I see that's weird just cancel do anything back here and that other one should start yeah so why am I getting double builds for every yes we've had an annual build for a turn home Oh son this is where I click the button even though those one back there building there should be a notification that says a bill has started that's that's pretty confusing actually so that one's next that one's running all right and this I'm gonna actually get rid of this one here because I find stats fail before and I probably need to figure it out actually but new file folder no I don't want that I want to remove the repo and a project description I don't want to add a project description how did I what the heck just happened [Music] well whatever okay so pipelines go back to that what's our build status all right so the casing for the names is done the story's lowercase so whatever alright so let's go back out to get up beer and we should have tada build pipeline succeeded it shoots us over here so let's let's actually log out of this sign out and then get that out of here github and let's see what happens when we actually swing in there without an authenticated account right [Music] hey I'm mine there we go [Music] so I actually want to logout here to sign out then gracious take longer [Music] okay I'm still kind of tripped out though like why doesn't that other the other features work as easily doesn't gonna make any sense it's kind of standard stuff I've always had issues with with.net the builds are weird about that I mean job is the same way shouldn't complain but all right so we got all that in there and I log back in and log out okay close all browsers windows I should have stayed logged in and just use Firefox yeah alright so here we go [Music] should probably add one just build and run the console or something there's a test verification stuff okay so that looks good if we go over here yeah exactly we want to see okay so builds releases got know what okay that's kind of a it's a weird button to see at that stage in the game now come on go all the way back yeah releases pipeline okay so it releases builds and then what about repos repos I think I made it public yeah download as okay boards have no no board action overview pipelines 33 percent succeeded now you know it would be there I don't have access to a wiki you are correct thank you who okay so we ran over a good 30 minutes there but we got it working finally with the script versus the task other cast at the dotnet or the vs Studio One whatever it was so with that gonna wrap it up for today I want to thank anybody and everybody that came out and gave a look-see at what we've been building over all kind of made some good progress was it it wasn't large amounts of progress because we stumbled or I stumbled through that build but you know that's that's how it goes sometimes so with that everyone had a good one and I'll catch you on the next C sharp hour and maybe you know C sharp hour in 30 minutes cheerio [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",
