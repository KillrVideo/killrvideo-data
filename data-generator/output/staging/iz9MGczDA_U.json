sure uh let me know put it put a thumbs up in the chat uh if you can hear two vices that is myself and eric eric do you want to say hi hey everybody good to meet you virtually yeah that's great and no more than two because you know uh sometimes what i've done is i've streamed some music in by um accident so what we'll do today is a little different we're gonna go through the mentee first uh and to make sure i'll i'll make myself small um and and thanks for participating thanks for thanks for coming in uh people from all around the world you know it's it's always exciting to see people all around the world and you have um you know a great at least two hour session uh in store um on myself and eric and deandrea am i saying you're right eric um from red hat and you can see a school t-shirt right you know you want to show it uh properly it's like i made quark stupid i'm in this like little tiny bubble you may need a magnifying glass yeah that's true yeah you can't see that but you'll see it later uh hopefully all right so let's continue on the um mentee so we bought your phones uh the medi code is eight six seven four one eight two three and uh we are doing this earlier because we got the feedback that you know we are spending a lot of time before we get to the content so hopefully what we want to do is get this out of the way as people are joining uh to make sure that everything is okay all right so i see a lot of thumbs up and let's keep going and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get no all right so back again and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all okay make sure that yeah while you're finding that out i see people talking about the jacket that's right i forgot about that myself isn't it cool right um and we didn't actually give our jackets for the workshop last uh last time we did it right but the problem was that some of them did did not make it because of all the supply chain issues right so we decided to go with five free books printed books this time so if you if you hang on till the very end uh you're gonna get uh you know five free books that eric wrote um any you want to plug in anything about the book eric yeah so the the book we have and i don't have a copy with me but there's a the book that i wrote back in late september taking my spring knowledge and translating it to corkus so learning corcus from the eye or the lens of someone familiar with spring so a lot of similarities and you know testing and all that kind of good stuff okay so i'm having some issues here but but stay with me i'll find us all right looks like you must be in like a mission i know this you've got like mustache that's my problem i can't find to see to be able to find my proper screen okay now i found it all right so question number one come on all right here we are yes it's on man pressure's on all right so what's your experience level with cassandra this is a cassandra plus quarkx workshop so you know feel free to uh we find a lot of beginners we do find some experienced developers and administrators every now and then and uh no skill gurus we gotta watch out for them right but as we expect you know most of you are beginners um and and today um you know really um you're gonna use uh cassandra in the workshop but there are a lot of other workshops where we go into more detail i'm just going to only cover that in passing if you will today because really the focus is on app development and kind of experience the joy of app development with quarkx all right moving on how much of java experience do you have wow that is impressive more than 10 years we have a lot of trouble eric i'm gonna run away it's all yours now now i myself uh have been doing java for quite quite a while um and and one of my uh envy was uh if you look at other languages it was so much easier to do the inner loop and i'm going to talk a little bit more about that uh but but you know definitely you know with quackers it makes it a lot easier and you'll see that in action today that is cool right if you want to put in chat uh oh actually let's finish the next question and then maybe we can get some ideas here all right maybe that's an interesting choice that i thought this was a pretty binary question right right right exactly right yeah you've got to be politically correct these days right so so this is this is you know right there all right uh if you want to put in chat uh you know especially those two people who have used quadcopters before uh you know how many years you've been using or you know your experience level that'll be great as well but you don't need to if you don't want to um so eric i i think this is kind of the audience that we want right uh who have used java quite a bit before uh but i've really not used quarkus too much right because what we're going to see here is you know you're going to become pretty familiar with quarkus by the end of the workshop um anything do we want to add eric no i mean i think we'll we'll talk about some of those who haven't used it and and maybe another question for future is have you heard of it or you know what's your level of familiarity with it whether you've used it or not but we'll talk a little bit about kind of the the why you know why we think it's yeah perfect okay so let me move on to the presentation and let me see make sure i got the right one here and slide show all right and i'm gonna make sure the moons show up properly so just give me a second on that and make sure that i don't have any music turned on because i've done that before and looks like we are good to go so this is the workshop intro to carcassonne cassandra and again good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you are from and let's get straight into the content so my name is raghavan srinivas but for whatever reason people around the world have a tough time pronouncing my name so just go buy rags rags not to riches been in the java ecosystem for a while um i'm also a kubernetes guy a cuban art if you will uh looking forward to attending the kubecon eu if any of you are going to be there you know please come see me in person that'll be great but i am a mechanical engineer um by um you know what i did in my undergrad but you know the thing i like about um you know these workshops is that you can see something in action and to see code in action you really have to you know get your hands dirty right and that's why i like these workshops the workshops are aimed at up leveling your your skills wherever you are uh i love distributed systems i love to teach and communicate but one of the main passions is to try to simplify the inner loop you know distributed systems cubanities has made it a lot easier but it's still not there you know we are constantly trying to improve this inner loop and i think you know quarkus is really um you know taking a major step forward and to talk about that a little bit more eric you want to introduce yourself sure so good morning good evening good afternoon wherever it is that you are my name is eric d'andrea and i was happily invited here by rags to to help out with this with this workshop um i've been doing software development for for quite some time you know over 20 years or so i've spent most of my career in financial services you know working for large organizations that have lots of restrictions over what you can and can't do so that inner loop auto conversation looks kind of different depending on what organ is what your organizational structure is i work for red hat currently uh i'm an open source contributor i've contributed in the past to things like spring and spring boot i've got a ton and ton of experience with spring but most recently i do a lot of contributions with corkus i'm not on the core engineering team so if you ask me how devmode works and all that kind of stuff i'm not going to be able to tell you but i do contribute some stuff i was just on some of the corpus insight stuff this morning i do a lot of technical writing and workshops and demos and whatnot around around corkis and you know kind of one non-technical thing that i do i am uh a black belt martial that's cool yeah uh i i i like the fact that you said you know you're not in core engineering and you don't know how caucus colon dev works right and we'll see that today and that's the nice part about all this is you know sometimes we don't even care you know i mean maybe we care but we don't really know how how it works and it just happens and the platform should take care of that right and quarkx does for the most part right all right so a little bit of homework i mean not homework but housekeeping and then you know we will look at nosql briefly um and then um look at cassandra quarkus um then look briefly at microservices we have several workshops that address this in more detail but but the part that we're going to spend most of our time is doing live coding so hopefully i want to get through this in about 40 minutes or so and then what i'm gonna do today is do it a little bit differently and let you guys lose on the live coding part because you know you might want to try different parts and then at the end we're gonna have the mentee where you'll get you know again you'll have a chance to win a printed copy of the book which can be sent anywhere okay so with that said our challenge today is to build a very simple to-do app okay could be us um very straightforward and you'll see this in action uh once once i um you know kind of go through the practice and so on so we've gone through the mentee cool so let's jump straight into the um into the content so i remember actually how this term nosql originated and and basically they wanted to come up with some cute little name for um you know for uh basically doing a twitter um you know a tweet and and essentially what they did was they came up with this catchy hashtag uh which was really about you know it's not sequel but it's something else and they came up with this term which which has caught on actually uh nosql and sometimes it's also referred to as not only sql um and nowadays you know you have some nosql databases which also do sql so so you know the the uh the lines are blurry but but if you think about this you know this happened in 2009 so what's new about you know about uh nosql uh actually as you know you know a lot of enterprises a lot of developers you know take their own time to do the um to adopt you know some of the fundamentally different paradigms one of the nice things about nosql is that it scales horizontally okay unlike relational databases which are really more about asset transactions and so on nosql is really about you know kind of the horizontal scaling and i and i say this jokingly that you know uh actually uh cassandra was there even before the cloud was there right and if you think about that a lot of the cloud-based properties were actually inbuilt in cassandra um you know even before like i said you know that's called the uh the cloud was there so especially horizontal scaling um you know um and especially uh resilience uh reliability um you know and so on and so forth that the cloud provides uh to be able to distribute it in multiple regions uh all of those was available in cassandra and many of the other nosql databases uh you might have heard of this it's based on what is referred to as a brewers conjecture and what this means is that you know in a typical distributed system uh failure is inherent okay uh there is a eight laws of distributed systems are actually started with seven and then there was an eighth one added and and you can you can kind of google this and look for peter deutch who was a engineer in sun microsystems you know i work for the company as well and basically he came up with some of these what they call seven fallacies of distributed computing and one of the fallacy is that you assume that there is no failure but there is going to be failure all the time so when failure happens if you think about three different properties the consistency availability and partition tolerance you have to sacrifice one of these you can only pick two of the three in a failures in area if there is no failure no problem right um so usually um um you know the you you pick like you know two of these right and there are um no sql databases which are clarified as cp which is consistent and partition tolerant ca which is consistent in availability availability and partition tolerance apa and so on one of the things that cassandra always tried was not to sacrifice partition tolerance because actually that is even worse than being available okay and there are several workshops which talk about this so it's also referred to as the cap theorem and and you can see that there and you can see the different nosql databases which kind of fall into these different categories all right so now comes um cassandra it's basically again a peer-to-peer architecture sometimes referred to as a ring-based architecture and sometimes i oversimplify this you know especially when i'm talking to java programmers and i know that a lot of you are java programmers think of this as a distributed hash table you know what happens in a hash you have a key and then you have a value right you take the key and you hash it and you distribute it to the different nodes based on the hash value but if i have to do this myself what happens when you add new nodes what happens when you remove new nodes what happens when a node you know has a failure you know you have to somehow migrate the data or be able to meet the data from other nodes right so one of the cool things that cassandra does is does all that you know i don't have to worry about all that right it persists the data um you know it's not just in memory uh but but you know you can kind of use it like a cache so there are several different ways of doing this but um essentially it's a master less peer-to-peer architecture and you can say this uh today we're probably gonna deal with only like maybe a dozen entries you know in the to-do but it's really great because you know you don't have to worry about sharding it even if you have like millions of entries um and you can cons you know you can configure the consistency as well and again you know we are not going to go too much into this but you might have heard of a term called eventual consistency and surprisingly eventual consistency works great for a lot of applications definitely for the to-do application because if i don't have my to-do right there it's okay because i'm a procrastinator by nature i can always do it later or maybe if it's there earlier than the other one you know it's fine you know i can i can deal with it but large cloud-based companies or what they call as apple scale companies actually use cassandra um and and um you know you you can see some of the logos here like apple netflix fedex you know there are a lot of different companies which use this um like i said before you can distribute it across the globe you can make it hybrid cloud multi-cloud you know you will see today that you you will probably create your database uh on uh on google cloud but you could as well do it on aws or microsoft azure um and and some more as well um so you're going to use this is a perfect way to segue into astra db okay so this is our database as a service it's serverless um it's auto scalable and and essentially again it's in the cloud so one of the criticisms of cassandra was that it's very hard to administrate it right um it requires like a phd to essentially do that we take all that you know that uh pain associated with administering it and we take care of that for you and and that's exactly what you're going to use today which is the astrodb which is the database as a service in the cloud um with a 25 a month but 25 per month credit you can do an amazing amount of things um you can even run some small production workloads uh but if you don't want to use astra there are other forms as well like for example kate sandra which is a kubernetes version and and you can install it on-prem or in different clouds i myself have it installed on google cloud and and eks and i have a multi multiple region set up uh so you know you can do pretty fancy things so with this before we jump to quarkx do you mind eric if we can set up the database because that takes a little bit of time and all that we're going to do is set up the database and then jump into quarkx um is that good right we're going to push me no no i'm not is that it no you're you're in this one for sure um so let's go ahead um at the same time you know i'll i'll point them to the github link as well so that you know if they feel like you know we feel like we're getting into the action um because i know that you know everybody's chomping at the bit to get get the action right all right i know how i am what do these hands are exactly right so what you're gonna do is go into your our github uh and let me see if i can make this any bigger okay i'm gonna go into full screen mode okay and all that you're gonna do is you're gonna go to this github link okay um if you if you type uh exclamation github oh i didn't start my night hub okay can i ask one of my colleagues to start nightbot i forgot to start that all right so with that said you know just go to this github link which is github.com slash data stacks devs and you should be able to find it workshop intro quarkx cassandra and all that i do is just follow this along okay so essentially the first thing we're going to do here is create an aster db instance if you have already created one don't worry about it you know all that you need to do is you know um take it back from unhi i mean hibernate to unhibernate okay hibernate to active okay um so just remember the database name is workshops and the key space name is to-do list okay so how do i start it or how do i create my database just follow the links here right so i'm gonna follow this and open the link in a new window okay you can you can do whatever you want you know whatever works for you okay and let me see it should come on all right and you may ask you may be asked to register um so you can put in your uh you can sign in with github or you can sign into google uh i just use my email so let me sign in okay i'm gonna sign in here and i'm good to go okay so you know first time around it may ask you you know why are you using um why are you interested in cassandra and all that okay and let me get rid of myself and make me smaller so that you can see it all right so so it might give you uh you know the different work uh the different databases i've created um i i usually forget to mention this but but maybe i should um it you know the database is just name and and there is a concept of what is referred to as a key space uh a key space is really a container to kind of group tables logically okay um so so that's kind of how uh how we're gonna um um use the databases plus uh key space names so so that'd be similar to like a schema in a relational database conceptual schema is similar to a table um the uh key space is similar to sometimes what is referred to as a container like for example in article they group tables um you know into a container um i think they call it container if i'm not mistaken but basically it's a logical group grouping of tables and you will see here you know if i look at workshops for instance right and if i do a connect and if i go so i'm maybe jumping around a little bit but that's fine um if i do a describe key spaces okay and and here's my here's what we're going to use today right the to-do list so if i do a use to do list and describe tables this is really all that this is the key space is the tool list so it has only one here right so if you if i look at something else for example use uh drapitisk i love saying that name it's the name of a spider in italian okay um so now if i do the described tables you should probably make your screen a little bit bigger let me try that thank you any better okay again not too many but let's let's use something else native java okay and if i do a described tables it's probably the same you can see to do items right uh i'm trying to see if i can come up with something else but i'll come up with it in a second but what you're going to do is you're going to do a create database okay and you're going to provide the database name and the key space name okay and then what you're going to do is you're going to say you know which region if you want to use google cloud aws and microsoft azure you could um you you will have to you know basically go into this live chat and and you know maybe ask if can be turned on or better yet you can put in your credit card right and you know the moment you put in money all doors open up for you right you know so you can do it on aws or microsoft azure if you want i just put north america the you know and and picks uh monster south carolina or ashburn virginia which is close to me so as you can see uh it's it's locked so the only thing that i could use today is uh max khanna okay and this may be different in different regions i'm not quite sure you know i haven't tried it in india or whatever so so you can you know it doesn't really matter for this purposes of this workshop you can pick this and and if you don't mind once you um you know you have created a database you know put in a thumbs up in the chat and then we'll move back to the presentation all right again all that you're going to do is go back to your git you know your github link okay and follow along create the database name workshops to list and we'll do a whole bunch more later but for now put in a thumbs up once you have created the database if you're having trouble let us know yeah database name is workshops and key space name is to-do list okay and and you can see here um in the github link you will see this database name is workshops and key space name is to-do list all right we saw a thumbs up i'm not sure if that will let me put in um links so i'm trying to links without putting links if you know what i mean yeah all right i think we're good we already see two thumbs up so we should we should just go to the presentation and without further ado i think it's going to be eric just give me a second eric and then i'll turn it loose right and i will do the presentation and you will let me know when i need to advance it right okay i won't forget don't worry all right just give me a second oops okay so all right without further ado carcass all right so i'm not sure what slide you're going to go to the one that yeah there we go design video there's a little bit of a delay here between what rags and i are doing and what's actually showing up on the youtube so apologies so i i think we saw at the beginning that there were a couple people who had said that they've used this corpus majority of people said that they hadn't so i thought maybe we'd take a couple of minutes and just talk about well oh why right well why why did we decide when i say we i mean the community in general not like any one person not we me and rags but um you know why did the community decide on building something like corcus it's not like there aren't enough java frameworks out there right you know you know what's just what's one more so if you think about um historically java have been been around for about 25 plus years at this point it was really designed during a different time so thinking about throughput and what we mean by that is if you think about how the just-in-time compiler works and when your application starts and then it runs for days weeks months at an end although you know we used to put in cron jobs that would restart it every night just because it fixed some problem that we could never figure out why but in any event the the applications were designed to run for long periods of time and the the just-in-time compiler would optimize the byte code during runtime based on what the application was doing and it didn't matter how much heat space you took right you know i remember back in the days with like web logic and whatnot we would allocate like four gigs or eight gigs of jvm heap size for some of these applications because we didn't really care we started these things up maybe we had a cluster like four jvms that ran in a cluster and and that was it but if you think about where we are today especially with like kubernetes and containers and whatnot the the problem is kind of turned over on it on its head what we really want to achieve is smaller faster things that start up use far less resources and were to scale to meet domain scale by introducing more instances and in the container world those instances are ephemeral right each instance is the same as every other instance so the startup behavior of each instance is exactly the same as every other instance so the size and the footprint of these matter which the jvm wasn't really invented to do the jbm was was invented to solve kind of the opposite problem of that and so that's kind of one of the things where we decided that hey if we're going to do a new framework let's just let's not do just a new framework for frameworks per the sense of doing a framework let's kind of reinvent the way the jvm works without having to get developers to have to learn all new sets of tools you know developers know java they love java there's you know billions of java developers in the world we don't want to change that and so that's that's the main reason why why corkus wasn't and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button if you think about how a typical that doesn't look at the next slide there we go there we go so if you think about how just a java framework in general or the java jvm in general works when you start up you know you've got this this build time versus runtime separation right you typically you use whatever whatever tool you're using maven gradle hopefully not in but you use some tool that packages and compiles your your application and then it hands it over to the jvm which then runs that application and the first you know three four five six seconds of startup time there's a ton of stuff that happens before your application is actually up and ready to serve requests or to do whatever it's meant to do you know you've got loading config files you've got class path scanning annotation scanning reading resources enabling disabling features to kind of come up with what the the canonical model of that application is from the jvm's perspective once that's built then it can do things like starting thread pools and you know connection discovery and all that that good stuff before your application is finally able to to respond right but what we found is if you go to the next slide is that a lot of that stuff is is wasted compute right so if you think about when when the jvm starts it's got to scan your package your say it's in a jar file or an ear file or what you should have said your file war file it's going to scan all the classes and it's got to load all that class metadata into memory right so like so that you can do reflection things like reflection and whatnot but then all that metadata is just kind of thrown away but it's still thrown away meaning it's not used but it's loaded in memory well why can't we do all that stuff at build time right if nothing changes between each instance of an application why can't we do that once what quarkus tries to do is to optimize all the things that that it does so all that stuff that it was doing before it tries to do as much of it can as much as it can at build time and actually generate bytecode containing all the the jvm stuff and i'm not a java jvm expert or anything so i'm just gonna use air quotes and call it stuff um because i don't know any better so that when the jvm starts all that work has already been done and we can just kind of hand it off to jvm and say hey here this we did this for you already just just do it right and what's interesting is if you go to the next slide you know there's this big race right now for native compilation right you know a few years ago it was kafka it was like the shiny widget flying through outer space that everybody's trying to to chase right oh i want to do this because that's what all the cool kids are doing well what's interesting with corcus is and i don't at all mean to lessen lessened at all but the the design of corcus in the first place just kind of enables native to happen right it it's almost like a side effect while it is natively native the fact that i can easily build one of these native binary executables is almost like a side effect and again i don't want to downplay that at all but it really is just you know a product of the design of the so you want to first pause i want to put in a plug here um you know the end of the uh exercise today you know there is a lot that we throw at you today uh but if you get to the very end you're going to build a native image yourself and you can see you know perceptibly how quick in response it is right you know compared to what you would have done before so very cool very exciting but um you know again i think uh you know the the philosophy of caucus is to take as much penalty as you can in build time and and kind of make the runtime really nimble really fast yep and this benefit it's the jvm as well and i don't have anything in this deck because you know i didn't want to take up a whole lot of time but there needs to be some decisioning about when when do you run native versus when do you run in jvm because they're like anything there are trade-offs right things like monitoring if you're using agent-based monitoring agents like um dynatrace or whatever that install agents in the jvm well that's not going to work in native because there's no more theoretically there's no more jvm so things like that there are definitely trade-offs that you want to consider and we can have another conversation all the time about what those trade-offs might be but it's definitely native shouldn't be the end-all be-all so i know that you know there are a lot of people who are in java and new to quarkus do you want to plug in your workshop or you want to do it i mean not your workshop but your weekly uh seminars right you know maybe you can do that later but but just remember there are plenty of resources for java to to learn i mean for a carcass yeah yep yeah yeah let me get to the end of the section so if you go to the next yeah so you're already on the next slide so the the key principle here the key tenant is it should be familiar you shouldn't have to learn a whole new set of stuff to do this right we should just make it easy so if you're using things like standards like jax rs or jpa or gta or you know any of these these well-known java standards or tools like hibernate or kafka or cassandra or jager or you know any of these kinds of tools camel prometheus it should just work right you shouldn't have to learn a whole new skill set to in order to i still use maven stuff right that's all it matters you can still use maven we can have that conversation over a couple of years i know we all have a love-hate relationship to maywen but but you know if it if it's still java it's it's fantastic yeah yeah for me anyway that's it that's a different conversation for a different day but the you know the one thing i leave you with and this kind of it's not all just about the technology too we've had a lot of customers come to us and say hey you've it's the switch to corcus has saved our development time and our developers on the inner loop productivity side you know end times over from what they were doing before with you know xyz technology whatever they were doing and that's part of the the framework itself so you know i already kind of alluded to standards and configuration but the whole developer productivity thing it's it's really hard to measure but it it's so easy to to do things so if i like we're working with cassandra here today if i wanted to start doing development you know quarkus can figure out what you're trying to do and if you haven't provided a backing service like a database or a kafka broker or you know redis or infinite whatever it is it can go out and grab a container and spin up the container for you while you're doing your development and while you're running your tests while also you're doing this this continuous testing thing so if you're really into test-driven development corkis can understand what tests are related to which parts of code within your project so as you either change your code or you change your tests quarkx can automatically do this and rerun those tests and provide near instant feedback loop to you automatically and there's no ide tooling or plugins or anything required to get any of that it's just part of of the framework itself and there's a whole bunch of other stuff but i know we're we're trying to you know keep keep to a timeline you can still use the ide that you're familiar with right like for example eclipse um you know for intelligence it doesn't matter or even visual studio code which which is what you're going to see today or vi if you're that's the kind of person uh but moving on um any anything else you want to add eric no yeah i like you too we have there's a weekly we call it corpus insights so if you just go to corkus io slash insights there's a weekly podcast that we do i keep saying we it's not it's not me but the quarkus team does where they have different speakers or different topics and it's an hour you know one kind of thing that streams out to youtube so this thing about microservices right you know we started off with monoliths then you know we called it service oriented architecture sometime in 2005 and now we are in microservices right um [Music] you know there is a reason our ryman reason for everything right and i think we i think we talked quite a bit about this already microservices makes it a lot easier to be able to scale these different things independently and that's just not one reason there are plenty of other reasons especially when you're doing a robust ci cd where you can install them like 1000 times during your day you know you can install them all separately you know can you imagine a monolith being able to you know install it like maybe even five times a year uh you know it it becomes really hard right um there are a number of advantages uh obviously there are some disadvantages as well uh you know like complexity the culture has to change a little bit uh but again you know when you whenever you're making a paradigm shift you don't want to do too much you know you don't want to change your tool set you don't want to change your um you know methodologies completely right and and i think carcasses it kind of helps you bridge that right but it definitely reduces cost it reduces risk and your uh velocity as they call it you know release velocity makes it you know is a lot faster uh let's look at quarkus cassandra extension basically it's a native quarkx configuration uh it provides cassandra driver support and and the nice thing again is that you know if you have if you're using astra as you're going to do today right it works if you want to use kate sandra which is cassandra and kubernetes you can still you know adjust it and you will see all this right or if you're using data structure enterprises which is an on-prem version of cassandra you can do that as well you know it's support for all of those but one of the nice things is that it supports the database as a service which is what you use today okay and to be able to use the database as a service all that you're going to do is you're going to use the credentials and the credentials are actually provided to you and will go through this as well um in a what is called as a secure connect bundle all that you need to do you know as a java spring kind of application is point the security bundle you know from the application.properties file right and and you're good to go all right so let me go back to the little bit bigger heads all right and come back here all right so all that you're going to do is you're going to inject the carcass sql session and you'll see the code in action okay and and essentially it provides uh we we don't use an object mapper today but but you know there are some examples i'll point you where you can use the object mapper um and you know the support from mutiny types and a whole lot right but i know that we are all again jumping on our bed to go to live coding so here's what we're gonna do this is a uh a little bit different from the previous workshops that that i have done um or we have done in general typically what we do is we do a is a check at every section to make sure that you're all on on speed uh but but since we have added quite a bit to this particular workshop my feeling was that this would be better if we let you guys lose on the live coding but please come back you know around i would say quarter to quarter to two eastern time okay that's in in about an hour from now uh when we will do the mentee and we'll give away five bucks okay so in about an hour and give away five bucks but at this point what i'll do if you can pay attention for about maybe 10 to 15 minutes i'll walk through the instructions because actually there are some kind of tricky parts if you will um that you may want to pay attention to so if you can put down everything right now and just pay attention for about uh 15 20 minutes okay after that we'll let you lose so so maybe at the top of the hour uh you have about 45 minutes to go through all the different exercises and then you know you can ask us questions in chat and we'll be glad to help you out there especially if you're stuck don't hesitate you know you can do that but what i'm going to do now is kind of walk through the exercises okay to walk through the exercises what do i do again you know just follow the github link right and that's exactly what i'm going to do so give me a second before i get there all right so this is my github link right so again let me go into full screen mode and uh i've already brought up git pod which is what we're going to use and i'm going to try to increase the font here if i can okay so that's good all right so essentially what happens is uh you know there are a bunch of things remember i we i talked about the secure connect bundle right you have to download the secure connect bundle to be able to do that i go back to my astra console okay so data stacks is it asteroid datastacks.com i can never remember but here i am all right so go back to your astra console okay click on the database okay and all of these um you know instructions are provided to you um click on connect okay and there are a bunch of different drivers that are available right you can see here um you know javascript sdk python sdk java sdk really doesn't matter which one you pick because they're all the same uh but you know since we're java we'll do java okay so there's the java sdk okay and um so connect using a driver sorry that's the one that you want to click so you say java right and then you say click on download bundle and and do the secure connect bundle here okay so click on the secure connect bundle and what it'll do is it'll download it locally so you can see here secure connect workshops dot zip right so you can download it locally i'm not going to download it because i've already done this right and then what you're going to do is you know follow the instructions again right so essentially i i've done this i'm going to launch git part all that you're going to do is you're going to open up this link okay you you this is a link and if you click on this it'll bring up get part i've already opened git part and i'm good to go it's right here okay uh you may have to put in your github link um you know if uh if you're doing it for the first time uh but you know just your github uh you know credentials is gonna work just fine so once you're here um you know there is this kind of like uh explorer window right the file explorer and then you have this terminal window and then of course there is this editor window if you will right um so we'll primarily be using this this uh um you know terminal window okay so again i'm just going to follow the instructions because you know it's just easier right so this is the you know like i said the explorer window the editor window and the terminal window primarily using three okay uh there are a couple of things that you will need to know for example your public url um this is going to be different for each of you uh because it depends on your github uh it's it's a good idea to kind of keep it handy because you're going to be using it now the first thing you want to do is set up your application right so so what you're going to do is you're going to open up this source main resources application dot properties right so let me go in there all that i do is cut this and paste this okay so um i open this okay and and what we have here i have i filled it myself already okay but you'll have to put this astra username and astra password to get that what you're going to do is again you know if you go back to your managed database you'll have to create a organization settings okay and then you have token management and you generate a new token with database administrator okay and if you generate a token it will give you a client id client secret and token the client id and the client secret is what you're going to use okay and and a good idea to kind of keep this handy um you know you can put it in notepad you can do whatever you want okay um but if you navigate away from this page right you're going to lose this so just just be aware of this if you navigate away no big deal you can always generate a new one okay if you lose it not a big deal and all of these instructions again you know i'm following it a little bit kind of non-linear but but you know all of these are available um you know in the github page okay so you're going to paste the username you're going to paste the password and then you are going to download the secure connect bundle like i said before you're going to download it locally that is you know you're going to connect click on the connect using driver java click on the download bundle and click on the secure connect bundle okay so essentially what you're going to do is you're going to take the secure connect workshops.zip and drop it in here okay and that may be the trickiest part of the workshop actually right give me a second i'll be back okay so that that might be like i said the trickiest part of the workshop okay is to be able to um take the secure connect workshops dot zip i've already done this before just make sure it's in your top level directory so to do that i usually what i do is i just do this um and verify and it should be about 12k if it's not 12k um then then something is not okay so just go ahead and do it again all right that's all you need to do and one of the cool things about quarkx again is you know it has the swagger ui um you know health checks and all that and and you know eric can talk at length about this but the nice thing about this is you're going to try it yourself okay so let me go back to my workshop let's assume that i've done all this right the first thing i do and this is the coolest thing always test test driven development right uh make sure that i'm able to connect to the database right and i mean eric you can talk a little bit about testing while i'm while i'm doing this but one of the one of these trends about quarkx is testing correct yep yep so what you're doing is you're just you know running may even test but what you you know as an experiment what you could do is you could just run quarkus dev mode and you could turn on continuous testing and just let the framework do it for you um and so then if you made change any changes you make it would automatically rerun the the tests for you exactly yeah so here all that i make i want to make sure is that i'm um you know i'm connected to the workshops so i've been connected to the workshops database right and the appropriate key space okay and if everything works fine keeping my fingers crossed right you never know i want to talk a little bit about uh the uh java tools options here which came out as error you know you can ignore that but uh eric you want to talk about that or i don't know honestly i don't know i don't know either yes i think it's probably just something in the code is printing to system error instead of systematic maybe yeah as simple as that okay and and somewhere here you should see um you know the table created as true and again a lot of this output is pretty relevant like for example you know it shows what are the installed features uh you know you can see here the cassandra driver uh the kubernetes client which you probably won't see initially but you will you will do that later um talk a little bit about rest easy rest uh you know and so on um eric you want to do that while i proceed yeah sure i mean like like i said you know corkus is based on standards so when you're in the code like in the the rest end points and whatnot you probably won't see a whole lot of corkus specific imports most of it will just be you know to the jax rs standard you know outside of the the court the cassandra specific stuff so it's all about you know adhering to standards and you know what what else is kind of interesting is caucus doesn't care whether you want to do reactive or you know whether you call it imperative or blocking or whatever so whether you want to do synchronous or asynchronous it's completely up to you we're we're doing blocking endpoints but you could just as easily change the method signatures of all the endpoints and you would transform the application into a reactive application or just a single endpoint as a reactive endpoint quarkus kind of figures out under the covers what it is you're trying to do so in this case if you just open up like the the astrotutu class for a second just to have a reference as to what i'm talking about yes i'm opening it up this one yep they asked you to so like if you notice in there all the method signatures there return like pojos or lists or whatnot you could change it to reactive types and corkus would understand what it is you're trying to do so the way it's implemented now when these endpoints get called the con the bodies of those methods actually get moved off onto a worker thread and while the work gets done and then it's dispatched back to the event loop thread and serve back out but if you were to rewrite the code a little bit and return reactive types quarkx would not move it off to a worker thread it would actually run it on the i o thread so it's kind of cool and you don't even really need to tell corcus about it it just kind of figures it out on its own very cool all right so moving on i'm again using the github instructions and that's all i'm doing right so we are now ready to run the application how do i run the application you know it's a shame that i'm skipping the test i should probably do that but but you know in the interest of kind of keeping this uh going okay i'm going to just do the skip the test because i already know that it worked right um but again you know your tests might be a little bit more sophisticated than the simple you know i'm able to connect kind of thing right so all that i do is i run this maven target called quarkus colon dev okay and it will tell you a service is available on port 5005. and what is the 5005 you know it's the debugger okay and and this is standard in java so you know not something new um but you know i don't care about opening this in browser or opening this in preview so i'm going to skip it i'm most important i mean i'm most concerned about the application itself so i'm going to open it in preview mode or i'm going to open it in browser but i really don't need to do that because other ways of doing this but let me open it in the browser okay uh it didn't come up which is fine not a big deal okay so so what we can do here is you can use one of these bash okay and you can just say gp url 8018 and again all these instructions are in there and this will be the um the end point for your application okay so so i'm gonna take this and again you know it's in the instructions so don't worry about kind of following along okay and if i hit this hopefully my application should be up and running right very very simple application right nothing you know uh very fancy or whatever right uh very simple application i am uh uh doing uh uh quite going on vacation that's something i haven't done you're right i am going to [Music] bengaluru my favorite city all right so uh all right so let's uh go back to my to-do and go back to here right which is you know basically i'm running this right and one of the cool things about um about [Music] caucus is that you can do what is referred to as heart reloading okay and the easiest way to do that is go into resources i keep forgetting where it is oh there it is right matanz and uh index.html right okay so let me go here into index.html okay and and it says fork me and github right and i think it's the daily one that i need to fork so for me already on github okay so i'm just gonna change that a little bit and i haven't done anything right and if i go back and look at my application you know pay attention to this right corner over here okay um oh i lost my cursor okay there you go so if i do a you know i have i i probably should have brought up a browser which kind of looks like this but you can see here for me already on github okay i didn't do anything right it basically was looking at you know the the different sources and and it did the hot reload as as it's referred to uh yeah and it's you can do more than just static connect too you just update it said you can change your code you can add dependencies you can remove dependencies you can refactor classes rename classes and it'll just work exactly yeah mine was very simple changing your static html which is you know it's still cool but with me you know you can do you know a lot more things i'm just trying to get you going on this yeah but even this is very cool uh you know considering where we were about five years back right you know so yeah all right so um so you can do a whole bunch of stuff um you know like for example you can force the restart you can resume testing if you're a test you know if you're doing testing uh and so on and so forth and one of the cool things is being able to look at the quarkus dev metrics okay so to be able to do that you know you can you can hit the d key and we'll see if that works uh i've had some issues with git part but but we can we can we can take a look so just do a h here okay you can type h and it will give you all the information here okay and open the dev ui in the browser you can see here open the dev ui in the browser um it's not working for me so yeah yeah i've had it work before so unless something has changed anyway very easy all that you do is slash q slash dev remember this right slash q slash dev to get the caucus matrix okay and there is the caucus matrix whole bunch of stuff in here um you know you can take a look at all of this um any one thing you want me to dive in uh uh one of the things i do is kind of look at the config editor okay and i can change the aster password and astro username not quite sure if it's gonna work you know but i've tried it um you know you can change the you know you can see the key space here to-do list right um a lot of other things that you know you can take a look at i'm using an image registry docker io that you will see in a little bit okay swagger always include um so you can get the swagger ui because this is really about primarily about using swagger uh like a risk-based api and and that's kind of how we um how we make this application as like a turn it into microservice uh and and i'll point that later uh so that you can call it as a service um i'll just mention one thing too the config editor shows you the current values of every property that you have based on the extensions you have installed in your project whether you've actually added the property to your properties file or not so if you've added the property it shows you know what your value is if you didn't add the property it's kind of what the default value is and any values that you change will reflect back in your properties file and your application will automatically pick up that change yeah that's a great point to make because um you know if if for some reason i did not uh um you know update my application.properties file it's just looking at the config editor of course you know the application may not even come up but if it did come up then you know you know what configuration you're using production dev you know all kinds of things like that very very handy very useful and all that i needed to do is just hit the d key which did not work but but that's the way it's gonna work okay uh you can take a whole bunch you know take a look at this which is the open api again very cool you know it's the swagger um you can take a look at this again you know if you go go into the other bash and hit the same thing okay so this will give you the swagger open api spec okay and i'm gonna again very straightforward uh it adds an endpoint slash q open api and hopefully this this is going to bring up the open api um i think if i do something like this it might depend a little bit on the on the browser okay if i do this for instance you will get the swagger i'm not quite sure where the 404 comes but but you know you can you can take a look at this it has the index html what are the deletes the post and so on you forgot the queue we forgot the slash q oh is it oh this is the default okay yeah that makes sense okay thank you yeah any of the end points that corkus generates falls under the slash q name space or the uri path all right already pretty exciting but the last thing i'm going to show here and then i'll let you lose is show the debugging part because i i think i'm almost to the top of the over okay so this may be a the line number might be a little bit different in your um editor but here i think i'm line 61. but here yours i think asks for line 60 okay so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna run the debugger right you know i'm still running my application in development mode all that i need to do is hit the run and debug okay and this is going to bring up this short debug quarkx or something like that right which is the target that i've said this is you know something to do with visual studio code and all the magic happens so you don't need to worry about any of that start debugging okay now i'm gonna go back to my application okay and run it again right very straightforward right and i have all this and i put in the uh last one right debugging all right and i'm gonna hit return and notice here you know you can see this red thing going on you know something happened right it's a little bit different and you can see here even in the tab i hit the break point it's it's giving me a hint that he hit the break point and if i go back there's my break point very cool right so i go back to to-do i look at this debugging i fix it but like what eric said this is a very simple example where i'm just you know changing your static property but what you can do is you can you can you can hot reload your code so so for example you know if i want to make this uppercase or lowercase or whatever you know you can do that you know in line right uh and it'll work right so so but let me show you this uh i changed it to debugging and then what you need to do is hit this small arrow called continue okay and all of this instructions again is available you hit this continue and if you go back and look at your application there you go let's debug it okay how cool is that right you know you're able to do debugging now um and and you know you can do a whole whole lot of stuff with that as well so then what we do is we know we we look at you know again all the instructions are there uh we do packaging we we do clean package and skip tests and so on and then one of the things that you know we enhanced quite a bit and thank you eric for doing this as well uh is the containerizing part because that's really where you know quarkx shines um you know to be able to deploy it into containers and and what i'll do here is i'll show you this part um because i'm skipping everything else okay i've done uh quite a bit of this but for you to be able to do this you have to do a docker login okay and so let me go in and do the docker login okay so the first thing i probably need to do is kill my application you know let's go back and worry about that later right so again you know control c all of those will work fine okay um and let me do a docker login so if you don't have a docker login don't worry about it you you don't need to do this okay and i don't know if we told people or not but they could probably get going while we're talking we're just kind of killing dinner no no no actually i would like them to pay attention a little bit here and then you know i'll get them losing like two minutes well that's that's my famous word sorry all right so um you know once you do the docket login right um then what you can do is you can push this to docker hub um okay so you can stand up an application in kubernetes and so on uh and and essentially i've done all this so we use a free service called ok tito okay and and all of this is available in the instructions again sorry about it one catcher that i think you should mention that i ran into when i was doing it was when you push it to docker if the repo didn't already exist which it most likely won't for people it it'll create it but it creates it as a private repo so you'll need to go into docker hub and switch it to a public repo and they're interesting exactly how to do that but that's kind of like a gotcha because when you try to go deploy the image it'll be like hey i can't find grapevine grapevine yeah yeah so that's that's a great point um so you can see here i i don't have anything running um all that i need to do is to be able to push it okay i'm gonna push that all of the instructions are there okay so so you know there are a whole bunch of stuff that you'll need to do okay make sure that i get my docker login id okay so if you get the docker like login id it's probably going to be blank here yeah because i didn't follow a step so go back and follow that step you know i'm kind of doing like i said you know a little bit jumping all over but but you know if you can follow this step by step you will be able to get the docker login id okay so all that i do here is kind of get the docker login id okay you'll see here i'm using the docker library that will be used as rags ns okay and now i'm ready to push it okay so i have the login id and now i'm ready to push it okay so i'm ready to push the image so to be able to push it all that i need to do is follow the instructions again okay and we use a container plug-in called jib to jib is so cool it is so cool for the inner loop because it does a whole lot of stuff you know and maybe you know you may want to talk about this to eric but you can see here it's using a base image from from a very well curated um you know ubi image from that red hat users okay and then essentially pushes it um you know into my uh actually here i'm probably not pushing it so i've just created it but if i do a darker images you should be able to see this okay you can see here i created a rags in escort cassandra 26 seconds ago like i just created it right now if i want to push it the next command um is gonna do that for me okay so what i want to do is i don't want to keep all the secrets in there right so uh so essentially what i do is i uh i get rid of all of that so so what i do is i i kind of do this i go into the application properties and i take out you know the secret id and the password and all that and i can do that again you know there is instructions for doing that so i go in and i get rid of that okay and this is going to push it also okay and in the meantime what i can do is i can take a look at this kubernetes yaml file okay so if i go back here it generates all of this automatically for me how cool is that again you know i can take a look at this uh oh what happened here kubernetes you know you didn't add the extension yeah you're skipping all right so so that's probably what happened okay so you'll get it you know when when you when you do it and you can you can follow along this um so any um and and then you can uh deploy it to the service called okto okay but but i think i've done this and the final part is this uh package skip test and i'm just gonna start this uh it's it's actually simplified a lot you know earlier i used to wait for like seven minutes but now it's like two minutes it's unbelievable how fast it is you know i really i really like the latest experience so how do i how do i package this very easy all that i do is do this clean package and skip test whatever right and i'm good to go okay and and we'll not let this finish because this takes at least two minutes right um but essentially i'll come back and show you how quick this is and you can you can see it actually in action where you know it's it's it's a lot faster um in in action uh so anything else you want to add eric before we turn them loose and uh you know let let you guys if you if you don't mind can you can you put in a thumbs up and and put in an exercise number so that you know we know you're following along like for example um if if you finish exercise six just put an exercise six and a thumbs up or or if it's a thumbs down you know we'll try and help you um any anything else you want to add eric uh because i no i think with the people exactly exactly and and the last thing i want to do is you know somebody talking behind me when i'm doing the hands-on right so we're gonna try to stay as quiet as possible uh if if it's affecting all of you then we'll come in but otherwise what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have this pause screen uh and let you guys kind of work on it and we'll be there on the chat uh to help you out you know not just us but there is the entire team that's kind of helping us out okay so uh with that said let me go to my presentation give me a second here and don't remember i mean do remember uh come back in about uh 40 minutes okay and we'll start maintain that time depending on you know how things are going okay so we will have a pause for about 40 minutes okay this is the uh to-do application um and you know it goes through the tables and all that the slides are also available might be a little bit different from what exactly you're using but you know you can take take a look at the data model we already looked at slash q slash dev um and and the nice thing about this is you know you can use this as a micro service so you can connect it to different back ends all of this is in the uh in the repository i'm not gonna spend too much time we looked at rest api um architecture from a very high level you have the to-do back-end you have this 2d application which uses rest api and some kind of database on the backend and we have connected you to astra okay with that it's all yours now let me see if i can stay quiet we see some um is that ajesh kumar who has completed exercise 6 which is cool do you see any questions in chat that needs to be answered eric before we stay quiet no i don't okay i don't think so unless i missed it okay i see that mel had some issues but he's he's over that which is great i see quite a few people who have completed six which is which is cool and again if you don't have the time to do it today that's fine you know the instructions are pretty self-explanatory uh you can try that out but i'd be really curious if everybody can get to you know packaging native you know if you want to skip some steps and go to native that's fine too uh because i think the coolest part of the workshop is the native if any of you are running into issues please feel free to contact us uh why a chat we only look at youtube chat we don't look at twitch so just just remember that nicola samprini semprini hopefully i'm saying your name right um completed exercise 6 which is really cool keep going he gave me two thumbs up which is i i'm gonna take it as like really excited right so kishore greek apati is asking is there anything to cover i'll go through the workshop offline later you're perfectly welcome to do that later remember we are here to help you just in case you run into trouble myself and eric hopefully you won't but but you know just in case so so we are here for at least the next half an hour but the cool part you're going to get five printed books um you know based on how you do on the mentee quiz okay so my advice is even if you go away for a little bit you know to take a bio break or whatever the case may be to get lunch um you know or dinner as in the case of india it's fine but but try to come back about 10 minutes before the top of the hour or 10 minutes before the half hour in in the case of india right so so in about half an hour from now let me clarify one person isn't going to get five books five people are going to get one book yeah exactly yeah and i'm going to dump off camera for a second but i'll go i've got a copy of it i'll hold it up fantastic yeah yeah that'll be great and and it does it include autographs too oh he's gone fantastic if you can put in also the exercise number um that would be really appreciated because then we'll know where you are all right i'm back sorry i don't know if it shows up with the virtual background or let me see if i can if i can make you feel this way i mean i mean that's going to be a little let me let me make it a little bit bigger just give me a second or at least i can do that i could turn off my background too it's probably that is true there's no way yeah so maybe we can do both right give me a second let me see that good thing i put up my green screen so people can't see the mess maybe all right i i think that's that's looking pretty good now you know i mean i unfortunately can't do that because then i'll have to fiddle with too many things so so yeah if you if you want to put it up a little closer uh yeah it's because of the what's your background it's not working yeah yeah i mean bananas here yeah i can bring it up on the url right and here we go much better very cool now does the giveaway have your autograph from you or probably not because i don't physically have the copies here in my house they're at a storage facility across the country from where i live and they'll get shipped right from there but but if you're going to be at a conference in texas right that that we're both going to be absolutely eric would be happy to sign i will have copies with me eric would be happy to sign it fantastic sarika said she's done with exercise 6. uh in editor no need to control plus s that's what kesu murthy says uh i don't know what control is yeah you don't need to say all right oh yeah yeah that's what control s does right uh basically get part uh does uh auto save so you don't need to do anything you know which is really cool again xsa eid mazen the you know the person really cool mazen mellow put a thumbs up if i tried to you know if i got your last name right exercise eight was what i i forgot what it was but uh um let me see oh debugging all right done with exercises eight you're very close uh it's going to flow very quickly you can skip the packaging part not a big deal i know that you know that's typically what you do in production but but you can skip that again you know great job keep going nice to see a lot of thumbs up here and feel free to give some thumbs up on the youtube stream as well uh because eric has you know taken his time and and you know we are here to help you so so feel free to let us know if any of you are stuck please don't hesitate we're going to come back in about maybe 25 26 minutes to do the mentee and we'll try to finish up on time today exercise seven and eight nicola great job good to see a lot of thumbs up okay uh there may be a problem here right knit 10a extension and an extra in oh okay file the pr thank you so much mason yeah if only i knew how to type right and and actually that's a great point you know if you have any suggestions for improvement or um you know anything like that uh feel free to you know put in some pr's uh eric i really appreciate uh you going through the instructions and putting in pr's that we merged last week so so it's always a lot of fun to see different perspectives and how you can do things better so really appreciate it if you can put in a pr exactly that's right community makes it better absolutely right yeah it's a little humbling i i have to admit that but but you know it is what it is what's interesting i you know from i've always worked for large companies like financial services and whatnot and you were pretty much always forbidden from contributing or giving because that you know the business feels that you're giving away trade secrets when in reality what you're contributing has nothing to do with any real business case especially when you're contributing to things like cassandra or corcus or spring or whatever it is it's more general in nature but i know when i joined red hat and reading you know everybody signs a contract with you know that that talks about the rules of you know the company and what not when you when you join a company but like i never worked for a company where like right in like the first thing you see is you know we encourage you to get involved and contribute and what it was like like a breath of fresh air you bet you bet uh i i started my um you know career with java right you know my professional career and and one of the constant criticisms we got from the community was we wanted open source and it's amazing how java took off after it became open source right so so yes absolutely right mohammed hati niya sudhin has completed exercise eight very cool love to see some more nine and 10 and so on uh but but take your time you know we still have a lot of time you know we will come back in about about 20 minutes 22 to be precise and if you have more detailed questions or discussions and i forgot to mention this earlier is you can take it on this card which is uh really more in-depth and there are a lot more people in the community who are willing to help you with this as well um i don't know eric if you are signed up to the uh data stacks discard community but you know um something you know if there is a detailed question i'm sure i'll find you and opinion about that yeah yeah i'm in there i'm not probably the right place but i'm in there this is a really really cool thing that i'm going to be able to take a bio break so i'll be back in like two minutes while you handle the shuriken is that good yup handle the show without the keys of the infrastructure i'm back do you see my jacket it doesn't say you changed jackets would you go outside i changed my jacket because i wanted to show off this old java logo that i love this is the old java logo and this is the java jacket i've had for a long time all right uh so somebody had some problems um sql test errors yeah without seeing the error no i think yeah yeah yeah that absolutely makes sense yeah that's probably what is happening yeah and and that's why we talk about like uh the testing part right you know if you if you don't get the testing um test right then you know chances are the others not gonna work right so so if you can get that out of the way um you know that will help you kind of at least first level triage what the issue is so you know eric is right in that you probably don't have the client id and secret in your application properties file and also the secure connect bundle and drag it to your git spot gate pod workspace absolutely so hs 2075 let us know if you still running into issues you know it may be something that we probably haven't seen before but unlikely [Music] says the java logo on the jacket does not compare with the quadcopter logo all right i don't know about that yeah but uh but while we are at it you know you should you should now get up a little bit and show your uh you know your t-shirt uh you you know no no i think it's more visible right eric uh yeah yeah i can stand up a little bit i'm trying to like look at myself on this side over here i made carcass i made corp so they they gave these to people who contributed to corpus between one and two not just red hat employees but anybody in the community who made a contribution where your your email address was relevant in the get change log between versions one and two they sent out these t-shirts to everybody fantastic yeah and do you want to talk about do you want to talk about how the name caucus came it's interesting i think i have a slide on it somewhere so they if you think about quark so the word quark is this the smallest particle out there right the smallest building block that you can make anything from and then the word us meaning like you and me we're the hardest things in computer science right you know the tech the tech is the easy part it's the the people that are that are tough and then you combine cork and us and you get corporate at least that's the way i understood it yeah that makes sense yeah yeah you know um again going back to the inner loop right you know that's exactly the same thing right and and i don't know if uh you guys have heard of a computer scientist by the name of nicholas worth um i think i believe it was french and and basically he said programs is equal to algorithms plus data structures right so if you think about programs the way to make it more efficient is to improve the efficiency of uh both your algorithms and your data right and i think quarkxpress cassandra is a great combination that way because you know quarkx is really about reactive um applications and cassandra is really about responsive data so so i think you know you you need need to be able to kind of um optimize you know every part of the tool chain um but but i think the fundamental part that gives you huge quantum gains is in the inner loop um i mean that's how that's my personal feel for it yeah i agree there's an interesting article produced by lyft the engineering team at lyft a month or two ago where they talked about the how their inner and outer loop development had changed how they originally solved it and then how it changed over time as the team and the complexity grew and whatnot if i can find the link i can paste it but it was a really really interesting read on the different tools and technologies that they had tried and you know how it worked and then it started to not work and where they're going with it now well i'd be curious to see that myself and and one of the things about these workshops which i love is that i learn a lot myself okay but i also realize it's very hard for me not to talk so i'm gonna stop for the next 10 minutes and let you guys focus and then we'll be back in about 14 minutes okay oh swiss worthless swiss thank you thank you for the connection is it okay to paste the link to the lyft article in the youtube chat so it's a four part series and here's the the link to the first one the first two are the ones that talk about inner and outer loop and then they talk about deployments and whatnot staging production and all that really really interesting article series the first two were really interesting and and and i think uh ian larue um is absolutely right quark has made java great again um i think i think just that that you know kind of breath of fresh air uh i think other platforms are also following suit uh i think made it made it really cool and you know as java guys uh i think i think uh we are you know definitely on track to make it cool again i see that damon completed exercise nine getting there getting there we still have about 12 13 minutes left and and if you guys want to wait a little bit we can do that you know we can always close up after that you know slightly after i'm just playing around with the slides just in case youtube determines oh nothing is happening and i'm going to shut down the stream or something like that i don't want that to happen absolutely 8080 is a great point do you want to talk about that eric since you came from financial background yeah i'm just i'm letting it soak in before i formulated so i'd say that's true and maybe true and untrue i mean there's a ton of banks i mean look at like goldman sachs bank of america a lot of these companies are really innovative but then there's a whole slew of them that that aren't um but that being said they have a huge investment in java right now i agree that they're using they're probably using java the way it was designed to be back 20 years ago right you know with these huge workloads but the shift to using lighter weight stuff it's not just a technology problem like when we go in and we talk to customers about innovation and modernization and cloud native or whatever it is technology is only one-third of like that cap theorem triangle you have is it kind of you can apply that here too but you take the labels you get the tech you get the people and you got the processes right the tech is only a third of that if you don't change the people in the processes then you're just wasting your money and your cycles on the tech right so you've got to be able to change the mindset of how to not just how to operate but how to build applications at scale in this in this type of environment look at companies like lyft or netflix or linkedin or whatnot i mean these guys are going to production hundreds of times a day right with very little to no human intervention so yeah it can be done but the the companies that aren't investing as much in it are going to miss the boat a little bit it also goes to how different organizations are organized as well i mean most of the financial companies i've worked for are very contractor heavy right so they just offshore everything they you know they throw the work over the wall you know it gets done and then it gets kind of sent back and then the consultants that worked on it move on to something else that doesn't foster that kind of environment and i'm speaking out of opinion here not you know any kind of company representation you've got to invest in the people that are building and maintaining these these applications and in order to to get that if you're going to continue to operate in that environment maybe it works for you but it you're gonna have a hard time the other thing i'll say you know companies that try to do microservices and don't have good automation or don't have a good automation strategy are bound to fail right you've got to figure out automation and you've got to be good at it even at a maybe not like super but you've at least got to have it and you've got to get your feet wet in it before you yeah even if you don't do microservices if you can do automation if you have to pick one of the two i would i would pick automation you know so yeah that's kind of how it goes yeah and microservices aren't the end all be all of everything either i mean we we i don't know if it's an official term but internally we call them a couple different names either majestic monoliths or fast moving monoliths if you can take advantage of things like automation you might not be building a microservice but that application still may adhere to many of the cloud principles or 12-factor or whatnot if that works for your organization there's nothing wrong with that right as long as you can automate you can not just the automation of delivery but the automation of testing and whatnot if you've got that down you're well ahead of the game again that's my opinion i i think you're absolutely right on that one yeah um you know um i think paradigm shifts culture shifts they take longer than tech shifts right um that's invariable um but but you know um i think i think it's possible to do all that uh you know at least the tech is there today to to be able to do that all right anybody on exercise 10 twelve oh we some mezzan melo completed exercise ten uh we're almost there you know just wait like ten minutes maybe about six seven minutes and we'll start uh the mentee then you are eligible to win a a book um i want to make myself clear you know a book that is about carcass it's a printed copy that will be shipped to you wherever you are in the world yeah and what would five copies do you anyway other than hold your table up right yeah yeah what are you gonna do with five all right we have about five minutes and and i'd like to ask you to kind of start kind of wrapping up if you want to put in how many uh exercises you have completed that will be great if you want maybe like a two five minute extension we can definitely do that we can wait a little bit longer i just don't want to drag it too long uh so just put it in the chat you know if you want an extension of like five minutes you can do that seven minutes we can do that otherwise we're going to start the mentee at about 10 minutes to the top of the hour or 10 minutes to the top of the half hour you know depending on where you are so that is in about five minutes exercise nine that's cool very cool all right looks like people are good to go so we will start in about four minutes okay is that good um you know we'll go through mentee uh ask a few questions tough questions and it's actually pretty simple um and and you know i will talk about the rules in in a moment but but we're gonna do that in about five minutes yeah i'll throw this out there too for people who want to know more about quarkus there's a a sample application that we've built out there i can drop the link in the chat for it it's called the superhero i've seen that um it gets like some heroes and villains and they battle against each other it's a it's kind of an interesting architecture it's it's definitely a microservices multi-service architecture it's got some database unfortunately there's no cassandra in there but there's kafka and schema registries and all kinds of stuff in there and i'll drop there's a blog post about it too that talks about kind of why and some of the requirements that went into building it perfect yeah hopefully one of the participants you know will adapt it for cassandra and put in the pr or something like that yeah we really need the cassandra dev service so everybody from cassandra engineering is listening nice they i'll ask you for that little nudge into the stomach here absolutely absolutely i love what ian is saying about java concurrency in practice uh if it's only one book that you read multiple copies in your hand it's called java concurrency in practice uh do you want to put in who the author is so i can't quite remember but i've i've read runs actually is based in vermont so we are all the northeastern guys right so very cool yeah he's an old sun guy brian goetz he was the one of the original people on like the back in java 5 the java util concurrent package yeah and he actually uh i mean he he has some great talks i've attended some of his great talks at java one he's fantastic uh but he's still the you know architect at you know in article for java does some great things so performance analysis do you want to talk about that this is a advanced question by masan maluk i think he's doing the uh native packaging right maybe performance analysis yeah i'm not sure what he's referring to and perform so native build is a excruciatingly memory hungry and resource intensive process so i mean two minutes to do a native build is actually very fast in comparison to some others that are out there even for i mean this i wouldn't consider this a trivial application it's somewhat non-trivial it's not super completely there um the native image and the dead code elimination process is quite memory hungry and it's not just specific to corcus it's you know vm in general it's just kind of the price you pay for it but you're doing it once at build time and then you're getting the bang every time you run on the update i'm trying to see what was my uh how was it looking uh huh what happened here get hard what did i miss all right i'm not gonna worry about it let me go back here i don't know how long it took for me but uh i don't know if it's if it's gonna be still there yeah it was probably a few minutes all right let's go back here and see is this one nice yeah did you get pi probably stopped all right let's not worry too much about that so um it's about 10 minutes so what i'll do is i'll go to the uh mentee is that good um and then we'll wrap it up with some resources um eric try to finish up on time today all right and then again all the instructions are there if you want to do it on your own pace not a big deal okay so let's go into mentee okay this you saw before um and i'm gonna start the presentation let me see again you know all that you do is putting in this code 86741823 okay and here all right so let's go back here and i'm having some trouble here oh what's going on minty sometimes freezes on me okay there you go it took forever all right so let's start presenting okay so we did all this now is quiz time remember eight six seven four one eight two three and i'll make both you and me little if i can and i'll add some music because it's always fun to have some music right so i'll keep it a little bit low let me know if it's too noisy all right quiz time what are you gonna do 86741823 and join us you will be eligible to win some books okay one day i can advance the slides here all right okay let's roll remember look at your devices you have a few people playing so answer fast but most importantly answer correctly name of the database as a service we use today what do you think did we use any databases service today probably right was it gitmod was it astray or was it quarkus time's up and 20 people got i probably shouldn't be playing you can play too uh because you know even though i've played and i know the answers i can never get it on time so you know our attendees are much faster much smarter than me so all right so let's see the leaderboard leaderboard coming up in a second looks like thomas is going to be in front daven with the strikethrough i don't know how we did it but that's really cool um saint elmo kathy earthman any of you might still be able to win a book moving on next one question two of seven i think it jumped from zero to two but that's fine let's not worry about it answer fast but most importantly answer correctly which file stored credentials to connect to the astra database securely i think you modified this file was it the palm xml or was it the application properties or was it the astra to do.java none of them what do you think eric you want to take a stab at this all right 17 people got this right we managed to trick a few people um with the other answers but but you know more or less everybody got this right okay that's cool let's look at the leaderboard all right ah looks like there's gonna be some changes muhammad hati is on top uh devan um alvaro and i believe if the strikethrough comes through you answered this wrong maybe uh akansha but you can still win it nicola samprini um you know is answer the fastest so that's really cool all right looking exciting question three of seven you still have not even half the way right and so fast but most importantly answer correctly which port did the debugger use i talked about this briefly but i think if you went you know if you followed the instructions it might have told you was it port 80 was it port 3 000 was it port 5005 or was it port 9000 times up wow some people thought it was port 80 and some people thought it was a sport 3000 so we managed to trick them again um but 12 people got 5005 okay chances are that the leaderboard is gonna be uh these 12 people but again things could change pretty quickly all right so let's see how is it looking ooh what do you think very close between muhammad hathi and aged x9 comes from nowhere all the way to the top um by the way agent x9 oh that's you okay i'm so disappointed all right question four of seven answer fast but answer correctly what maven target we did not use in this workshop hot reload quark is calling dev package clean what might it be i think we use package i think we use carcass colon dev [Music] these are some pretty specific questions unless you did the workshop it's uh and people felt right no they got it wrong that was wrong that was my bad uh i think i think uh heart reload was yeah the heart reload was the one that we did not use i i managed to fool myself because everything else was used that squawker's dev was used package was used and clean was used uh but heart reload is not an option unless you you kind of you know you can always set the maven targets you just didn't use it today okay so let's see how the leaderboard is shaped up hmm looks like mohamed hati may not have made it too bad try again next time but you could still come up you know you're very close you're six danielle was the fastest agent x9 you are no longer eligible uh don't play um and then loveside alvaro akansha nikola any of you could win it all right so let's go to the next one yeah i obviously will keep my look but it's cool you were able to do it pretty fast what is the end point we used to get quarkx related metrics and look at your phone these are slash metrics slash all or slash q slash dev what do you think looks like slash all maybe i'm just trying to miss lady and let's see i think that quite i think that question is a little misleading i don't agree with the way the question is written and can you can you say why because you're talking about metrics we never showed when you say metrics you're probably talking about jvm metrics in which case none of those answers were correct but if you're talking about the dev ui which is what we did show so i think the wording of the question was a lot all right i i beg to differ on that because slash q slash dev gives you some metrics which i didn't dig into right um the end point it depends on what you need mean by metrics uh like for example the um oh okay all right we can we can talk about this later all right but uh but good point but i i think among the three uh slash q slash dev was the closest right would you agree with me on that one well yeah that's the only end point that made makes sense for a corker's application but i still think questions thank you let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up all right puggy kishore happy and agent x9 got it wrong and that's why he's upset i'm just kidding nicola daniel mazzan keshewa any of you could still win this okay we still have a couple more questions and let's get to it as quickly as possible looks very close and so fast but most importantly answer correctly and i did talk about this in passing what container related maven plug-in did we use in the workshop i think we used a couple but but you know the other one is not here did we use a java plug-in did we use a maven plug-in or did we use a plampa game for the container related stuff yes a lot of people got jib but we did manage to confuse others right um a few but but you know again if you're paying attention or if you've gone through the exercises you would have seen this okay and to be fair uh you know maybe you didn't get to that point um but but i did talk about it during the workshop all right let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up you i think we have final question for all the marbles right i think this this leaderboard is very interesting in that you know it's it's kind of all over the place which is kind of nice uh puggy is on top kishore daniel mazzan nicola happy muhammad um davum mill any of you can still win this it's very very close all right let's go last question you guys ready all right let's hit this and so fast but answer correctly native image generation with quarkx requires what does it require vm i did not talk about this um too bad but but you know if you uh looked at the instructions we we do talk about this um and and you probably talked about it did you elliot to this uh eric i don't have the mentee if i don't see the questions so the question is image generation with carcass requests growl vm java vm and linux vm uh and i don't know if you talked about the graph vm at all so it was a little bit someone mentioned it in passing but yeah yeah so the native image just definitely requires the growl vm of course you know the java vm is for running these uh you know in a portable fashion but the native image um maybe maybe you want to talk a little bit about native image and growl vm connection now since we didn't do it earlier in the workshop yeah i mean growl vm is a it's a product or project an open source project for taking it's not just for java but taking like it works like with python and a couple other languages ruby and whatnot but taking those languages and taking the outputs of their builds so in the case of java byte code and compiling it into a native executable so in our we were running i think it was ubuntu so a linux machine so it actually removes the jvm and takes the byte code combines it with the jvm and produces a native binary but what it also does is it removes all dead code and dead code is something that at compile time like if i have a class that calls a method on another class that's statically linked but you know with java reflection i could in introspect into the the class metadata and call methods through reflection that is not a static link and therefore that code would get thrown away by the grail vm compiler so the grovium compiler very aggressively reduces not just your code but it looks at all your transitive dependencies as well and removes all pretty much all dirt cut so there's some gotchas that you know yeah and i know that uh you know everybody is patiently waiting for who's gonna be winning the five bucks and uh without further ado it's here hopefully the leaderboard [Music] is the winner so here's what you're gonna do uh if you're in the top five um so that's puggy dania nicola samprini um is it mason or hazen uh kishore um yeah so those are the top five right um so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take a screenshot uh and and and which you know i'll tell you where to um you know basically send it um you know with uh what what is the information that you require you need the uh um you know email and postal address and so on i think whatever jack you know i think that goes through jack and then jack will send it over okay and and let's go to the presentation now and i'll i'll give you a little bit more detail on how to do that okay so this was passed on paused and we are almost done with the presentation so what you're going to do is yeah i don't have that huh i did not have that i thought i had it um basically what you're going to do and i'll drop it into youtube is jack.fryer at datastax.com and i'll i'll put this in the chat in in a moment um and and you know you you take the screenshot and send it to him and it will be shipped to you with all the details okay if you if you can't find the details you know you can go back and look at some of the other recordings uh and it will be available and if you don't you know if you didn't take it uh while it was there don't worry about it again you can go back to the recording and find the screenshot right so this will provide it will give you a quark first cassandra badge um but you know there are a bunch of other badges available as well uh it's fantastic to be able to put this on linkedin as many of my colleagues say i'll turn off the music because we don't want the music anymore give me a second hopefully okay and and you know um you can put this on linkedin and and i've heard you know this is all anecdotal feedback it it even helps you to you know with your salary and your professional life and so on um it's just cool to you know kind of display this okay we have a build-a-thon going on and we have u.s uh dollars 41 000 prizes uh in worth of price some of them are gone already because you know we've completed one month uh but we still have three more months left or maybe two more months left since we finished one but how do you get more information on that you can put a exclamation hackathon in in the chat and that will give you a url on that or you can just go to buildathonhat.com okay um even if you don't win prizes uh i think i think it's really cool because uh you know it will help you kind of get your hands dirty um and and kind of play with it um this is the book the quark is for spring developers that was given out but but you know if you don't if you didn't win the print copy don't worry about it because you can download the free copy right from from the red hat site um so you know it's it's not going to be the the book that many people like but but still um i think the nice thing about this is you'll you'll get the latest edition uh you know once the editions get updated and so on so so that's kind of cool but there are other resources as well i think uh um you know some of these are listed here some of them i think eric talked about you know kind of the weekly chats especially on quarkus similarly you know with cassandra we have workshops running every week um some some as similar i mean as simple as like uh introduction to nosql uh some a little bit more like on microservices some on data modeling um so all of those are resources that you can tap into um want to talk a little bit more eric on this resources um no i think you covered it for a while it's it's a free download you know we we talk about you know a bunch of different stuff we will we do have work plans to to update it and keep it up to date the the examples github repo has been kept up to date you know obviously we can't update the print but the the examples has been kept up to date okay um serverless and caucus great combination right i think daniel oh who actually worked with me in the previous workshop uh he he he's responsible for kind of keeping this uh up to date is that right or do you want to talk a little bit about this yeah so this is the d-zone ref card thing yeah so my colleague daniel oh who's one who co-wrote one of the chapters with me in in the book um maintains this this reference card for doing serverless development on with with corkus using serverless functions so being able to take or write a serverless function once using java quarkx and deploying it to like lambda azure function google cloud function you know nate you know kubernetes knativ you know however you want to deploy it but being able to move that code into whatever runtime environment you want without having to code specific runtime environment i know there are some questions about how do i you know get the swag um don't worry about it i'll put it in the chat in a second after i'm finished with the workshop but basically um if you want to get your hands dirty there are a whole bunch of ways to get your hands dirty right this may be may not be reflective of the latest versions but but uh you know again if you if you just go to qualcus.io that's probably the best way to get started right all right with that i want to thank you all very much thanks for coming thanks for spending two hours thanks for finishing up most of the exercises um i really appreciate it i definitely want to thank red hat and eric for for being with us and and you know to be able to put on this uh workshop and go really in-depth you know into some of the carcass uh aspects um again you know it's really about the inner loop you know responsive programs plus or reactive programs plus responsive data you know it's great programs um anything you want to say in
