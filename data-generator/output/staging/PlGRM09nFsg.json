yeah thank you thomas and it looks like you have a great plans that's absolutely great so i will switch to my presentation then and yeah i have to scroll down so now you i guess can see me and i hope can hear me adobe and let's start that's five minutes already and we have a lot of things to discuss today and if so actually i won oh yeah that's it oops yeah before we start i have to ask you some questions so i will know what your experience is and how to focus which things i have to focus the most during the presentation uh to ask questions we use special website you call it mentee.com it's completely unanimous you don't have to register you don't have to login don't have to put your email or anything just go on menti.com and put the code 4972597 or just scan that qr code i have to hide myself oops so you will be able to make this to scan this qr code and i have to ask you three questions as you join mendy please don't close the um this tab because in the end of the presentation we will play a little game we have a special quiz and those who will answer my questions correctly and fast enough we'll earn some prizes sponsored by data stocks some nice cassandra t-shirts and other things and we i guess about to start easiest way to use men team is just open it on your mobile phone and we are start asking questions already that's not a quiz yet justice atoms from setup questions how much experience with apache cassandra known at all yeah sure absolutely uh yes yes yes that's a very important point so none at all or less than one year that's a perfect point and that's a very good place for you to start because well we have something cassandra is not a simple thing and you will have to learn something today and we can proceed so how much experience with nosql databases known at all less than one years one three years three five years more than five years okay so i see most of you have already experienced with no relational databases or not only sql databases let's say and of different experience but most of you have some that's already great cassandra is a nosql database but you know this nosql field is huge and therefore you have very different databases let's say in this field and my final question is what are the databases you have the most experience with you can give multiple answers there so i want to mention all of them what's that postgresql oracle mysql i don't know radius or whatever you prefer to use what's your favorites what you have the most skills oracle okay that's pretty much expected but you have some more for me okay mysql db2 postgresql radius mysql wins mongodb yes i see okay so looks like uh mysql was a leader but now postgres and radius are taking an interesting distribution so good thank you for answering my questions it helps and now we can proceed to the next now we can proceed to the presentation great so please do not close this step we will use this one to play the game play with the main twist but now let's start with important things first so intro to apache cassandra decentralized nosql database for big data let's take a look what is it how it works and why you may need that so apache cassandra is a distributed decentralized nosql database which you may run on a single node if it's your laptop or anything for a test or development environment but when we speak of cassandra usually we speak of a multiple nodes so one node size is usually capacity up to four terabytes although it depends on your strategy because some companies prefer to have smaller data per node and uh for output well that's one of the fastest databases in the world currently it's hard to say the particular for output but it's a lot a lot and thousands of thousands for transactions per second per core it's a really really fast database uh question [Music] how nodes are communicating every node communicates with every node there are no uh any kind of um paths they follow all the time exactly vice versa cassandra nodes are very smart so they know what's going on and they communicate with different clusters to communicate with their neighbors and know which one is more remote and all the time every packet goes through half of the world and delivered very slowly or maybe this note is closer located closer and works much faster it's all considerate so every note is smart and every note communicates with every note um notes together uh united in data centers or rings in the cassandra terminology ring is just a synonym to the data center and what are the main features of apache cassandra so why people prefer to use that which use cases are the best fit for it first big data rating cassandra works with tremendous amounts of data and for many companies that's like a really really really really big size so for the long time we thought what the biggest cassandra client biggest company using cassandra is apple apple was using cassandra and he's still using cassandra and moreover developing cassandra really hard and their cluster was like around 170 000 servers dedicated cassandra servers with petabytes of data now we know what uh chinese huawei uses even more than that and a lot of chinese big projects like alibaba like tencent so well-known wechat is all built on cassandra second point for us is a highest availability so as cassandra is a distributed and decentralized database there is no single point of failure and there is no master nodes or primary nodes all names or all notes are equal there is a question on zoom isn't facebook on cassandra well it's a complicated question because cassandra was developed originally in facebook and now uh facebook is uh instagram also and instagram works on cassandra completely but at this point we don't have any data on uh particularly facebook using cassandra although it comes from facebook originally now it's an apache foundation project so we will speak about availability soon and you will see how it works then geographical distribution cassandra supports multiple globally distributed the active active data centers that's one of the best features for the globally distributed companies like uber for example uber uses cassandra or more to say data stocks enterprise and it uses data centers spread over the world with ease it's a native cassandra feature when we always mention highest read write performance so ability to write or make a lot of reads per second with any amounts of data and it's vendor independent so it's an apache foundation project baked by data stocks and apple and instagram and netflix and many others but it's an apache foundation project there is no chance the things happen like happened with elastic changing their license for example so um speaking of scalability one of the most important features of a cassandra scalability there are two kinds of scalability we usually mention vertical and horizontal what's the vertical scaling vertical scaling requires one large expensive machine then your old one is not enough you replace it with a new one bigger one again and again good points it's easier to get than horizontal scaling bad sides it's expensive more expensive for horizontal casing even horizontal scaling in most of the use cases and there is still single point of failure you still have one node bigger node one master node let's say horizontal scalability requires multiple less expensive commodity commodity servers so we scale out not using the bigger one bigger server but multiple same size servers it's cheaper in the most of a cases it removes single point of failure problem it's logistically harder good news uh in the most case in the most of the cases it's cassandra takes care of it so you don't have to think of anything like i'm going to have not five notes but 12 notes now what's i what i have to do your job is to add more note and tell cassandra that's your new notes please reallocate data cassandra will do it automatically you don't have to reconfigure clients still clients will contact to the first node ask for the shema ask for the cluster shaman and then they will contact the nodes which is closest to them or replica nodes those stores data cassandra scales horizontally that's clear but there is also one big point cassandra scales linearly one of the best features for me is a cassandra linear scaling that means what more node you add very zero to very low overhead on adding new nodes and then you add more nodes you have higher capacity or higher for output or actually usually both and that works perfectly fine in this case i hide competitors for on purpose as an engineer i can set up every database to be quick or to be slow my point here is not to say what cassandra is faster than another database name although mostly probably it is my point is the linear scaling here more node you have higher capacity you have and there is zero overhead on adding more nodes that's not only our opinion but that was a really nice research done by netflix engineers who scaled cassandra up under persistent testing on them right node count write read count scaling from 45 notes up to 300 nodes and you see this really nice smooth line that's exactly how it works because cassandra scales linearly if you want to read details about this research it was done by netflix and publish it at netflixtechblog.com at um well blah blah blah i will send you a link in the end okay i guess it's too long to try to copy paste it or try to type it right now okay cassandra scales linearly what's next cassand data is distributed it means when we work with a database like mysql postgresql you have all your data on a single node and if you want to have more nodes you may have one primary node some secondary nodes or and if you want to have master master active replication then it means you are deep in troubles because it's not easy to organize what's the problem here at some point you are getting more and more data at some point you are getting too much data and then you have to go sharding sharding is painful and if you ever did sharding with relational databases before you know how much trouble problems it brings i did and i know so cassandra is big data already it means what it already to support any amounts of data and that's done based on the partitions on the right side we have an example it's a table of country city population of the city very simple table how many citizens per city we have per city per country and we have to spread this data distribute this data over the cluster to do so we need a partition key so column which will split data into the partitions in this simple scenario we have only one partition column partition key in more advanced scenarios you may have multiple partition keys per table i will show it to you a little bit later so when we spread data data is united to the is spread to the partitions based on the partition key value so for example all the account all the cities of the united states will go to the same partition all the cities of france will go to another partition but the same for one partition so we store together what we retrieve together and of course every node can store more than one partition of course so in this case for example we have two partitions in one node it's completely fine actually every node stores a lot of different partitions how partitioning work it's very easy first you dedicate one or more columns to be partition keys and then using murmur free partitioner the values of those uh values of this column will be converted into numbers or tokens the official name is token every node in the cluster is responsible for the token range so a range of tokens and therefore every node will receive and store partitions with the matching token and that's a very simple idea here so data is distributed but that's not the only thing data also is replicated what does that mean it mean what every partition is stored as many times as you arrange this uh to be stored using replicate replication factor recommended value of replication factor is free per data center because you may have multiple data centers and you may have different replication factors per different data centers from zero and to as much as you need but we recommend to have three or five usually so replication factor three means whatever in row is store every partition better to say is store it on three different nodes the idea is very simple every node when responsible for the partitions of three different token ranges replication within the ring works very simply then you for example store some data you have this data and you store you add a new city for example i'm located in the city otterberg it's a small town in germany so i want to insert the data therefore my deity will be um country germany city otterberg value around 5000. let's say this value germany is being hashed into the number 59 it's really not but for example it will be fine then the uh every note in the cluster is ready to answer every question and the data comes to a wrong node it can happen because for any reason a driver for example was not able to contact a replica node not responsible for this data and then it contacts the closest the node so this for let's say number 17 or number one as we have here six nodes this node knows which nodes are replica nodes for this piece of data and redirect the query to the nodes responsible for this set in this case our node this node is called coordinator node because it processes or coordinates the query and that's important to understand every node is um every node as a coordinator node if this node would receive the query this one would be then coordinator node and so on so then uh then this note as it knows which one is responsible then it sends the proper queries to the nodes responsible for this data as soon as they receive this data they confirm there what it's received and it's all set how it works then very easy if anything goes wrong and one of the node cannot receive the data then coordinator node stores so called hinted handoff and as soon as the replica node will recover it will ask neighbors like okay guys sorry i was down what happened as i was down and a coordinator sends storage hinted handoff to the replica note and everyone is happy that's the first layer of defense as we've uh distributed databases and with replicated data we have to uh keep their consistency up with all the nodes well then we need to have a lot of self-defense layers to keep data delivered to overnote and cassandra has a lot of them this one hinted handoffs is just the first one so some of you already may know something and think something about that okay you have replicated your data and now you got into the troubles that's like the this very very simple idea i had a problem i decided to solve if solve it with multi-threading and now i have two problems so when you decide to replicate your data you may get higher availability but you also get the consistency problem it's all well described in cap theorem or brewers eric brewer's theorem which states in a distributed environment in the failure scenario out of three features out of three qualities consistency availability and partition tolerance at any bad moment when you have problems you have to choose and you can have only two of them that's um very easy then everything works and network is good and everything is great then you can have all of them at once but when something goes wrong servers are down network's network is lagging when you have to decide what do you want to have main thing you don't want your database to be not partition tolerant if your database distributed database is not partition tolerant obviously after the first partitioning network partitioning you will be not able to use it anymore then availability means what in any moment of the time you get answer and consistency means what in any moment of the time you get the most up-to-date value if something changes and in any moment we have to decide if you want to be here available and partition tolerant or if you want to be here consistent and partition tolerant that's just like a law of physics you cannot change it but let me show you how we can handle that with cassandra because well we want our data to be available and consistent and partition tolerant all at once how do we get that so some people say cassandra is available and partition tolerant but not consistent or eventually consistent personally i don't agree with that for a very simple reason cassandra is configurably consistent and in any moment of a time you can specify which particular consistency level you want to have right now idea is very simple executing um select or insert statement whatever so you want to do query your data update your data you can specify consistent level you want to have id is very simple that's so that's configurable default consistency level is quorum but you may also have any one two three quorum all what does that mean any means what then you write your data for example as soon as it reaches any node you don't care if it's a replica node or coordinator node as soon as it gets your data you receive a confirmation it's the fastest way but it may be not reliable because if this note what got the request is a coordinator not replica then and something bad happens afterwards immediately in the same moment then your data will not be for real storage if you bring your data if you bring this node back when okay it will send hinted handoffs to all the other nodes it will replay the log and you will get your data but if this node is going forever your data is going forever so any in in the most of a case not recommended consistency level one two three it means amount of the confirmations you need from replica nodes nodes responsible for your data amount of confirmations you need before you proceed then quorum means the majority of replicant nodes for example if you create uh it all with replication factor free majority will be two if you created verification factor five majority will be free if you create with replication factor two majority will be try to guess and actually that's that's interesting try to guess what will be the majority what will be the forum for replication factor two no not one it's still two because out of two 51 percent round up will be true that's why we recommend to use numbers like three or five not two or four because yeah because for uh four nodes for replication for replica majority still will be free but it will be same for five nodes for example so you can afford losing more nodes still keeping your data available so if you have consistency level quorum and if you have three nodes and one is down you query your data two nodes majority is up you'll get your data yep and uh let's take a look at that uh um stop stop stop cassandra is a multi-dc multi-data center system so there are three more data three more consistency levels you have to understand local one local quorum and each quorum so take a look if your application runs in the united states australia and europe and your data is located in the data centers in the united states and australia and europe you want your for your european clients work with your european application and european data center correct of course it makes no sense for them to work with the australian data center so local means what uvs uplink for this particular instance of your application this particular data center will be considered as the closest one then you start up an application you can specify which data center is the closest one and therefore it will prefer to use with this data center obviously and then local one means what you will wait for the confirmation from one replica node out of this local data center your data will be automatically spread over the world but if you are going to wait for each quorum obviously it will wait for a you will have to wait for the quorum in every data center you have and if you have free data centers you will wait overall for all of them even for the most remote so each quorum is a good choice when you work with highly important data but it also can be the slowest way in the local quorum you will wait for the confirmation only of a quorum of replica nodes of the closest data center so with consistency level one as i said it's very simple when data comes uh it's being distributed to all the replica nodes and you wait for only for one out of all uh replicas confirmation as soon as you get the first one confirmation is immediately returned to a client we are all good we got your data your data will be stored everywhere but we wait only for one confirmation of course it's asynchronous process which is a very fast so i see there is a question from felipe i will answer this one after my workshop again well then yeah and that's an example of consistency level one replication factor three uh if uh consistency level quorum replication factor free we will wait for the majority of the confirmations what makes two for replication factor free and for consistency level all we will wait for all replica nodes to confirm they got the data but there is a problem because cep theorem is still here watching you always watching you waiting you to make the mistake and the moment you send consists you set consistency level all what happens let me scroll back and remind you this slide what happens when we set consistency level all very easy we migrate from availability and partition toll around to full consistency and partition tolerance that means as long as a single note cannot answer your question boom you got an exception sorry desired consistency level cannot be reached one of your notes is unavailable or down oops so that's a very important point cassandra is configurably consistent and that's a configuration per query that's what i really want to highlight the same application may work with highly important data you don't want your bank to make to run your transactions in a not consistent or consistent way yes but there are also many applications working with let's say secondary importance data which you find if you are getting outdated for example if your friend of yours at facebook change it to his or her profile picture and the same second you open like half second later you open his or her page and you got the old picture will you survive that well i think i will and that's perfectly fine so within the same application depending on the importance of your data you can specify different levels of the consistency and now here comes one very nice trick if consistency level all is very bad for us doesn't matter how many nodes we have even if we have replication factor five and we lose one node we can't retrieve our data anymore do you call that high availability i don't with consistency level quorum i can reach i can lose two nodes out of five and still get my query well when you have two nodes of two servers out of your five servers down that's pretty bad situation but even under west circumstances your cassandra may work so what are the solution here are there any better ideas there is a thing called immediate consistency and immediate consistency is a great concept basically we want to have our data available but if we require consistency level all when we got into this trap of a single failed node brings us to a problem how do we get into the middle of these cap circles because well we want to be there immediate level immediate consistency is the best way to get them so when i write data i specify consistency level quorum that means what i wait for at least two confirmations in good scenario three nodes will get the data in the bat scenario two nodes will get the data at least or if i have somehow two out of three nodes not available i at least will be informed what operation is not possible okay that's fine i know what uh data is still consistent i know what problem happened i can work with so i wait for two confirmations good when i'm trying to read for the data with consistency level quorum and client tries to read and there are two options in the bed scenario query first answers can be delivered from there to up to date notes well then answer is delivered immediately and that's a correct answer but what happens if my read query first to answer it notes one was updated and stores the correct data and one wasn't updated and stores outdated information what happens then idea is very simple here comes the second defense layer of a cassandra call it repair on read if during the read operation cassandra notices what two different nodes or three or five different nodes returns different values it will automatically execute repair and recover the system to a consistent state and will return most up-to-date data to the client and you will if you don't read logs if you don't have monitoring configured you will never even learn about that because it's fully automated so here comes repair on read there are still more layers of inconsistency defense or consistency defense better to say but that's how it works that all about simple idea a simple mathematical idea with immediate consistency if your consistency level of right plus consistency level read higher than your replication factor you get immediate consistency immediately so very very simple we have replication factor 3 and we have consistency level write quorum which means two and consistency level read quorum which means two two plus two is uh bigger than three we have immediate consistency there is no possibility to get outdated uh information that's not the only way because for example if you make consistency level write all equals three and consistency level read uh equals one so three plus one four is still bigger than replication factor that makes your reads very very fast because you don't wait for confirmation at all you get uh only one uh answer and immediately process that it's the fastest way but uh then you have danger on the right time because well of the cep theorem you write with a consistency level all one note is not available you cannot write that's not the most common scenario although people are using that for example i know one company having two different data centers one for processing of real data let's say for customers and one for analytics so where we are distributing their workload they were moving data from one to another with consistency level of write all once per day in the morning and then during all the day we did not more write operations for analytics in the analytics data center only read in this case we could use consistency level read one and get all the data very quickly and still have immediate consistency and vice versa you can have consistency level right one and consistency level read all uh have consistency level overall four higher than three and have immediate consistency but that's obviously not the most recommended scenario definitely default consistency level is quorum if you don't change it it will be quorum it means you always have immediate consistency so people say cassandra is eventually consistent i don't like this that's not perfectly correct cassandra is configurably consistent and you decide which level of a consistency for which kind of data you want because it's per data because it's perk query setting next thing data is distributed everywhere so geographic distribution you can have multiple data centers at same but also it's a platform agnostic so you can run it in microsoft azure aws google cloud and your own on-premises data center at the same moment of the time and those different data centers will still build the single cluster working together in this case if you have configured it all correctly you may afford losing a wall data center still getting your data data back so speaking of the use cases what are the typical use cases for cassandra everything what relates to scalability and highest workload high for output or high volume heavy rights heavy reads everything what relates to very intensive operations and thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of operations per second that's a perfect case for cassandra availability the same for any kind of a mission critical workload you've seen with replication factor free you can afford losing a server with replication factor 5 you can afford losing 2 servers and still be available per data center or maybe even more if you have more data centers no data loss always on for any kind of data you may want to have it's there then next thing we mentioned it's distributed for any kind of a global presence and workload mobility you may have your data everywhere at the same moment of a time active active and you don't have to take care of that because it's a cassandra job to replicate your data and but we also speak about a compliance in a gdpr you can set a replication factor and pair data center you will see it in a moment and therefore for some of the data centers kind of a replication factor can be zero it's perfectly fine and then you are good if you you don't want to store data of your european clients into the united states data center that's perfectly fine and everything what relates to global companies having clients everywhere and next thing and last thing is a cl everything what relates to cloud native and modern cloud applications cassandra perfectly works in the distributed networking environment cassandra perfectly works in the case of a multicloud and hybrid cloud have mechanisms of self-recovery and able to support um hybrid cloud multi-cloud at once okay so as few words about uh the structure of the data in cassandra it's a table based white column based and table based database it's not uh which is shemales you still have shemas here so simple the basic unit the smallest unit of the data is a cell intersection of a row and a column with a data inside then row is a structured single data item in a table id first name last name department then something new comes what i've mentioned it before and i want to mention again data structure partition it's a group of rows having the same partition token and that's a base unit of access in cassandra that's very important to understand when you work with a normal traditional relational database you have database when you have table when you have rows you don't think of anything else well as as long as you don't have charts then the cassandra you have key space so container for tables then you have table when you have partition when you have rows and that's very important to understand and when we have a table which consists of partitions based on columns so overall data structure is a key space having tables and table having partitions viv columns within example data here is users organized by city so in this case i partition my users based on the city they lucky they allocated in and that's not the best strategy i will explain you why but it will work at first at least and we have partitions and partition key columns defining those partitions when we have clustering columns i explain in a minute and finally i have data columns and well it all consists of rows in the end when i create the key space key space is the first thing we start to play with key space consists of a very simple set of properties first one is going to need the name pretty much expected and it may have a lot of different configurations but one is really important for us is um replication strategy so what's the replication strategy is um that's their [Music] how to say strategy which will define the data allocation within your cluster and there are only two strategies simple strategy and network topology strategy simple strategy is good for your laptop and bad for everything else it's very simple it's only for your own development scenario let's say network topology strategy as it states it's a network topology availa strategy what does that mean idea is very simple we're working with your data center you have servers servers are into the racks and racks are into the data center so you may have two data centers for example but still there will be some racks and still there will be some servers if you work with a cloud you may have very for not servers and racks but you will have some nodes and you will have availability zones in this case cassandra considers availability zones as rex why does that matter because by default cassandra tries to distribute your data in the day what replicas will be not stored together very simple idea if you have multiple racks and you have some servers in a single rack they tend to fail together because of a network or power outage so cassandra tries to put repartitions of your data replicas on your data into multiple different tracks or availability zones absolutely automatically you don't have to take care of that again to reach the maximum possible availability of your data and then finally for the network topology strategy we define replication factor by data center united states west one i want to have free replica application factor free for the europe central one i want to have replication factor five that's pretty simple and then uh you may have i may have three data centers i don't mention this one here it means what my data my key space user will not be allocated to the data center number three whatever if whatever it is asia central one again doesn't matter then i create a table i have to allocate some values here again table creation is a very simple create table key space users by city so users partitioned by city viv city text last name text first name text address text email text okay too much texts for me but it's fine and when i define primary key primary key consists of two parts partition key and clustering columns clustering columns are optional partition key is required without partition key i cannot partition data and therefore i cannot store data because i don't know which server to use to store it what's that job of the primary key primary key job is a very simple idea it's must be unique identifier for a row for example if i build my uh primary key to be like that city partition key last name first name as clustering columns therefore primary key of every row will consist of a city last name first name what's wrong with this scenario well i have a lot of john smiths in new york actually i did a little check that's about like a couple of dozens of them uh so basically cassandra uses absurd which may be familiar to you and therefore uh every next john smith will override data of a previous john smith and he will not be happy very simple how do i solve this problem i add one more value to the primary key so this one is the example on the same data city last name first name email in this case i don't need email per se in the primary key but i needed to ensure uniqueness because amount of john smith's in new york with the same email isn't going to be too high another option would be if i just store the list of users without partitioning by city my primary key may be user id as long as a user id is unique i will have as much partitions as i have users and that's perfectly fine number of partitions it's not a problem so you may have one partition per one row in the table and that's perfectly fine the main job of a primary key is to ensure uniqueness then partition key partition key we discuss it a lot already partition key is an identifier for a partition it consists of at least one column might have more if you need that so essay a typical idea primary key user id i will be able to query my users if i know their user id or primary key video id and comment id given we are storing comments for videos and the youtube so we have youtube we have videos we have comments i may store comments like that i will spread them into the partitions by video id and that's a good idea store together what you retrieve together all the rows with the same partition id will be stored together and will be retrieved together it's easy for them to retrieve i have to ask one particular node not try to combine them from multiple different nodes so that's a simple idea that example from iot we will discuss in details later so i will not discover it for now give me a moment and finally clustering columns they are used as you know already in the primary key to ensure uniqueness but they have a second job which is they define sorting order so partition key has only two oh sorry clustering column has two jobs they needed to ensure uniqueness and sorting order if you need sorting order so as said our problem here primary key city last name first name as long as soon as we got the second person with the same name in the same city we have troubles so we solve that city last name first name email problem is solid but also second scenario video id comment id it will work they are unique enough but they are not sorted in this case and if you want our comments when you open youtube video you want to see the latest comments first well mostly probably you don't want to see any comments at all because they are mostly but still we have to show latest comments first so in this case we are using video created at and comment id create a ted isn't required for uniqueness it's required for sorting order now we are getting to the end of this presentation and i just have few last slides but those slides are the most important they even have a slight of a year award i created them and they they were so great so i decided to give them this award so that's an award from me to my own slides that's a little bit selfish but they they're really really really important rules of a good partition store together what you retrieve together open a video get all the comments with a single query to a single server then you have them stored by video id i don't store my comments for video based on their commentating because take a look if i don't specify partition key in my select statement what would happen next cassandra doesn't know which note to ask if you have three notes on your production cluster it's acceptable if you have three hundreds three thousands three dozens thousands notes you are literally going to ask every note do you maybe have a comment for the video number 15 16 it will take ages so let's call it full cluster scan our idea is to always avoid full cluster scan and therefore always specify partition key it's very important second rule of a good partition avoid big partitions so in this case we have video id created add and comment id comments will be partitioned by video id and you know what there can be really a lot of the comments per video which kind of looks like a violation of this rule but it isn't really because what really matters is the size of a partition i mean like physical sites megabytes kilobytes and so on and they can be really a lot of the comments but they are just a user id video id created ad and text so just some minor sizes they will never be too big as they are but the general idea is up to 2 billion cells per partition the general recommendation up to 100 thousand rows in a partition that's not a street limit you can have more if your rows are small it's fine up to 100 megabytes in a partition again you can have more but it's not recommended two billion cell is a hard limit and uh what's wrong with this example country user id idea is very simple you will have some countries are like um i don't know give me example give me an example of a small country like in europe we have a lot of them something like san marino san marino you are going to have like or vatican how many people yeah luxembourg how many people live in luxembourg how many people live in vatican those are going to be pretty small and meanwhile imagine india or china and there's going to be two imagine you have san marino in china it's going to be two partitions with 20 people in one and much more very different number in another one so what's your point try to partition your data to be reasonably big not too big then there is a trap so um i told you there is a problem with this example let's take a look that's a real example from one of our clients a huge telecommunication company with a lot of infrastructure all over the world imagine network of sensors reporting their state all the time every report is very simple sensor id universal unique id type stamp so when it happened and value what's the value of the sensor it can be temperature it can be humidity it can be network for output at the moment and so on and every of them report their state every 10 seconds and you have billions of them and at first there go that's a real example as i say a first pivot table like that sensor id is a partition key reported at as the clustering column to have them sorted and unique please try to guess what was the problem and when it happened the key word is when actually it would be great if you could answer that in zoom chat okay navin kumaran i see your question on the youtube chat i will answer uh after the main part of the workshop will be done the presentation will be done so after two billion sensor values well well well well well yes yes yes yes yes uh so the main idea here uh then then like two sensors report different values at the same time no it's not a problem because different sensors will have different sensors id the problem in this case is what those partitions are always growing and growing and growing in the beginning it will work fine but after some months as we report data every few seconds all the partitions will be just too big and it will be hard for cassandra to handle them to address this problem we introduce a new solution called bucketing as i've mentioned it before partition key may consists of multiple columns values in this case we are adding one more scientifical column called month year and that's just an integer or a string that doesn't matter that's a scientifical thing to organize bucketing now we have february of year 2021 therefore our month year is going to be zero two to zero to one february of 2021 on next month is going to be zero free to zero to one when we add this month here to a partition key we have very four partition key consisting of the two values sensor id and month of a year combine it together we will give different partition token and therefore data will be allocated differently as soon as month is over you will start to write to a new partition and your partitions will be never too big that's very easy now i know what usually a lot of people on this example ask but why can't i use just date so 9th of february of 2021 why answer is very simple you can and it will work and it's not bad but it brings one more problem to solve take a look when you query data you must always specify full partition key no inequalities so in this case if i have to query data for today with a date it will be easy i give sensor id and today and i get my data it's fine but if i have to query data for a month for two months for three months no inequalities i have to say okay get and give me data for sensor number 12 for today and yesterday and day before yesterday and day before before yesterday and so on and so on and so on um i see a question in the chat there will be too many partitions and there would be just date no it's not a problem you may have as many partitions as you want that's not a problem you can afford having billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of partitions but when we have these day sized partitions if you have to retrieve data for multiple days we have therefore to specify all of those dates in our select statement it ain't going to be convenient now if i have to query data with this example sensor id month here if i go into query data for all the days in uh year 2021 i have to do select from where sensor id number 12 and month year is january of 2021 or february of 2021 pretty easy and i will get this data how about sensor id month year reported that yes it should work as well uh it should work as well so i don't see any problems using month year as uh part separate part of a partition key it should work as well it just from my point of view makes your select statement a little bit more um but yes it will work it should be it's pretty good solution okay so we are out of time and we still have a quiz to run so i'm getting to the end of the slides finally avoid hot partitions as said before with example of country and user id in some countries you have like 100 people and some countries you have very very different numbers uh if you spread your customers based on their country and you start to sell your goods in china and you are successful there congratulations but now you are deep in  with this data model at least so this scenario with primary key video id of a partition key so that's a video and comments to video on youtube is it a good or bad example that's acceptable because take a look we of course every video have different rate of comments per moment of time yes so just release that video of i don't know whoever beyond may get more comments than whatever other video we talk about but again as they have a lot of videos those videos have different ideas they will be spreaded over multiple servers so you will not get a situation when one server is busy others are idling that's what important to avoid if you have doesn't matter if you have 1000 server cluster and you have replication factor free and one partition is hot and others are idling you will have three servers overloaded and others are idling and your data model is not efficient very simple so we made it to the end and now it's time to play a game and after that i will be able to answer your questions okay oops wrong side yeah perfect so let me start hey there yes so quiz time i'm waiting for players before we start and we have some questions and we want to answer who answers the quickest and correct way you will get top three places actually top three places are getting prizes and of course to say many things to the organizers we have something special for them as well but you still have to participate that's a lot of fun in the competition you know good so i see 13 people that makes everyone is able to win because we don't have too many people today 14 okay give me one more and we start give me 15 people in the competition so every 5th will win 13. okay okay 15. yeah we are here so we can start so answer fast to get more points how many masternodes does cassandra require at least three known cassandra is a masterless system enough to maintain consistency free per data center and time is up and let me see your answers and correct answer is cassandra is a master less system there are no master notes there are no sarah slave notes it's every note is equal every note is a replica note and every note is a coordinator note all of them have the same duties they are responsible for the different ranges of data that's correct but all of them have the same duties there are no master nodes in cassandra so we have a lot of questions today so you still have the chances let me see the answers and ribeiro was the fastest one congratulations and we have hoblin on the second place and oh i'm sorry uh grzegorz on the third one i hope i pronounced it right sorry if i'm wrong and we have some competition here so there is a question too and answer fast to get more points in cassandra how is data distributed partitions data is copied to every node address locators through a mail that's a good question so how is data distributed or based on what data is distributed i would say time is up and the correct answer is partitions take a look uh data is copied to every note two people answer gave this answer it means i'm going to be fired tomorrow because everyone should have answered partitions if you have data copied to every note and you work with a dozens petabytes like apple does using cassandra it's going to be like too much expensive even for them to store all of the data data is distributed based on the partitions not to every node yeah and the leaderboard uh freebear or double your ribeiro uh gave the right answer but too slow and grzegorz gets to the first place great job that's amazing then with only five points difference that's a couple of micro seconds hobling is getting second place like last hold and w ribeiro or verbero i'm sorry is on the third place and that's a really good result because first three places are getting prizes and when we have mike rahul jangra with the fastest answer nicolaus and tommy and there are some more people getting closer and closer to the winners let's see how it goes in the next questions question number three answer fast to get more points how do you scale up a cassandra database faster hardware increase the scale factor add more nodes stack nodes until they reach the desired height yeah i see uh i'm very happy i did my best time is up and the correct answer is add more notes and add faster hardware it's a vertical scaling and cassandra prefers horizontal scaling so what are the changes we are going to have none of the leaders made a mistake but there are some changes based on the fastest answers and ribera gets to the first place that's great then hoblin is on the second still holding the second like that's a stability sign of a success and gregors gets to the third one again but we know how easy it can change rahul jangra is on the fourth getting ready to jump in to the third place like so stay ready there are some more changes coming in and next question answer fast to get more points what is the recommended replication factor 7 3 forty two one who needs more than one note so this one must be easy this one must be easy i guess three two one time is up and the correct answer is free recommended replication factor is free so you can afford losing one note completely and still will be able to answer to any question with consistency level quorum which is recommended you can also have five which is also a good number but usually we don't recommend go higher okay so this one was simple what okay okay that was unexpected riberu makes a mistake snoop um was the fastest one getting into the top six of the participants that's a very nice result in the middle of the piece hoblin gets to this first place how could you you should have stayed in the second one like what about the stability but okay okay gosh gets to the second one and rahul takes his chance and gets to a third place and that's great ladies and gentlemen okay so next question answer fast to get more points a cassandra database can be deployed on aws only any combination of on-premise and cloud provider only one of the following on premise aws azure or gcp can be deployed on a live raft in the case of emergency now i'm all curious on the answers yo not a single doubt any combination of on-premise and cloud provider and still be the same cluster it's completely platform agnostic and who was the fastest wheeze time who gets the label fastest who is here okay mr zedd was the fastest one getting to the seventh place grizz on the first hobbling on the second okay and rahul jangra holds the third one very good job but stay aware over the nikolaus very very close to you well then question number six answer fast to get more points the cap theorem states what in a failure scenario with a distributed system consistency availability and partition tolerance are all achieved only availability is achieved only two of the three guarantees are achieved i should probably buy a new cap so i hope this one will be harder it was too easy to you at least for most of you yes cp theorem states what in a failure scenario with a distributed system only two out of three qualities can be achieved or partition tolerance and high availability or partition tolerance and consistency that's why we make a decision and there are three people answer it what consistency availability and partition tolerance are all achieved i want to ask you uh that's the land of unicorns and rainbows could you please send me a ticket to your land i want to live in the land they see if the theorem works this way i really want to leave them so who was the fastest and who made a mistake oh my god rahul it was such a nice attempt but i guess now it's yes go to the seventh place i'm sorry so grzegorz gets to the first one hoblin is on the second and nicolaus uses the mistake of rahul and gets to the third well well well well and we are getting closer to the end answer fast to get more points the recommended way to achieve immediate consistency is to use read write one one read write one all read write quorum quorum or with a video chat between coworkers it's gonna be pretty interesting on the high lot operations i would love to see that in action but the correct answer is simple quorum quorum with read write one all you do reach immediate consistency but it's not the recommended way because recommended way as i stated before quorum quorum so let's take a look at the results does any one of the leaders made a mist oh that's unbelievable take a look such a competition till the end so nicolaus makes a mistake and mike jumps to the third place and snoop um is on the fourth already with again fastest answer that's great so we still have competition in the leaders list but on the first place we have grzegorz and hoblin and mike in the top three okay and take a look rahul is not so far away so there is still a competition and everyone has a chance to win few last questions ladies and gentlemen answer fast to get more points a key space key space what is a key space is organized into rows and columns contains tables and sets replication is the base unit of access is a place to store extra house keys what would you answer okay so key space contains tables and set replication key space is not the base unit of access it's a partition and key space is not organized into rows and columns because key space contains tables that's the correct answer so let me see the results oh my god i can't believe i can't believe on my memory this squeeze is like the one that tends to change all the time grzegorz kills the first place and mike gets to the second and hoblin is on the third and emersed was the fastest one getting the fourth place and take a look there is a familiar name with 571 point call it ribeiro welcome back to the top we aren't done yet but you have all the chances to get in question 9 answer fast to get more points in cassandra tables which are required data columns clustering columns partition keys that makes me very curious if it was like patient enough to get my answer here was it good enough was my explanation good enough for you to get that time is up require it partition keys clustering columns are optional and let me see the people who answer it correctly does any of okay okay okay that's not expected it looks like there are some changes again so greg grzegorz was the fastest one holding the first place very strong hoblin on the second and third is for mike and emersyd is very close to that and snoopum is on the fifth let's take a look how it goes then like you people make me nervous and we are in the end of the quiz answer fast to get more points in cassandra tables hold many partitions only rows and columns replication factors endless sea of hopes and dreams what would be your answer here i can't wait to see that's very very very very interesting correct answer is partitions correct answer in partition that's not a relational database you use it to use chema table rows no partitions think of the partitions it's very important okay and i want to see the results after this one oh my god i can't believe that happened okay grzegorz despite the wrong answer gets to the first place mrz gets to the second one with the fastest answer ever and hoblin holds the third one with jersey balwinski uh very very very close with 600 points difference it's not a simple to jump over 600 points but it's possible it happened before that brings us to the last question of this quiz take time breath in breath out warm up your fingers prepare as we are starting the last question and three winners will get the prizes answer first how does cassandra perform joints cassandra joints require a join table just like sql joins cassandra does not support joins cassandra only joins clubs this one is very very very obvious this one is very simple cassandra does not support joints that's the price what comes when you work with a petabytes over thousands of nodes there are no joints and the correct answer is no joints and that brings grzegorz to a second mistake in a row and basically wipes out the first half oh my god that's incredible i love you that's such a competition this time hoblin congratulations you got to first place in the end and emersed on emmert i don't know uh with 8538 points get to the second one and gregor holds the top three that's enough to get the price all the prices are the same so it doesn't matter if you are top one top two or top three if you didn't make it to the top three don't be too sad about that because what's the most important is your knowledge your skills today you learn it one of the most powerful databases in the world so you learn it a lot of very important things in the final end that makes you better expert and raises your salary because cassandra is used on the biggest companies over the world it definitely may help you to secure a higher money in your pocket in the end so that's the acknowledge knowledge is prices that's what really matters to the winners please write to me i will send you an you know what i will send you a link actually to my linkedin that's my linkedin please we spent one hour together actually even more almost one and a half uh sorry for that and we did so many things together so now we are like colleagues so please add me on linkedin it's always great to make new friends and for the top three send me your email t-shirt size and post address so we will send you the prizes if you by any reason don't use linkedin so here is my alex smith at datastox.com that's my email and therefore you can use this one to get your price and oops let me send it a twitter well i have oops i have twitter but i don't use it too much good and basically that's it so uh that was intro to cassandra with alex volchniv developer advocate at data stocks we have some recommendations for you how to get more learning uh in apache cassandra field it's all free and available at datastax.com or at the data stocks academy and uh the most important announcement here tomorrow we have a very special workshop coming in uh the factory that's a very important thing in cassandra to create an official data model and i want to recommend you a free workshop happening tomorrow evening and the day after tomorrow morning call it uh advanced data modelling there is a great guy called artem chabotko a doctor atom chabot he is a creator of the data modeling framework for apache cassandra and i highly recommend you to attend this workshop uh to meet me again and to meet mr chibotko to learn from them from him and well a little bit from me as well how do you design successful data models for highly loaded applications it's free and i guess for this one you can get a special price peach is yes um for this workshop we spread a special voucher what allows you to pass cassandra certification and become a certified developer or administrator for free like literally paying nothing we have free courses and now we sponsor certification so you don't have to pay a cent that's great i love it and we are done so tomas i guess i handle that to you thank you yeah i love this one yep [Laughter] thank you a great big pleasure to me uh one side of my job i'm organizing cassandra days globally currently i'm working on cassandra day russia cassandra de italy cassandra de france and i guess maybe a couple of months later we have to talk about cassandra de poland as well yeah i know how to find you as soon as i will have as i will have a moment i will reach you thank you all",
