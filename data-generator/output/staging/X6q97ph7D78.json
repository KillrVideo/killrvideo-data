    "text": "all right well hello everyone I I think we're live here um so so yeah I'd like to welcome you all to this uh short live session on a building applications on eks and Cassandra um I'm Erin from data stacks and uh I'll be taking you through the material today uh so hopefully um you know if you if there's a lot of you out there who um are running your you know your own Cassandra you know self-manage maybe have it in the cloud um you know you can absolutely use you know some of the things I'm going to show you today to um you know kind of kind of help you build out further in the cloud um into you know with your application layer that uh that'll talk to either you know Cassandra dsse or whatever you happened to be running all right let's go here so real quick um it's just going to look like this we're going to be I wonder if I can no no I can't move my my picture around that's okay um anyway so it it uh you know we're going to go through quick intro uh talk a little bit about the the architecture or stack that we're going to uh going to use today um we're going to talk a little bit about the data API and for those of you who have used Cassandra and DSE before and maybe you've used it for a while you're probably used to connecting via cql well the data API is this cool new thing that um you know really kind of simplifies the process um and then finally I'm going to take us through a a quick demo of um building out a Java application and putting that Java application out there in um in AWS right along with my my cluster so all right and hopefully it'll all work I I was just telling I was just telling Michelle that I went totally scorched Earth on everything I built so this is all being rebuilt from notes so you can you can see it happen live so this should be really cool if it works all right so real quick definition of terms um so we throw a lot of abbreviations around there of um you know especially with some Amazon Services um like eks for elastic kubernetes service um not to be confused with ECS uh elastic container service which is Amazon service that um you know if you don't need full-blown kubernetes it's a way to run a containerized application uh out on out in your Amazon Cloud um and of course if you want to um to run a container image out there you need to have that container image in a container registry which is where Amazon ECR or elastic container registry comes into play so those are three definitions that we'll be thrown around a bit today so EK eks is you know elastic kubernetes ECS is elastic container service and ECR is the container registry all right just so we're all clear on that so real quick about the architecture one thing that we've been focusing on a lot lately with uh self-managed Cassandra out in AWS is that um you know we we have this notion of um data Stacks mission control which is our our product that you know helps abstract away kubernetes it puts kubernetes on easy mode you know where it really really helps really really helps you out so it um it runs on top of Amazon eks um and then inside of Mission Control we can decide hey you know maybe I want to deploy a Cassandra cluster maybe I want to deploy a data sax Enterprise cluster maybe I even want to deploy that new hyperon converg database or an hcd cluster um you can do all that really easily and seamlessly with uh data Stacks Mission Control uh the additional piece that we're adding in today though is that hey so I've got my cluster out there how do I do something with it how do I how do I build an application that talks to my uh data sax Enterprise or Cassandra cluster well that is actually going to be stood up on Amazon ECS um so you know again just so we have a you know clear view of the uh of the stack and of the architecture um this is kind of going to be our goal for today all right I've talked a little bit about the data API oh man my picture is really in a bad spot there let me just kill that for a second can I do that no I can't do that oh I can hey hot no don't do that can I say no that's that's actually somewhat better let's let's stick with that for a little bit here sorry we have a new we have a new streaming tool that I've never gone live with before so we're kind of learning as we go anyway so data API when you deploy a uh Enterprise grade data STX cluster with it so dsse 6.9 or hcd 1.0 you automatically get a pod deployed for the data API um so that's actually really cool is that is that when you go ahead and you build out one of those clusters you don't have to worry about standing up the data API in in addition to it it's just kind of there so really easy to use now again I mentioned that you know for those of you who have used you know Enterprise grade Cassandra or regular Apache Cassandra before for a while you're probably used to connecting uh to the cql binary protocol and using Drive that are designed to uh you know use that uh that uh protocol as well and that's on Port 9042 well this one the data API connects on Port 8181 so this is just a little bit of a reminder that you do need to expose that Port um you know for the data API as well just to make sure that you're you're able to connect on it now shifting from cql to the data API does have a little bit of a change in and how we name things um you know a key space becomes a name space a table becomes a collection a row becomes a document um if you want to get even further like a like a column or a cell becomes a property um so that's that's just you know how you hear me you know kind of um kind of refer to things you know going forward just in case I happen to throw around you know keyspace and namespace without really explaining why I'm using one or the other just note that um that that the switch between you know the two ways to connect to your cluster you know kind of brings along that little change in definition of terms all right so connecting with the data API um is super simple all you really need is an endpoint and a token and you can build your token with um with a quick command in kubernetes that that I'm going to show you actually and that's just this Cube control get secret um and then you specify you know like the the name of your user um your namespace and then you do you do A- o for out and you send it as a as a format of yaml and you're going to come back with the 64bit encoded um representations of your username and password then to build your token you start with the string of Cassandra with a Capital C um and then a colon and then the 64-bit encoded username and then your 64-bit encoded password you know so it ends up looking something kind of like that but again I will show you this process uh super easy and then of course you know when you when you go ahead and connect up because it's um it's like rest it's a rest based U you know connection you'll actually send the token along as a as a header variable um so that will allow you to connect up and we'll actually put this to use in just a little bit so the demo application that that we're going to build today is this application called DS books and the idea is that um hey we have these these books that have been written by uh data Stacks employees so you know we're just going to we're going to build an application that lets us like list them out uh catalog them you know maybe even like you know do a little bit of like like easy searching by like title or author um and the stack that we're going to use for this of course on the on the back end we're using um Cassandra or data STX Enterprise the uh controller controller layer is built out with uh using spring Boot and then voden actually allows us to kind of build a really quickly just in pure Java a component-based um you know gooey front end for the web so those are the three things that that we're using to uh to put our application together now of course we have an allnew driver for this that allows you to work with the um the data API um this is it's the same one actually that we um that we use for as DB so it's just Aster db- Java um then you can specify the version um and again depending on which dependency manager you're using for Java whether you're using Maven or Gradle um you'll you'll want to go ahead and put the dependencies in you know obviously to whichever whichever flavor of dependency manager you're using I tend to use Maven so I'm going to be using the top one in my My Pal XML um but for those of you who love Gradle the uh dependency is right on the bottom there so there we go all right now for the fun part okay so we got our demo um we're going to start out by just um by having a look at our load balancer it already does exist um I I've actually that's one of the things that I didn't blow away for this for this uh presentation so I left the load balancer intact uh but we'll just go ahead and take a look at it with with Cube control um then we're going to build out our oh that says DS albums I should say DS books we're going to build out our DS books app um we're going to build it into a Docker container and then push that container out to Amazon ECR and then use that container to create a new service inside of Amazon ECS all right here we go let's put the rubber to the road and just see what we can do here so um I'll switch back to uh picture in picture here I think that's going to be better um so hey this is Mission Control and and you can see I have a cluster out here called roll bones um this is running on data sax Enterprise so DS 69.2 um we have three nodes out there um and this is all running in um as you can kind of see from my if you can see my URL here it's all running out in uh Us West 2 so if I want to be able to see um like kubernetes based resources and assets this cluster I can go ahead and bring up a terminal window here and we can just say Cube control oh let's see let's do um actually you know what let's just do a get pods yeah and this is inside my own erands prge namespace so let's just start with that and as you can see here we go we have um we have a pod running out there for cql Shell we have another one running out there for the data API we have another one for Cassandra a Reaper which kind of manages our consistency based repairs and then we have a pod for each of the nodes 0 one and two so there are all of our pods out there so now let's modify this just a little bit and maybe I want to do a get services and let's just make sure we're pulling back say grep roll the bones and then we'll pipe that to GP one more time to just pull back anything that has the load balancer type oh I may want to run the command rep yes that would be good okay so we pulled back uh back two load balancers here um as you can see uh the cql service has a load balancer on it and I've also defined one for the data API and as you can see it has an internal IP but it also has this um CNS entry here and we're going to make a note of that because that is going to be our connection endpoint that we'll use for the data API um and of course that's running on Port 8181 just uh just kind of like we mentioned so now that we know that's out there let's go to postman so in Postman here again I have um I have that DNS entry that leads to our load balancer uh we're going to and we're going to specify our default name space on the end you know when you're when you're working with um with key spaces inside of Cassandra for cql um you can you can really you know name it whatever you want you know some of the things that we've that we've used and that we' we've built um for a lot of our geni applications like if you've seen any of the videos that that our that our awesome devil team has done with you know anything with um you know like like langlow or any of the uh or any of the rag applications um or anything like that um they're using a lot of times those those drivers will have a default namespace named default namespace so just to avoid confusion that's what I've that's what I've done here now what I'm going to do is send it this create collection command and it's going to create a collection named DS books and if you have a look at my headers here you can see I've got yeah accept and contact type of both application Json but I also have my full Cassandra token here uh prefaced with the word token so I should just be able to go and run that and with any luck this is taking a little bit of time come on hey there we go status okay outstanding all right so now let's move down to this um this post command I have called insert many books so now you notice I have that same DNS entry up here the with the 8081 for the endpoint um we have our default name space as our our key space or name space but then we also have the name of the collection of DS books on the end um that's how we're going to send all of the data in Json format um about our books into our collection so let me go ahead and run that and hey I got a bunch of IDs back so that's a good good sign um if it if it has a if it has a success condition it'll return the ID that it was inserted with so let's bounce back to um mission control for a second and inside my roll the bones cluster here I'll go to the cql console okay so let's log in as [Music] me there we go um so now since I'm connecting via cql now I'm kind of shifting back the names from like namespace and collection to keyspace and table like we're like we're kind of used to so let's do a use default namespace all right so if I have a look at the tables yep DS books is one of the tables so let's do a select star from DS books just like that hey there we go we have our we have eight rows which it's exactly as many as we should have so hey that means that our uh collection and our data are all in place all right let's switch gears oh oh you know what I skipped the part about the token didn't I all right let let me do that quick um here I've already used the token uh but I'll I'll show you how to get that so that's a cube control get secret and in our case it's going to be roll uh bones super user and we're going to go ahead and grab our namespace up here so I don't have to retype that then I'm just going to say o yaml just like that boom and you can see right up here we have our 64-bit encoded username and our 64-bit encoded password so that's where our token comes from okay now now let's switch gears a little bit here so if I go back to Eclipse yes I I know I'm I'm one of the uh few remaining devs on this on Earth who have not converted over to vs code but I've been using eclipse for 15 years and I just yeah I'm not interested in changing so let's go ahead now and we're gonna we're going to build this out so I've already included that dependency for the astb Java driver um what I'm going to do since in my Java class here I have this uh collection of type document defined as like a private class variable and then above that from the environment I'm pulling in my application token and my endpoint um so in the controller here let me just start by initializing my collection or my connection I should say let's do data API client I'll just call that client and that's going to be a new data API client and we're going to initialize that with our our static environment variable of token simple enough next let's create a uh a database API object so let's just go database DB API and we'll say client. get database and yep we're going to pass API endpoint and we're also going to pass our um our namespace so let's say default namespace just like that all right and then we also have to initialize our collection object up here so real quick let's just go collection equals DB API get collection and we're going to pass the uh collection name of DS books just to go ahead and match what we have out there all right um let's see here so we have a we have a a few methods that need to be filled out here um one of them is this uh just get one book so what we're going to do is just do a return um because it's going to return a uh a Val a value of type um optional document so let's say collection and we have a find um we have a find one but we also have a find by ID uh so that's what we're going to use here and just pass book ID like that um you'll notice too that we also have like uh like get mappings for restful endpoints we're actually not going to use those today uh voden is actually going to go straight to the um the underlying methods like the like the get one book that I just uh just specified here um but you know it h having those as a restful endpoint is a good idea to kind of offer like expandability into um you know into your into your application oh and I see a question here about like what roles do we need to associate with the uh with the service account um I'm trying to remember how I did this all here I don't think there was anything special that I had to do um yeah I think I think really the only time that I had to mess with um specifying like like roles for the for the service account um was when I was creating the backups for uh for the Cassandra cluster but yeah yeah oh actually yeah there there is a role that um that uh that runs things on the um on the service side in ECS and I'll cover that when we get there so yeah that's a good question actually all right so get all books Let's go ahead and do this one real quick um this will just be a return and we can just do a collection find with an empty parameter list that'll pull everything back um now I know that you've been taught you know and uh you know that I've publicly stated too many times don't just do a um select star without a wear Clause um when you have a result set that's as small as this for for what we're doing that's that's actually not not terrible so that should be okay all right let's do find by author um so kind of the same same thing here we're going to say return and this is going to be collection and this we're going to do a regular find now I've included the equals operator up above um so I can just do q and then we want to check for the author property and we want to make sure it's equal to uh the author variable that we're passing in here um likewise we're going to do the same thing with find by title so I can paste that and let's just go ahead and put title there and title there and that should all be okay all right so now I've saved that and that that all looks okay um let's go ahead and test this out quick so if I go ahead and just do a run here all right looks like it's started and let's go Local Host 8080 hey look at that we have our application outstanding okay let's now go to the command line here and let me page back in my notes um I'm actually going to export my endpoint and I'm going [Music] to oh you know what I probably don't need to do this in retrospect um so yeah right from here let's just go Maven clean install Das capital P production just do that all right um passing that P production for Maven actually does trigger some things in the build um in terms of um building out the proper dependencies into your jar file for voden so that's sort of important to do um so let me have a look at my target directory here okay um yeah you can see that this file just got built so let's go ahead and um and build our application as a Docker container so we're going to go ahead and do a Docker and I'll say build DT going to call take it as DS books and we want to run this in the local directory just like that this might take just a second oh look at that finished great so now if I go ahead and look at my my local Docker repository you can see that I have this DS books entry right here as a container um so again if this all worked um I should be able to test this out by clicking run and yep let's expand optional settings we want 8080 oh one more and then we also want our environment variables so let's put our endpoint out there and our application token out there as well and we should be able to run that let's have a look at containers oh did that not oh is this what no I don't think that's oh 19 seconds ago well maybe it is well you know what let's uh let's try that again maybe I didn't do something quite right here all right 8080 yeah we won't bother naming that okay so application token here we go maybe that was it maybe it uh realized that I uh kind of hosed up my application token there and let's go endpoint okay oh ha yeah you know what it might have collided with um the application in my IDE that I didn't stop maybe that's what the problem was okay now let's try running it hey this looks much better okay yep can see that it's started now let's go up over here Local Host 880 again hey all right we got our application outstanding outstanding okay so now I can stop this and we can go back to our command line here so real quick let's go ahead and we're going to need to retag our um our Docker container to match up with our with our um ECR repository so let me do that quick so let's go ahead and do Docker tag DS books and I'm going I have my um my URL for our repository or URI that I'm going to put right here and I'm just going to put DS books on the end of that okay now the way that we can tell if this worked is if I go back to Docker images and yep you can see I have two of them for DS books um but the one with our uh our ECR URI is at the is at the top so that's how we know that worked okay so now let's go [Music] Docker push and that's all we should need to do oh my authorization has expired right okay so I'm going to go ahead and do a um a awsc I login quick and we're going to use ECR and we'll do get login password and this is going to be for us West 2 and then Docker login username AWS password and oh password standard in we'll do that and I think I just need uh um count you or I in the end of that let's try that oh I wonder if I missed something along the way let's try that hey login succeeded outstanding okay now let's retry our Docker push and have a look out here um this is the uh the repository that I'd put together for our demos that we ran at AWS reinvent um couple of weeks ago uh so you know we had a demo for for langlow and then we had a an AI shopping assistant that uh that we built that was kind of using that langlow endpoint so if we do this right our our uh container for the DS books application should show up here hey all right look at that okay let's copy that URI because we are definitely going to need that all right so now it's it's in ECR let's go ahead and shift gears over to ECS Oh wrong way let's see here elastic container service there we go okay and then same thing inside that uh ECS cluster that I I'd built for for re event um you can see we have two Services down here again for the the same ones that kind of match up with the um you know the pre-existing um containers that were out there let's go ahead and create a new task definition okay so let's say just call it DS books um so real quick um you need to specify the uh the operating system and architecture that um that the application was built with so I'm running on a Mac M2 which is an arm processor uh for ex Advanced risk machine um and for those of you who don't know risk means reduced instruction set computer versus like what most people are used to with a like most PCS are cisk or you know complex instruction set computers um so there you go CIS versus versus risk and then arm is like somewhere in the middle all right point is though I want to select Linux arm64 um here I can select some of the resources that I want behind my service like that um here we go you know somebody asked before about like which which role do I need here um we can actually just leave that as as a blank and it should pick the right one but I do have this ECS task execution rule that i' that I've created um that that should allow this to work just fine okay for the container itself we're just going to say DS books uh remember I copied my image URI so I'll just paste that in um this is indeed an essential container all right so we're going to go port 8080 just like that um ah and we need two environment variables so I'm going to do this exercise again of uh adding both the DB API endpoint and the application token and let's go ahead and put our data API in point there and then our application token can go right here okay and if I scroll down I think the rest of this is all okay so let's do a create all right so we have our task definition created um what I can do here uh is say I can say deploy and I can say create this Tex t as a service so let's say create um yep it's going to that ECS cluster uh we're going to use fargate as our capacity provider I think that's our only option here um let's see here uh yep we're we're deploying um our our task as a service you can also launch a task as a task um with the the idea being that that tasks are you know I mean I guess they're both kind of ephemeral but a will live for a little bit and then just be gone when it's done whereas a a service kind of endures for you know an extended period of time uh we'll just call this DS books um let's see here and then under okay under networking um the default Security Group is not going to work so you're going to want to pick an AWS security group that has Port 880 already Exposed on it um I created one just for all of our demos at re reinvent and I think if I just search for reinvent yep sure enough there it is so then we have the correct Security Group and I'm pretty sure the rest of this is okay so let's do a create all right um so now we can see our ECS cluster um we can see the services that are running if I go ahead and I do a refresh hey look at that DS books is up here and it's not quite running just yet but I can click into here here and I can say tasks and if we refresh a little bit okay there we go so it's it's provisioning it's on its way up I can even um you know maybe take a look at take a look at the logs as well um I can yeah look at that it started uh maybe we're okay here let's see if I do a refresh well it says it's pending it might still be it might still be waiting here okay running running that's what we want to see all right so now if I click into the task you'll notice it has this public IP address here and I'm just going to copy that and if we did everything right 8080 oh look at that oh it worked I was really kind of question questioning myself as to whether or not I'd put too many moving parts to be uh to be assembling live in front of you here but um it looks like it all looks like it all came together um so we start off with um you know you remember uh Denise gozell used to be our used to be our chief data officer um she wrote a book on you know the practitioners guide to graph data um you know um we have uh Jeff Carpenter and Patrick mcfaden Cloud native data on kubernetes you can't go wrong with that actually I have I have a copy of that I have a copy of both of those that I just mention mention over there as well um and you know of course you know I I I could could also plug um you know eban hwit and Jeff carpers um Cassandra definitive guide um and you know earlier this year I wrote one called code of java 21 so hey if you're coding to Java 21 I advise you to check it out Shameless plug but um but yeah so this is this looks like it's working um all right well with that I can bounce back over to our slides here and um oh here let's um maybe do that well that's a little bit better anyway so other resources for you to check out you know have a look at our um at our Discord server it's out at discord.gg Stacks uh you know of course we also have our our data Stacks Developers YouTube channel which this um is being broadcast on and you can find this recording at the same address on YouTube um you know once it uh once it completes up and of course you know for other resources feel free to check out uh data.com um we have plenty of material out there uh pretty pretty much if if you're stuck on something with you know one of the drivers or one of the databases or you know maybe you're even trying to trying to build a rag application with um with langlow and reactjs hey uh we have all of that on our website you know to uh all that doc documentation to be able to help you out um and of course if you have questions you know the um uh Discord server you know we we kind of run that you know 24 hours somebody somebody's always looking at that um so yeah that should be about it um I'm looking to see if there are are any other questions here oh how can Cassandra be launched in kubernetes pods um well that's uh that's a great question you know the the thing is though is that uh we actually do have um like there actually are official um Docker containers of of Cassandra that you can go ahead and and pull down um you know I I do recommend you know if you're gonna um if you're going to use those um we we actually did start with the when I worked at Target and we put it on kubernetes we did start with the community Docker container we just kind of we use that as a good building Point um so that's that's kind of what I I'd recommend you know because every Enterprise is going to have their own requirements about about how they run containers um specifically though if you've looked at some of our kubernetes-based offerings you'll notice that we have a um a free and open source project out there called Kate Sandra uh which is essentially a containerized version of Cassandra that's specifically designed to run on kubernetes and when you deploy through Mission Control we're actually using the official k Sandra images that are that are getting pulled down and um and that's what that's what mission control is deploying inside of Amazon eks um so yeah that's a that's a great question actually let's see I don't see too many too many others on here um so yeah you know I I guess that's um let's see is there a Q&A side oh yeah and it's just the the same ones that I that i' had answered already yeah uh yeah I think we're uh I think we're in good shape here so all right if there's nothing else hey everyone thanks for joining you know I I hope you enjoyed it I hope you got something out of it and um you know best of luck in uh you know continuing to run your clusters and uh building out your Enterprise applications on top of them all right thank you",
