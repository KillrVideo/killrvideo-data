    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems well I am really excited about this week's episode of the distributed data show this is Jeff carpenter and I am here with Robin Schumacher hey Jeff how are you and we have brought you on today to talk about a very exciting new release for data sacks Enterprise DSC six long-awaited long-rumored finally available now so I want to ask you all kinds of questions about DSC 6 how it came to be what's in it and so on but I would like to give you the opportunity to make a proper introduction for yourself first of all so why don't you just tell us a little bit about your background sure so I am SVP of products here at data stacks which means I oversee the product management the documentation and the developer relations teams and I will have been here at Dave stacks but probably seven years this coming July so I think I was employee 25 or 30 or something along those lines way back in 2011 when I joined and prior to that I have been a database guy for literally 30 years so it's a good chance that I have worked with most every major database that's out there in one form or another as a database administrator Oracle sequel server Sybase db2 Teradata my sequel Postgres all of those i've dealt with and so I was a DBA for quite a while and then got into making software for DBAs and database developers I started the product team up and ran the product line at him company called Embarcadero technologies that makes tools for database developers we went public in 2000 and went on from there to start up the product team at my sequel so if there's any viewers who are using MySQL I was the person who hit up the enterprise product the product team up and just as Oracle was on my sequel I went over to a Postgres company called Enterprise DB was doing the exact same thing they're getting the product team going creating differentiation between open source and commercial product when my good friend Billy Bosworth was tapped to be CEO here he and I have worked together for 20-some odd years this our fifth company together and tapped me on the shoulder to come here and it has been a great ride so far that's awesome and I wanted our to make sure our audience just gets to hear a little bit of that depth of background you've definitely been there done that seen it all and you have watched a you know our product here at data stacks really mature from its it's beginning stages and really adding on a lot of the enterprise features that you know we would come to expect in an enterprise grade database and so this this feels like a major milestone in terms of you know having arrived at a new level of maturity so definitely excited to you know here a little bit behind the scenes about what went into that so I want to dive right into it what are some of the overarching product strategies that went into DSC six like what's the main objective here with this release sure so over the past six to seven years what we have been doing is building an enterprise data platform on top of proven open source technology patch Cassandra Apache spark solar things like that and during that time period we have done a lot of investment and worked with the open source communities to really build up Cassandra to where it is today which is really one of the top two leading those sequel platforms out there and I think arguably the only one that is built from the ground up for heavy lifting distributed database scenarios and use cases I think there's really no one out there that would deny that when it comes to distributing your data ensuring that you never go down having predictable linear scale performance Cassandra's it and so that's what we've been doing over these past six or so years so we've been building a Cassandra on the open source side and then building a commercial enterprise home on the other and now we've kind of reached a milestone with DSC 6 where we've begun to focus on a number of other objectives now that that DEA's data stacks enterprises where it is and Cassandra has reached a level of maturity in the open-source community and so really we've got three objectives that we're looking at long term and what I mean long term puppy in the next three or so years that have really shaped and molded dc-6 as well as the versions that will be coming right after the first being an emphasis now of reprioritization of our development efforts so that our commercial platform day stocks enterprise is really the priority versus in past years having that focus be on open source and as I mentioned we work really hard with the open source community to get Cassandra where it is today and because it's reached really strong and stable mature place in the market we now feel comfortable to relax a number of the guidelines we've used internally that have held us back in terms of focusing on data stacks enterprise and retaining functionality we developed for data stacks Enterprise so the first objective really is this this new emphasis that we're placing on data stacks Enterprise the second involves simplicity and so again over these years we have put a large set of large building blocks in place in the platform and security integrated analytics integrated search and memory graph database multi-model functionality and now now that we have these in place were beginning to polish them if you will make them easier to use simpler for our customers to utilize in their daily work whether they're developers or administrators or operators and our cloud strategy which I think we'll talk about in a little bit factors into that as well so simplicity is really the second goal that we have and then the third is our unification or unified platform objective as I just mentioned we have integrated analytics integrated search all these other pieces that work very very well today but what we're looking at doing now is going from an integrated platform to one that is more unified where we're beginning to actually bake these piece is a functionality deeper into our distribution of Cassandra so that when you download an install data sex Enterprise and push the start button all of this functionality will be available always on there versus some of the secondary work configuration may be that you have to do today to enable analytics or search and so those three objectives see the emphasis now on the commercial platform the simplification of the platform and the unification of the platform are really as is what's driven what we've done in six and the releases that are soon to follow excellent ok so you've definitely given me a roadmap there that I'm gonna follow and walk right down that road so let's talk about each of those points now in terms of kind of a distinctiveness between dc-6 and Cassandra you mentioned that it's there's a little bit of a emphasis and divergence between what's in data sacks enterprise and open source Cassandra is that something that you can talk to you a little bit sure so as I mentioned earlier we have been piloting the ship as it were with a set of guidelines that I helped develop when I was at MySQL and also it at Postgres company that helped us determine what we give back to open source and what we have retained for paying customers and now we're relaxing those guidelines and so in the past we had mandates that said open source Cassandra would never run slower in data stacks Enterprise even though we put some performance optimizations as such into the platform into the DSE platform they were never really out of the box in a sense so we had mandates such as that that open source Cassandra would never scale less than DSC would never replicate differently or in less advanced fashion and that's changed with DSC 6 what you're going to find is out of the box data sex Enterprise will run faster than open source Cassandra okay it will scale better it will replicate in more advanced fashion and so some practical examples of this first would be a set of optimizations and utilities that we've include in version six that we've labeled DC advanced performance in advanced performance is targeting applications that really require the utmost and speed and don't require any changes to any existing existing application code or setup or anything else that you've done so that when you download and install six just push the start button it's going to out of the box give you round a 2x improvement in both read and write performance without you having to do anything and we've got use cases where we're actually seeing even greater increases in speed so this was a huge rewrite that our development team worked on very proud of the work that they've done we've got some performance tests and benchmark papers that we'll be putting on our website that you can download and take a look at the viewers can look at and see exactly what we've done there so that's one of the things that's under the DEA's that gives the advanced performance umbrella another being a brand-new bulkloader that we have added so one of the requests we've gotten over the years has been something that exceeded the capabilities of the SS table loader the copy command that we've got with cql and really more mirrored what people have used in their relational environments like sequel loader for Oracle DCP for sequel server or something like that and that's exactly what the Daz bulk loader is it allows people to really push data into the DC platform and unload it in a much more simple elegant and much more performant way than the prior utilities and so our internal tests are showing a 4x actual improvement in both moving data into inserting data into the platform and then unloading and getting it out and pushing it to perhaps other targets within the enterprise so that's a second item and then a third is our DC analytics which utilizes Apache spark for the very first time again we have done all the open source work to connect spark and Cassandra together but for the very first time we're including our own spark connectivity layer inside of data stacks enterprise and there'll be there's a number of benefits that that are realized from this but on the performance side we are seeing a 3x now speed up with basic queries against data those stored in Cassandra access with spark so again all of these features are things that in past releases we may have thrown over the transom to the open source community but now they're being retained for days decks enterprise customers and hence the focus again just on DSA itself right good so there's a number of exciting things that that you mentioned or at least hinted at and there with respect to performance improvements in a variety of areas just the basic core database itself first of all on the order of 2x performance the speeds speed boost for that as well as the you know increased performance for analytics we're gonna be actually diving into that hopefully quite a bit more in future episodes looking to dig in with our engineering team and with our product management team on some of those specific improvements things like thread per core and some of the byte order index improvements so I'm excited why you know we're not gonna preview or pre hash all that right now but just you know it's for our viewers and listeners stay tuned we will be diving more into some of the technical details here of those things in future episodes so look for that coming up but I wanted to key in on one of the things that you mentioned in particular as an emphasis on usability or simplicity that we're really really pushing hard toward with a lot of our products so can you expand on that a little bit more for me please sure so we're constantly and naturally listening to what our customers need as well as what the community is saying in terms of the things that they would like to see in Cassandra and sometimes these these requests will deviate and and sometimes they don't tell really well and one of the areas that you'll see the community and enterprises agreeing on is the need to alleviate the issues that that some see in Cassandra repair operations year after year when I run our product surveys and we do sampling we find that oftentimes people will strug with repair operations how to do it how often to do it etc and if it's ignored it can really threaten the viability of a Cassandra cluster and so a couple years ago we introduced a repair service that was deployed at the ops center JSX off center level which is our visual management minors solution but it was handicapped in that it could only utilize the functionality that exists existed at the Cassandra level and so we did a few tweaks and and we have customers that use it today but it was still fell short of what we really wanted and so with six we're really proud to announce DSC node sync which is a server based set of functions that operate repair and a very transparent in an automatic fashion across a cluster in effect alleviating the need for anyone to manually intervene and and handle or deal with repair operations so basically when you install six and enable node sync you should not have to deal with repair operations really again and we've made it very very flexible for people to use so that if you have a set of repair processes that you like you can keep it that's that's fine but if you want to again wash your hands of dealing with repair you can enable node sink it's done on a per table basis can be handled either via the CQL or visually through op centered and monitored through op center but the bottom line is here we're really giving our DX enterprise users the ability to take a big piece of administration kind of overhead that they've you know carried for some time now and really just cast it aside so that's one example another which I'm really happy to see is our new upgrade service and so as a DBA there were two things that I absolutely dreaded I hated doing a point major point in time restore on a critical database scary thing and secondly I really hated doing upgrades again to a major system because you're always worried is something gonna go wrong you can practice as much as you you can on development systems but you know there's always something that happens so and then take that that ankhs that people feel and magnify it quite a few times when you're dealing with a distributed system that maybe has sets of nodes running in all different parts of the world and it can be again a daunting task and so this is where the upgrade service comes in this is an automated system that helps people with patch upgrades we're starting with the patch upgrades to begin with and then we'll tackle major upgrades next but the idea here is to notify you if a particular upgrade or when a particular upgrade is available and then download the software either onto the machines themselves or staging area apply the patch in a rolling restart fashion so you never go down there's no outages whatsoever having to deal with we're upgrading your system is concerned and you can monitor it and handle it all through op center so really happy to see upgrades tackled in this fashion again we start with patches and then the the major upgrades will be coming next but I think nodes say can upgrade service will give you I guess the taste of the types of things we're looking to simplify we're DSD is concerned excellent so also you mentioned this idea of the unification strategy of having a more unified a product and I assume that that means in terms of the way that the core cuz header database integrates with SPARC and integration with search and I know that the graph the DSC graph makes heavy usage of both search and analytics under the covers so can you talk about how all these pieces are coming together more and more I assume that that's what is happening under the hood sure as I mentioned earlier I mean we've had we have a lot of this functionality well integrated into the platform today but we want to make it simpler and easier to use and also just directly available with no thought given to enabling the functionality and so as an example with Daz search DSC search is based on Apache Solr we add quite a bit to it at an additional value to it very very powerful set of functionality but it does require secretary configuration there's the solar API to deal with there are times when maybe you might want additional hardware resources to tackle the search workloads in addition there's transactional workloads that you do through Cassandra and so where we're going with DSC search and the this unification objective is to really bake search into our distribution of Cassandra so that when you start the database up it is simply available from the get-go that instead of having to deal with multiple API is the solar API and in the Cassandra query language cql api you're only dealing with one you're only dealing with this cql api that is done or handled rather in a very efficient manner so that you don't need additional hardware resources and everything is much more efficient and in six you you see that the beginnings of this so this is going to be something the process is going to take a several releases to round out but in six what you see is us beginning to attack the API layer first where we're introducing much more support for search operations through cql and we're giving customers the syntax that again they're used to if they're coming from the relational world so for example in six we're supporting the like command which which people are very used to using in in relational databases the like command done through the cql api but uses DSC search underneath the covers and with subsequent relations we'll be developing that new engine finishing everything up and so this is where again you're going from something that's that's integrated and nice to something that's really unified and much more simpler to operate and develop against so it begins with DSC six with search there's other areas though as well so with DSC analytics you're seeing us now provide support for unified authentication that's now in analytics so security is being again unified throughout all of the various components of data stacks Enterprise and then lastly it's not just at the server that were we're carrying this objective out it's also at the client level so our web based developer tool based X to do today supports graph it supports Cassandra query language working with Cassandra and with Studio six now we're delivering support for spark sequel so if you want to just write sparse equal jobs without doing a lot of extra coding with scholar whatever else you're going to be able to write that those sparks equal queries fired up against DC analytics be able to return your result sets much like you would in a relational world or Cassandra or whatever else and look at the data so you're seeing us do this unification not only at the server level but also unifying our developer tools so no matter what you have to be working with whether it's analytics search graph transactional you'll be able to handle all that through through Studio excellent that is really exciting you know I thinking back like some of the rough edges that were smoothing out across the product line and having a sort of an evening out of capabilities like you mentioned the security capabilities looking more and more the same across the platform you know having having less of my cql statements that are search queries having a having to specifically reference at their solar queries and just being more and more straight natural-looking CQ oh these are all great improvements that I think are gonna make life a lot easier in a lot of ways so the one thing that we talked about before that we really haven't dived into it all that I want to come back to is the cloud strategy so with our DSE managed cloud how is that impacted by the release of DSC 6 sure so we really believed that with version 6 we are delivering the leading distributed cloud database on the market and and one that's really been designed from the ground up for hybrid cloud now that's a that's a loaded term so I want to define what I mean by hybrid cloud I'd sum it up this way if a customer comes to us and say will you support us on premise our answer is yes will you support us in the cloud the answer is yes will you support us in multiple clouds the answer is yes will you support us in in in a way where we may be using on-premise and cloud together at the same time our answer is yes so that's really how we define hybrid on-premise in the cloud multi cloud we're there we're able to deliver all of the functionality that you enjoy with data sex enterprise no matter how you deploy and so where our cloud strategy comes into play is with manage cloud which what you've already talked about data sex manage cloud that is our white glove service that is a true managed service and allows customers who have no desire to be in the database business or at least don't want to deal with certain applications in their company they can they can come to us and we will ensure upfront that we are supplying everything they need to choose the right hardware configuration to get their data models right which are two key areas you want to ensure that you get right for success with the platform and then after that we take care of everything whether it is provisioning upgrades backup restore or performance to mean we handle all that for them and all of the functionality we have been discussing thus far will be available in in data stacks manage cloud and so no matter again whether you're downloading and installing it yourself whether you're running dc-6 in the clouds or itself or whether you choose our managed service you're going to be able to enjoy all the flexibility of being able to deploy how you would like to and get all the benefits of data stacks enterprise and the other thing that I want to emphasize right now we're seeing quite a bit of enquiries coming in from customers who are looking to have an alternative to being locked into a particular cloud provider I mean as you know that the various cloud providers offer their sets of databases but they are exclusive to their particular cloud provider so if a person goes all-in on Amazon or Azran or whatever else there is a real fear there that should these vendors increase prices or limit them in some way they want a way of being able to control their own destiny especially where their data is concerned and that's what data stacks Enterprise delivers in the cloud we are cloud agnostic you can run across all the different clouds we've talked about as well as others like Oracle cloud and and not have to worry about being locked into a particular vendor and kind of have your data as it were held hostage so cloud is very visible part of our strategy and I would say that again we are the leading distributed cloud database because the foundation of the platform was built from the cloud from the ground up rather with cloud in mind we are the only masterless architecture that is out there dynamodb is not masterless cosmos DB is not master lycium I can go on down the list but we are and that's why we're able to deploy across the cloud and on-premise with ease exactly so in yeah that's a topic that we definitely dope into quite a bit with Jonathan Ellis when he was on the show so if anybody hasn't seen that I encourage you to go back and take a look at that episode he he died sexes that and kind of that that various cloud managed service competition that's out there and in quite some detail but you did raise the term there that I want to pick on a little bit which is this idea of lock-in and you know lock-in isn't it isn't an issue that people encounter not only in terms of locking in to a particular managed cloud provider but we these are arguments that we also hear when we're talking with our customers I recall talking with one of our customers that was a DSC customer but didn't really want to dig into using some of the analytics features right they just wanted to stick to the DSC core because the quote didn't want to get locked in so I mean this is an argument that we hear sometimes and I want to give you the opportunity to respond to that what's our what's our thought process in terms of locking into DSC and people are concerned that they might not be able to go back to open source Cassandra or what have you sure so the first thing that I'll mention is realize that we always in our development efforts we're always pulling from open source Cassandra and and building on top of that so it's the proven foundation for everything that we do here and this means that if you're a current open-source Kassandra user you've built an application but you're looking at Daz 6 and you're thinking wow I'd like to take advantage of those particular benefits there's no heavy lifting involved whatsoever to now aim your application away from open source Cassandra and at data stacks Enterprise because again we're we're using open source Cassandra underneath the covers and if you choose not to employ any of the particular enterprise components such as our advanced security analytics search etc if at some point in time you're looking to maybe move back to open source again that's not a heavy lifting option if you're using our open source drivers is really know nothing that you really need to do again as long as you haven't coded anything that that use uses our enterprise components if you're using our data stacks enterprise drivers there's just a couple single or a couple line code changes that you make and you're pretty much done you're also able to very easily move the data between clusters utilizing SPARC job or something else but the bottom line is we always maintain compatibility with open source Cassandra making it very simple for people to come from the open source world deploy your applications on data stacks enterprise with really no code changes whatsoever and absolutely give you that safety net like we think that once you get on data stacks Enterprise you're not going to want to go back to open source and lose the performance gains and all of the other benefits that we've been talking about but if you want the assurance that no I'm not going to be locked in you have it no that's good yeah and and I would I would be very tempted myself to kind of dive into a defense of you know why the operational simplicity is gonna pay for itself and well we'll save that for our sales team to make those those arguments and make that case but one of the things that that I wanted to ask you about is well maybe not everyone knows that we have an early access program that we do you know trial out versions of new releases as they're coming to market so this is a pretty battle-tested release it's been put through its paces by some really significant major customers in a very big way so can you talk a little bit about what is the feedback that we are getting from some of these customers on DSC 6 what kind of experiences are they reporting yeah so as you mentioned we have had an early adopter program that's been in place for quite a while now and I've been overseeing the one for version six and we're getting good feedback from customers that are talking about how is an example with DSC analytics they found the new unified security much easier to work with than they have in the past they're seeing the performance gains that we've talked about they're enjoying the now simple way that you can load and unload data in a very short order and the other objective that I really didn't mentioned earlier that you just briefly touched on is we have kind of an internal objective called rock-solid and this is something that we've kind of carried forward for a while now we want to make sure that no matter what that when when we hand over data stacks enterprise it is literally indestructible that it is not going to fail you in production environments and many people don't know the degree to which we go to ensure that as an example we are the single largest tester of apache spark in the world so we are the ones that do the thousand node tests on Amazon and on Google compute engine and ensure and ring out every kind of issue that we that may exist at scale so that our customers don't hit that that's one of the benefits that you get with data stacks Enterprise is this production certification that that no one else is going to provide and that gives again a really a strong comfort factor to customers that they can deploy with with confidence when they begin to use data sets Enterprise for their critical applications excellent um so one more question if I can sneak in for you but before you go I know that we're running short on time so we've dropped an awful lot on people and we are gonna be caught talking quite a bit about DSC 6 in the coming weeks and you know diving into some of the different aspects but if we kind of lift up our eyes and look out a little bit further toward the horizon what what do you see coming after DSC 6 any sort of sneak preview as to what we're thinking down the road well the goal with all of the things that we've been talking about thus far is to ensure that that we're not just delivering technology tweaks for technology's sake everything that we've been talking about has a real business purpose to it so it's not just about giving you 2x or 4x performance gains it's about you the customer being able to process more orders per second or handle more concurrent users at scale for your growing business or be able to handle more product lookups in your product catalog so that you're satisfying customers and they're not clicking away when it comes to simplicity it's it's all about increasing the customers productivity so that they spend less time administering the system and more time working on business-related activities and so those are some of the more business oriented goals that we look at for this release and also those that are going to be coming down the pike and so you can expect to see us attack in all of these particular areas that we've been talking about whether it is being able to be more resource efficient from the platform standpoint whether it is to ensure that we are doing things like making containerization with our platform just very turnkey and and simplistic those are the things that we've kind of set our sights on but but the areas that I described earlier the the renewed emphasis on commercial platform the simplicity unification some of these things that we've been talking about are going to take a number of releases to get there so for example our next-generation search probably three four releases but look we really have it polished in where we want it to be and so we're excited about the SE six you know it's one of those things where I've seen so many releases I was you know here for Dia c1 and I always think you know it's never going to we're never going to top that release and I feel that way about six but when our next release comes out I'll probably shake my head and think I don't know how we did it but we did it again we top that release so we're excited about six but also really looking forward to some of the things that are on the short term horizon as well well I'm pretty excited to you as you could probably tell so I just want to express appreciation to you Robin for coming on the show and also just so your product team I know that you guys absorb a ton of customer input and really are out there seeking a lot of feedback and are very responsive to that I feel like the product that we put out there in DSC 6 is really I mean it's driven by the customer it's for our customers and that's down to what you guys do so yeah I just well I can I can tell you that I again as I said at the outset of this I've been doing this for a lot of years but I would absolutely say the product team that I work with today is the best that I have ever been a part of and it is a real privilege to work alongside them and be a part of the team and see the innovative creative ideas that they come up with that again solve real business problems so fantastic to to again be a part of the crew well we are looking forward to bringing you back here at some point in the not-too-distant future to talk about DSD 7 or maybe even sooner should the occasion arise so thanks for joining us and we will see you all next week on the next episode thank you for joining us again for the
