    "text": "I think today is the day we're going to talk about hyperon converge database yep and more importantly uh there's a poll out there so go answer that real quick the first poll of the thing so how you been Aon I've been all right I've been all right you know I just uh you know I just did a a week vacation in Miami that was nice very nice indeed yeah avoid all the Hurricanes get back y I ended up uh picking like the one week or so that didn't have I like split the Hurricanes right there was one in in Puerto Rico and then there's another one evidently up way on the East Coast but uh but yeah is the season yeah don't go don't go to Miami in the like late summer man that's the curan season well again that's me from Minnesota what do I know about Miami right you know why they don't put infrastructure in Miami or in Florida in general there that's a 100% chance of getting wiped out by a hurricane or flood something you're telling me there there's no AWS East FL yeah no there would never be one either unless well there's the underwater data centers right yeah all right well you know what we need to get moving here uh so today we're talking about getting started with hyperon converge database and so I think the thing that we need to start with here which is the most important thing is you know let's talk about what hyperconverged database actually is right and good idea the the first question for everyone is why hyperon converged and I hear that a lot like wait a minute that seems like a weird name but hyperconverged is a word and hypercon converge infrastructure is a word but like why why are we using word a hypercon converge database and um I will explain and hopefully make this obvious or at least uh understood by many so um it comes down to just this which is managing resources and infrastructure now you know and this is compute Network and Storage and Compu Network and storage are what you pay for when you use when you buy equipment when you provision data centers when you're renting it from a cloud um and Compu Network and storage are those those elements that um need to be run efficiently so if you're not using your compute Network and storage in the most efficient manner you're wasting money and hybrid converge infrastructure and HCI has been around this like combining those things together and making it as one unit and how do we do that no surprise kubernetes that's right yeah kubernetes is the if you hadn't heard I that was the poll that I put out there are you running kubernetes or not and if you're not you should be thinking about it soon or unless you just use straight up Cloud stuff but um that's fine too uh but you know data stocks we're we're very we very bullish on kubernetes and to the point where we actually run a lot of kubernetes so our data STX Astra is a h Cloud database Patrick Cassandra is a service and it it's essentially it's Cassandra running on kubernetes and we have something like 30,000 clusters running on kubernetes so it's something we're pretty good at I think don't you think Erin I concur yeah we we're I at it yeah yeah yeah we're we're okay it runs 247 and it's pretty amazing we we believe in it because what it does is it lets us run and this is why this is I'm getting to the point of why but it's given us the confidence to build things and give you access to the ways of running Cassandra that are very coste efficient because as a cloud database provider we for us to give you a good price on using a database in the cloud that essentially could beat anything that you can do yourself and we have to be very efficient and and believe me that Erin how many meetings have we been in or been involved in where it's like oh we have to you know do this efficiency on our Cloud I mean for like yeah every time yeah so no for sure for sure yeah yeah that that being able to to scale uh compute and storage separately really is key in terms of yeah being efficient that way for sure yeah and people say I'm sorry when people when people Say Hey I want Astra but I I want I want it on Prim I want it on my own well I mean ultimately kubernetes is what makes Astra kind of awesome so yeah yeah and is not just a thing that you have to run in your own Hardware either um oh I I like to make this point often that you know kuet won because all the clouds decided that yeah we want you to manage your compute Network and storage using kubernetes 2 right right so when and that's why we we use the word self-managed you know um it's not on Prem always it's you're running it yourself and so um you know hcd is is this is why hyperon converged is a thing and this gets into this thing what where we are with at data stack is you know we however wherever you want to run candra we want to have something for you yep and um we have a lot of options a lot of options yeah all right um and this this just happens to be I'm going to dig into what it actually is so besides Renning Cassandra and kubernetes uh what what this is the the the products slide that I'm sure everyone does love to read but it's what what we did with hypercon converge database which is really important important is um is give you everything you need to be successful building applications with Cassandra so uh there's a component there's different components but one of those like if you go further down I mean this is where um the stack starts is with Mission Control mission control is not the database mission control is the control plane for running uh HDD and it's a separate install it's something that you have to set up ahead of time but what essentially is is creating this this interface where you can create and Destroy and modify uh your cassander clusters um right it makes it super easy to do too um yeah and we we have videos out there on how to use mission control and the docs are pretty good um so yeah highly recommend yeah and Erin you've created a an entire playlist on Mission Control if I'm not mistaken or have you done that yet yeah yeah I've I've done that yeah yeah that's out there yeah so mission control is a separate topic we're not going to cover that today but um it is I I want to make sure it's well understood because we're going to walk into we're going to start using it some yeah uh but the the Running part the database part of that is aache Cassandra and it has a lot of data Stacks enhancements things that we've added to it um many things that came directly from Astra that are now running alongside Cassandra and I'll go into that in a minute and then um finally it's it's the the API Gateway which again I I'll we'll cover in a minute here but thinking about it in terms of instead of just like a a a port running in the cloud somewhere that you can connect to and good luck we also think about developers in terms of how best they can consume data and the data API if you're not familiar with it is a very cool interesting way to run data uh on Cassandra without having to do data modeling yep yep and and actually if you've seen anything we've done recently on um on Astra or you know we even have examples out there on how to use the data API with um you know dsse 69 um yeah and Astra of course but uh but yeah we we have tons of material out there on that too but hey now we're bringing it to the Enterprise with hcd yeah yeah um and so the the thing that you get out of this is you know the things that are there which are really important um you know are these storage improvements a lot of this has to do with efficiency right if you look at what we what the value prop is for someone who wants to use hyper convert jbas HD is this is around the efficiency like storage improvements are really big if you run a large cassander cluster you know storage is the thing you need to solve and no density that sort of thing we can do incredible amounts of storage efficiency with hcd just the way that it runs in um you could save an enormous amount of money just on that walk away y um and then um the indexing support we it ships with uh storage attach indexes which has been in Astra for quite a while it will be in Cassandra 5 uh which as of this recording should be released anytime rc2 came out yesterday so it's it's close it's close it's close yeah uh Vector search for Gen and gen of course is the word of dour and probably of the two years of that I've been hearing it and Vector our Vector search is based on J Vector which is quite possibly the best Vector search indexing algorithm out there right now um and I have a slide on that um and of course I mentioned mission control which is doing you know instead of having to do everything in a command line to run your cassander and kubernetes we have a a nice little gooey for you which we will demonstrate um the cloud native architecture is that and we we're this so the version 1.0 that we're talking about today doesn't quite have all the storage and compute separation we wanted um that's a harder thing to pull off and and into a supported package um but it exists and we're g to have that shipping soon it looks like a one. one thing um we wanted to get 1.0 out there so people could start looking at it and working with it but that's coming and Vector graph will also be in 1. one vector graph is another way way to do Vector search but with knowledge grafts um yep yep um and I like I mentioned this is I think this is your number one reason um Aaron how many people have you known that run just a little bit of Cassandra H you know most places I know run a lot of Cassandra right yeah you're right I've known a few that run like like a small you know few node cluster but yeah most places are running a lot yeah and I it that's where it adds up and the TCO is is about being efficient with the parts that add up um of course you know going faster me moving faster being able to provision and run clusters quicker and some of the things that we have that really make it easy to work with but also that overhead you know the com and what happens with like the storage like reducing infrastructure cost by 20% that's a pretty giving an amount of money um and that's the thing you're paying for that's the compute Network and storage right um and the way that we license and this is because this is a pay for product this is part of our Enterprise this is an Enterprise product part of our licensing um is not based on node count we don't do that anymore we base it on resources and um I think that you'll find a significant savings trying to uh reason through how it it goes more more about like what you actually use it's closer to how we price our Cloud product which is hey I need I need to use this much database well that's that's what you pay for that's how we how we chart it yeah um did I miss anything in here Erin no I don't think so no yeah um but yeah so resource management is your the key here um and then the vector search I just have to make sure you know that Vector is a separate if you don't need it for Gen if you just want to run your Apache Cass workloads then HDD is good to go um there is a separate skew so a different it's it's a different charge for using HD Vector but it's based ex it's based on the same thing that's happening in Vector Astra Vector which is on our Cloud product and so if you want to if you go use Astra and you think it's awesome and you're like I want that in a self-managed package HD has it and it's keeps up pretty well and what it mean when I say keep up um it's just the pace of development and this is an important thing to realize is the pace of development for J Vector is just so fast right now and I mean yeah Jonathan Ellis who's working on this I mean oh man I think Aon you could you could attest to that he's just flying right um oh yeah yeah I mean I think they're on version three now going to four um right right in fact you know they're they're evolving it faster than they can get it into Cassandra because you know I think when I think when Cassandra finally releases with Jay Vector it's G to have like version one or or something like that but it's it'll be a couple of iterations behind what the the latest and greatest is that we're that we're using in Astra but but yeah yeah and it's moving really really fast and um I think the the thing that's really interesting too is that this is uh J Vector is this is like looking the future of hcd um will also be included in open search um that's that's something I keep hearing about and open search will be included in hcd so um you know it's it's it's really making it useful for developers um and then finally you know like what what what are the use cases because that's that's the other thing we hear is it is if you're using cander I don't need to tell you what the use case is because you're probably already using it right um yep but I think you you've been building some some newer things like um like gen applications right right right yeah um you know anything you're anything you're doing in terms of like um like product recommendations is a really good use case for things that um that are driven under the hood by by Vector search um of course if you're you're building out like a um you know a chat box for your site or a shopping assistant you know again that's going to have that's going to have a um you know a vector data structure underneath it as well um and that's that's really that's really the cool thing that that I I think you get here is that um that that ability to have a path forward with uh with some of the latest and greatest Tech developments that are that are going on out there right now for sure for sure yeah and um yeah it's about moving fast it's uh the modern the modern stack you know that it's developer ready that's and we'll show that um and there's more to be said around developer ready but um if you're operating Cassandra clusters um we were in the same camp we could hang out because we do the same thing we we build Cassandra clusters for developers to use in our Astro product we also sell a product to help you do the same thing and we we're really successful at doing this we have over a thousand new databases created a week a um and thous well thousands every week and um we do it efficiently and and we can show you how to do that so that's where we're at okay so I think you know blah blah blah right let's get into some sharing here that's a good idea that's a good idea this this will be a little more a little more exciting than just you and I talking right yeah well we had to get you're exciting I'm I'm just aing head well thank you I guess yeah I guess wait a minute was that okay all right I'm gonna switch over to I'm gonna switch over to the demoy part of this so um just hang on to your hats everyone this is the part where we do the live demo so guaranteed Something's Gonna blow up um so yeah oh we got a question on here uh yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what you're right and Dan we're going to fix that I know it's it's something that was supposed to be there and it there's just some issues but um uh we we're gonna fix that you're right um the I know it's on the road map for sure yeah yeah you you've been doing some online upgrade stuff right Erin yes yes okay so um that is that's something that I think is going to happen pretty soon uh and that's more in Mission Control right right yeah um the the one that the one that I've worked on is um is from dsse 68 which I know is way newer than DC 51 um but uh but yeah I I know that the um the the team is is really working hard on on getting a process out there for that just I mean you're I I mean Dan's not the only one I mean there are so there are so many people out there that are running DSC 51 so it's uh is definitely a path that we need to have for folks yeah and kind of using that as a segue into the demo we want you to use this button right here exactly and and have it work well with five. one um because for sure I mean if you're on 5.1 you're a you're on a pretty old version of Cassandra um the upgrade just in changing code bases is going to be worth it uh yeah especially with where five is at right now five is just like an instant 20% performance increase you know that's that's more or less with the code we're shipping with HD so um so we're gonna walk through a couple of things here so this is Mion control um you know we're going to do the Julia Child's thing we already created one so we already installed this is already running this is one of our internal um H clusters or I'm sorry um Miss control yeah yeah um one of the things you you need to do is you start a project so so um I have a Patrick project because apparently I'm a project um there are a lot of projects in here we'll switch projects in a minute but a project is where you store your clusters and so um inside the project uh I'm gonna I have no clusters in here right now so we're going to walk through like what that means to create a cluster and go through some of the configuration because um if you've used Astra when you say create a cluster it asks you like one question um like what is your favorite color and that's it um there's a few more questions when you're creating your own yeah a couple more couple more um so eron um let's let's you and I walk through this real quick um you know uh you know of course you're gonna put in the the name because yep of course I'm misspell it um and then I'm gonna pick HD let's let's look at the first bit here so version yeah go ahead you can was going to say you you can specify a specific version I'm pretty sure that HD1 is is the only one we've got out there right now um but kind of the cool thing is that if you look directly under the uh the version there you'll see that we have a spot where you can override the um the image and I I'm trying to remember which which dockerhub repo it is but you know you you can go ahead and like kind of look where we have a lot of the um uh like Mission Control you know images for all for all these uh these uh databases stored and you know you can pick a specific one so if we're if we have one that's like in beta or whatever you know you can go ahead and use that one if you want if you really wanted to use beta but um but anyway yeah you can totally override that yeah it's it's always good to have options right yep um well and it'll be it'll be useful if if we have alternative builds in in our data Stacks uh repo as well yeah yeah absolutely I I think if someone if we had some hackers out there which is probably about half the people um you could even deploy your own stuff but good luck I think you can yep y yeah um so I'm just gonna use a default here so yeah so then we set up our topology um again with Astro that's already kind of baked in but this is where because you're doing self-managed you get to be in control of that um including multiple data centers so let's go through some of this um so data center name Advanced workloads are is if you're using dsse this just htd does not have advanced workloads like uh solar or uh classic graph so those are not a part of it um what what about some of these other settings that I should look at here um you know you can also you know specify your uh your rack as well which is usually a pretty good idea um and then you know the probably the the other important thing and I forget where it is exactly but there but there's a way to set up like a um like a no like a node Affinity mapping um or a rack Affinity mapping so you can actually have like a specific um right here yeah so I say there it is there it is oh I'm sorry I'm looking right at the broadcast the text is a little tiny yeah I yeah yeah that that's where you can set up your your rack to you know rack -1 to match up with like us Central -1 or or something like that you know you could you could yeah so i' I've added r two racks in here so I'm gonna say three nodes per rack y you always want that to be a factor of your replication Factor yep that's right and look at there I've got six nodes total that are going to spin up now the question is where is this going to spin up we we'll look at this in a minute but you know this is Mion control when I say how many nodes I want it's going to deploy that in my kubernetes cluster that mission control EST yeah that's right and in fact you know you can specify that with the um the data plane control up above because yeah you you can you can deploy your cluster direct to the control plane or to one of the other defined data planes that you have I think I got in trouble for doing it putting in the control plane last time yeah for those of you who are looking at this name and going what what in the world of sports is um this is uh this is um kubernetes um and it's because we're running in GK this is Google Cloud um this this is our kubernetes this is our kubernetes environment for this particular setup and so um we just have a we have a setup with a label for this so yeah that's the data plane context um a lot of these concepts are in our docs by the way we're walking through these and of course reading the docs there's there's a lot of these have deeper explanation also planning like doing some cluster planning that sort of thing yeah okay host network uh we're just gonna say Auto on this um I love this read the docs before you do anything different it's like the cassander yaml that says like whenever the your your host IP address is never it's never Z or oh it's z0000 Z is always wrong that's what always wrong coms in the yam will see yeah yeah um so uh yeah so when then we have then we get into like per node resource stuff um and I mean what is there any gotches in here that you need to think about I I don't think so other than I mean what whatever you set here is going to be consistent across all of your all of your data centers you know so it's it's good in the sense you don't have to set it like like data center but I think that's something you want you know I I don't know that you'd want a data center that that you could provision with only like eight gigs of RAM or something I I don't know well yeah I mean just to be a little resource light but then you could also pick your storage class which is more or less linked to how kubernetes goes again we're separating Computing storage here um I'm just GNA pick standard SC and two gigs is f yeah yeah I think standard is is technically the equivalent of spinning disc you know so maybe it's good for for Dev but you know I don't know that I'd go I'd go beyond that but again in the docs we have resource planning and that's that's the one you pay attention to now if you make a mistake it's okay because you could always change things up you can always because this is kubernetes you can update and say oh no instead of eight gigs of RAM I want 16 and you know it'll reprovision pods it'll re it'll do some shuffling if you need to add more storage I mean there's there's options but um you know this isn't like ordering a server off of Dell and that's what you get and then you're what you get you get yeah yeah sorry that's what showed up um yeah then we have then we have this business of authentication to the cluster uh let's let's walk through this real quick now that's so I mean basically you you can Define um it it's just kind of like like starting a Cassandra cluster you know when you when you normally provision a Cassandra cluster one of the first things I mean at least that I do is go ahead and create a new super user account and then you know change the password on the Cassandra Cassandra one I'm gonna use the word password because no one guesses it's it's security right yeah no right but I mean I have to put in a password here right right and right now it's going to be this this username because I don't get to change it or I could just turn it off required and this is this is a powerful but interesting little slider here this enable internode encryption um let's let's dig into that so tell us a little bit more about what's happening there well basically that determines whether or not you want to use um inode TLS certificates um and the cool thing is is that uh Mission Control will manage the life cycle of your uh of your Cassandra certificates um which to be honest is super awesome I remember having okay this is probably 10 years ago now but I I remember having to like take a partial outage on a cluster so that I could I could update the Sears on it one data center at a time as I as I went along and I remember that that was just not fun for anyone it's I that's why I said this is such a powerful little slide I mean it seems so innocuous but it's like those of you whove done this you you will rejoice because it is a big deal and it uses certain manager behind the scenes and AC me which is if you don't know about that it will it's such a major Roi enhancement because not only does it handle the provisioning of cert certificates TLS certificates it also does a rotations and just keeps everything moving no security people will be upset you using Sur manager ever right um and then all right so backup and restore I feel like that's something we can touch on I'll let you do that yeah yeah so so the prefix is basically you know when you um when you run a backup or have a backup scheduled um that's how it's going to you know kind of kind of prefix the file names that that it that it sets up um and the directories too I think I'd have to check that um backup configuration that's something that you have to set up special now you absolutely can create a new cluster of hcd or you know or whatever inside a mission control without a backup configuration that is the cool thing kind of like you mentioned Patrick that hey if you have to go back and modify later that's one of those things that's really really easy to do um but the idea is that you create a um backup configuration that's aware of things like um like you're underlying bucket storage and maybe um you know your your service account Json and can actually go and like kind of tie together the uh the back end of where those where those backups and res have to happen from um so that's really what that's all about but yeah we can we can I actually have a video on that where I where I go through kind of kind of setting that up um but yeah we can we can skip that for now but it's definitely something that um you know I and I know a lot of people you know maybe don't back up their Cassandra clusters either but uh it's it's an easy way to um to set it up and give you that extra you know ability to recover from some kind of like data disaster so and there's two type of users out there those who have lost data and those who are about to I keep saying backup the backup for cassander I've said this for a bazillion years backups and Cassandra are not about data like losing a cluster it's about what your users wind up doing to your data like U data corruption you can back out of oh I mistakenly I've been there where I've had people like oh somebody somebody wrote some code that wiped out like a ton of Records well go back to you can easily restore that from the backup and because of the item potency of Cassandra data it's easy to restore yep all right cool uh and then of course if you if you know you know if you don't um read the little docs about this um 25% is recommended but you may want more that's totally cool yeah I I I usually go 50% of ram to heat so's let's do it you know live a little right yeah um and then I you know this have have we have you done a video on this yet on which one adding an external data center I have not I have not touched that one yet thanks I think well there you go there's your next thing uh but that's that's actually a pretty cool thing and of course it'd be adding the seeds for that um is the important part um you know the the the superpower of Cassandra there are three things that we started from the beginning of Cassandra project back in the day when it was just a little Sprout coming out of Facebook um which is you know scale which is the most you know scaling uh linearly which is important linear performance and then also distribution like we will never have a cassander database that can't distribute across multiple data centers and be active active that just just the that's a sacred right so yes and we maintained it um good so stay tuned for that one that'll be a really good one it's in the docs of course but I think a video of my eron would be really sweet and then finally deploy API yes or no that one's pretty simple yeah yeah and that this is and the the yes is based on how you want to present this to your uh to your developers and there we'll we'll go into it a little bit so I'm just go and create this puppy all right so once uh once I click the go button it goes through this thing where it's now provisioning you could see where it's provisioning nodes behind the scene um and it's provisioning three per per rack as I asked it to um this is all happening over in my uh Google area here I can probably see it firing up right now pretty soon uh this is in Google Cloud this is actually what's Running part of this right now so but that that was a peak behind the curtain uh we don't need to do that but I think what we should do eron is let's go look at your project and um you have a lot of stuff going on here that's good to kind of point out so yeah yeah so so test for Echo is uh is probably the probably the better example here um so so yeah um yeah I I'm I'm a bit of a fan of the band Rush so all of my all of my clusters are named after Rush albums and the and the data centers are named after songs you know and because Rush has played since you know the early 70s and actually before that but uh you know they there there's no end to material that I could use there so yeah wow well let's let's look at some of the stuff that's in here well first of all these are all running clusters yeah different data centers yeah y y I think I I made each of those at on hd10 um I think those nodes are 8 gigs each with ram and then 4 gig heaps and I think they're running e it's either 10 or 20 gigs of disc I forget oh it looks like 20 yeah oh oh No 10 10 10 gigs 10 10 that's it that's it yeah and then yeah and then you had a six gig Heap on 16 gigs yeah hey man you can make up whatever you want but the the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie oh you're you're not wrong there yeah yeah but you know it gives you this it's it gives you a lot of stats like threadpool stats things are these are things that come out of like no tool stats I was goingon to say things you'd normally have to go to node tool for yeah and it kind of puts it Mission Control puts it all in one place which is really cool I think the other thing that most people will want is pretty graphs yep yep yep yeah and again you you can see most of um you know all of the important things are going to be here um note that with with Mission Control you can actually um we went over this yesterday with with Chris Bradford you can actually you know ship your your logs you know from your clusters in Mission Control to an external observability Suite um you know so so we have customers that that do this with like like Prometheus um grafana is a is another popular one too um actually you know i' I've come to understand that admission control comes with grafana you just have to like know how to turn it on yeah there there's so much good content to be made and I I I saw Brian Fischer was in the chat Brian works on our doc team and um I think he'll be he'll be doing some really interesting dock Dives on um on connecting to external resources like data dog or your Prometheus cluster that you already have um and that I think that's a really important point to make is observability is almost religion man it's like this is what I do this is what our team uses don't tell me to do something different and even worse don't be an island you know yeah these are neat and pretty graphs but I want it on one one place so we heard you we got that yep yeah and and you can set up like um like custom syns as well I mean you can send it to uh like um like data dog if you want to um you know or if or if you're rich you can send it to Splunk you know or very very very poor there's a way to customize that and kind of bring your own observability in the mission control as well yeah no I I love Splunk we we use Splunk at data stacks for our cloud and the amount of St that you can get out that think it's just crazy yeah yeah I used it before at Target it's it it's cool but yeah yeah it's uh it's a little pricey it's a programming language it's a storage medium no it's both um we'll go into the connect a little bit later uh you know that that's you know this is very similar to how Aster Works where it gives you like how to do different languages and we'll go in that a minute but I think let's get into this uh into day two things here so like backup so you wanted to like you wanna want me to something I actually um for for this this this is the the cluster that I used to make my my backup and restore video um that I I came out with a couple of weeks ago um so so the backup activity that you're you're seeing here is just for you know like like um oh let's let's see here yeah I I didn't schedule it it it was it was a oneoff backup it was like hey go ahead create backup kind of a thing sorry sorry what I can look at a different cluster if you want to look at the schle no this this is this is good this is good um and actually probably it's probably better if you have a look at the activities um tab in the left nav there there you go so yeah so so what you can see is you can see the um the different um backup operations that have run um I think one of those is a restore that I I also did um and I think I I think I have one on on my other cluster that that's kind of hung up there as well permanent waves is permanently backing up yeah but that that's the thing you know we're we're I was going to say where we go back to talking about like you know how Mission Control gives you things you'd normally see in node tool um this saves you from having to do like a um oh what is it like like a node tool compaction yeah no tool compaction stats I think oh wow it's been so long since I yeah yeah yep no not no tool compact don't do that no tool compact no no no no don't do that um let me back to your yeah and then if you you go back and then yeah test for Echo and then say repairs oh repairs something else but no rep repair is good too repairs are good too yep yep so yeah repairs are things that you know of course you you can schedule um or you can run a one-off I'm pretty sure oh I do have a schedule look at that got to click over and see yes I couldn't remember if I created a a scheduled repair or not but yep yep that's important I think this is really the cool and this is the ROI part is you know you can a lot of those day two operations the backup repair you just set up schedule and let it run and um it it just works and there's some great configuration for it so um I'm sure if you're running cassander clusters I'm sure you already have a processor too but this is one maybe you're using Reaper you know I know that's something that that we've set up before um but but again this this is Reaper under the hood and it you don't have to set it up it's just kind of there yeah it's you can see the nodes running there um well great um I think this is what I wanted to show here should we switch back over and talk about some of the like so I think where we're at the point where okay so we oh let's let's make sure my cluster set up let's not let not leave everyone hanging yay it's there starting it's still starting oh you two noes up right is that one in each oh it's one DC at a time okay is it yeah well it's doing one rack at a time so it's it's setting one rack at a time that's it that's yeah because it has to do the um the token ranges so yep as prescribed by the documentation starting up in a very orderly manner well done mission control um so okay so once we have so we walk through like what HDD is so like would you even want it um and um Dan is waiting for 5.1 so I'll go talk to the dev team immediately um look let's hook up Dan I'm just gonna have that absolutely yeah got yeah we got you man um and then we talked about like what what do you do like how do you provision it so let's talk about like all right what's next is uh let's let our developers connect to it so let me switch over to that yeah um jump back to the the old slides here hang on yeah R of these slid that shows uh it's this thing hey there we go so so yeah so before getting into um you know connecting up and and how you do that um you know hey just just a quick talk about like hcd and especially when you run it through um you know when you're using it through mission control um well you have this this basic component which of course is your htd cluster that you know that has all of your nodes so Patrick if you you click there um you'll notice that the cluster nodes all have like internal IP addresses um and those are things that you know typically you know you would expose so that your your Dev teams can go ahead and go ahead and use that um or if you're running Cassandra in a in a kubernetes world you'll probably stand up a load balance so you can go ahead and click and one more I feel like I'm provisioning wood balancers now that's great right so so basically yeah it's it's it's simple it's it's um I'm sure everyone you know kind of knows this stuff already it's yeah putting putting your your nodes behind a you know a load balancer or a virtual load balancer or whatever to um you know kind of for those requests along making sure that it's it it's getting to um you know the nodes that it it needs to get to um but the the other thing if you go ahead and click next we also have the data API um and the data API kind of runs as its own service and you know kubernetes World it runs you know also as its as its own pod that can be exposed um and in this way you can you can decide hey you know with hcd well maybe I still want to use um cql for for my applications or for for new things that I'm building maybe I have a lot of things that have been running on Casino Sandra for a couple of years and 9042 is going to work perfectly um or if you want to use the the new data API Paradigm you know you can use that as well as long as you kind of expose that and then you can connect to that on Port 8181 and and real quick data API equals compatibility yep yeah yep it's it's working right it's working with it in a in a document database Paradigm that's right that's right yeah so developers who are building on will have zero problems working with the data API maybe you want that you probably do maybe you want that yeah so let's get get into all right so and that's the thing this is kubernetes and so this is so funny like at cucon there's plenty of talks about like I've set up a kubernetes cluster how do I get to it you don't connect directly to the nodes anymore nope nope um but but but yeah you know the the probably the most key thing on this slide is that big bold purple depends on infrastructure um but bottom line yes you do you want to make sure that um that you're exposing um those ports of 8181 for the data API and uh 9042 for uh for for cql and those are going to be you know in a kubernetes world running on different pods um so of course if we go ahead and look at the next slide um you can see this is the uh command line hacky way to do it uh with a uh you know a port Das forward via Cube control um specifying you know the uh the two port and the front port and then um your your name space so yeah it's not hacky this is this is the way this is the way it it works man it's just you know you want that fluffy front end go ahead although load balancers are you know that load balancers per cloud provider um you know that's a built-in thing with all their kubernetes stuff so you would have to worry about it too much um and they they have infinite scale they're just amazing how much you can get out of a load balancer yeah right right so when you authenticate up um you you can you can still go the old way like I said of of using you know 9042 um cql binary protocol and that takes your you know Cassandra username password that you're that you're used to um or you can generate a token um and actually you can use I'm pretty sure you can use a token oh maybe maybe I'm not correct on that I maybe I think it's just for the data API I don't know that you can use well or is it would would a token work straight up with with hcd using cql I don't know that it would I mean I know Tech we do Astra yeah because he uses AST right right I'm GNA say I'm gonna say it confidently yes and that may be a chat chbg response right but yeah I believe with the new driver it can take a token um but you know it's worth making sure I know you have a video about part of this I do have a video about part of this yeah yeah that that actually I I talk through the next slide that you're going to see too so of course if you used Cassandra for a while you're probably wondering well okay I know where I get my username and password where do I get a token from well so essentially you can compose your data API token from uh this little Coupe control command which basically what it does is um you know pulls out a um you know pulls out your super user from the uh from the The Secret store and um gives you the base 64 encoded username and password so if you go on a little Patrick one more does it really have blah in the password that's so weird no that's that's that's my way of not getting yelled at by our our security team and we do yeah if we anytime we put a token up we get an immediate email yes yes we do we do um so so yeah if you run this command it's it's going to give you back the base 64 encoded um username and password so my username is permanent waves super user but it'll come back from this command as 64 Bas encoded um and then basically you just put it together with a string of Cassandra Capital C and then colon your B 64 encoded username colon B 64 encoded password that constitutes your token uh this is and this is a lesson we learned in Astra is developers prefer this and it's easier to work with when you have like a application based token and you can put different you know for oper it means that you can give give out tokens that have certain permissions and that everyone uses the same thing um don't put this in your public repo but it's out there and you can revoke the token and you know it's instantaneous unlike having to go through the username and password you know people typing passwords and everything uh yeah tokens are much easier to work with you're absolutely right and that people so much prefer this um I remember when I first started at data stack that with Astra we were still using like um to connect up you needed like the database ID you needed the region you needed your um and well I think it was a a user ID and then like a secret um and then your secure connect bundle no now we just do token and it just like does it all yeah it does it all definitely okay now you can connect to your stuff so you built you you know what it is you can build one and you can connect to it I think at this point you should just go try it out um we have so I think so we have some resources for you um I know don't don't don't worry about typing this this is just you know for later but it'll be in the description and I believe uh Michelle's putting them in this Michelle's gonna get these out there yep yeah so I mean the the YouTube playlist if if you didn't get enough errand today there's more uh but I Erin I really appreciate this playlist and just to let everyone know the reason I appreciate it is because you you turned it into these little nuggets these bite-sized chunks like do a backup do a repair you know each each video is at separate topic use a data API yep build cluster yep and and he's cranking out more and more of these and we came up with a couple of day yeah for sure for sure yeah and our HD docs uh are getting beefed up at a really rapid Pace like I said shout out to Brian who's on I know he's watching he just waved at us on the chat but uh Eric r many of you know from the Cassandra Community he's also pretty involved in HD docs I mean we're just and feedback is important if you see something that's missing on any one of these we want to hear because we're we know we got stuff to build and there's more to talk about there's never enough so always you know you could find us in the usual places um just looking at my LinkedIn I see many of you found me on LinkedIn great so yeah Aon uh I think were're both pretty also active on the ASF slack um yep that's right that's right um but yeah you know that's a good call it about the the docs Patrick and that um yeah if you see something in docs that doesn't quite look right or isn't working for you let us know um just because there's a lot of times that we see the stuff every day and when we see stuff in the docks we may glaze over it because we really know it we really kind of know you know how to go about it anyway um so the the docks may not mean the same to us as they do to you guess is kind of what I'm saying um so if you if you see issues it they may be things that we just gloss over because we see them every day so and you know what's really cool this is very different from like uh like a lot of uh open source projects where they're like oh you found something broke in the docks well we'll take a PR no right this is awesome because you could just tell us and we have people we do it that yeah yeah so that's that's nice don't don't hesitate just say it get it out there um cool all right I think we are done um again you know we were out there uh in all the places where you like to be um we're in slack we're at a few different places so um please uh LinkedIn connect with us tell us about what you're working on if you have any questions we're more than happy to get on a zoom with you um we have some links uh that you should follow for sure if you want a free consultation meaning working with one of our solution Architects to talk about hcd as you know how does it work in my environment like here's my kubernetes environment here's how I want to run Cassandra um maybe you don't want to run HD maybe you want to run Cassandra a different way talk to us we've got a lot of options um but you know in 2024 we have a lot of options because we have so many options right there's Cloud there's not Cloud there's yeah still not going to run it on Raspberry Pi don't ask but we have some cool videos about that too if you go look yeah it's fun but not in production um but yeah just you know sign up for there's on our page on our homepage there's a sign up for a free consultation we'd love to talk to you about it and see where you're up to so um and I would be happy to join that call Aon will join that call so absolutely absolutely great thanks everyone and we'll see you in the next work chat all right hey thanks everyone all right okay",
