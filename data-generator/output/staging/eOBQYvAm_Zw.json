    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed in building large-scale distributed systems so it's been a year yeah we're back at day to day Texas we are we can't stay away from this place can we I mean it is the only conference that I come to that consistently has Bud Light Lime at the speaker's party have you found anywhere else no and that's why I come to I also barbecue and barbecue Bud Light Lime and barbecue for the speakers that is Austin in a kind of in a nutshell right yeah if anyone else knows of a conference with Bud Light Lime feel free to reach out to me on Twitter I'm always looking for more opportunities like lime all right well that being said it's been a year so what last time we talked about what was new was smart yeah years a long time in software they can saw careers that's what that's one year I think actually yeah yeah it's about the same yeah it's exactly the same especially cuz it's open source so it's really more like about a quarter yeah it's like a quarter of a real year yeah so open source let's have a lot of arguments and we'll do stuff so yeah yeah 2.4 coming up so 2.4 already out very excited so many cool features the Apache arrow integration keeps getting better I'm really excited about it it's you can now do arrow accelerated UVs and what this means is that Python VM and the Java VM are able to coordinate together so much better room right and not just Python I think the our integration I don't remember for sure if our integration went into dot for but I'm I'm like 90% sure it did I don't remember seeing a lot of our anything anymore yeah it's true there's not been a lot of work in the core smart stuff on our a lot of it's been happening by the our studio folks and another sort of project and it's based on the spark our stuff so it's a little bit confusing sort of where some of that code lives but I'm pretty sure that you can use our with arrow and spark but if not it will be very very soon well it seems like Python is becoming more of a first class citizen every day oh yeah very much so I mean I it's not just that I don't understand the arts in tax I think Python is a great language and there's been a lot of an investment in in Python specifically for spark there's there's multiple committers actively working on it I mean the the folks at IBM my old former employer thank you for paying me money I've been doing some excellent work there too yeah they got a lot of people working on it they do I'm Brian Cutler is is the probably the committer most focus on that and the works been really good and the Apache arrow project is also like a separate project and just just does a thing if it's if it's okay Apache arrow has explicitly asked for more people to help with doing code reviews okay we're also about to do the same thing in spark because we're in this place where we have like just too many changes coming in and we just can't keep up with government well code integration and this is this is a hard part I think with open source software is when you have a lot of different parts and they're different people maybe different teams all working on the same thing yeah and then it all goes into one repo now it has to work together and ship yeah it does and it's really hard right and and the reviews are often really the challenging part right and we're seeing this like Brian's been doing great work reviewing a lot of those arrow hashes coming in that's really solid but in some of the other areas we could really use the help from other people so if you have experience with Python specifically if you have experience with Python and Java you are like a very small pool of people and we would love to help you involved in doing code reviews with spark so that we can do some I mean I think like I know Python in Java I mean I mean I'm doing I'm trying no I don't miss the problem I got I got work to do great so the problem is the the group of people that know both Python and Java do seem to tend to be what's called employees yeah and that's the problem - you know say unless there's your Jo be doing code reviews can take a what and you do you do live stream your code reviews there really are reviews and you can check them out on YouTube and they are longer it's youtube.com slash users slash hold in Cairo but yeah nothing personal every time you do them right all business mostly I try I try really hard well like I want to be clear for other people who are like kind of intimidated by the idea of diamond card reviews it's like totally okay to just like do one file right you don't have to do the entire thing we can just come and help out for the bit of time that you have and like if you could just just for one hour a week you too could help save me from a life of enterprise support contracts I feel like this is a pledge drive it is it's like you know something yeah call now get your creds it doesn't give you credit it does actually it looks that's really important and I I mean I love our code contributors without them we wouldn't have their integration to start with well when I see people in Nigeria especially in an ancestor and they're you know they're contributing like hey I found this thing I think this me or something like that I'm like okay you're involved yeah that's great that's amazing yeah but the the people who people who will cherish and remember are the people who do reviews right cuz like here's here's the thing it's like it's a funnel right the number of people who are able to help at this level yeah it's just really small and like I feel overwhelmed and this are you doing all the code I'm not I'm not but there's there's like three people who are doing the code reviews for the Python integration and they're lovely people does anything tagged as like low-hanging fruit so this is the problem that we do have is that them no no no that there are things tagged as low-hanging fruit but the things that are tagged is low-hanging fruit like I can use I can review those really easily right so I don't really need the help with those what I really want is I want other people to take a first pass on the things which are kind of gnarly right and give like an initial like yeah this looks reasonable this is my understanding summary so that I can come in and be like yeah this is great I'm gonna spend like the six hours on this that I need to or you know this other person will take a look at it be like this is super gnarly these are the things I think we should fix first and I'll be like yeah that's awesome I'm gonna come back when those things are fixed and put in the six hours and they just need to put in like an hour to gives a little ownership - it does yeah yes okay so we hover to lottery and now I realize like oh wait a minute but that is actually I think just locks them with what's new you want more new get on the code reviews its do those people yeah like we have 500 open pull requests we can move so much more fast 500 sorry so much more quickly yeah five hundred give or take there was a time when I was going appetizer and shot it yeah all right so what's right so we got arrows my renovation all I was getting a lot better all that but the the real exciting thing is that spark 3 is the next thing on our roadmap and this means major version change it means that we don't even have to pretend we care about compatibility anymore dot 0 so good oh don't women prod so all the tech deck gets thrown away there is well we're tech right right because what happens is when you replace the sequel engine with a new one you don't have any bugs anymore right oh no actually actually all the old bugs magically feed forward oh so what we did last time is we we wrote a new sequel engine and we just closed all the sequel bugs oh yeah and I'm pretty sure we do the same thing again so it'll be a real exciting time no more testing yeah so I mean we do need more tests but like spark 3 is really cool we're gonna get a chance to take out all kinds of mistakes then what's gonna get dropped I agree oh okay because that's the time where we do these things yeah it broke ated removed so python 2 7 I'm not like I'm not we promising 3 in the future bye-bye 2 to 7 is gonna be heavily deprecated in spark 3 like you can probably still run it but I'm not gonna test it yeah so it is on you yeah um and like Ria's gonna be I mean that's I think you can safely get it over that now the only things still using any Python 2x stuff is probably stuff that was written like five years ago oh we can't talk about that right yeah yeah no I'm the microphone definitely we're gonna pick that up so we're good no not at all yeah yeah that okay well you're right that's great so go Python to now is a great time to get started on your Python to the to migrations you haven't already so I mean that's that's one of the things we're probably gonna get to finally kick out sparking my live which is our old legacy machine learning library what's really exciting yeah yeah that's true I mean I easily do that no I trained a lot of I trained a lot of linear regression models with that in fact I'm actually training one right now omi live well yeah there's a long story for why it's on ml live rather than SPARC ml but we haven't reached the Bud Light Lime portion of the conference another day another camera roll it'll be fine well there's here yeah oh my god there's any way we could just do a whole side tomorrow I'll let me do that some day like dry bits oh that's just my live stream oh that's just your live stream so yeah that's cool I'm only I do it at 9 o'clock in the morning so I'm sober at least half the time yes I'm all about coffee no that's great no one knows what's in your coffee cup on our live stream not at all okay all right so we got we're getting rid of some Python ish stuff maybe kind of sort of non-committal but yes but then big features that are gonna they're the new thing yeah so I'm not working on the screaming part personally but I think we're gonna see some really big stuff happening in spark streaming that's really exciting we're taking another crack at the data source api's because I know did you use the news wispy too if you guys a lot yourself personally I have okay so there's been a lot of complaints with them I use pearl so I don't feel like I can judge oh man you and I should have DVI okay yeah so we're gonna we're gonna rewrite our data connection layer again so that's really exciting because there's there were some serious issues there so if you're a database vendor this is once again another exciting time for you to provide all you can in connector what do you think it's gonna be a relatively smooth upgrade path it's looking like that soon some new functionality that people are really asking so they can provide a better experience to spark and sort of give it the information it needs other thing that I'm excited about I can't promise for sure is the kubernetes integration is becoming much less of a heart what's that expression dumpster fire yeah yeah so uh uh we're we're starting to put out the dumpster fires and its really exciting is that a convenience operator oh no there's three of those Oh from do we have mini to VicRoads what's happen which one you do you like I like the one that works so yeah so my solution has been data forth it doesn't work either but it'll be release who talked about this last time and that was build the answer yeah but I think this is kind of our communities is right now anyways it's kind of a wild west there's a lot of exuberance I'm making it to work and then you know I get a lot of choices and then eventually it'll just kinda go what's the exciting things that I'm seeing happening for for spark with kubernetes are there is a proof-of-concept shuffle service where it already and it's really important because it's gonna let us bring in dynamic scale up and scale down scaled down is the hard yeah that one's that plenty is the one that sucks I can always add more resources rather I did have to make a quarter of requests for six terabytes of SSDs let's get it back you scale it down oh yeah no no no no okay so um well it'll start to support better scale down and another one that I'm working on personally is scrim earnings actually does a a better job in my opinion this is like a personal preference sort of thing then yarn of communicating essentially pod migration or container migration more or less and so I think we can start doing some more intelligent things around sort of container migration so what's really important for people who are doing dynamic scale up and scale down on the underlying kubernetes cluster not just the spark nodes on the cluster because you want to be able to shut down entire executives I can see how that would be really useful especially in a cloud environment yeah I mean I happen to work at a cloud provider what a shock - this is what I work on right yeah but this is like everybody's using cloud right yeah no thank God yeah everybody let's we're all jumping in the pool now but this is scale up scale down is like that's a cloudy notion because when I'm paying by the hour or by the minute yeah it makes a difference I don't want to run all day especially doing nothing yeah speeding infrastructure doing nothing you know the number one thing I found this out fun tangent number-one concern across all levels of use of cloud usage and cost control I mean I don't that means my cough some ops people to developers to sea level everyone has the same concern cost control yeah so if you didn't work at a cloud company you might be worried about that yeah I mean I am worried that my boss will find out how much I spend but like as far as I know everyone will find out like you're just burning infrastructure some way I mean I know how to make sense right like cuz at some point someone might come and be like wait which one's more expensive you're the machine right Anna fencer is the machine your news yeah yeah all right there anything else so we need to talk about on that rework three to three main engine machine learning changes Oh actually yes so one more things but wait now one more like this look Steve Jobs yeah oh wait here yeah ah deep learning is this how Facebook knows everything about me probably yeah so I can do this at home now this is awesome yeah um deep learning is that's the creepiest part of AI think right now so I'm gonna refrain from comment based on the suggestions that I received from our valued partners in the PR groups let's focus on the technology changes it let's focus on the technology yeah so deep learning is going to be a part of spark sort of is the answer it's it's so it's happening in a very interesting way compared to the other components in spark right right specifically it's happening to me in a much more hybrid way so what we're seeing is the the support required for the pipeline to like build a deep learning pipeline is going in spark for the most part but the components to actually do the deep learning are living out in separately foes so it's like a almost like a pluggable storage layer yeah it's like yeah we acknowledge that this exists but bring your own implementation it looks a lot more like the datasource connectors than our machine learning library right it's like you should build two or these and like to be fair because it's a new thing like they're building a lot of the bridges themselves right but it's it's really nice because it means that I don't have to understand deep learning code because if that was in course part I would have to learn a lot more just not having and it's so really it's a really nice boundary that I can pretend that I won't have to learn the other side of it you tell at least six months after spark three trips yeah and I I don't want to learn about either but I think that's interesting that there is potential abstraction layer abstracting abstract thinking yeah that's great what could go wrong omid uh I guess we'll find out real soon huh spark three is gonna take some time I would not worry about it feeling next year and day to day that's what we're gonna talk about so next year at day to day we'll talk about why spark three is later should we just do it now okay so a generic excuses are really value the contributions coming from the community but at this time we don't have enough reviewers code reviews yeah back to basics we're really excited about the latest release candidate however there seems to be some different groups within the community who have different opinions about if we're ready Viva Viva open-source yep the other one we decided at the last minute that we're gonna add a shared memory bridge but it turns out that it keeps giving us native code exceptions and no one here remembers how to debug those anymore you can all right so hold on native code on Castillo and Java that's the classically hard impossible problem indeed yeah what could go wrong because we're not gonna no no it's okay it's okay through the magic of Apache arrow shared memory buffers LLVM Python and Fortran you too can train a deep learning model I'm gonna quote to be higher there is no magic there is magic you just don't want to know what it is okay so you're ending this spark three magic yes work three is gonna be magic and definitely buy a support contract or whatever it is my boss sells awesome all right got in that shameless plug that is quite an overview I think that's everything promised we're gonna see what happen that word promised no no I like everything discussed yeah we'll see what lands alright perfect BAM alright it was we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show
