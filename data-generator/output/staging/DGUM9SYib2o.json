    "text": "[Music] in this section we're going to discuss traversal behavior and predictability this is a really fun and interesting topic that can help you take your graph skills to the next level so okay that was cool to say but what's this guy talking about for starters it's important to appreciate that each graph is different graphs are kind of like people in that regard they share certain similarities but they also have things that make them very unique techniques that would work great with one graph might fail miserably with another and vice versa it also stands to reason that you're using dse graph because you anticipate having a large data set in this case being able to gather and understand the characteristics of your graph is critical to developing traversals that will perform well at scale for example a between a centrality algorithm that runs great on a 20 person social network might not hold up so great when scaled to a network with millions of people and wouldn't it be nice if you can't anticipate that ahead of time well that's what we're going to discuss in this section so let's get started the factors that affect traversal performance can be broken down into two high-level categories graph complexity and traversal complexity we're going to start by taking a look at graph complexity we'll be primarily focused on characteristics related to the size of the graph and how the vertices are connected sometimes we refer to this as a graph's vitals because it's similar to a doctor measuring a patient's weight height blood pressure age etc you know all the basics no surprises on this next slide just like a nurse measuring a patient's weight and height we're going to start by looking at the size characteristics of the graph the traversals you see here are pretty straightforward i'm particularly fond of the second pair where we look at the vertex and edge counts by label since most of your traversals will likely be confined by label quick pro tip the data stack studio bar chart and the gremlin group count step go together like peanut butter and jelly if you work through the exercises you'll get to see this in action but either way i highly recommend giving it a shot once you know the general size characteristics of your graph you can start to look at how the data is connected which is when things really get interesting and just to motivate this a little bit the reason this is so important is because these are the characteristics that will influence how much data a particular traversal touches as it executes these three gremlin traversals that you see here basically all do the same thing which is that they compute the degree distribution of the graph the first reversal looks at both incoming and outgoing degree and the later two are specific to in degree and out degree respectively the output of these traversals is also really easy to visualize using data snack studio highly recommend you give it a shot it can be very enlightening to see this information in a visual format it's a really great way to get familiar with the aggregate personality of your graph in these reversals we're looking at information that's fairly similar to the previous but we're getting more of a summarized view so to speak by inspecting the mean minimum and maximum edge counts per vertex label i'll point out that when you're thinking about traversal performance the max order is probably the most critical value because that influences the worst case scenario branch factor what do i mean by that well suppose you're executing some sort of social network analysis algorithm it might run great for most folks but things could go off the rails when you run into someone in the network who is super ultra popular and has millions of adjacencies so you can get a feel for that risk by looking at these metrics along with the degree distributions from the previous slide all right i think it's time for some pictures to help clarify what we're talking about here as i mentioned earlier graphs are kind of like people and that they share certain similarities but also have characteristics that make them very diverse you can really see that with these three graph types the lattice graph is extremely uniform each vertex has exactly two three or four edges this is a very straightforward and predictable graph then we have the scale free graph which is designed to mimic the power law degree distribution of most naturally occurring graphs this is probably the most interesting graph type because it tends to show up very often in nature real world scenarios such as social networks protein to protein interaction networks semantic networks and even airline networks then you also have your random graphs and honestly i think the most interesting thing about them is that early graph scientists thought that they would be great for simulations but in fact found later that they're typically not very accurate like i just mentioned a scale-free graph would probably be a better fit for most graph simulations that said it's still important to understand the different types of graphs what their characteristics are and how to spot them so let's look at the degree distributions for each of these types in these charts the x-axis represents the degree and the y-axis represents the percentage of vertices that have that degree the lattice graph is really simple because each vertex can have two three or four edges depending on whether it's a corner vertex a side vertex or one on the inside you can see that the distribution is very uniform obviously there are only four corners on a square so the number of vertices with degree two will be fixed at the count 4. the number of edge vertices is determined by width and height of the lattice all the remaining vertices make up the area on the inside the random graph will have a degree distribution that roughly follows a gaussian distribution and again i want to point out that you should probably resist the urge to blindly use random graphs for simulations there are situations where that might make sense but in most cases you'll be more accurate using a scale-free graph which as you can see here has a degree distribution that follows a power law curve which means that most vertices have a small number of edges and a few vertices have a very high number of edges if you think of the obligatory social network example you can imagine that most folks fall on the left side of the graph humans tend to have a monkey sphere of approximately 100 individuals so it's pretty common to see friend counts in this range but then you have your celebrities your politicians your super famous people who have extremely high number of friends or followers and those are the individuals that make up the long tail of the power law curve all right so let's work through an example where we collect the vital graph metrics and start to think about how these different graph characteristics will influence our traversal performance as you just learned we start by looking at the size of the graph and you can see here that the cycle graph and star graph have identical sizes of nine vertices and nine edges it should also be immediately obvious though that their degree distribution and other degree related metrics are very different in the first line here we take a look at the degree distribution and we can see that it's pretty simple every vertex in the graph has two edges so we see that for degree two there are nine vertices and you can see that the behavior of these traversals is very predictable we sample a random vertex and then begin a breath first search over all of our adjacencies and you can see that our counts increase very predictably additionally you can see that the simple path is always the same so let's contrast that with the star graph here we're running a very similar traversal but note that the results are quite different if we look at the degree distribution we can see that there are eight vertices with one edge and one vertex with 10 edges so you can see how different our counts are for a similar breadth-first traversal like we did on the previous slide and the same goes for the simple path count as well the key takeaway here is that we started with two graphs of equal size but quickly learned that the traversal behavior of identical traversals was very different because of the characteristics of how the vertices in the graph are connected and that's really what this is all about you want to get familiar with the characteristics of your graph so that you can make accurate predictions about how it will behave in different traversal scenarios so what did we learn for the cycle graph we saw that the flat degree distribution led to a very predictable traversal performance on the flip side we learned that the star graph has a more skewed degree distribution which can cause drastic deviations in performance and trust me this is really important stuff to understand ahead of time because it's pretty easy to have a traversal that works great most of the time but blows up when you land on a super node like a popular celebrity or a major airline hub now let's switch gears a little bit and look at the characteristics of a traversal and how they influence performance here are a few things you want to keep an eye on if you're familiar with the term code smell then you can think of these as those types of characteristics of traversal smell these are clues that indicate that you might be doing something a little sub-optimal for starters if you have a large number of steps then you're introducing additional computational complexity nothing surprising about that more steps more work to do the next two items are kind of related if you're traversing down long paths or iterating over a particular operation many times then dc graph is going to need to do a lot of work and or touch a lot of data again this seems pretty obvious when you think about it but remembering to consider these things usually turns out to be the hardest part be careful about how you use side effects steps side effects take up a lot of memory which can become an issue at scale lastly be aware of how much data a traversal is going to touch if you're performing a full graph scan which i would like to point out is a risky operation that should be done with care then you need to be cognizant of how much data you're going to touch and what the realistic performance of that will be there are a few gremlin steps that tend to be more expensive than others not all the time but these are steps that you should be careful with starting with the most expensive your path steps all of these steps require some path history which is quite expensive from a memory footprint perspective as it gets saved for every traverser so we talked a lot about how to identify potential hazards but we haven't discussed yet what you can do to work around them now there's no single right solution here so my best advice is to be smart and get creative but i can provide some guidance for starters sometimes you may have no choice but to modify the graph itself i've definitely seen folks who were successful by eliminating outlier super nodes from their graph in order to achieve acceptable performance in a way that did not noticeably alter their results more often than not though you will be focusing on improving your traversal the first step in that effort is always to minimize your initial working set to the greatest extent possible you want to utilize indexes wherever possible and in some cases you can even rethink your approach get the same or similar results using a different technique as we discussed on the previous slide side effects can be very memory intensive so you want to use them cautiously lastly sometimes it might be possible to get an acceptable result by sampling and or limiting your working set if you want to learn more about this topic then i encourage you to search datastax graphvitals and you'll see a datastax blog post titled grapho endodonticology thanks to my buddy dr marco rodriguez for choosing a title that's easy to say on camera great post though i highly recommend reading it finally i want to point out again that a lot of these concepts aren't super complex in practice the tricky part really tends to be remembering these simple ideas and applying them it's easy to get caught up in the initial implementation and accuracy of your traversal without considering how it might perform at scale so the best advice i can give you is to simply take the time to consider these things you now have the tools so when the time comes put into work and give it a test run in the exercise",
