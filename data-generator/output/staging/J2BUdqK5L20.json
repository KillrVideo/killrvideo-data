  "description": "Jonathan Lacefield is working on efforts with DataStax Enterprise Graph, and today Adron speaks with him about graph while at San Francisco Graph Day 2018! We delve into super nodes and adjacency lists to start with. But eventually we move from the aspects of what super nodes and adjacency lists give us to what we are doing and what we’re looking for with graph data and graph database solutions.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems I made it all and this is Jonathan Lacefield we're gonna talk to you about a few different things but the first thing we were gonna dive into is we were already kind of having a conversation and I just wanted to kind of elaborate on what we're talking about earlier so where were we on that okay first I just want to say you're you're a beautiful person I really like your look it's yeah you lose the glasses the gleam yeah okay there we go you know different different shot yeah okay so we were talking about we're at a graph conference I'm giving a talk later on something called super nodes what those are but you know whole presentation on that but we were talking about the adjacency list right roots or the what a super node is is a outcome or trade-off of using these things called adjacency lists which are data structures that are optimized for a graph processing yeah and we're talking about like how nice of a fit that structure is to the Cassandra data model itself so how does that match work with the data model yeah so you have these lists but you know yeah and that's - it's two things this is what the folks that originally built a graph database named Titan OMSI 2013 2012 a different Eon yeah but you know they're the team behind DAC graph yeah and it's it's the kind of one of the foundation ideas is an adjacency list really just stores the relationships around a central vertex yeah yeah why that's cool is that with one lookup I can walk out a graph mm-hmm from a certain vertex well if you think about that that is the same model as a Cassandra partition okay I have a partition key which would be my originating vertex right all the relationships are just stored in a very flexible model allows me to go out so that's that intersection is literally projecting a graph model on to a Cassandra database it's really taking the concept of an adjacency list right and storing it in Cassandra's wide row format cool okay so in that's a change that's pseudo recent well so this is the foundation of DC graph which we first introduced inside of data sex Enterprise in the five-o version okay which we continue to build upon and improve upon 600 was just out we're looking at our next release on the horizon we're gonna call it six seven we just soonish soonish that's right I'm in product management you know being an engineering Yates or evil so it's gonna be here when it's gonna be here no it's it's not that far off though and as you look at this concept of what it you know taking a graph model and putting on solid like standard table and you look at full context of data stacks enterprise-grade get into is really the the multi model story yeah built for a hybrid cloud right and all that comes with that and that's you know that's a very broad discussion but you know not from a change perspective but from a looking forward perspective having data that I can access through cql or gremlin great because it's stored all in the same kind of ways very very nice yeah yeah a dead plaintiff yeah it takes a lot of load off of not just the app development but you know the operations operational side of things too which is great um this this leads me to one of my other thoughts it's been bubbling around a lot in conversations today and I've been wanting to ask you yeah which is I've been talking with people about freight shipping tracking things nodes be like containers or whatnot it was just and just kind of fumbling into even the the different word usage sometimes collides a lot like containers for instance but what I was curious about is what are the domains that you see using graph a lot these days and especially like what's your own personal curiosity like what what would you like to see from four different domains out there like I'm I'm a freight shipping nut I love tracking and shipping and trains and planes and all that stuff and seeing where things go so I'm just curious like what what do you like to kind of dig into and look at sure so for some context here my view of the world these days is that there are graph problems yeah and then there's graph databases yeah graph problems are bigger really solve them you need more than just a graph database oh yeah so in you know the logistics use case is certainly one and the graph problems really center around wanting to analyze and process the relationships between entities right and really a lot of it comes down to what you're hitting on are the paths right how how do I go from this to this I know there is like in so some of the popular use cases that we see are our customer centric like give me an enterprise would want a single this has always been the panacea for for enterprises but it give me a true single then you yeah the customer but but graph technology it's truly graph problem graph technology helps enable that you know and by doing so you can also see who are your influencers right so it's not just paths but it's connectivities the connected components to use like a formal graph term I mean who are the most highly connected customers I have great right and is that am I looking at the folks that shop with us the most or that require the most help and support or are they where that trade-off is Ryan and you start overlaying like some social are they influencing other buyers there as well okay yeah so one use case we see a lot is this customer 360 yeah and different permutations of that in other words is logistics and path finding fleet management shipping oh yeah I haven't spoken to any but have more full carrier type yeah customers that are very large and then also it's a you know a little analogous to the customer but the product side of things it's actually brings both of these together so yeah product catalog inventory can be a part of that supply chain can be a part of that because I mean very graphy like yeah hi Tina oh yeah you know this flower goes down where door my other operate that's a problem yeah definitely and that leads to one of the other conversations which I found interesting is and this brought the conversation via Twitter about you got all these planes fly in different places with people go on different places and then all of a sudden every once in a while you'll see wow that's a really dirt cheap fare and what it boils down to like when you look at it tactically is an airline has flown a bunch of planes into a place and they've gotten people there right now they need those planes back out somewhere and they have too many into place yeah so they're just trying to they want to make it cheaper to relocate the physical plane from point A to point B so they sell the dirt cheap fares even though they lose money it puts some people on the plane to help cover the cost of getting it back out to wherever and the conversation just came up is like how do you map that out how do you start to figure out where they're trying to they've had too many flights go in so now they need to get some of the planes relocated back out to where they need to be for the higher dollar higher demand flights back into somewhere else so that's that's one of the things I keep looking at yeah as I just I find it very curious and I find myself manually solving the problem which is time-consuming I like I know how to find the fares but it's because I know you know I'm an airplane nerd some I know where they put airplanes I know what kind of airplanes they're flying I know what airports are hubs and things like that but then I like step back and go oh wait this is this is a pretty cool graph problem to try to try to figure out it really is its optimization and it's half yeah what it comes down to and there's a lot of different techniques to do that mm-hm but yeah that's essentially you know how what is my most efficient way to get from point A to point D yeah and overlay that on a full graph or you know a big subsection of your graph subject yeah absolutely you know we have we have we have folks in the airline and post and logistics and fleet management as well solving those problems today with DSC yeah and it's interesting and I mentioned DSC not just DSC graph this as a part of that right but you need you know heavy analytics capabilities there is you know and a lot of times a lot of search functionality yeah it really makes sense of the data and just like my own curiosity about the plain things the first thing I started doing is all right well what I need to start collecting the data so you don't just automatically put it in a graph like you just write infer you know you need to put it somewhere so the database itself is the perfect place you just start collecting it and then you can start to figure out how to pull out the pieces you need and put it where you need and then you can start graphing on it all right what what really gets interesting is the problems we you know vfc Grapher or DSC in general get involved with is you know the kind of mode you're taking is more of kind of a static view right but doing this based on live data oh yeah in a transactional system that maybe have a couple different workloads great going on right so that maybe you're you're ticketing system is falling through this Android component right DSC but then you also have this optimization that's running periodically based on that data yeah automatically getting updates and seeing these things live and it's really cool from the graph perspective you can watch your graph mutate and change oh yeah if you visualize this you'll see you know the more important nodes or vertices will become larger and your visualization and shrink down yeah you see the path so they they they move around as well yeah that'd be cool and maybe at some point when I'm done you know as a hobby collect and all that data figuring out what I'm flying on maybe I get the audience to join me and putting together some stuff you know and it might get real-time that'd be pretty awesome would be sweet yeah I love to see that cool so in just a little while you're gonna have a presentation and we're gonna record it and you are gonna be able to view this at a later time on the YouTube channel so subscribe go check it out it'll be published real soon so that's it for this distributed data show I'm Adrienne and this is Jonathan Cheers thank
