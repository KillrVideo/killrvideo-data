    "text": "hello everybody welcome to today's session today i'm going to take you through um connecting google cloud platform dataproc with datastax astra i'm going to be using some jupiter notebooks as well so a little bit of an overview of what we're going to do today we're going to be spinning up a google cloud platform dataproc instance and right now that's based off of 1.4 ubuntu 18 is the version we're going to be using and we're going to be connecting that to data stacks astra and the release that we're using of data stacks astra is based off of today's date which is august 17th 2020. and then the dataproc instance is going to have some jupiter notebooks that are associated with it that are based off of some previous data stacks sessions that we've done with a little bit of machine learning so be able to follow along with those as well um just a disclaimer before we move forward this isn't uh an official datastax guidance it's simply a knowledge share that i've put together and hopefully it can help you with a project that you're working on just make sure you check the versions and everything of what you're doing to make sure that they're all compatible okay so uh some resources that we have that are available to us um for this uh obviously you need to have a data stacks astra account um so if you don't have one uh already then um you know go and sign up for one there's a free tier that you're able to to use to follow along with what we're doing today it's very simple to do very easy there's multiple videos out there that show you how to do that i also have a repo uh github repo published with um all the code that is needed for this and the steps as well to be able to be successful in in creating this environment as well um and then as i said earlier this is uh based off of an original workshop that data stacks had put on so i've put the link in for that workshop i'm not going to be going through all of that workshop in fact i'm only going to be going through the the first notebook to just show the connectivity and everything but if you want to follow along and get insight into the entire notebook you can go and sign up for this workshop it's a workshop on demand and it will give you a lot more information of what you you may be looking for okay so path to success and these steps are laid out in the repo as well and i'll be taking you through each of one of these steps as well in this video so first thing you need to do is clone the repo onto your local laptop or desktop after you've done that go into that astra account that you have created and you need to download the cir secure connection bundle um once you've done that all you need to do is take that zip file and place it into the jupiter secure connect um platform or folder in your uh git repo that you cloned um next thing you need to do is uh rename and modify the astra connect package um what this uh script does essentially is it copies that secure connect bundle um from your uh google cloud storage onto the local data proc cluster so it makes it a lot easier to connect to to astra and i'll show that later as well and then optionally if you're going to use the gcloud scripting to create the cluster you'll probably want to rename and then modify that data proc creation script um and essentially what that has is a bunch of variables for uh the uh different region that you're going to be deploying in and the google cloud storage bucket that you're using and a couple other things so i'll take you through that as well and then what you need to do is transfer those files to your google cloud storage that you're going to be connecting to the data proc cluster and that'll put you know all the notebooks up in google cloud storage it'll put that secure package and everything that that you need to uh to do this demo and then um we're gonna go through the the create of the google dataproc cluster and we'll either use that uh google cloud script or the google console i'll show you both in this video if you're going to be doing this a lot then you'll probably want to use the google cloud script the gcloud script makes it a lot easier to to spin up multiple instances and then once that's done it's as easy as accessing the notebooks and running some examples so uh hopefully you find this uh this video informative and uh we'll uh we'll get started right now okay so the first thing that we're going to do is go through some of the resources that we have available to us the first thing i want to show is the github repository where all of the code and commands and everything can be found and this is actually based off of this original machine learning with apache spark and cassandra workshop that was done so you can click on here and it will take you to that that webinar that you can sign up for and go through all of the uh the notebooks and everything and learn a little bit about machine learning and then the original code the github can be found at this link right here uh some more useful information is uh just some installation and steps uh to uh complete this uh this example um you'll notice here that uh you know there's a couple of things clone change a couple of things download a couple things and then deploy the data proc cluster so one of the first things that you need to do there is uh go on to astra you can see this is the login for astro we're going to go ahead and log in log in to astra and uh we need to download the secure connection package which is located right here authentication secure credential or secure connect bundle once that's downloaded you'll need to put that into the repository where you uh downloaded your github repository so mine's right here you're going to place it in this secure connect folder you can see mine's right here secure connect dataproc and then there's a couple other things that you will need to do prior to moving this code to your google cloud storage so the first thing you'll need to do is in this gcp folder there's this example astra connect package and what you'll want to do is you'll want to rename that to just astra connect package and then in that you're going to change um this uh name right here from what i have it as mine to your bucket in your google cloud storage what that does essentially is it moves that secure connect package that you downloaded from astra onto the data proc cluster so that it's available from all the nodes to be able to to access dataproc the next thing that you might need to modify if you're going to be using google's command line tools gcloud tools is uh this dataproc creation script i'm going to go ahead and open that and that's what it looks like in the example that i have so you'll need to go through and and where it says your cluster name put your the cluster name you want a name and your book and everything but for readability sake i have one here that i'm going to use um just as an example to show what all is needed and we'll be walking through this a little bit later um in the uh in the example but the reason to do the modifications now is so that you can have this um script uploaded to uh to g cloud it's not necessary really that it's there but it's great to have it so it's kind of bundled together with that um so so now that i've done this i am going to go ahead and migrate all of this data then up into uh to gcloud so now that i've downloaded that secure bundle and i've modified those the files that i needed to modify what i'm going to do now is i'm going to copy the all of that information from that repository up into up into google cloud storage so you can see here um indigo dash dev that's my bucket here right now there's only one file in it so i'm going to go ahead and just copy this this command and you can see right here that i'm already in my uh my git repository for uh this code i'm just gonna go ahead and paste that in there and then i'm gonna go and change this um your bucket to match my bucket go ahead and hit enter there what that's going to do is it's going to copy everything that's in that git repository so those modifications that we made that secure connection package everything up into google cloud because that's some of those files are what we're going to use to create the cluster and then some of the other files are the jupiter notebooks that we're going to be using for the the machine learning so we can see that that operation is complete so i should be able to go over this bucket go ahead and hit refresh and we can see that there is now a notebooks folder with jupiter and then there's our notebooks there under secure connect we can see that our secure connection package is there under gcp we can see that our shell script that we're going to use to move that secure connect package to the the nodes is there as well the next thing we're going to do is go ahead and create the uh the cloud data proc cluster and i'm going to do this uh two ways the first way i'm going to do it through the console here and just using this create cluster button the next way i'm going to go through and do this active cloud shell where i just copy and paste the command and we'll go through that later so first i'm going to go ahead and click click uh this create cluster and it's going to pop up a screen it's going to ask me for a bunch of information so let's walk through this so first thing we need is the cluster name i'm going to call this indiego dev console so i know that i created this one through the console next couple pieces of information are about where you want the cluster placed and the size of the cluster so we have regions here the cluster mode basically masters and workers kind of the general configuration of the master nodes worker nodes um the number of nodes that you want in the cluster so this is all basically your scaling policy that you want around your cluster and how big of a cluster mine's pretty vanilla i'm just going to do a really small one for for this test to show you how it's done so i'm not going to change any of those there's also this advanced options that we're going to be changing several advanced options so i'm going to go ahead and click that to expand it but i'm also going to click this component gateway and what that does is it enables all of the the web interfaces to all of the different components that you may need to use on this cluster so for example we're going to be using jupyter notebooks so we want to be able to access the web interface for jupyter and by clicking this checkbox that is what's going to allow us to do that okay for network i'm just going to leave the default network you may need to do some different networking for your cluster depending on your environment okay cloud storage staging bucket so this is pretty important that we get get this right i'm just going to click this browse we want to make sure that we collect or reconnect to that bucket that you created before that you uploaded all of your git files to because that's what's going to contain all of the notebooks and everything that uh that you need to be able to execute those machine learning scripts on this dataproc cluster all right next is the image we're going to go ahead and change this image like i said earlier we're going to use this 1.4 ubuntu and then optional components we're going to add the jupiter notebook and as a requirement of the jupiter notebook we also need to make sure that we install anaconda as well so i'm gonna go ahead and select those okay uh so now we need to do initialization actions and there's actually a couple of initialization actions that we're gonna need um the first one and i've got them here is uh the um is the uh location of uh the connection package script that we created if you recall correctly we downloaded that secure connection package and put it into that directory and uploaded it to the cloud storage now what we need to do is we need to run that script that basically takes that connection package and puts it onto all of the nodes in the cluster so i'm going to go ahead and copy that and put that in here again that's the location of that connection package script and then the next script that we're going to need to put in here and this is going to be a region specific script mine just happens to be us central one this is a google script um it's an initialization action that google provides and that is to do additional pip install of some of the libraries that the jupiter notebook is going to need so i'm going to go ahead and put that in there again this us-central one is something that you'll have to change for your location okay cluster properties there's a couple of cluster properties that we're going to change here the first is a data proc specific one and that is for a java security that was recently implemented that essentially prevents the the secure packages from working so there is still the java security available it's just not this new conscript data security that's put on there so that's going to be dataproc it's this property dataproc.conscript that provider enable i'm gonna go ahead and just copy and paste that in there and we're gonna make that false and then we're gonna also add another property and this is gonna be a spark property and what this does is it tells spark that i am going to be adding additional jars to uh to my um to my cluster and the specific jar and i looks like i have a little bit of a typo there i'm just going to take out that equals so it's a spark jars packages and it is the data strap stacks uh spark driver that we're going to need for these uh for this connection okay and then the last thing that we need to do is we need to add additional metadata and this is going to be some additional pip packages that we we need to add so i'm going to go ahead and change it to pip packages and i am going to select all of these and those are going to be the additional pip packages that uh that i need um there's also some uh some additional advanced security and schedule deletions and stuff i typically don't change these except for the schedule deletion um if i'm going to be working on this for a while and then maybe have to go do something else i'm going to add a scheduled deletion if the cluster is idle just to save some some money and so i don't have a cluster that's out there running and doing uh doing stuff when i'm not working on it so typically i'll change this to maybe 24 hours or something so one of the cool things about google is you're able to go and get the equivalent rest or command lines so we're going to actually use this in the next step or the next creation process to do it from this active cloud shell so i'm going to go ahead and take a look at this command line here and it gives you the the whole command line that you need so i'm just going to go ahead and copy that and we'll just throw it into this document here in case we want to look at that i do have one already created but we'll have that one just in case we want to look at it so the last thing that you need to do is just hit create and what will happen is it will go and it will start to create and and then after it's done i'll show you how to get into the jupiter notebooks and start running uh some code so we've walked through the console way of creating the the cluster we can see that that's creating in the background there now we're going to walk through the the command line way of of creating it and this is actually if you're going to be doing lots of creating and deleting testing types of things this is actually a lot easier because you just cut and paste this command into the the cloud console and it'll kick off the build um so just to walk through a couple of the the modifications that we have made in the previous uh in the previous parts um this uh i've provided a template for this uh in the repo that um you know kind of has some some markers to go and change things but as we saw in the previous uh creation you can get that command line if you do a manual create through the console one time and then copy that that command i will point out some of the um one gotcha that you need to look out for when you're doing that but essentially in this uh gcloud command line you need to go through obviously change the name of the cluster that you're going to be changing if you remember we enabled the component gateway so we can see that that option is marked here on this next line here the bucket that we want to point to that has all of that information that we we moved from our our local git repository up into google cloud storage and of course the different regions that you want to put your um your cluster in and then uh the next couple lines are for you know just the master machine type boot disk size the workers all that type of stuff so after this properties if you remember from the console creation we had two specific ones um this one is the the conscript that enables uh or that disables that conscript provider and then adding the uh the spark cassandra datastax connector to uh to spark so that that's there and then optional components again we added jupiter and as a requirement anaconda had to come along with that if you want there's this max idle you don't have to do it but i do it just in case i get pulled away doing something else and i don't want the cluster just sitting out there spinning doing nothing project again is something that is uh unique to your organization so you'll need to change that for uh for your company um initialization actions this is um again where we did the uh um the astra connect package the script that takes that connection package that you downloaded um from uh from astra and then again uploaded into uh google cloud storage to allow um when the cluster is being created to move that connection package from that google cloud storage onto every node in the cluster and that's essentially what allows the dataproc cluster to connect to astra and then this uh initialization action for the pip install again you'll need to change this us central one for whatever region that you're in and then in the metadata if you were to look at the cluster creation um from the console it doesn't have quotes around this metadata so if you have more than one like i do so pandos and cassandra driver and numpy and and uh all those um you need to put quotes around that so that's the one thing that uh you need to go and and check and we can go back and i can show you this is the uh the actual console um creation that we just did and then i i copied the command line if we go all the way over to the end that shows all of those we can see that there is no quotes on that so you do need to modify this script just a little bit and put quotes around that otherwise it will give you an error so let's go ahead and do a creation of a cluster using just this so i'm going to go ahead and take this command line i have hard wrap on on this command so i can't uh i can't select this and use it because there's space is actually after this and it won't uh it won't paste right so i'm going to go ahead and copy this one we'll go over to google cloud and i'm going to activate this cloud shell essentially this is just a terminal in google that allows you to interact with um the google cloud and has all of their tools already provisioned and everything in here so i'm just going to go ahead and paste that action here and we can see that it's going to go ahead and it's going to start creating that that cluster there and pretty soon we will see that pop up here into the into the clusters so uh once that's done we'll uh we'll go through the the jupiter notebooks and show you how to access those and start working with uh with your data okay so now that we got the clusters up and running i'm going to show you how to get into your jupyter notebooks and start running some code so what you need to do is you need to pick the cluster that you deployed and go ahead and click on it and it's going to have a bunch of options down here we're going to want the web interfaces option so go ahead and click on there and um it's we're gonna scroll down and we're gonna look for the jupiter one and go into jupiter and that's gonna redirect us to a new page and there's to be two different uh folders you can look in here we're going to want to look in the gcs that's the google cloud storage one so you can see this is uh where all of that information was that you uploaded from your local repository up into google cloud so i can go over to my bucket here and i'm gonna see that same information here in notebooks under jupiter and then that's all of that same information and uh i've done an additional thing here i've renumbered these notebooks from the original webinar one through five corresponding um how they were looked at and i purposely did that because in this notebook number one there's a specific um part where you enter all of your data stacks and astra credentials that you're going to want to that's going to go ahead and save for all of the other notebooks so if you do end up going in and just running another notebook make sure that you come in and select all of this uh this box here and put it in that notebook so that you have that same information so we're going to go ahead and change that information for the cluster that i'm using now so my username is uh dataproc my password for this one is datastax my secure connect is a secure connect dash dash data proc and then this key space set i'm going to be using for this one is data proc okay one other thing to note is uh right now i'm having trouble uh getting these images to uh to show um but i'm working on that and if i find a way to get it done we'll uh we'll update the video so that those show up okay so let's go through this this notebook really quick this is just going to import a bunch of stuff that's needed we're going to create those variables for all of the notebooks and save those so we don't have to enter them a bunch of times again creating some some stuff that's needed okay so our first connection to cassandra this is going to use some of those variables that we created before but a couple to note so this astra connect package is in this slash temp remember in our shell script in the initialization of the cluster we copied it from the google cloud storage into this temp directory so that that connection package is actually on all of the nodes in the cluster so we'll go ahead and connect connect there we're going to set our key space there and we're going to create this table called social media go ahead and run that now it's interesting what we can do if we want is we can go over back over to our astra cluster and we can open up excuse me we can open up this developer studio and we can go ahead and create a new notebook here let's just call it data proc we're going to be connecting here so go ahead and connect and what we can do is we can look at the different schemas over here and say we're going to connect to dataproc and we can see that our tables the social media table that we just created from the notebook hearing in the data proc has been connected so what we're going to do now is we're going to get some data and again this is kind of a little work around that i had to do but uh working on a better solution i'm downloading that data storage onto the local server so that it's going to uh then run from the local into uh the astra database so let's go ahead and start putting that data in there and uh something really you know neat to do in case you want to see what this star is actually doing is we can go back over to this data stack studio and say you know select count from social media let's put a limit one on there so it doesn't complain but then i can see run this query and i can see that records are getting added into that uh that table as that's running come back and find out that it's it's done but um and then if you ever want to look at um you know any of the uh you know data that's in this table you can you know simply use this workbook and use cql to go and interrogate that okay so let's do some machine learning with apache spark i've created this app as demo one it's going to use this uh spark cassandra connection configuration with our secure connect package and then our username and password so let's go ahead and create that and that's going to run here in a second and it's gonna show us this uh this table row count pretty soon with uh that number of rows 6621 again if we want to verify that we can go back here 6621 pretty neat go ahead and take and take a look at what that data frame is now we're going to go ahead and just quickly go through the rest of these it's going to do per the original webinar some k-means machine learning on top of that data i'm going to do some training on it and then we're going to do some some pretty cool visualizations on some of the data all right and uh so that's the end of our session i'm gonna go ahead and uh and drop that table that we created so that if i want to run through this again i can do that and i'm gonna go ahead and stop spark just something to uh to be aware of if you ever wanted to see the spark details of what happened in this dataproc cluster you can go back to your cluster and you can open up the spark history server and it will actually bring up that see that demo one that's our session that we just got done um got done running so pretty neat there so go ahead and uh and take a look at the original webinar for additional information and thanks for watching my video i hope you learned something",
