    "text": "serverless functions offer the industry's best code to cloud experience that's available today there's no upfront investment to speak of and you can get started so quickly and there's little to no operational overhead they do however require some special considerations in development particularly with regard to handling persistent state functions are stateless by design their life cycle is managed by a cloud platform and they just wink in and out of existence right it's very common for functions to experience spiky usage where traffic volumes are shifting reliably and unpredictably however a lot of relational databases and other sort of instance-based or long-lived you know kind of non-auto-scaling databases are connection oriented meaning what meaning they're designed to work with a limited number of long-lived clients like web servers by contrast functions as a service or cloud functions are ephemeral and very short-lived meaning that their database connections are numerous and very brief if the function tier scales up to hundreds or even thousands of requests the downstream relational databases are just going to get completely overwhelmed with connection requests similarly scaling down even from reasonable heights can leave resources already allocated and stale connections that would deny subsequent requests from the function tier because the system is busy trying to figure out how to reclaim those resources if it gets reclaimed at all now sure of course you know do these databases have some sort of scaling capabilities of course they do but often you know even with some teams implementing do-it-yourself auto scaling uh you know you are using things like terraform ansible puppet chef you know these are essentially outside in approaches where you're basing it off a trailing indicator of load you're only scaling one cpu memory network disk or getting nearer to exhaustion and you know who wants to chase down shards and out of sync replicas i mean that's an out of operations nightmare especially when customers facing data is could be at stake now a cloud native or a serverless database should be able to observe the internal state of the database and based its scaling decisions off of that you know and of request volumes to enable better and more efficient scaling now auto scaling databases that can scale that intelligently should be able to analyze things in real time as well as look at historical data so that you're reacting to issues immediately and predicting future traffic patterns now sure scaling down of course is just as important as scaling up maybe even it's more important actually because it's the key to lower operating costs so databases that just can't auto scale down they'll never be able to compete because you know they're they're you're paying for that idle time uh even things even when you employ workarounds like connection pooling your connections are left open by design right so you're continuing to consume resources you know you're just never going to be as resource efficient um as your serverless auto scaling counterparts now traditionally the sort of apt database connection is made using drivers or native clients and then more modern databases have taken to exposing their data access layers in standards-based apis now exposing your databases as kind of an api really reduces the learning curve for the developer and the more fluent the api the less that how the database represents the world is going to kind of leak into your function code making it easier to read and write and debug of course test suite and release automation are also pretty important these days in modern application development so having an operational api is really important for ci cd pipeline integration now with astrodb the data api uh gateway implementation is an open source project called stargate uh it's you know and it does more than just automatically configure these you know uh data access layers uh via apis for each of your database instances it also further decomposes the monolithic system um in astrodb so that it's a microservices architecture it separates query coordination from storage right so um as different nodes in the cassandra cluster so your scalability isn't all or nothing um you know and that flexibility to scale you know uh um compute you know or query coordination from you know an i o intensive workload like storage means you can place it on hardware that's optimal for that task improving your cost efficiency now function to database connections with the traditional drivers can sometimes be tricky with serverless functions because often you know the traditional native drivers were usually designed to expect a long-lived server instance right you know hard-coded ip you know where's my virtual instance maybe even a file system that it expects to be around for more than a few hundred milliseconds um these are just not things that serverless functions truly provide so yes of course workarounds here are certainly possible and you know with modern drivers like the ones that are available from data stacks you know they can be they can certainly be cloud aware but having both options can be pretty important as you'll see in just a moment now coming back to exposing databases as apis you know it can neatly sidestep you know potentially having to do workarounds to accommodate binary native driver connections because the databases api keys can just get stored in a credential manager or a secret manager like aws secret manager or azure key store or google secret manager now the stargate open source project allows astrodb to function also as a schemeless json document database so you can handle you know your function tier can handle structured as well as unstructured data off you know and it basically makes astrodb a truly multi-model nosql database now the flexibility in having different kind of connection strategies is pretty important because sure lots of applications are designed for scale with uh you know from the outset and have no tolerance for future rewrites or redesigns but of course it can make sense and often does to prioritize you know ease of development and faster routes to market because you've got to shift features early on knowing that you have a future redesign or rewrite ahead of you um so being able to have strategies at different points along the spectrum is pretty important rest json great for early stages of the application life cycle when you're trying to shift functionality you know and then hey maybe your application load and your adoption from the users is increasing that's where you know you're going to decompose into micro micro services great grpc and graphql can be very handy in those instances and then for apps that are designed for global scale right from the outset or maybe the ones that have evolved to that point naturally over time native drivers offer the best possible performance and if you want to expand into a new region pairing serverless functions with a serverless database like astrodb can drastically reduce costs when you're scaling both horizontally and vertically in a new region in the example there on the left we have a single logical global database that's spread across three data centers right in different regions of the world so if you were to write some data in an america's data center that change gets automatically replicated at the speed of wire over to the data centers in europe and apac now data stacks is also working on inter cloud for astrodb which is aimed at users that have these kind of multi-region deployments but they want to use more than one cloud provider today you can only replicate data within a single cloud provider but soon astrodb will support replication across cloud providers and between cloud providers this would be a huge win for function developers because then they can use any of the function providers programming models that they that you want and yet things are still resolving the same data and database so why not give it a try right now our free plan is really generous and there's no credit card required you can just sign up in a click or two with google or github and that sort of thing so try it out and let us know how we can help you we look forward to helping you succeed with apache cassandra and astrodb",
