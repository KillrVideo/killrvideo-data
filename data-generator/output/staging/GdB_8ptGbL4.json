everybody who is attending today uh we have cassandra day singapore uh thank you for taking some time on a saturday hopefully everybody is doing well i know that we have some pretty crazy circumstances right now uh with covid around the world but we want to give some some good training and education about cassandra the open source uh distributed database today and let's go ahead and get started welcome to everybody and we have some initial slides to just get you familiar with what we're doing today today we're talking about cassandra uh with the apache cassandra project um this is its logo and what is this apache cassandra you can see in this eye there's different nodes in a cluster cassandra is a distributed decentralized database it was first developed in facebook for messaging and then they kind of threw it over the wall into the open source community and now for the last 12 13 years it's been a top-level apache foundation project i've been around in the community since about 2010 helping with the the database and just to give you some high-level idea of what this database can do it's uh able like it looks like in the picture you can have any one or any one of a number of servers that that can be part of a data center and all around the world so you can have active active in any data center in any cloud all around the world it's elastic with its linear scalability so if you need more capacity or throughput or you can just add more servers you you your your entire data centers can go down or individual servers can go down for maintenance or for if there's a disaster or hardware failure or links go down and the database will continue to run like i said you can geographically distribute this all around the world and it's very very high high throughput and very very low latency so anything that backs a mobile device or a web page a lot of applications like instagram netflix apple's icloud um run on cassandra even uber and and others and it's vendor independent which is nice so it gives you some uh confidence that you you don't have to feel like you're locked into a specific software vendor and and you can still get the performance and capabilities that you need so let's keep going here uh so who uses apache cassandra netflix apple alibaba tencent instagram uber lots and lots of companies uh around i am located in sydney australia and i help out with a lot of companies in the asia pacific region i've helped out with a lot of companies in southeast asia in fact in singapore there's different banks and financial services organizations that are currently running cassandra today um lots of different streaming services we're working with you know lots of different companies around the area retail travel like airlines in singapore also use cassandra for a variety of purposes and we'll go into some more details a little bit later some some to give you an idea uh 98 of the streaming data that that for metadata when you pause and you continue the account data that you have in netflix all of that data is stored in cassandra on tens of thousands of servers um operated by about eight or ten people which is pretty impressive um apple this that slide is a little bit out of date they have about 250 000 instances of cassandra storing everything from gift card redemption data to icloud to to store data so everything that's that's backed in icloud is probably going to be stored in cassandra lots of operations per second lots of data so if you have a data problem you have scalability needs low latency cassandra is a really good solution for you so today's agenda so kicking this off we have the welcome which is what we're in right now and then we'll go into a workshop that that is introduces you to the database gives you a breakdown of what what makes it work so you can have an idea this isn't magic this is actual you know software development just in a in a different way that is refreshing uh then we'll have a break uh you will have a quiz where you can you know demonstrate some you know how much you've you've come to understand about the database and when some some swag then we'll jump into data modeling with cassandra and then at 3 30 we'll have an ask me anything session so everybody involved with this this this day is going to be part of an ask me anything session we'll talk about that in a second um and then we'll do some application development with cassandra using different apis and familiarize you with how you can write your app quickly with cassandra and then we'll spin down for the conclusion at uh 5 15. so so there will be a quiz at at 1 pm and that you can get a prize there there's going to be an ask me anything session you'll get a prize there and then everybody will be able to get a certification voucher for uh for getting for getting certified with uh apache cassandra as a database officially certified to put on your cv or your resume as a developer or as an administrator um so there's a certification process there who are we uh we are part of data stacks developers and here we are floating in space here's alex who's going to be here shortly and stefano just having a good time in space with their toolbox and we are here to connect every developer in the world with the power uh to the power of apache cassandra that's pure and simple i mean we have things that we do for our jobs to try to help people that's that's basically what we do though is to to help people i've i've you know spent lots of nights trying to to help people make sure their clusters run properly they can they develop efficiently um get the most out of the database um and so this isn't really a a commercial session this is more about the community of apache cassandra uh this is a little brief about what we are who we are this is how you can contact us if you need anything but we're on github and linkedin and twitter um we're all apache cassandra experts and educator alex is an educator he's based in germany he'll introduce himself in a little bit and a cloud architect stefano is based in italy northern italy also a developer and architect and then i'm based in sydney australia right now and also a developer and architect so we're all happy to help you in whatever you need in this process so from a logistics standpoint if you have anything that you need there there will be um the contents of what we're presenting today will be on youtube and it will be recorded but while this is a live session you can ask questions on youtube um in real time and we'll try to answer them the best that we can and then there's a mailing list so there's a lot of these shortened urls that you can do there's a bunch of workshops that are out there on datasets.com workshops discord if you're familiar with discord the kind of the real-time chat um we have a discord channel for for workshops and for cassandra questions so if you're kind of in the trenches and you don't know what to do feel free to ask there there's somebody going to be there 24 hours a day pretty much um there's a forum this is kind of like a stack overflow style of asking and answering questions and then we have free development courses that are at your own pace to prepare you for the certification exams and then there's the the youtube channel that you're currently on well most likely viewing this live live uh live link so the ask me anything section so dts slash cd cassandra day singapore dash qa and you can submit your questions and so you can ask questions in real time don't worry about that you know we can answer whatever questions that you want but if you have a question that you're dying to have answered in depth uh about cassandra about where it's useful um about like either limitations or capabilities or how it fits into an overall data system um we're happy to answer all of those in our ask me anything roundtable session and you'll get a prize for the top voted questions or the best questions but just don't forget to put your name in there so we can give you the give you the price um and then like i said discord um following this i mean obviously there's the youtube section that you can put in questions in real time but following this session the discord discord room is a great place to um ask those questions afterwards so and then like i said there's a there's you know a koala that's winking at you from here in australia and he's happy now because the fires are no longer going and he will send you a prize for the quiz so if you answer the questions and if you're quick on the click on the responses for a mentee themed quiz you will get uh some prizes yeah jeremy may say something um sure go ahead so hi everyone um thank you for the introduction just want to stress one thing cassandra days are about cassandra so our goal is we want you to get to know cassandra as as much as possible and to start using this marvelous database so this is our mission but uh obviously we also want to have some fun while we do that so today there will be a lot of very deep information very useful information to get started but in the middle we will have a quiz we will have some fun so get ready be fast and if you're fast you might win prizes so yeah um cool and and and besides that if you're interested um there's some exercises that accompany today so that it's not just the content and you're not just sitting there um taking it all in and just having us talk to you um or talk at you there's there's exercises that you can complete as part of today and you can get a badge that you can post on face or on sorry on linkedin or whatever or just you know your own satisfaction of getting some some getting involved and hands-on with this database for like if you're it's your personal interest or your job and you get one of these badges and then similarly like i said you can get a voucher for taking a certification exam so that if you're if you're interested in getting to know the database in more d in more depth as a developer or as an administrator um there's these free vouchers and i think those vouchers usually cost about 190 u.s dollars it's 145 dollars to take the exam but yeah so for today we sponsor taking the exam for free to all of you uh you will still have to go there and and learn something which is given for free in the academy of data stocks so go ahead because as alex likes to say and he will soon appear on screen as well uh if you can bo if you can head put your on your resume uh as cassandra certification on average you will have a higher pay so you will differentiate your resume and you will be more competitive on the market plus it's a very cool database so it's cool to learn it yeah yeah find out how a lot of these companies are scaling um i personally it's just really interesting for me because um some of these like banks and retail organizations they have literally hundreds and thousands of servers running this software working together and it does a lot of really cool stuff for you and in in that first session you'll start to understand um a lot of it's kind of some detail about how things get done underneath but it does most of all of that for you so i'm excited for you guys to come to to understand the database a little bit better so enjoy the day have some fun and i'll turn it over to alex and stefano thank you jeremy thank you okay okay i should have turned it on my mic uh so hello everyone it was good i know it was good for you but now it's right also for attendees yeah uh so uh yeah but now indeed that is good always check sound levels uh that's alex polish never developer advocately the data stocks and welcome to cassandra day singapore and that is the opening that's the first workshop of the day and uh it's a very important point for you to start thank you for joining and i believe we can proceed with that right now uh so we stir cassandra fundamentals so uh i'm alex wilshere developer advocate fleet and i will run this workshop and also later application development workshop for you and as jeremy mentioned apache cassandra is used by the biggest [Music] best known and very big companies solving their problems with apache cassandra in the world why uh that and what are the main features of apache cassandra what apple netflix instagram and many other companies are not uh are using that not some other databases well usually big companies use multiple databases that's right but for netflix for apple apache cassandra is one of the biggest uh and the primary databases of course first of all it's big data ready it's ready to work with the data of a huge site besides for example apple uses cassandra and source and cassandra hundreds petabytes of data and that's their words not mine so as you see data volume can be really huge if you is one of the biggest companies in the world second highest availability uh not just high availability but highest availability and to that is matter because in the end reputation is everything and uh companies want to be uh all uh all the time available and that's definitely one of the primary cassandra features then geographical distribution with cassandra you can easily have multiple databases multiple data centers everything in the same cluster across the world and so you will keep your data close to your clients even if you have clients in australia in singapore in europe in america you can have multiple data centers actively communicating with each other then read write performance it's of course very fast database that is clear and one very important point it's open source software vendor independent apache cassandra called it apache because it belongs and controlled by apache software foundation a well-known open source foundation non-commercial non-profit organization which helps and maintains open source software like many other and maybe no apache kafka for example apache pulsar and our technologies and apache cassandra is one of them as a top-level project originally developed by facebook but then contributed to apache software foundation so cassandra is very fast very reliable and so on and so forth how exactly it works first things we have to understand is cassandra is distributed so the data is spreaded and data stored on multiple servers in data is replicated into multiple machines cassandra can hack can have multiple data centers delivering not just fault tolerance but disaster tolerance for true level or level of highest availability and it is masterless so how many master service master servers does cassandra cluster need uh answer is there are no master servers that is masterless database decentralized there are different ways to scale your database and usually databases go with vertical scalability vertical scalability means what when you need more firepower when you need your database to be faster or to handle a bigger bigger volume of data you replace your previous machine with a bigger server more powerful server and this scalability type is easier to organize but it's soon getting very expensive because top level database servers are extremely expensive and it's still single point of failure and cassandra chooses a different way sandra prefers horizontal scalability horizontal scaling requires multiple less expensive commodity hardware so instead of replacing previous server with a bigger one you just add next server of the same size next to yours it's cheaper and it removes single point of failure it's logistically harder because now your data has to be spread over multiple servers but don't worry cassandra takes care of it it's not your job i'm a lazy engineer i love it and database take cares of things like that and not me so cassandra scales horizontally but that's not the only thing cassandra skills linearly and that's what really matters it means if your data model is right and we will discuss data model a lot with stefano in his workshop a couple of hours later then you if you want to double the power computational power of your server you just have of your cluster you just have to double uh amount of servers in this cluster and that is really cool so take a look uh it's uh another a great research done by netflix netflix is one of the biggest cassandra users and by the way their netflix tech blog is amazing if you are not yet subscribed then go do it uh because they just like incredible how they share their knowledge in the world of those technologies so netflix did a research for cassandra linear scale up raising amount of servers from if i'm not mistaken to almost 300 within a single cluster and counted the performance of this cluster and take a look at this incredible nice smooth line what that means zero overhead on adding new servers and trust me it's a rare feature in the database world most of the databases introduce uh some uh downscale of these line it's never so straight as it with cassandra so uh very very primary feature of cassandra is the distribution of the data okay but why do we need that and how it works idea is very simple with traditional relational databases which you most mostly probably know already at least some part a full copy of every table install it on every server and if this amount of data is too much for this server you have to go sharding and sharding on relational databases a very very complex mechanism very painful mechanism i would even say and it's a very manual mechanism and every time you do any changes in your database you have to restart things it's painful process there are no more joints over shards and so on and so forth cassandra works differently understanding what cassandra is big data already it means what the amount of data in cluster can be tremendous as i said apple uses hundreds stores hundreds petabytes of data in cassandra so this way we spread the data we spread the tables over cluster and as here on the previous slide we have this table a very simple table uh population per city per counting so new york amount of citizens los angeles amount of citizens and so on and these stable as all the our tables in cassandra are distributed by partitions over the cluster and that means what first thing not a single node stores a wall table it allows us to have tremendously huge tables and still be able to handle them and second point when you add more nodes data is reshuffled over those servers so you can have more and more volume capacity of your cluster and uh what defines this distribution distribution is defined by the partition key notice how data data is stored here france united states germany canada and so on they are grouped by counting who defines that the point is then you are creating a table you can speculate can you must specify a partition key and partition key is a column or multiple columns those will define partitions now how it works there is a partitioner which calculates tokens from partition keys partition key can be basically any value string integer doesn't matter but token always will be integer so it's just a more more free hashing mechanism which converts everything like strings into integers why do we need them take a look within the cluster every server is responsible for the range of tokens known as token ranges for example in this case i have an example of four servers and therefore if we say what token ranges are from 0 to 100 which is basically not right because the numbers are very very huge but just for the simplification let's say it's uh from 0 to 100 or from 1 to 100 then in this case as i have four nodes first first cassandra node will be responsible for the token ranges from 1 to 25 seconds from 26 to 50 51 to 75 76 to 100 and then we can see what tokens on the right side we have sydney australia 59 it goes to this server right so this server will store information for australia then toronto and monreal number 12 they will go to this server and finally germany 45 will go to this server and third one will be without any data considering such a small table now that is very important thing cassandra is very small smart and very automated if i add a new node if i need more computational power or more volume then cassandra will recalculate token ranges automatically and reshuffle data over the cluster automatically and therefore this one will be responsible for 1 to 20 21 to 40 41 to 60 61 to 80 and 81 to 100 the same way it works if you want to decommission your cluster for example many companies don't like to pay here too much for their infrastructure if you want to just if you know what will be a quiet period you don't have too many uh customers and you can save on your cloud costs for example by just the commissioning server and cassandra will reshuffle things back into a smaller cluster with uh bigger token ranges and then you know what the reason you like black friday or anything is going to happen and you are netflix and you are going to release a new season of the game of thrones you know everyone will be watching that then you want to have more servers and you can add more servers and it's all automated and cassandra manages with shuffling if you have these uh experience like i have with a sharding on relational databases you must know how it feels how amazing it feels for databases doing that for you it's indeed just incredible so that it is distributed but that is not enough what happens if part of the data will be lost what happens if a server is not available if you are long enough in business you know what the downtime of a single server is just inevitable so data is replicated what does that mean it means what every piece of data is stored in multiple different machines multiple times when you create a key space i will explain later what is the key space uh but for now we need to know just what key space is a group of tables when i create table i must specify replication and replica form replication i have to define network topology strategy i will explain later and replication factor data center in this case i have let's say only one single data center data center one and i set replication factor to free which is a recommended variable it can be for example five and can be basically any reasonable number but we usually recommend to stick three per dated center normally three maybe in some cases five but it's a rare more rare use case uh so how that works as i say data is not only distributed but replicated replication factor free means what every row or better to say every partition you will soon learn why it's so important every row is stored on three different nodes so in our case we have here three different servers responsible for our canada partition how it works we think as we have three servers responsible for this token range that means what for data this we will have free replica servers and then someone for example tries to store data node receiving the request in this case we see what it's not responsible for these set of data then but this node is smart every node knows schema the token ranges allocation over the cluster and these nodes sees okay that's a token 59 i'm not responsible for it but i know those who are and it will just transfer this data to the proper replica nodes and we will be happy now funny point normally that never happens the trick is not only cassandra nodes are smart and understand who owns the data but also cassandra drivers are smart as well so normally then the driver never contacts some uh non-replica node usually driver always contacts directly the server what is responsible for this data this allows to avo to avoid one network operation of course but let's say but you can ask any node in a cassandra cluster for any piece of date despite its partitioned and distributed still any note able to answer any question doesn't matter if it's a read request or write request just if you reach the proper note which is responsible for your current token range then it will be minus one network operation which is of course uh better but you can reach any of the nodes and it will work for both rights and reads that's because that's why cassandra scaled so great for rights for example many databases are good at scaling for read operations because it's easier but for rights were let's say not so many competitors what happens if one of the replica nodes are not available there are multiple layers of defense from this situation in your infrastructure i believe but still it always can happen what happens if one of the replica nodes is not available during some time it means it doesn't receive updates inserts updates so any kind of mutations will change data delete insert update everything but change data won't reach it and as a result you may have cross node inconsistency what does that mean take a look those two got the update but this note was on fire was stolen by aliens or something i don't know and it didn't get the update and there are also many layers of defense from cross note inconsistency in cassandra first layer called hinted handoffs hinted handoffs is a great mechanism and that handoffs help you um to how to recover and not even help you they do this self-healing autorecovering without you have to do anything if a server if a failed server recovers within a couple of hours those handed handoffs will be delivered to it fully automatically and you don't have to do anything it's a self-healing and clustering cluster recovering itself it is amazing well uh and there are some more multiple layers of the defense for from inconsistency we will discuss later on so data distributed everywhere that means you can have multiple data centers and those data multiple data centers are always active active so there is no idea like with some databases you may have um single data center is active and second data center is passive and only receive updates but you cannot write to this data center not like that with cassandra as i said it's decentralized and every node bears the same duties as all the others so every node can receive updates inserts rights whatever and then it distributes data to other data centers as well it allows to global companies companies like uber for example keep their data closed to them customers uh giving a very good response time for example if you travel from asia to the united states and you are traveling to the airport with uber and you you get to the airport by uber have your flight then with uber you get to your hotel for example you will work with the same cluster your uber application will work with the same cluster but with different data centers for one which is closer to you which is obviously the best way to work because you don't have to wait too long then one more thing and i see uh frederico palma says interesting and yeah i really like it it's indeed one of the most powerful databases we have at this moment on the database field so hybrid cloud and multicloud cassandra is an apache project it's platform agnostic you can have it running on your own data center you can have it running on google cloud microsoft azure amazon web services and fun fact you can have it simultaneously so your single cluster can be running on multiple clouds getting this multi-cloud or hybrid cloud [Music] connectivity for example let's say this united states one can be amazon web services this one in europe may be google cloud platform just because european gcp may be cheaper let's say or we want to have some redundancy over multiple clouds and this one can be your own data center on premises and together they form them together they form this cluster which consists of multiple data centers and that's a very powerful approach of course how it works with multi-data center replication considering we have replication factor free in each dc first we get a data to one of the nodes node currently processing your query is called coordinator node and there is always people asking how is that coordinator node designated an answer is each node what receives a query will become a coordinator node for this query so that's not like a master uh server or something like that no way just uh the node what got your query will be coordinating it and every node at some moment of time is the coordinator node yes it's received some querying drivers have some load balancing mechanisms so they can ask multiple different servers okay so coordinator no so the node got the request it becomes a query coordinator for this query and it will do two things simultaneously first it will send the data to all the replica nodes of the current data center and also it will execute this call to a second data center that's all executed asynchronously in no blocking way and that's a very fast mechanism of course very important mechanism as soon as data received by all replica centers on data center west its job is done meanwhile uh start remote card in the remote query coordinator start its job uh and distributes the same way data over data center east and they destroyed so all of our replicas got the data all of our servers got the data good so understanding use case everything what belongs to the scalability field when you are going to have or very a lot of data or very a lot of output or both and it may change in the beginning you have not too much in the end you have a lot uh that's perfectly scenario as cassandra scales very well and servers are very performant heavy brights heavy reads as i said cassandra is scaling also very well for write operations not only on rate operations like most of the databases do and any kind of a scenario when you have a lot of rights a lot of reads or you require linear scalability team to have more and more and more and more and more that's a perfect scenario for it then availability everything about mission critical for example one health institution in germany using apache cassandra not because they have so huge data or not because they are globally distributed it's a german company but they work like as a health institution medicine purposes they want their data to be always available whatever happens database must work and that's a very good example because it may be a question of life and death literally so everything what belongs to mission critical availability having no data laws and having always owned database that's of course very a lot about cassandra distributed if you need to have global presence or workload mobility or for example compliance and gdpr purposes your data must be located on some specific data center of some specific country that's also perfectly possible with cassandra using different key spaces allocations for replica factor for different data centers if you don't specify a replication factor for let's say united states east one data center there will be no data storage for this key space and cloud native everything what we mean about the modern servers modern applications cloud kubernetes and so on and so forth cassandra is a great feat for web because it's natively support hybrid cloud multi-cloud multi dc good so uh stefano are there any good questions we have to answer by voice um well i was about to interrupt you just to remind you remind everyone who is uh listening and watching us of a few things that came up uh between the youtube chat and the the discord first uh yes somebody asked if this is going to be recorded yes it will it is and you will be able to watch this later on this same link this is one thing so you can re-watch it at your own leisure whenever you prefer and everything then there was a nice discussion some somebody mentioned yes their data is replicated on multiple machines multiple nodes so if your main servers goes down you're still good that's correct but not entirely correct because there is no such a thing as a main server which is even better so as i wrote in the chat all nodes are created equal so there is really no main master server at all so every server is as good as any other so that's even a well distributed resilience to failures so yeah other than that uh so sorry let me add a point here uh there are a lot of people with a relational databases experience and you must probably use it to a situation what within your cluster you have master server and secondary servers and you kind of write and read to master server and you can read only from secondary servers that's a relational database paradigm which doesn't work with cassandra because in cassandra exactly at stephanos 8 all nodes are created equal there are no master nodes main nodes there are no secondary class citizen every node is able to answer uh every request that's basically peer-to-peer mechanism and it's a very powerful mechanism it means when your driver tries to contact some server and it find out what the server is not available because of network issue power issue or whatever it will just reconnect to a next server or next server and still will be able to store and retrieve some data or fun of the demo uh we did and developer day in france a couple of years ago when we were able to travel we did incredible demo by wiping out the whole data center and what happened to our demo application nothing it simply switched to the next available data center because we had three of them within the same cluster what matters no main servers forget about this concept cassandra is a true democracy yeah so if i may add something you you say the master slave architecture is the relational database paradigm and it's true but it's not only that because there are also many no sql databases that are still based on this uh pyramid so bottlenecked architecture so cassandra is not like that and just to conclude sorry alex this is important i see not many questions on the chat but i had a look at the at the cassandra day singapore question site where we collect questions and i have to congratulate you because there are a lot of questions coming there and that's a good place to to write them because we will then be able to address them one by one for you all during the ask me anything session so yeah good job i will paste the link again so feel free to just write more questions and don't forget that you can also vote on questions that you see already there so they can bubble up and they will be getting higher priority in getting answered and the top voted will win a prize so thank you good yeah don't forget to upload the good questions uh now uh very briefly overview questions i see on the youtube chat um there is a question from uh handapani uh how cassandra is different from age based or google bigquery take a look uh speaking of google bigquery google bigquery is more of analytical tool and it's not as performant as cassandra speaking of google tools you better think about bigtable because google bigtable is based on the same principles as apache cassandra they basically use the same white paper as the foundation to be developed now google bigtable is a great tool i am a certified google cloud architect and like i know a lot about this thing um it uses the same principles as apache cassandra and from my point of view it has one but quite strong disadvantage it is non-open source it's a proprietary available only on demand if you completely 100 percent stick to googling for your infrastructure then google big table can be a good choice but if you want to stay to have no vendor lock then apache cassandra is better for you because you can migrate easily from gcp to aws or your own data center with no question and if you big table it's not possible basically big table belongs to it controlled to only by google then as for consistency availability and partitioning will cassandra satisfy all three that's a very good question with quite a surprising answer i proceed without on my next slides to answer that and uh frederico palmer asks what is the difference between cassandra and mongol that is the goal sorry i just wrote an answer and there is also exactly that question in the ask me anything already so if you just go there and vote them i'm sure we will address this quest this answer later yes yes sorry i just wanted to say please ask this question at uh fz the link with stefano pasted already data stacks dot io slash cd singapore qa questions and answers so this way we will have um better answers to your questions with a group of people group of cassandra experts and let's move on because we have more things to discuss so consistency some of you already know about cep theorem i think and of course a lot of you who understand the idea of replication also know problem it brings replication is great replication is the only thing what allows you to have a highest availability but it also brings a problem what is the problem let's talk cap so take a look there is a thing known as cp theorem also eric brewer's theorem it claims the following statement in the distributed environment you can have only two qualities out of free in case of emergency what are those three qualities and how happen we can have only two take a look in the normal scenario when every server is working no net for lux no network locks all the power uh supply is available and rainbows and ponies and green grass and everything is great your database at the same time consistent and available and everything is great but if something goes wrong then you have to decide where you want to stay and basically there are two places for us to be availability and partition tolerant or consistency and partition tolerance what does that mean let's first talk about those qualities what is availability availability means you get the answer you just add database it answers even in case of emergency in case of failure and then some servers are on fire there is a shark attack in your data center still you get the answer what consistency means it's a little bit more advanced concept when you have multiple servers storing the same data and you ask them for the answer they all give you the same answer there is no situation when you request some data and you get it some stalled data some outdated information which was updated but the note you asked didn't know about this update missed it somehow then you can have it outdated like you don't want your financial data to be inconsistent and finally partition tolerance partition tolerance is one of the most complex is the most complex basically feature here on the cep theorem so i have to explain that it's a very often misunderstood partition tolerance means ability of the system to survive network partitioning or network speed it means what you have let's say five data five servers within your data center and there is a network issue between them so there are three servers what can communicate with each other and there are two servers who can communicate with each other two groups a and b a group can communicate inside b group can communicate inside but they cannot reach each other from a to b from b to a network split now kind of you have two networks what cannot collaborate and it's called network partitioning and it's potentially a very dangerous situation it may be even more dangerous than just complete server loss or complete data center loss why the point is if some of your clients will work only with group a and some of your clients will work only with the group b as a result they get into the inconsistent state because the different updates to different parts and then the network split disappears some everything is fixed you just cannot merge them back because they have different information different state and no one can understand which one is right basically there is no right state it's called split brain problem and split brain problem is one of the worst maybe for poorest situation potential situation with your database so partition tolerance is the ability of the database system to survive network partitioning without getting into split brain and you that's for sure you want to have your data to be or here consistent and partition tolerance or here available and partition tolerance i will explain it now on the more examples but as very well said by stefano there is you can have it fast cheap good chose too that's exactly about the epithelium is there a way to get into the middle let's take a look so many people say cassandra is cp uh sorry many people say what cassandra is ap available and partition tolerant but i don't like this definition i find it a mistake and now many cassandra experts may look angry to me like what do you mean cassandra is not 18 cassandra is 18. yes and no because cassandra is configurably consistent in any moment of the time for any particular query you can set consistency level you require to have and there are consistency level like any one two three quorum all and there are some more consistency levels for multi dc deployments local one local quorum each quorum what does that mean now again there is a very often mistake people start to think of consistency level as like the amount of servers we are delivering the data which is of course wrong it doesn't matter what's your consistency level per query uh data still will be delivered to all servers responsible for this piece of data so it's not about how many servers will get update all the servers who need to know that will get the update but consistency level defined for how many of confirmations your um coordinator query coordinator will wait before returning information to a client what okay we got it and with consistency level one first client writes data and to some node which is a query coordinator in this case query coordinator sends these data to all three replica nodes and it waits for the answer but as we define at consistency level one it will wait for the fastest answer to arrive and then get back to the client and say okay we got your data you can be sure it's storage in the database so it's called consistency level one and this example demonstrates how it works with replication factor three uh the fabrication factor for example five it will work exactly the same way but the amount of replicas will be higher of course and with consistency level quorum quorum literally means majority so more than a half more than a half for the replication factor three is two because uh half of a server cannot vote and uh stefan i'm sorry uh keyboard sorry no no no no no no worries we are good so there is a consistency level forum with consistency level core and query coordinator will wait for the majority of the servers to confirm what they got the data and with consistency level all how do you think what will happen with replication factor free and consistency level o we will wait for all replica nodes um responsible for this piece of data for the partition i'm working with to confirm what they got the data and now you can think ah consistency level all looks good i will just go and use consistency level all over time because i want my data to be consistent right uh right but wrong kp server theorem stays what you cannot be c a and p simultaneously that means what then you go with consistency level o you basically just transfer your data from available and partition tolerance into consistent and partition tolerant and as a result yes you have full uh consistency but you by the price of the availability what will happen in case of any of the servers cannot answer what will happen answer will be simple if a server cannot confirm what data was stored after some time after some time this car query coordinator will report to the client okay sorry desired consistency level wasn't reached we cannot store your data oops there is a problem and um these that's a point c p theorem is here and you just cannot uh get it or maybe you can there can be better ways let's take a look there is a thing known as immediate consistency and immediate consistency may be the practical optimum for us to have the high to have a full consistency but still be able to survive a data loss the trick is there are multiple ways to reach immediate and first way take a look if you write with consistency level all when we can read with consistency level one and always know what uh data is up to date it's never will be outdated good but not really great because right happens still on the consistency level all if one of the data's databa is one of the servers is not available we want to execute this operation and that's not nice another way to reach immediate consistency is to write with consistency level one and then read with consistency level all this way we uh as long as even one single node has this data stored uh we are good and we will get information the most up-to-date because we ask all of them and then get the latest value but again that's not the best way immediate consistency done the right way is that when you write with consistency level quorum and if you read with consistency level quorum so you always reach more than a half of a servers you always have immediate consistency how it works how do we get to the middle of the cep theorem take a look mathematics mathematics is great and it's very helpful in this case if replication factor 3 quorum will be 2. it means what then this client writes something we wait for at least two confirmations right and uh therefore there will be free replica server supplication factor free and two of them we do know they received that update and one of them maybe received the update we don't know if it received or not mostly probably yes but it happens then we are trying to read this data client reads these data and as it executed also with consistency level quorum it means what we will receive data from two different uh nodes for sure and there are two possible scenarios first scenarios first two nodes answer it was this one and this one waiver update and therefore uh query coordinator sees for data matches and returns to client this data and everything is fine and everyone is happy but what happens if this note indeed was not updated and it dispatches outdated information so it was faster it missed some update but this time it was faster and query coordinator sees what we have two uh non-matching uh pieces of data there are actually hash is used to save some uh network time but that's not about that right now so query card network sees which is we have two different values but then cassandra stores data it always have the timestamp then this data was dispatched and we see what these tell you is a newer than the old one and uh that's the last bright wins so always the last piece of data consider it is the most up-to-date of course because to store it the last one and then cassandra returns to client uh this up-to-date value not the outdated one but the right one and initiates a second layer of defense from a cross note inconsistency known as repair repair on this broken read so the note what was what didn't have your data updated will be updated the internal cassandra mechanisms and guess what that's also absolutely automated so you don't have to take care of that it will be executed by cassandra automatically so we can have immediate consistency but just writing with consistency level quorum and reading with consistency level forum this way we still can afford losing a single server because of whatever power outage or whatever happens with the server and still be able to deliver answers to these rights or read requests absolutely without losing any data without losing any queries but meanwhile we will have this immediate consistency uh mathematical uh why mathematics very easy if consistency level right plus consistency level read more than replication factor you do have immediate consistency simple as that uh and as we discussed at consistency level quorum for rf3 replication factor 3 will be equal to 2 plus 2 more than 3 so we have a media consistency display consistency trade-offs so higher the consistency you require lesser chance you may get stale data that's quite obvious you pay for this with possible latency now that is very important to understand what is the possible latency take a look when we dispatch these queries to free replica servers we wait for free answers and we don't know how quickly those responses will be returned maybe for each of them it will take just one millisecond one millisecond one millisecond one millisecond answers arrive simultaneously in this case doesn't matter which consistency level you would use response time the same for all of them so if you would go with one or if you would go with all response time will be the same but in the normal life usually it happens in a little bit different way and it can be like uh uh one millisecond two milliseconds and five milliseconds and now you think with consistency level one i would get my answer within one minute second in this consistency level quorum i will get my answer with two milliseconds and we've consisted say level all i will get my answers within five milliseconds because third node was busy or something was not perfect on network doesn't matter so that's a possible latency and with good working network you usually can go with higher consistency if you've still no delays it depends on your situational needs and query can be configured it can be configured per query as your application usually works with different pieces of data for example for second class data i don't know profile picture no one will worry if your friend updated his profile picture but you will see it updated in a couple of seconds not immediately it's fine but with some financial data health data health monitoring you need to have the data updated in like a more consistent state then you can go with higher consistency levels but usually quorum feeds most of the use cases some some systems with right heavy workloads and cassandra is very often a good choice for write intensive systems may benefit from consistency level one for rights if data isn't required immediately data will be spreaded over cluster to all the data centers to all the proper nodes over time if you just store information from iot sensor network uh when you may benefit from consistency level one because receiving this confirmation from one single server in most of the cases will be enough good so uh stefano yep are there any good questions on chat um no it's pretty quiet i think most of the questions are piling up in in the ask me anything uh site page so that's even better so we will have we will pick them i've seen some of them go in there but on the chat it's pretty quiet i think you can go ahead great yeah so database is all about data and of course we work with data a lot so how it starts it's all start from a cell a normal cell like intersection of a row in a column which stores some value for you exactly like in relational databases when we have a row and this concept must look familiar as well it's a structured data item in a table usually it keeps some values for you department user id username and so on and so forth now we get into more interesting place oops what's that okay sorry wrong slide so data structure partition take a look when you work with data on the relational database you use it to work with it like database table row database table row in cassando you have one more idea which is very important to understand the partition partition is a group of rows having the same partition token for example in this case on this example if we use department as a partition key we will have in this small table of five rows two different partitions one for wizardry department and one for dark magic department and finally table holds partitions and table is a group of columns and rows storing partitions then we create a table in cassandra query language by the way this is an example of cassandra query language which looks very familiar to you because it's designed to be very similar to sql so you can learn it easier um we create a table by the way speaking of uh structured query language take a look cql is designed to be very simple very simple and very similar to sql and that is great because you can learn it very easily but there is one more problem many people who are not like you who didn't attended our workshop they say oh secret is so easy i already know it i can go and use cassandra and no they are not because they are not like you they didn't attend this workshop and that very often brings to them a lot of problems to them and to their clients they just start to use cassandra as my sequel without joints and they inevitably run into big big big problems so notice sql looks like sql but it's not the same and cassandra is not like my sequel without joins so you will see soon why and what you have to consider to avoid any kind of troubles so when we're creating tables we have to define key space and key space is just a group of tables like database or schema in postgres then you have to define user when you have to define the table name of course when you have to define columns as normal like [Music] name of a column type of the column and here we have text text text text trust me we have more data types than just text okay and then very important thing we will walk through in the next slides uh primary key primary key is something would identify seven unique row and it has to have a partition key and clustering columns optional so uh regarding the key spaces we discussed already when i create key space i have to specify key space name and i have to specify a replication strategy and replication factor there are more settings can be done but those are required so they always have to be specified what do you need to know about a replication factor by data center you can have multiple data centers and you must specify replication factor per data center uh if you want to have data there that's a very good question on understanding how cassandra works how do you think considering this statement is correct so there are no mistakes it will work if you execute it uh how many data centers i have in my cluster please answer on the youtube chat i'm very curious of what do you think how many data centers i have in my uh in my cluster who will be the first okay three okay two eight how many centers i have in my cluster two eight two data centers five what a while well that's quite dispersion okay so many different answers yeah many different answers a lot of answers but known uh right yeah well that was a tricky question but that's yeah yeah warm you up that's a tricky question but on the quiz you will have even more advanced questions so stay focused take a look uh don't forget the cassandra i can specify data locality per key space so there are no answer to this question again there is no answer to a question the best possible que uh transfer we can get is at least two because take a look we have here united states west one and europe central one but i can have europe central too i just don't specify it here so it will get no replicas and this case wow a key space won't be replicated to europe central too or maybe i have a dozen of data centers in asia i can this statement is still correct there will be just no no data of this space replicated to these data centers so the only possible answer is at least two considering this statement is correct okay so i hope it was a little bit of surprise for you i love to make surprises then let us proceed then we are getting like overall view on the data structure and go from top to down first we have the key space which has tables and tables has columns rows and rows are organized into the partitions and partitions are very important now defining primary key is a very important skill and it may be not so obvious many relational databases are used seek sequential ids and then you store something you just get id of this record from your database it's a convenient way like i used it many times in my life of course i like it but there is a little bit of problem when you have one or two hundreds of servers they will have to communicate with each other to dispatch you a sequential id which obviously introduces some delays whereas your clients hate to have because your clients your consumers want to get your answer transfer from your application immediately and if you are too slow we will just go to your competitor so we want our database to be fast that's why we define primary keys not by database but uh by our design so primary key can a primary key have two duties how to do this first it must ensure uniqueness second it may optionally define sorting order if required let's take a look at this example a primary key for our table users by city uh with city last name first name email will that work yes it can be quite a good example but hey let's take a look at this bad example ct last name first name why is it bad what's wrong with this design let's think what a please answer on the youtube chat you are doing very good job answering my questions by the way thank you so primary key of city last name first name why is it bad i already see how you are typing your questions not only can i hey ben great job and very quick yes indeed not only right because as i checked there are like two dozens of john smiths in new york and every next john smith will be will make a very bad surprise to a previous previous john smith in your system so it is not unique most of you made the right answeration very well let's move on to the next part uh partition key partition key is the very first argument in primary key and partition key is an identifier for a partition it must present you always have to specify a partition key and it consists of at least one column but may be of more if needed if your partition require to have multiple columns it's also possible so partition key has one and only one duty it partitions rows very easy so take a look we can have a single row partitions like primary key user id user id will be partition key and primary key at the same time and we will have as much partitions as much users we have and it is perfectly fine we can have any amount of partitions it's perfectly fine or for example if we have videos on youtube and comments for those videos like you are writing comments right now right we can partition them by video id and that makes sense and our primary key will be of video id and comment id to have the uniqueness right and a video id as a partition key so this way our comments for per video will be stored together which makes a lot of sense now there is a bad example but i have a special slide about it it's a very nasty example and i will explain it in higher details a bit later and finally clustering columns clustering columns have two duties they are used to ensure uniqueness and sorting order if required and clustering columns are optional so it's completely fine to have them or not have them depending on your structure so in this example users by city we have city as a partition name and last name first name and email are clustering columns in this case we already discussed the first example city last name first name without email it will be not unique and second duty can be here when we have this video id and comment id they are not sorted and if we in veyonique but not sorted and if we introduce created add timestamp as a clustering column you will have this video id created at comment id primary key and primary key will be unique enough and sorted because create a type clustering column clustering columns are also for sorting purposes by the way very important point uh stephanie will explain it in more details later but uh in this example gt last name first name email address is not present in primary key right address is just a data column that means we cannot search or we cannot sort by these data column because only by the parts of a primary key we can search we can sort we can use very close only on the parts of a primary key that's a very important limitation well you always have a price to pay for such a power so to be good in partitioning design to be good with cassandra you have to be good in partitioning design and i want you to be successful with cassandra so now we start very important uh slides the most important slides of this presentation they even have the slide of a year award i created those slides and i gave them of art because i find them extremely important to you there are only three rules you have to follow in order to design a good partitions and that's very important because if your data design is bad if your data model is bad stephan will explain it in more detail soon then your database cannot be as scalable as performant as it could be cassandra's highest performance is share it responsibility it gives you all the tools but you need to know how to use them so let's start rules of a good partition rule number one store together what you retrieve together in the perfect scenario one of your any of your query select insert update delete must reach one and only one partition because when you work with a single partition you work with a single server but if you work with multiple partitions you will have to reach multiple servers and cassandra will have more work to do um and obviously it's not for recommended way so first we'll store together what you achieved together take a look open a video on youtube we have to show comments of these video in a single query for example video id created at commentating that's a good example they are partitioned by video id so we can reach all the latest comments within uh one single query to one single partition that perfectly makes sense now if we do not use video id as a partition key like if we would go like that then uh partition uh we will have as much partitions as many comments we have it's fine to have many partitions it's not a problem the problem is then you are trying to retrieve data if you specify the partition key cassandra driver and cassandra query coordinator knows what's the token and therefore which servers to ask because it knows which servers are responsible for the token range of this token but take a look if you don't specify partition key what will happen then you when you order something when you order food when you order pizza uh do you give your full address to the delivery service or do you uh just give your street name and city i don't know about you but i prefer to give a full address so delivery boy or girl will arrive to my door to my apartment to my house and deliver my pizza hot it's a must be hot right but in the computer world uh specifying no partition key is like hiding your apartment number or your house number and what will delivery boy do in this case will go and ring on every door on your street hello sir have you ordered pizza no sorry i will go to the next door and again sorry sir sorry madam have you ordered pizza no okay i will go to the next door through the wall street that is as stupid as it sounds of course so specify for full address in case of cassandra it means always give the partition key if you don't give that let's call it full cluster scan and it's obviously anti-pattern and that's very very very stupid so always give the partition key if your query doesn't use the partition key cassandra will try to protect itself and not execute the query and give you an exception there are mechanisms to uh make it still execute query but we won't discuss it here today now next rule next rule of a good partition avoid big partitions what does that mean do you remember why do we do partitioning at all we do partitioning because we want our data to be to be uh available always uh doesn't matter what size is it and even if it doesn't fit a single server we still can split it into multiple parts and put it to multiple servers but then your partitions are too big then cassandra cannot work as fast as it could and it will work slower you will have some maintenance problems and so on and so forth so it's very important to keep the partitions of a reasonable size by giving them the right design of the partition key of course what are their hard limit there is only one hard limit a partition cannot be more than two billion cells per partition cell i remind you is an intersect of a row and a column so if you want to calculate the amount of cells per partition you can just take amount of columns and multiply it by amount of rows and within this partition of course that's a hard limit and there are two more recommendations usually we recommend to have up to 100 000 rows in a partition you can have more but we still tend to have like not too big partitions and it we recommend it to be up to 100 megabytes in a partition now if you exceed those a little bit there is no big deal but we have seen a partition of 1.2 terabytes and that is disgusting just don't do that because two big partitions first you pick a gray database and then you prevent it from working in the right way don't be like that understand your partition sizes it is very important if you want to have highest of the best of a market performance with cassandra you can have it but it's a shared responsibility uh why this example is specified as a bed here partitioning country by city take a look i live in europe in europe we have a lot of small countries but we can have a lot of them partitioning by countries maybe answering so bad uh but if you go um for example somewhere in china or india a lot of people living there you may get into the situation what your partition will occasionally become too big and it will be hard for your cluster to deal with that so uh your task developing partition keys is to make uh partitions of more or less even size so they should be more or less the same size preferably some little discrepancies are not so bad but again if your partition is like one terabyte that's obviously a very bad idea um now let's uh let's work together on one task let's work together on one real life story happened to one of our clients imagine we all working together on a huge telecommunication company like very huge this company has a lot of infrastructure a lot of hardware all over the world with dozens of data centers like really a lot um and we have a very important uh thing we have a monitoring over all of our data centers because you cannot control what you can measure so there is billions of sensors reporting their state every few seconds every sensor reports its id so you usually universally unique identifier uh time stamp and value that means like for example at 1502 we register a temperature of 40 degrees uh by the sensor id one two three three two one simple reports value can be a temperature humidity whatever basically there are different sensors and we design it table at first like that uh primary key to be partition key sensor id and report it at as a clustering column sensor id makes sense store together what you receive together i know what i'm going to show the diagrams of how temperature changes in the server room over time and it will be the same sensor so sensor id makes perfect sense as the partition key and there are also reported at timestamp so when this value was registered for uniqueness for sorting purposes so that looks like quite a reasonable design in the beginning it works but after some time we have got really huge problems please answer on the youtube chat what happened and why this design is marketed as bad design [Music] that's an interesting question [Music] one of my favorites yeah what happens over time to these partitions hey hey don't give them hints i want you to come on we want to lead no no no yeah no you are right of course but sometimes we need people to think alone about what you know we want to you know guide the proper thinking i mean it's all new stuff for many of them yes yeah and there we go that is that is great so there are multiple answers already and i want to walk through then yeah okay good so first of all thank you for answering well done uh i will walk through them um navi krishna every second temperature of sensor can change that's perfectly fine uh so yes temperature changes they are never overwritten because time will be different and i store all the data that's not the problem then second answer already was right by sudha sata suth hasata khar i hope i pronounced your name right partition will grow huge as time passes and that is the right answer in the beginning it will be fine first few months it will be perfectly fine but as we store this data every 10 seconds over time partitions will become too big uh there are uh then uh ben griffin says you could have multiple sensors at the same time yes but it's not the problem because we will have different sensor ids and therefore we will be working with different um partitions mostly probably on different servers and cassandra is very good in writing data so it's not a problem um because it is iot it will generate lots of data after time passes yes chives i'm sorry don't know how to read this sneak then data will be huge over two billion per partition right partition yes too large yeah so most of you made it right um basically partitions will grow over time and at some point we will become too large yeah so if i may say something on this service yeah the point is that you start collecting more and more data as time passes and that would not be a problem for cassandra itself and and there is an observation here to be made because uh you might you might see some it's a sneaky problem in this case because there would be a slow decrease decrease in performance slower and slower performance and you might be tempted to think oh yeah it's a fact of life my data is becoming bigger and bigger and i i have to deal with decreasing performance with that uh that's likely not the case with cassandra because as as long as you're partitioning you partition the data in the proper way and you keep the partition size constant over time basically you can still achieve a constant time access a constant access time even for large and large and growing data as long as you add nodes so if you have to deal with 10 times as many pieces of data you might just add nodes and you will still have the same access time to get the data as long as your partitioning is good which is the point of this slide so that's that there's a subtlety here just okay sorry that was just to [Music] no need to sorry your remark is very important and now take a look i see there are some comments what the data will be too huge exactly as stefano said uh if cassandra scales linearly and if you have like really really really a lot of data just add more servers and partitions will be reshuffled over those new servers so you will have it it's completely fine to have a lot of partitions as long as they are not too huge you add more server and partitions are migrated to a new server and you're good but if the partitions per se are too big then that is a problem and there is one more point as hanadapani asks can partition be dropped and recreated at any time based on the date on the data group so the answer is partition can be dropped and you can wipe out the world partition it's not a problem but you obviously lost the data and what i want to say here take a look um you cannot change primary key after it was created there are other table statement like in the relational databases but you can alter only data columns you cannot alter partition key or clustering columns why take a look partition key defines data distribution over cluster and clustering columns define how data is stored on each particular server an attempt to change any part of the partition key will lead or to moving all the data over the cluster to the new partitions or restoring restoring data on the same partitions in the new order when we speak cassandra we usually mean a lot of data that will basically wipe out any performance of your cluster for at least for some weeks in some scenarios and that's just not allowed that means what your if your partition design was bad now you have to create new tables and migrate data to those new tables and that's not so easy process that's why i'm talking uh those slides a slide of a year alert you have to learn it in order to decrease the need of a later data migrations for your cluster so it's definitely may help you a lot of time later data design is important data model is important and especially for partitions now so we got into this bad situation and that's not just a theory it indeed happened in real life with one company i cannot give you the name because they are our clients but it was it happened so there are two possible answers how to solve this situation first answer is ttl time to leave and this ttl will expire the row when it's expired of course and if you want to store data only for some months for some years for some weeks it may be a good choice to just let data expire after some time makes sense the problem is it wasn't the situation this company wanted to store this data for years and years and years so ttl was not to help and we introduced a second solution which work which was a better fit it's called bucketing do you remember i told you a partition key may include multiple columns so we introduced a new column a scientifical column month year what is a month year month year can be an integer or a string that doesn't matter which consists of month and year for example now it's october so our month year will be uh 10 to zero to one because it's october of year 2021 and now there is an interesting point take a look at partition key includes sensor id and month year as soon as month year is over like october uh will be over one day i hope and november starts what will happen then month year will become 11 two one two uh two zero two one as a result the token then you will be new because uh partitioner will generate a new token out of new volume and we will basically create a new partition completely automatically and now we have bucketing or partitioning not based on the sensor id only but also based on the month of a year and we have our table design sensor id month year reported ad that gives us much smaller partitions and that is great so our partition never grow larger than over one month and that's a perfect solution now you can ask why we use month here why don't we use week why don't we use not a week but day something like that will it be better to just put time stamp uh in the partition key so remove month year and just move reported add into the partition key uh it could work on wright's time but what did i tell you respect your delivery guy give your full address if you uh make it like sensor id reported at as a partition on the right time it will work but when you are going to retrieve this data take a look uh take a look let's say i'm going to show a diagram of the temperature values for the sensor in my server room and i need to get data for free last month in this case my select query will be select value select timestamp value from sensors sensors records table where sensor id equals one two three three two one and month year is 10 20 21 0 9 20 21 0 8 20 21 so very for october september almost this query is not perfect because it will reach three different partitions not a single one but it's acceptable so we get me i mean it may work it's in so bad and i will get all my data but if i have smaller bucketing i will have to specify each week or each a day or each hour or basically every part of the partition key always and the small bucket tickets will be very not convenient on the right time the problem of a partition key it doesn't support inequalities working with partition key you always have to explicitly specify the partition key and you cannot make it like more than less than you have to give a full partition key that's why we prefer to bucket base it on the month and year but of course it depends on the amount of data would arrive so sometimes you will have to switch to weeks if you have much more yeah any questions there was a question in the chat that jeremy has answered about how to alter the scheme of an existing table that that's been answered i just a way to frame what alex just said i second ever everything he said and a way to frame it is that since you have to deal with big big data you have to find some compromise and how you find it depends on the size of the data and the kind of the kind of access pattern you need in your application as alex said so if you if you are happy with with accessing data only for small spans of time at once you might want to have smaller bucketing so smaller partitions and this is really uh the result of how the application needs to retrieve data and how big the partition you estimate will be and that's maybe one of the underlying narratives also in the data modeling uh story i will tell you later of yes yeah good so so sorry rajiv just wrote a question on that and yeah well the balance for the optimum partitions is mostly depending on how you plan your application to work you don't get many recommendations from any automated part in cassandra it's it's more a matter of being able to anticipate what your application will do which is essential for a good data model and being able to estimate the size your partition will be yep so we do can give some recommendations for example there is um data stocks field team recommendations on how do you do some checks but in general there is not much support can be done in advance by us but you have to think and try to design your partitions even thinking in advance yeah i would say it's not our fault because it depends on what your application will store and use so yes yeah there are formula two formulas to estimate the partition size depending on which columns how many rows and which type are the columns like a typical you know memory size estimate right but other than that it's it's up to you right uh so uh you know what uh i always say it like this with cassandra you as a developer have more work to do than the relational database i mean like i mean that it's it's real as a developer as an application developer i have more work to do but you know what uh cassandra enabled yes it pays off cassandra enabled developers are more expensive so as a result i get more money for that and i'm completely fine because company pays for this uh to enjoy all the power and highest availability of cassandra so now next slide avoid chord partitions we already discussed the big partitions with them it's quite simple there are just some partitions what would keep a small size a small amount of data and some partitions what can be too huge easy to understand but what is a hot partition what partition is a partition what access it more often than others and in general it's completely fine to have some partitions what access it more often there are others if you have 100 of partitions or 1 000 of a partitions and 10 servers they are distributed evenly across those servers and if some partition is being accessed too much and your server is very busy dispatching all the queries you can just add more servers right you have 10 servers add 10 more and uh partitions will be redistributed over cluster and you will have less partitions per server as a result the low button servers will be decreased and because you will do you will have more workers doing the same amount of work and everyone is happy but let's take a look closer on what is a code partition this example video id created at comment id you remember comments per video for example on youtube we partition our comments by video first you can say hey there are some videos on youtube those have a lot of comments uh will be those partitions big maybe answer is well yes and no there are indeed some uh videos on youtube would have a lot of comments but it's not so big deal for us because the data size won't be too big there are comments like what normally comment have id outer id outer name because of the normalization stephanie will explain you later text comment and time stamp so 5 6 7 8 fields type text mostly and then they all are small so those comments despite there can be a lot of them they still small per se and that's not a big deal that must be fine in most of the cases but let's take a look at the example country user id you've seen this uh example before we have customers we have customers mostly in european countries there are a lot of countries but their size from the population point of view usually is not so big we work in europe everything is fine our data model user per country works perfectly well but when we go to asia for example let's say we go to china and we get extremely uh good outcomes there like literally everyone in china wants to buy something from us that that's a great job i mean our business is thriving it's great we are very popular everyone is buying something from us and that sounds great but now take a look we have some countries and very for partitions like malta uh san marino vatican liechtenstein and so on and so forth so there are some partitions of a small of a size of one two three five persons let's say um and now we have uh really a lot of customers in china so we have one huge partition being accessed all the time and it's a very hot partition so server keeping this partition are very busy and now we we may say like okay but we are very successful business if we have had 10 servers just let add 10 more servers let's add 100 more servers via reach sounds good doesn't work take a look uh if you have uh this hot partition you can add as much servers as you want but you will never have uh this partition uh distributed anyhow because even if you will have as much servers as partitions you have it still will be one very hot partition of a server and cassandra server is very is very fast but it also has some limits so uh you can add as much servers as you want it won't help if your partition is overloaded even so one single partition per server will be too much so we have to think not only on the size of the partitions but on the workload distributions on the partitions with video as i said it's completely fine because yes video can be heavily accessed but we have a lot of heavily accessed videos spread over cluster and that's perfectly fine and again usually we access like some very last comments but not the whole history so it will be fine for us um yeah sure in the world maybe that video becomes super popular but if you anticipate that you can employ bucketing and create that on the second choice here and so you you can stack solutions to solve your your data model uh if i may add a very quick thing yeah sure alex just mentioned the problem of hot partitions so you might have china which is a very big country everybody in china uses our e-commerce and our china partition has trouble because if you look at the physical layer how the data is stored there will be a directory with some files that are constantly being replaced and rewritten basically there is a another layer of problem connected to this which is if you have big partitions you might have to unlock that two or more heavy partitions and on the same node so let's say for some reason a node will host china and india which which is also a very big country and everybody in india uses our application so besides having trouble trouble in your file system basically you will also might have a network bottleneck again so to distribute evenly traffic means traffic and storage and io so everything has to be properly distributed for best performance so that's why avoiding hot partitions is very very crucial right thank you good so and we are done with the theoretical part and you did a great job watching it and answer and asking questions now if you want to get the participation certificate or achievement unlocked page uh you can follow me doing this lap or you can just watch me doing this lab and then do it after this session which is also perfectly fine uh stefano i believe you have a link for us i sure do uh i thought i i can do that if you want uh if you are everything ready then that's okay otherwise i'm ready to you mean the link to the github right yeah uh if you want to do the practical part you can do it uh absolutely yeah yeah okay as you want i just have to share my screen so let me first drop okay so the point is that we have 20 minutes and we have been alex has been talking all the time you have been listening and thank you for being so attentive and asking questions yeah now it's time to get your hands dirty so we will have a very small and quick first exposure you will have a first exposure to cassandra now let me first drop a link to a github repository with a readme that we will follow later to to do a bit of practice and i will also drop you another important link and i think in the next slide alex you should also those two links so uh now this is the link so this this astra dev link that i just posted in the chat uh yeah now it's arrived so if you switch if you jump to the next slide i think i added those links as well but anyway they are in the chat oh yeah you are right sorry um once one word on astra today we speak about open source apache cassandra and we want you to go and type your first sql queries but we don't want you to install and run a cassandra cluster because maybe it may require some power of your laptop and it may be not easy to do within like 20 minutes we have left so good news we have managed cassandra for you to use for free and you don't have to install anything because it will be available to you via your browser it's called data starts astrodb which is basically a cassandra based databases service with all the power of apache cassandra within a couple of clicks in the browser which is really great because as someone who was deploying and running cassandra clusters i know that's quite a lot of work to set up your own cluster so two links you have on youtube chat data stacks devs workshop intro to cassandra or you can just scan this qr code and create your astra db at astra.dev cassandra day singapore astra is free for your usage for educational purposes you don't pay we don't ask for your credit card as long as you have real production workload we will ask for it of course but for this educational purposes it's completely free yeah let's say if you have a workload that brings you out of the very generous free tier congratulations because that means you're already running a pretty successful application so okay so should i switch to your screen if you want yes because i'm sharing and just go if you just tell me that i'm sharing because you know i you are like i can't see the light okay great yeah okay so this is these are the slides uh the the links you find in the chat so let me show you the github repository is this one and just uh just quickly showing how it is structured there is a lot of instructions why do why is there so much uh text because it's a live that we guide you through that's because this repository and its instructions are also good for yourself at your own leisure later to go there and just do the exercise if you want so this is a self-service thing first and then today we will do it together okay so um the other link would bring you to something like this and this is what alex said so this is uh astrodb which is offered by datastax and it has this free tier we were discussing it is basically a managed solution in the cloud that gives you a free to use database as a service and it is built on apache cassandra so you will interact with it and you will basically have the chance to play with a cassandra instance without having to install anything so the first thing i would suggest you is to register which is free just give name email or you can log in with google github whatever and you will be able to create an account so this is all detailed here in the readme so please go ahead if you want and register you will be asked to create your first database here in your account and if let me just scroll through the readme um one second before that i'll just tell you that you will see a section in this repository called homework here that will tell you what to do to complete the homework which is more or less just a bit more than we will see than what we will see now together and if you want there is a way to submit the homework as a github issue you attach a few screenshots that you completed everything and we will then grade the homework and give you the badge the badge that you will then be able to you know show around and to to boast a bit um this is not the same as a full-fledged certification because that would require studying a bit more than what we see today but uh still it's a good introduction and yeah to get engaged with cassandra okay so uh let's go so first you have to register as i mentioned and you will probably okay this is my account i already registered okay so after registering and logging in you will be given this screen which is uh the one to create a database because in your account you can have many databases let me first create my database and then we suggest you you see okay maybe alex you can paste these names in the chat we suggest you to to stick to the standard database name sorry database name killer video cluster that we suggest here in the readme in the instructions and the key space name you should choose killer video that's just you could choose any name you want but in order to be able to just copy and paste and not modify the commands you see in the readme the sample commands we suggest you to stick with to those names so okay the database is just a separate database and in the database we create a key space alex mentioned that a key space is a is a group of tables this is a logical space where you keep your related related tables together okay so [Music] after giving database name and the key space name uh there is an important thing so maybe i closed this chat but there is an important thing astra is a service that is sitting on multiple cloud providers and multiple regions so okay i'm creating this database and i can still choose what will be the backing uh infrastructure provider so let's just say yes no no no no no no why let's ask our attendees which which provider do they prefer maybe they prefer google cloud uh guys uh what do i think which provider stefano should use okay alex you have to tell me because i don't have visibility on the chat so okay what are the answers i will tell you jeremy hannah suggests us to use aws because it has a region in singapore which uh pretty much makes sense but i still want to know the people's opinion okay navi krishna azure azure azure aw aws okay okay because i i know aws better i'm certified on that one but aws okay aws dominates that's okay i appreciate that there is a singapore region and that's very good and probably most of you would stick with that for latency you know but i'm based in italy and i'll go for the frankfurt so region that's also because i spent some years living in frankfurt and that's a very great city so i want my database to enjoy the city so europe middle east in africa and europe frankfurt and that's it so look at his name his name sorry provider and region so i'm ready to start yeah and you can start please but then you create your database you can make a decision of your choice and pick the provider you find the best that what was the wet what matters i see most of the people prefer it amazon web services but there are voices for google cloud and for azure so when you create your database go ahead and pick the cloud provider of your choice that's perfectly fine and select every journey you like the most so after you click create database you end up with this main dashboard and you will see your killer video cluster database being created which means that for a few minutes two or three minutes it will be in pending state so so what is happening now behind the scenes astra is spinning up a lot of stuff is setting up your database configuring it all in the cloud through the magic of kubernetes and then you will soon have your serverless database ready to use so in a few minutes this database will be active like the other so i have already many so three other databases but that's because you know we play with astra a lot obviously you will probably have just this one just wait a bit for it to to so please let's start with this please uh as you as you create your database i'd like you to give me a thumbs up in the chat even if it's still in pending state so we see that you reach this point and then we just we we spent a few minutes discussing a few other things while everyone gets their database active like mine will probably become in a few minutes so please a thumbs up when you go to this screen with a pending database it's okay in the meantime uh now just uh this is almost hot off the presses because in no more than a few days ago uh astra launched the multi region feature which is uh still accessible only to say non-trial accounts but still if you are considering using astra for your applications because say you have a big enterprise and you want to use astra but you are concerned about data replication multi-region data regulation compliance gdpr whatever the good news is that now you can also have multi-region in this database and i remind you that astra lifts the burden of administering your database completely from you because see i just went to a website i register and there my database is now active yeah so that's a huge improvement i mean yeah yeah that's a huge improvement okay we have a lot of thumbs up already okay so maybe we wait another two minutes just for everyone to get their database active because the thumbs up was just to having created it so while we wait let us start browsing the readme so let's say we created the database name and the key space so the database is created and in a little while it will be active by the way uh you see a lot of screenshots and helps throughout the readme so it should be good also if you want to do it by yourself later you see there is an animation and everything okay now uh sorry let me assume you will be now having your database in the active state and i'm sorry because i have to scroll horizontally but that's to have bigger font size for you to better see probably on your screen it will be easier to navigate anyway i have my killer video cluster here and i can click on it okay so this is the view of what's happening in my database i still have zero requests so far i can check that i can check the health of the database i can look at a few things key spaces so you i can you will maybe want to explore a bit what are we going to do now of the very many ways to connect to your database in the cloud we will do we will use the cql console here because you see okay so if your database is active and you went to this part you can click on sql console tab here and you will see this terminal appear in your browser because if you have a cassandra database of the many ways to connect to it there is a console this is say you install your cassandra in your local machine you can reach it through a console and in this console you can type commands and get answers that's obviously not the only way but it's good you know to to play a bit manually with it and to familiarize uh the nice thing of astra is that it offers the same access you see i'm in the browser but i have a text-based command line console and this is where i will type my cql commands so now i will jump back and forth between the readme here and the console here alex please stop me if uh there are questions or or uh requests in the chat because i don't see them there are no questions but a lot of thumbs up that's very good to hear and i will go ahead then okay so let's create a table in this database right so um we went to the sql console here which starts with us logged in already and let's see if there are key spaces this you do with this command desk which stands for describe let's say describe key spaces every sql command has to be completed with a semicolon as i'm doing here so describe key spaces enter you see there are some key spaces well many of them are the system ones that i don't have to be concerned about but are good old killer video is here and it is the key space i will work on now a good thing is that cql supports supports tab completion so if i just write use so use is the command that sets my console to work on a specific key space within that so if i write use ki and i press tab i get completion so use killer video and now as you see here in the prompt this console session is set to work within the killer video key space which is what we want to do so we described the key space we used killer video okay now let's start getting serious we want to create a table you just saw the command to create a table uh if i'm not mistaken in alex presentation i think you saw it and this is what this is what we are going to to issue so we want to start we want to run this command which creates a table called users by city let me just take this command and copy it and paste it here so in most browsers and operating system you might have to right click and hit paste explicitly anyway this is my command you see this is something you saw with alex already create table okay if not exist but create table name then there is a bunch of columns so name of the column type name type name type at the end there is this important statement primary key that specifies how the partitioning is structured for this table you see we have a primary key composed of four columns and in particular the partitioning is by city so data in this table as you can imagine will be grouped by city in the same partition now uh you see i hit enter and i'm back to the console and i think my table has been created how to how to check for it yes you can describe tables so let's see let me type desktables semicolon and there we go you see in my keyspace killer video there is the table users by city nice um yeah you could also actually you can also go to describe table users by city if you want and you get a very detailed explanation of how is the table structure which is basically the same command we just run with a few more default settings for the table now we want to create another table so i'll just go quickly on that because we are creating another pair of tables look at the names this is called commands by user and this is called commands by video and that suggests these tables are two different ones but they will host they will contain in a sense the same data but if you look at the primary key the data will be organized and partitioned in slightly different ways called it's called a generalization and stephanie will explain it in details in the next workshop exactly i can imagine uh relational people in the audience uh raising their eyebrow how come i have a table two tables with the same data come on yeah that's something that you will later see it's very common in cassandra it's a approved officially approved design pattern now let me just paste these commands and we should have created more tables now so let me run again the described tables command see i have three different tables and as you can imagine at the moment the table the tables are all empty yeah okay so um let's create some data in them so again we are about to insert data and this is how you do that so insert into table then you specify the columns you want to insert and then a matching list of values for the values so user id will be this one one one one comment id will be a macro basically that is expanded live by cql with a timestamp or better with a timestamp uuid actually uh v2id will be this value and command will be this string so if you take this command let me copy and paste it here in the console bam i think we just inserted our first row in the table so very similar insertions always so they're all on the table comments by user comments by user comments by user comments by user let me paste this other part of the command we are inserting a bunch of rows in the sorry in the comment by user table okay so we did the create so the insertion part of the crowd operations uh yeah so okay there is a remark we are explicitly giving the uuid there there are use cases where this is realistic otherwise other times you want to use a random so a function that expands live with a newly created id that's depending on the flow of your application basically okay so other insertions this time on the comments by video table so we are inserting again a few values a few rows into this new uh this other table the one with the duplicated data mostly let me just go there and paste this command so what we've been doing so far is we have been inserting rows into different tables very nice let's read them so let's see what happens and how do we read data so many of the insertions have been on the commands by user table so these tables are examples from an application that is basically a sort of youtube written with cassandra so there are tables to host comments on the videos and video properties and so on so this is the table that contains comments by users written under a video basically let's run this query this is a bit of a questionable query so select sorry select splat from comments by user semicolon this is right yes what would what will you see here well a bunch of rows yeah now i made my font size big so this these are wrapped on two lines too bad but anyway you see not only you see the results one row two rows three and four but you also see the header the captions and you see that what is red is the partition key what is cyan and blue is the rest of the primary key and these purple ones are the data columns anyway you are graphically reminded of the structure of your table and you see these are exactly the rows we've been inserting that's all good and nice but actually this is not the best way to query a table you see this is what alex mentioned as this is a full table scan so if you have a million a billion rows this select would be a terrible in production because that would have to query many nodes to get data from many partitions and this is not what you're supposed to do in cassandra so let's make something better which is the right pattern to access data and this is this kind of query select from table where at least at least the partition key i should always specify which is what i'm doing here where user id equal something i think the colon is missing semicolon and there we go now instead of having you see instead of having everything including these two two two row this is now only three rows and they are the rows pre that are in my one one partition this is a good query this is not putting strain on the cluster because it just goes to one node to one partition and gets my data super okay um again let's do a bit more reads so let's read the data from comments by user again or comments by video same kind of pattern these are all let's say questionable readings but still they are there so i'm reading all rows in particular i want to point your attention to let me make this easier to read so you can also see what you do to select specific columns okay so you see there are four uh comments by video in four comments in the comments by video table and one of them in particular has a particular video id this one two three etc and it has a particular text so yeah that guy patrick is such a geek very good now okay let's go to the update let's say we want to change the data let's say we want to edit this command because the author of the command went to their to our application and they decided to edit the command so this is how you okay this is how the data was inserted so insert into blah blah blah and then you see comment and the text such a gig video id is the one you saw in the sql console and you see how the table was created in particular there is a video id and a comment id in the primary key and now our goal is we want to change this string here so to do that we have to issue an update or another insert statement actually they're almost the same but to do that to reach the right row we have to specify the value for the primary key because we have to let cassandra know which is the row what is the row we want to change and this is how we do it you see update table set field equal new value you see this is a different text the the new edited text and it's very important that in order to change that field in that row we have to specify the full primary key in the where condition so we change this this field this column where video id equal that one and comment id equal that one let's do that so this is the update and that's been executed and we can read again the whole table yeah you remember i have very big characters very big fine font so let's do this and you remember that it was different it was such a geek and our update has been successful so very good all nice and good this is just the tour of the main feature so creating data retrieving data updating data and what is missing now is deletion so the same logic for uh deleting data i want to delete that row because the user responsible for this command decided okay i want to delete this comment from the video okay in our application probably we would run in our api or drivers whatever we would run a statement similar to this one delete from table where again i have to specify the full primary key let's run this so delete from comments by video where video id and comment id you see i run this command and i think that if i run my select again haha you see this row has plain old disappeared so i think my delete has been successful and that's it so this was a very simple and very introductory course very introductory hands-on where you just saw the basics of writing and retrieving and changing and deleting data from cassandra obviously this is just a tiny door onto a very wide universe of what you can do with cassandra and you are strongly encouraged to go forward just a note on the homework you should take a screenshot of something like this so the results of the query before and after deleting and use it to submit the homework okay so there is a bit more in the homework because you should also let me reach the point here you should also that's very cool because besides this practice with your own astra you're on cassandra database there are also very interesting fully interactive courses here in the form of scenarios which are a mixture of you know theory and if you click start scenario here you will be able to interactively run some commands and learn what they do in in your browser but you will work with an actual cassandra installation running for you in the cloud again so i think i lost the github here so uh to complete the homework you please go to these two courses and you complete them they are very short and you will learn a lot and at the end there will be a congratulations screen take a screenshot of that and attach them when you submit the homework we will be happy to grade them and to award you your maybe first batch of cassandra expertise with that please give us some time because we manually apply those homeworks and we're definitely not going to do it on sunday so not earlier than monday or tuesday we will take care of them good point so give us a few days to grade the homework but we promise we will go through all of them yes okay so i think for the for the practice this is it uh you should i think i can give you control back to your uh slide because there is a final slide that reminds you reminds you all of the homework and the scenarios if i'm not mistaken or maybe i can also do that myself i already i already switched anyway uh so uh to have more practice you can go to catacody.com slash data stocks courses cassandra intro one of them is included into the homework so you have to complete it as well it's all in the homework description uh and that was it for the first workshop we are done now few very important points in the end of this cassandra day we have these vouchers for the certifications these workshops are really great but cassandra is a complex tool so you have to learn more to learn more we do recommend you to go to the datastax academy academy.datastarts.com is a free online courses to get deeper into the cassandra and extend your cassandra knowledge vera admin developer path and cassandra developer puff take the path what suits you the best and you will be after that ready for the exam which you can take for free with our voucher and academy is free of charge anyway that can really change your career because cassandra certification is great and in high demand and that's amount of data on earth will only grow and more and more people and companies will need cassandra power so academy.datastack.com is a great place for you to extend your knowledge but don't miss next workshop next workshop by stefano about data modeling is a very important workshop to be successful with apache cassandra um and then don't forget your to ask your questions uh using the link what stephanie gave you already we will have asked me anything session within couple of hours and most important now we are going to have a break and after break we will play a game where you answer questions and you can win the prizes from data stacks uh stephano do you think i have to add anything or we are done i think that's it so i hope you've been uh paying attention because the quiz will mostly be uh about what we what we saw right so far so yeah yeah i think that's it more or less and uh we will resume at 13 singapore time which means in 33 minutes from now we run a bit later but that should be enough to grab a quick lunch yes yes for you and maybe a breakfast for us a small breakfast because you know here it's 6 30 in the morning so yeah small coffee maybe a small breakfast and we will meet in half an hour or more see you in half an hour and get ready for the game and uh get your finger flexing because it will be important to answer fast to win not only correct okay so uh have a good lunch have

day singapore and please welcome niraj our colleague and friend who will help us to run this squeeze and ask you questions hi niraj hey guys hey and everyone welcome back we are happy to see you here and we are going to have a game play the game uh you we ask questions you answer them and those who gave the right right answers fast enough will win the prizes from data stacks uh today with me uh new rush our friend and colleague and he will help you to ask you the questions hi niraj good hey alex how you doing hey guys good all good looks very nice and if you can hear us in uv if you can see us please set the likes and thumbs up in the youtube chat because we are going to start the game uh here you have uh the instructions how to get to our playground please go to manche.com and enter the code 9450732 or just uh scan the qr code next to mirage and we will start so once again link if you prefer link it's in the chat and code is in the chat and qr code is on your screen and in the beginning to make you familiar with mentee we start with just questions normal questions with no right and wrong answers and then game will start in a couple of minutes so let's get ready answer those questions to become familiar with painting question number one what's your experience with relational database management systems in russia i believe you work it a lot with relational database systems before uh yeah maybe a little bit probably probably um some would say more than others what about you i'm pretty sure you've worked with a lot in your time yeah sure well you know the last year's my heart belongs to cassandra but before that of course i was using a lot of different relational databases and of course most of the people we have here today have experience with relational databases while i'm asking those questions people jump in jump in don't miss your chance to win please and yeah if you're there they're stacking up a couple for none at all we've got six that's saying a little eighteen that are saying all the time and zero saying that uh black boy uh black belts enjoying um [Music] okay i hope there will be no echo which is great okay so next question what's your experience with no relational databases a little okay now distribution is different of course zero to little little to zero only one person works a lot with no sql databases but we don't have any nosql gurus and that's quite expected so welcome to cassandra de singapore it's nosql event uh where you can even where you get better with no sql database knowledge and apache cassandra is one of the best of them well and i believe one of the last questions before we proceed to the game what's your experience with apache cassandra or datastax enterprise or astrum it's coming up a few okay so looks like most of you don't have experience through budget cassandra or general understanding and you know what that is great so don't miss the second workshop uh don't miss the second workshop of stefano and he will explain you the data modeling rules and that's essential to be successful with apache cassandra or data stacks enterprise or data stacks as ready and here we go and here we start the game now i hope you now understand how to click the buttons now take a look very good advice youtube has a slight delay so uh you will if you want to be fast you want to see the questions on your phone or on your mobile or on your mobile phone in your browser uh more than youtube because youtube will have a slight delay with that said be start let the battle commence and that will be a series of 13 questions and you have to transfer fast to get more points how many masternodes does cassandra need at least three per cluster a free per data center not a single one as cassandra is decentralized enough to maintain consistency two almost done time's up for the answers that's correct 23 people got it right that's pretty good that is a great result people that is a really great result because you made it very very very very right it's not a single one cassandra is decentralized and i see there are three persons answered at least three per cluster i believe that those are late comers because we explain at this moment cassandra is decentralized and cassandra does not need any kind of masternodes they just don't exist in cassandra terminology that brings us to a leaderboard and who was the fastest one okay george was the fastest well well done well done good snuggles is next we've got thinky place yeah but difference in points are very very very minor so that's only the beginning so let's go to the next question and that's question number two answer fast to get more points how data is being distributed over the cluster by partitions all data is replicated to each server with address locators using post mail oh that's not going to be seven more seconds come on guys and time is up time is up okay how data is being distributed right by partitions and there are seven people say all data is replicated to each server take a look there are companies like apple who store hundreds petabytes in cassandra that wouldn't be a smart decision to copy all data to each server so data is being distributed by partitions and what do we have on leaderboard i'm curious if george kept his first place it was a fast answer but not fast enough and george goes down to the third place which is still good because first three places get their prizes and gst with the fastest answer gets to the first place and that is a great result then danny risky is on the second place in george on the third with pegora following him very very close between few points so let us ask the next question question number three so answer fast to get more points how to scale cassandra cluster vertically upgrading servers increasing scaling factor horizontally adding more servers don't scale cassandra performance is always enough oh man that would be great isn't it there would be all right couple seconds to go right so most of you made it cassandra scales horizontally by adding more servers there is no thing like scaling factor maybe you meant replication factor but it's not about scaling and vertical scaling is not the best way for distributed databases and there is one person who answers cassandra performance is always enough thank you for trust but no in some cases you might need to scale your cluster for real but we appreciate okay so relatable yeah yeah so okay okay there are some changes gst was the fastest again and george made it george made it to a second place now that's a great and gaurav is on the third so looks like we lost some one of the former leaders but there is a lot of things going in here so let's take a look what will happen after the next question so that's a question number four answer fast to get more points which replication factor is recommended 1.5 3 15 42 hope you get the reference out of those options my favorite of course is 1.5 i always configure my cluster like that oh no no no you should have trusted me but you didn't get into this trap of course recommend it of course recommended replication factor is free replication factor 1.5 is a joke it cannot exist like it's half beat or half server it's impossible and 15 is just going to be too much so let's take a look on the leaderboard maybe someone of the leaders made a mistake could there be some changes yeah jst was fast he made it again again gst is fastest again and there are no changes on the top three only some finds only some fights in the lower part of the leaderboard but it's still the same gst george and gaurav hey and vibe half is very close to gaurav with just like 40 points difference which is nearly nothing but we have more questions to come i wonder if they can if vara is going to change places in the next question let's let's see so that's question number five and we start countdown answer fast to get more points cassandra cluster can be deployed on aws only any combination of cloud providers and on-premises only one cloud provider of your choice um sega mega drive i reckon sega mega drive yeah me too on weekends right so it was easy it was too easy we need to add more advanced questions for you any combination of cloud providers and on-premises simultaneously cassandra is platform and vendor agnostic okay so leaders made no mistake but wipeout was faster than gaurav still not enough to get into the top three but now the difference is only five points like that's really briefing very from very close and maybe maybe you know yeah that is cool so let's take a look what will happen in the next question i want to see some changes on leaderboard otherwise it's just boring some people may fall there are more advanced questions ahead and that's a question number six so answer fast to get more points cassandra cluster can have multiple data centers wrong single cluster can have only single dc correct but not more than two disease correct some diseases are passive only read-only correct all diseases are available for read and write and time is up and most of you made it correct all dc's are available for read and write well done you made it uh there are two people answer it correct somebody see a passive and that is relational database thinking please stop it not in my not on my sheet [Laughter] in cassandra every node in every dc is active always and there is also a mistake correct but not more than to dc with cassandra you can have as much disease as you want and as uni as your business needs so how it goes no mistakes by leaders there are some changes on the bottom of the leaderboard and gaurav overtakes george [Music] okay george is on the third place that's right good so that battle goes on question number seven so answer fast to get more points cap theorem claims what in the case of failure c a and p are all guaranteed only a is guaranteed only two or three are guaranteed or cp theorem claims what we will need a new tab that's quite a lot of options but who of you remembered what we said about cep theorem okay most of you and take a look uh niraj looks like we have six people from the country of unicorns and rainbows uh what in case of failure c a and p are all guaranteed guys please uh send me the ticket to your wonderful land because i'm going to move i want to live in the place where ca and p are guaranteed in case of a failure scenario in our world with not so much unicorns and rainbows in case of failure only two out of three can be guaranteed if you did everything right so let me see the leaderboard i still want to see the mistakes by someone in top three because he was fast yeah hey now george is back on the second place in gaurav is on the third and chatan is getting getting very close to them so there are still chances to change the top three and jump in for a lot of the people on this leaderboard so yeah only a few points separating uh third and uh third and fourth again yes yes yes so everyone have chances especially if leaders will do mistakes and that's a question number eight so answer fast to get more points recommended way to reach immediate consistency is read write one one read write one all read write worm quorum or viva video chat well i don't know when i want to have consistency with my colleagues i usually take a video chat option it always works if it works for me maybe maybe it works for cassandra as well and time is up and most of you made it but now the proportion is a little bit different take a look read write worm quorum is the recommended way to do it we've read write one all technically it's also a way to reach immediate consistency it will work one plus all will higher than the replication factor but it's not a recommended way and finally read write one one is a recommended way to reach inconsistency but not immediate consistency so one one can be dangerous there was a dangerous ground so our recommendation is to look warm to reach immediate consistency okay who made a mistake oh my god gst it was such a good ride we just lost the leader oh my god he went just to eighth place wow that was a big change yes that is a big change now george with the fastest answer gets to the first place gaurav is on the second and cheetah made it to the top three with np uh like staying very very close to him all right into the last couple of rounds here alec and it seems that uh first and second place is uh very close yeah do you think gst can try to make it back to the top three i think he could okay good he's gonna get the next couple answers right right yeah he is giving transfers very quickly so maybe we will see him back again in top three and ladies and gentlemen that is question number nine answer fast to get more points but your answers have to be right what is a key space it's organized into rows in columns it contains tables and defines replication it define it with partition key and contain rows it's the place to store keys well well well well well okay it was easy yes it contains tables and defines replication it's not organized into rows and columns it would be the table and it's not defined with a partition keys and doesn't contain rows but tables so let's see the leaderboard are there any mistakes no top three looks oh my god this mp made it to the top three overtaking chetan and george and gaurav are keeping their first and second place consecutively and gst with the fastest answer by the way notice his puzzle he stands for voiceover fastest is on the 8th place well done so question number 10 answer fast to get more points three more questions left what is required in a cassandra table data columns clustering columns partition keys nothing is required everything is allowed everything being allowed would be awesome right yeah that would be good but it's a little bit different so time is up and most of you made it partition keys are required that is right so let's take a look uh who was the fastest this time and this is fastest again getting to the seventh place okay but time is running and we have less and less questions left george gaurav and mp holding their positions in top three and chetan and nevi still can try to get in especially if some of the leaders will made a mistake and now it already be feel a bit nervous right yeah question 11 answer fast we get more points cassandra tables contain cassandra tables contain multiple partitions only rows and columns replication factors endless seas of dreams and fears what cassandra tables contain and that's you made it good multiple partitions and that the right answers i see some people answer it only rows and columns and i do want to uh warn you if you will work with cassandra thinking of it as like rows and columns thing you will get into troubles very soon never forget about the partitions over all or web partitions will take very very revenge and you may run into troubles in your production partitions are very important so multiple partitions that is the right answer and who made a mistake who was slow and what oh and p that's where gst made a mistake again he was too much in a rush i believe oh yes that's yeah two mistakes is too much i am afraid he lost his chance to get to it up free and mp i also not really sure if it will work but george with the fastest answer gaurav and chetan now making their top three viv rajiv holding very close with 300 points difference oh like i'm getting like alex yes yes [Music] oh we are getting close to the end that's question number 12 and answer fast to get more points how cassandra executes joints joints require dedicated joint table like in sql it doesn't it does but kinda lazy how cassandra execute joins huh sorry i was gonna say mate i don't think she's lazy though you think she's lazy okay so it does not cassandra does not execute joints there are no joints it's a nosql database not like in sql not like with any a kind of a joint table i just they just don't exist at the right answer cassandra does not execute joins and how do you work with the data then if there are no joints next workshop that stephanie will answer this question so how it goes on the leaderboard rajiv made a mistake it will give him no chance to jump with top 10 difference will be too big gst is fastest again with on the eighth place which is a great result but not good enough to get to the top three for sure and now danny risky is going to fight in the last question for the third place i believe i already feel this energy in the air everyone is ready for the last question i don't want to make you wait for too long who's gonna win though yeah it's the last question now we will have the winners and ladies and gentlemen that's the last question of our game question number 13 my lucky number let's start answer fast you get more points you know what to do single data center cluster of 8 servers how many servers we have to add to double performance 4. 8 12 it's not possible to double the performance in a single data center 4 8 the valve it's not possible and time is up see who answered the fastest yeah there are a lot of right answers before we proceed to the leaderboard i have to say uh there are again six people who answer it what four servers will be enough i bet those are the same six people uh who believe what uh it's possible to have cap in case of failure scenarios simultaneously guys i do need a ticket to your uh wonderland like for sure no sorry it's not enough to add four servers to eight servers cluster of course of course not it cannot double the performance there are some lows of physics in the end and 12 can be too much because if you want to double server double performance if your data model done right then a double amount of servers must be enough because of linear famous linear cassandra scaling and yes it is possible to double the performance in a single dc and now i'm pushing the button and we will see the leaderboard cheetah makes a mistake oh man he was the fastest yeah gaurav is the fastest and then you risky uses the mistake of chitan to get to the top three very last moment jumping to the the strain on the very last moment moment and george makes the first place 12 375 points that's incredible that was a real competition super close right down to the wire right yes and that's so dense like uh point to point they answered so close prove a world quest now what's uh what do we do winners so top three plays george gaurav and denny make a screenshot of your chain winner champion screen you will have to send it to jack dot friar at datastax.com i believe stefano will give you the address on the youtube chat oh okay it's done already thank you stefan now congratulations to the top three winners yeah i would say congratulations to the top three winners even if you are not in top three but still see yourself on the leaderboard congratulations because wherever you dozens of people and you made it to the top three that's definitely a great result uh total top 10 sorry that's definitely a great result and even if you are not on the leaderboard you know what our prizes let's admit it it's not like ferrari or villas uh so first better luck next time on this channel we run workshops usually two times per week so hit the like hit the subscribe button and participate in our next game so you will have more chances and but that what matters the most it's not this game and those prizes but your knowledge you earn it today and you will earn even more with a next workshop which stefano will start in a moment congratulations to all the winners uh frederico thank you for joining thank you for everyone who likes that uh i see a 51 concurrent viewer at this moment but only 19 likes ladies and gentlemen please fix it right now we deserve more more likes and you know it and if you don't give us more likes we won't proceed with the next workshop no no just kidding we will start next workshop in a minute of course but thank you so much for your support and we will happy to have you again uh how do you feel do you think we did a good job with the first workshop for judging by the answers i i think uh i think we did i think we did we did a pretty good job but there's a there's a couple of people who still believe in unicorns and uh some amazing fairy tale hands that i think will benefit from the next workshops so um hopefully everybody enjoys uh what's coming up uh there's some some great workshops that have been held by the team right thank you so uh thank you niraj we will meet you again at our ask me anything session right that's right great so see you again in a couple of hours and now we proceed with uh how to design an efficient data model uh for an application working with apache cassandra so that's going to be very interesting stay with us and i will get back to you in a moment [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wait a second yeah hey looks like we are back hello everyone welcome back so um you know alex that i'm not seeing uh the youtube live so tell me is it all right are our attendees looking at my slides yes yes all good okay and we are both on screen so so welcome back welcome back let's start okay so um i hope you've been having fun with the with the quiz i was watching you and there have been a few surprises during the quiz and congratulations to the winners and to everyone for having any way show that you paid attention and you learned a lot i think during the first workshop now let's go more in detail into one of the topics one of the most important topics namely data modeling so in a sense uh this workshop will be yeah shattering the dreams of unicorns and rainbows a bit more because this is somehow our goal today unfortunately no i'm joking we are not here to destroy your dreams of an ideal cap word but an sub-linear scaling word but we are here to teach you how to squeeze the best performance out of cassandra offense means to unicorns um by the way you have been meeting uh jeremy and niraj so far which who are from the asia side of data stocks so just as a by way of introduction alex and i are strictly organizers of the cassandra days and so this is a bit of our thing but obviously for today's event we have been joined by some of the best data architects in the asia pacific and japan region so you will soon meet yoshi as well for the ask me anything session and they are fine great guys who with a lot of knowledge and in case you want to explore more on the topic of cassandra they might be good contact points for uh you know for setting up proof of concepts or stuff like that or any kind of further interaction so that being said i would like alex you if you please uh paste in the chat the link to the questions to the ask me anything website that would be great because sure i'm sure today's present this presentation will make you come up with more questions and if you think they are interesting please paste them in that link so we can then discuss them at length in in the q a session right and best questions get prizes yes and you can vote other people's question if you're interested in them as well and they will be awarded the price okay so with that out of the way uh let's go back to the topic data modeling with cassandra that is building efficient applications or in other words how not to shoot yourself in the foot with apache cassandra because this is something we mentioned already in passing if you just take your relational knowledge and apply it to cassandra you might probably run into problems after later because it's a powerful database but it's very different in terms of internal architecture it's very different than relational databases it's one of the very one of the many flavors of nosql database and this means that some knowledge of how it works internally is needed to be able to exploit its wonderful performance and ability to scale so before we start something that we i'd like to repeat to refresh to all of you um this whole day will be still available for watching later on youtube on this very same link now i just mentioned about questions so you can ask them in the chat which is uh so they're only for the duration of today so be worried because best thing would be to ask questions in the q a website so we can then discuss them later we say just right now prices so please add your name to the questions so you can track them to the price recipient another option is to contact us and maybe keep in contact join us on discord uh the link maybe alex you can paste the link now so we can on discord we have a thriving community and we can bring the discussion forward you can have other questions we can discuss for a long time and there is a whole community of cassandra experts there to help you setting up your whatever your application whatever so uh to this workshop about data modeling is a bit less than two hours um which is obviously not enough to cover everything with data model but should give you a good start and maybe uh wake up your curiosity for more uh in order to get the best from this workshop you should have absorbed some of the notions that alex presented earlier in the fundamentals so at least you should know what a database is and in case you know what a relational database is that's good but maybe that's also not so good because this is uh this is a bit of knowledge that you have to somehow shed off to properly work with cassandra it will become clear in a while okay last remark when i say cassandra here i mean not only apache cassandra the the the titular product but also its commercial uh version data stacks enterprise or it's in the cloud wrapping so the product built on apache cassandra that you used earlier for the exercise which is uh data stacks astra so this is a broad sense when i say cassandra okay so who am i we met already i'm stefano i'm a developer advocate at data stacks i'm happy to connect developers with the power of apache cassandra this is um how you might want to get in touch with me so please do i'm very happy to that yeah i used to be a theoretical physicist and now i work in the it industry and uh yeah i like spiders as a personal note i like spider biology but that's not relevant alex you met already so let's move forward okay so um what are the points of today's uh presentation first we will introduce a bit cassandra for uh as a refresh we will touch on some of the points that have been seen this morning already after that we will see the role that denormalization plays in the basic design of cassandra and so how tables are structured and what is the goal of the normalization with that in mind we will see we will have a closer look at partitioning and primary keys a concept that you've seen already this morning that will lead us to have a deep inspection of how to query data and how queries work which is important and will lead to the main dish of this presentation which is data modeling proper so how you design your database when you want to have an application running on it after that if the time if there is enough time we will touch on other say side dishes side topics that might be very useful to have in your tool belt when you start uh approaching modeling of your data with cassandra okay so let's start with the introduction alex is there is that all right in the chat and yes yes we are going to just okay you can just start okay so first question what is data modeling well data modeling is the set of activities that make you able to design your database according to what your application needs so you start with just an idea of what is the application you are going to build probably we are in 2021 so probably it will be a web application or whatever it is you have an idea of your application what it needs and you do data modeling this operation and you end up with your database created there ready to use this is data modeling so before starting looking at how data modeling works in itself let's summarize some key features some key aspects of cassandra you've seen them in the already this morning but a quick refresh doesn't hurt so what is cassandra cassandra is a high performance nosql database and it is very powerful but in order to use this power you need some knowledge on how to use it so high performance size cassandra is able to deal with uh very big data so what is called the web scale you've seen briefly this morning in the introduction slide in the 15-minute introductory introductory presentation that cassandra is able to deal with databases of size uh hundreds of petabytes so that is one tenth of an exabyte so there is some such a thing as an exabyte and cassandra is able to deal with this scale of data which is astonishing all of these hosted on commodity hardware so you don't have to necessarily buy expensive dedicated super super powerful servers but you can just have many many ordinary machines speed another thing about performance cassandra is optimized for rights so rides are designed to be extremely fast that's not to say that reads are not but usually writes are the pain points for many systems so cassandra is fast it can sustain tens of thousands of operations per second per node sometimes we say transactions but this is a dangerous term in this context because as you will see there are no transactions in the relational sense so let's say operation writes and reads and when i say operations per second per node i say per node which means that cassandra is structured to be distributed to be heavily distributed so a a typical cassandra database is distributed over many many nodes nodes might be virtual machines physical machines whatever but they are servers and they collectively form your database indeed a cassandra database might also be spread over the world in different data centers one in us one in singapore one in italy and so on and they still form a single database with all of the advantages of that and the internal complexity of making this work but that's a problem for cassandra not for you so what is a nosql database um basically it means that it's it goes beyond the relational database paradigm in particular it is not relational and it is not transactional so very briefly there are no joints in cassandra which might be puzzling to relational guys who are watching we will look at this in more detail no joints no foreign keys no transactions so that already might suggest that when you are building your application and you are designing the database behind it some different line of thinking is required and you will see that okay so you must learn how to use cassandra to squeeze its high performance yes because let's say let's face it uh it's easy to just naively approach cassandra and yeah make an underperforming application make an underperforming data model a good point is do you have somehow to unlearn some of the relational knowledge that has been traditional for more than 50 years now that's because if you get the data model wrong your performance will suffer from that so some in some of the knowledge of how cassandra works internally is crucial to get this right and let me tell you this if you start with the wrong data model and you then go in production and then you have to change it that's going to be something that you want to avoid so you better spend some time in in modeling your data properly and then you jump in production uh yeah you know with a bit more confidence of how it will perform okay so that's by way of you know introduction and let's uh touch on another point so there is in the world of databases there is a big distinction a big access you can place databases on so you can classify workloads according to this big distinction between oltp and olap so oltp online transaction processing is the kind of workload where you just need to every single operation is you go to one table you change a single piece of data and that's it so very predictable very simple kind of operations like i don't know up increasing a number writing a new row changing the status of an item in from warehouse to shipped something like that and this is a very typical workload and usually this requires almost real time it has to be fast operations are going to be simple so you see here need answers now so it has to be fast because this is usually what is right behind my application right behind my client my customers and it has to work quickly usually the queries in this case are simple and they are unchanged so they stay the same throughout the life of your of your application sorry usually oil tv stays on the customer side of your application because your customers will not wait if you are slow they will go to your competitors so otp stands for fast answers and that's what matters the most yeah exactly good thank you fast answers and luckily simple operations on the database usually just on a single piece of data and that's it on the other hand end of the spectrum there is all up all up is the typical big complex analytics workload something that might involve a lot of data that have been that has to have to be you know coordinated compared the mangled in various ways shuffled and then reprocessed and a lot of things complex queries that involve comparison of different pieces of data and that's probably something that is not directly facing your customers is more of an internal thing you want you want to have every friday night you want to run your big big monster analytics machine in order to optimize special offers for your website the week after that and that might run for three hours and give you results and then maybe you tweak it every week you tweak a bit the analysis to change this and change that and so on so typically all up workloads involve a lot of complex queries in one they are probably evolving all the time they are for internal use so my analytics team in my company will i want every week a report of how are things going what i have to optimize to change and luckily such complexity comes with a relaxed requirement on on response time so i can maybe wait the whole night for for the analytics workload to work no problem but on the other hand it's a complex thing so these are some how to extremes uh you can have workloads all everywhere in in this spectrum this is a continuous spectrum if you want all of this introduction to tell you one thing relational databases somehow our one-size-fits-all kind of thing so back when there were not when there were only relational databases they were used for everything from oltp to all up right and they were they were somehow satisfying all needs up to a given scale uh cassandra is specialized for oltp so cassandra now i don't want cassandra to get angry at me but in a sense is very stupid as a database now this is a joke but what i mean is that cassandra is very good and very fast at doing simple operation a lot of them all the time simple operation go to one row change it right one row and stuff like that it's very quick very real time and so on uh alex sorry i'm hearing some echo maybe you let me shoot something can you say a word yeah that should be gone yeah sorry it was just a bit just not so loud but yeah thank you okay so uh cassandra we were saying is specialized in ltp and it's in itself not particularly optimized for all up workloads uh that's not to say that you can't do them that actually there are very many so there are a few solutions that allow you to use cassandra for the data storage and plug some all up specific tools such as apache spark on top of it okay so another reminder the pros and cons of cassandra cassandra is ready for big data as we have seen now it is very highly available if properly configured it doesn't have any single point of failures remember no masters every node is created equal every data center is created equal so it's really a distributed democratic kind of structure it is possible to have a database that is geographically distributed so distribution involves all of the consideration about cap theorem that you saw so far it is optimized for very fast read and write performance and a very important point is that it is vendor independent namely it is an apache project project which means that it is covered by the apache license which guarantees that it will be open source and ready for you to use now let's look at the possible negative points about cassandra and how we propose a solution to that so cassandra requires qualified engineers so it's not the kind of database that you just install and learn to use like this um yes but that right qualified engineer might be you because there are certification programs and as we mentioned already if you if you are if you become a cassandra expert on average your your pay will be higher um and as of now there is very high demand for cassandra special specialists in the market so that's a good bet another point is that cassandra is perceived by many as complex to manage yes so it's it might require some expertise in the operation side but nowadays there are managed solutions such as the such as the astra that you use this morning for the exercises another point as we mentioned is that cassandra specialized for oltp workloads you remember very fast simple queries that have to work in real time not so much for big complex joins and analytics yeah okay but as we mentioned as i said you can plug easily spark or other solutions on top of it so that's not really a big limitation another point is that cassandra has limited capabilities when it comes to search such as you know you want to do some full text search fuzzy search stuff like that yeah cassandra is not made for that and as alex likes to say good work comes from teamwork so yeah again in this case uh you can couple and it's very easy to couple cassandra to pair it with uh for example lucine based search engines um elasticsearch or solar they go very well with cassandra and yeah it's a good kind of teamwork that makes takes the best of both worlds okay so that was just an overview uh which i conclude with the first glance at the differences between modeling your data in a traditional relational database and in cassandra so okay um in a traditional database you have joins and indexes to to pair and to connect pieces of data in your database namely to connect tables basically with each other in cassandra there is no such a thing and you will work with denormalization which becomes a first-class concept in designing your data pillar of it you will see that uh a relational database offers the comfort of referential integrity so it's a sort of built-in safety in a relational database cassandra doesn't have such a thing and that's you know some some bad news that comes with the fact that you have to scale to very big data very big data very big sizes of your data set so you just would not be able to to keep performance high while enforcing refraction integrity which is one of the points that requires you to to think different in a relational database the primary key of a table is there to ensure uniqueness and that's it while in cassandra it also contains information on how data is partitioned and how data will be accessed in your queries you saw most of it already and we will come to that later very in detail because it's important now when you model data in a relational database you start with the entities and then you build the queries for your application in cassandra that's the other way around you start with your application and from the queries you build the database and you will see what i mean by that it's fun okay so that's it and i think it's time to go in to the topics so denormalization that's a very important concept and in order to have a look at the normalization i would like to start with normalization normalization is a very big idea that somehow marked the the birth of a relational databases back 51 years ago the idea it was was invented by edgar cott to to make databases able to automatically guarantee data integrity so a series of what is what are called normal forms was invented and they made it possible to [Music] comply with the rule never duplicate information so look at these three example tables there is a table with recipes there is a table on the right with ingredients but you see that a recipe contains many ingredients so we have pizza that contains mozzarella champignons and so on and we will have a third table that just expresses the pears the couples of any ingredient with any recipe you see that the name pizza occurs only once and the name mozzarella occurs only once the relations are just indices so this is how you would solve this one-to-many relation in a relational database so you see there is no duplicate information and you can anticipate if you have some experience with that that you pay this formally elegant solution with in general complex queries you have to do joins to find what are actually the answers to your questions indeed let's stay with the pizza and ingredients example i anticipated already that this talk is full of pizza and because i like pizza and you will see a few pizza here and there in the slides so be prepared uh luckily you already had the lunch so that's okay for you it should not make you you know drool okay so normalization you first design the tables because the tables are they describe the word there is a table for ingredients there is a table for recipes and then you create more tables for the relations and once you design the tables actually it's still up to you you're still free to decide exactly what is your question i might want so okay here you just see the standard sql syntax for creating and populating these tables in the example you see there are relations between a field in a table corresponds to a foreign key in another table and so on this is not news this is not even the focus of today but the point is that once i created the table i can just invent any query so if i need the ingredients for the pizza there is this particular query that is a query that joins um across three tables and gives me the answer so pizza and pizza has mozzarella and champignons and to give to get this answer i'm actually already have to join three tables and do some complex things but then i need the answer to a different question and i just can use the same table so really there is no repetition of data and i can get everything so i can start with the tables and then i can design my my application basically my queries that's good but that's also not so good because you see this was a simple example but in real life in real applications as time goes by and i have more and more tables more and more data my queries start to get unavoidably slow because they have to join data to do complex things and so on so my typical query will be a tower of joins and performance is not happy so this is something that was already happening as relational databases got bigger and bigger and performance requirements were heavier so higher and higher engineers starting started doing this okay you know yeah relational and whatnot but let us just duplicate the data here and there so the reads are faster that's a bit of a violation of the principles but you know speed is important because my application has to be fast otherwise my customers will turn to my competitor so yeah you see this table this table has this table violates the normal forms because i have pizza twice i have cake twice i want to express the fact that pizza contains two ingredients and i duplicated the name pizza yeah that's bad for the normal forms that's bad for the relationals but you know what it's fast because then when i have to query this table to get ingredients for the pizza i query a single table and mind that because of performance needs that was happening already in relational databases by the end uh so the idea is well let's take this idea and make it a first class concept in designing your database so not it's not something frowned upon anymore but it will become the main idea of how i design my database and this is something that cassandra embraces so in cassandra you will have to take the denormalization as this is called has granted and work starting from this tada this was a big point so you will see uh application of this idea later but let's just look at this point in detail so denormalization means you can have redundant data you can duplicate the data and that's okay with the goal that every query just has to look at one single table i will never have to you know look at different tables and merge data and compare data to answer my one question so every query goes straight to one table that's good because it's fast it's fast in reading because i just read the table but it's also fast in writing in a sense because while joints cannot be performed in in parallel joints have to be sequential so reading is would be slower in relational i can arrange my rights in a way that they work in parallel so yes on one side i'm moving the burden of you know connecting data to from the right from the reading phase to the writing phase but like there i also have them running faster because i can parallelize them that's so it's a double advantage double because uh usually i need my application to be fast especially in reading which happens much more often in most cases so i i move the slowness if you want away from the most used path of my application reading uh this idea plays very well with that system that is highly distributed as cassandra is as a big data system has to be um there is another implication though that is if i if i have to handle denormalized data myself so there is nothing in the database enforcing you know constraints and data integrity that means that my application will be responsible for that yes that's the price to pay so i will have to make sure that my application does for example multiple rights in a consistent way yes but you know what this is a small price to pay to have your application fast and able to deal with a lot of data which is what nowaday applications are required to do so yeah the point is that cassandra supports no joins and this is a central point because it makes application it makes queries fast but it also makes you it forces you to think very differently about how you organize your data you see in this in this small sketch you see on the left the relational world where every query had to query a lot of tables in general while in cassandra the schema is very simple one table one query in particular every query has to be only on a single table and this is the recipe so the idea for the normalizing data properly is you put all columns that you need for a query in a single table because you will have no joins and that makes for simple fast queries because as we said you need a query to be able to just go to a single table to get what you need and this has a very important implication that is one of the main philosophies of data modeling with cassandra identify the queries and then create the tables accordingly we will see this more in detail and this might sound scary and strange and foreign at first but remember that redundancy repeating data in many places is okay is your friend is your friend because as we said performance is important so it's very much cheaper to have more disk more disk space compared to having slow applications and losing customers but you know what in order to put this philosophy in action you need to know something more about how cassandra works okay so alex uh how are we going with questions are there all good we just we just discussing with jeremy job market in singapore but other than that looks like your explanations are perfectly clear and we get a lot of questions on slido which is amazing by the way don't forget not only to submit your questions on slido but also like uh questions of others so we will know what you feel the most important and what do you want to know the most yeah yeah definitely okay so i can go go on okay so let's have a closer look at how keys and partitions work in apache cassandra so how is data organized in a table yeah because after all data model is designing table and designing a table is uh what so the the structure of a table is what the term is uniqueness in in of rows in the table not only that but it also determines how the rows are grouped and distributed across the nodes in this big ring it also determines which are the queries that i can run and which queries i can't so that's very important and also depending on how the table is made there are some pieces of data some columns that i have to specify when i do writes okay and this is important this has to be known even to developers in a sense at least to those who design the application because that the two things so table structure and application are very tightly coupled i would say much more than in a relational database but first things first let's start with a concept that is probably very well known even to relational database engineers what is a table in cassandra you saw already this morning that cassandra structures data in tables so no nothing uh strange so far tables are a bit like a spreadsheet so it is rows times columns so there is an example here there is a table that i call reviews by recipe why because we started with pizza and ingredients and now we have an application let's pretend we have an application where there are recipes and there are reviewers who write reviews of recipes so look at the first line anita wrote a review about pizza on a particular day giving it a rating of eight with a comment and so on so this is the the core of my application is reviewers writing uh reviews of ingredient recipes okay and this is stored in this table here now the point is that in general if i design a table i have to devise a primary key what is the primary key it is a set of columns that is used to define uniqueness of rows that means that i cannot have two rows with the same values for the primary key so the primary key identifies uniquely every row of my table so look at this example reviews by recipes or anyway this is application of uh reviewers writing reviews of dishes what would be a good choice for the primary key remember i have to guarantee uniqueness let's see if i just take the recipe name as primary key that is really not good because you see i have different people writing reviews on pizza so pizza alone is not the f is not enough to guarantee uniqueness of the rose so maybe i want to add reviewer so i have pizza anita and pizza carl that would be great so that's okay the third choice i might be tempted to add rating itself so recipe name reviewer and rating well that's actually makes for unique rows but i would say it doesn't really make sense because that would that would make it possible to have a review by the same person for the same uh for the same recipe with different ratings two different rows that really i don't think that rating is belongs to the primary key it's just an attribute of that review so it doesn't make sense no rating then i might think of adding the date which is also okay and as you see the choice of primary key is ultimately also a function of what how i want my application to work because yeah i might this this is up to me up to how the application is designed shall i allow the same person to leave two different reviews to pizza on different days or not depending on the answer i might want one or the other choice for for the primary key okay so can a reviewer vote multiple times yes or no then i choose the primary key accordingly so there is a title coupling between table structure and my application needs so for today we will decide that anita will be able to leave different reviews to pizza on different days which means that we want to store the whole history of reviews by anita on pizza why not that's how my application has to work which means that we choose recipe name date and reviewer as uh the primary key you see i marked them in blue and that's how the table is now structured so uniqueness is guaranteed and we can go on i hope so far it's all clear this is a relational database kind of concept and nothing so new now uniqueness means that a primary key identifies uniquely and every row in my table every piece of data which also has the implication that if i have to insert a single row or update i have to provide all values for the primary key so if i have to write a new row at least those three fields have to be provided and if i have to let's say edit the command by anita i have to provide the three fields to identify the row i'm going to change it doesn't really make sense to edit those values because that would be a different row right so it's more like if i have to change the reviewer it's not an update overall it's more like deleting a row and creating a new one so that's the role of primary key uniqueness and defining which row i have to reach okay now very briefly um somebody might ask okay but instead of using these three columns to identify the recipe and the review uh or better instead of using pizza to identify the recipe i might have an id which maps to a different tables that is sort of a relational table basically that maps a recipe id to the name yes that's not a problem why not uh the choice between using organic or surrogate keys ultimately lies in well i would say a matter of taste is but more more to the point how exactly your application flow is there might be cases where using surrogate keys is best other cases where using uh natural keys organic keys is better but this is really not something for today we will stick to using the natural organic pizza instead of using an id and a third another table but this is just to say that there might be traces of relationality in cassandra which however will have to be dealt with in your application and not by the database as we said there are no joints in cassandra you have to emulate them in your application okay i would say so far so good for uh primary keys and let's look at something more specific to cassandra partitioning this is something we use already partitioning is related to the partition key so we just saw let's go back one second we just saw that this table has three different columns that make the primary key recipe name date and reviewer now some of these columns at least one are also the pr the partition key the partition key is a set of the primary key columns and it determines how rows are grouped together and how are they how they are stored in the cluster on which nodes they are stored you saw that this morning and we will see examples shortly the point is that you have to know this to properly design your database to suit your application so here there's an example of this recipe application we have we choose recipe name to be the partition key you see i made it red to distinguish from the rest of the primary key you see recipe name is red and it is the partition key now this circle with the orange dots is my ring my cluster and each no each node is a orange blob and you see that my one table is spread over the nodes you probably don't see much because it's a mess and i agree but it is a mess because i i use the replication factor of three because i'm in production so every piece of data is on three different machines which is good for production but not so good for explanations so let me do something not good for production but very good today i will bring the replication factor to one for clarity no no yes but you're just kidding just kidding yeah don't worry we will have a replication factor of three when this application lands in production don't worry but now it's clearer right so look at this table this is a single table and it has a lot of rows but look the rows are grouped by partition key so all the rows with pizza are on one note all the rows with pasta are on another note and so on and well incidentally there are a few notes with more than one partition that's okay that's not a problem and it will happen because usually you have many more partitions than nodes that's absolutely not a problem the important thing is that the opposite never happens you will not have pizza split between nodes pizza is always all together on a machine on a physical machine and that's because we choose pizza as the partition key so yeah here's the summary what we say each row belongs to a partition depending on the value of the partition key for example here is recipe name so all pizza are together on which node well it depends on the on the value in the partition key there is a hashing algorithm that determines which node will host the the partition by the way this is known to all nodes so everyone is able to directly go to the right node when it when it when it's about a particular value of the partition key so no need for communication basically and that's so the very important implication of these is that if you want your application to be fast to be production level fast and to scale to very big data you have to write your tables so that every query always goes to a single partition in this way every query will go straight to one node and even if you have 10 000 nodes you will your query will be as fast as on a single node basically because there is no need to it so it will not scale in any way with the number of nodes and the amount of data because it will always go straight to single node so this is how this is the recipe for being able to scale to large volumes of data every query has to go to a single partition to avoid full table full cluster scans and performance penalties and that's a very important point now suppose for some reason i want to design my table differently so it is the same table the same data but now i decide that the primary key is the same but i partition by recipe name and reviewer look at what happens the way data is distributed across the nodes is completely different and in particular if you look at the values of the partition key which is now recipe name and reviewer again you will always see rows with the same values for the two columns grouped together look at the at the upper right solid aldo it's two rows and they are always together now i have many more partitions they are smaller but still every partition is exactly on one node it is just a matter of having chosen a different partition by the way once your table is made is done is created you will not be able to change the partitioning because it's one of the foundational features of the table okay so choose wisely i have to say anyway if you change the if you think of a different way of partitioning the table the data will be very differently distributed and if you remember this point no query shall ever need to look at more than one partition then you can imagine how first you look at your query and then you design the partitioning because if you choose this different partitioning you will have you will be able to sustain different queries now you've seen two different ways of grouping the data so two different partitionings for basically the same table and you might ask yourself yes but what is the right choice and the answer is it depends because what is the query you want to run on the table so you see the point first think of the query and that will tell you what is the right way to partition data because uh the data is the same so it's the reviews of recipes done by various people on the first on different dates but it depends on what i want to get from this table if i want to be able to get all reviews of pizza by anybody i will have to stick to the first way of partitioning if i if i'm okay with getting just the reviews of pizza by anita so always in recipe and reviewer and only that set of reviews then maybe the second choice is okay you see there are pros and cons in choosing the partitions and this question came up in the morning so how to choose your your right balance between basically larger partitions that allow for larger queries so to speak and smaller partitions which probably make it possible to query smaller sets of data in a sense the answer is in your application so what kind of flow your application has what kind of access pattern your data have has to support so on one side you have giant partitions which is a known problem so large partitions very large partitions are danger for performance on the other end of the spectrum you have thin small partitions which is good system-wise so performance-wise but it might be too fine-grained to sustain your application flow and finding the right middle ground for in this is in a sense the essence of data model that's not the end of it because you might just have a single application that needs to support different query patterns on the same data so again in our example let's say my application has different workflow has different flows and there is both a screen that makes me look at all pizza reviews and there is also another way another page in the ui that makes me able to see all reviews by anita so looking at what we just said on partitioning and queries i think you can understand that a single table will not be able to to make both queries possible because either i partition by recipe or by reviewer in this case no problem let's create two tables same data duplicated written in two different ways two tables and every query will have its own table now attention relational people out there in cassandra that's absolutely fine and that's actually one of the one of the most uh suggested design patterns i want to access my data in two different ways two queries that somehow would not be possible in a single partitioning i create two tables no problem remember that disk space is not so expensive what is expensive is slow access to data and losing customers so no problem here so what is the point table duplication goodbye relational uh goodbye normal forms goodbye uh yeah relational patterns just embrace the normalization and have fast queries right obviously as we said in this case my application will be tasked with the duty of doing multiple rights so what it will do then no problem so you see a very so in cassandra you have to be a thing you have to make a query go to a single table you have to but as in this example most likely you might want to have a single query per table as well so that's a one way is uh enforced and the other is probably needed in most cases and again you have no joints so this is how you go about it now um so much for partitioning uh we just remind you of a few pitfalls that you might encounter when you create your table you saw them this morning already so no no problem but very quickly um you might have the case where everybody reviews pizza and nobody thinks of other dishes like i would do i would just think of pizza all the time and in that case if my partition is recipe name i might have the hot partition because one single partition is constantly written written written and maybe red red red the others sit there idle sleeping so i might have a cluster of 1000 nodes but still it would be a single node responsible for all of the traffic so i'm not using my database very well and i have a clear bottleneck the hot partition so storage and load and cpu and everything is very much uneven that's no good so this is a point and usually this makes me redesign the data model to accommodate a more even distribution of load and data and yeah read write workload another problem is that maybe my data model might be good for a little while then time goes on there is a bit of echo alex sorry sorry are you sure let me check okay but not not so big so so as years go by my data model that was working starts to accumulate more and more rows in each partition it's a bit like the iot example with sensor this morning right so let's say a lot of people write reviews and they are grouped just by recipe name and reviewer so carl year after year writes a lot of reviews of pizza eventually the table will become sorry the partition will become too large and it will not work anymore very well now this is important the point is not having a lot of data in the table that's okay that's what cassandra is there for a lot of data in the table the point is not having growing partition beyond a given size and the solution is bucketing as we saw this morning one of the solutions is bucketing i can create a synthetic column in this case year month built based on the date just to group every month of reviews in a different partition so i sort of limit the growth of partitions because every month i will move to a new partition and then i will avoid giant ever growing partitions and let me say you that probably uh my application will work the same because i can hardly see a case where your application really needs to get all part all reviews by carlon pizza forever from the very past so that should be a good solution in this case okay so partitioning it's very important to know how it works and to know how your table will be partitioned because otherwise your data model will probably fail somehow the main lesson is that your query should always go straight to a single partition which implies it will go to a single machine and then it will be fast so the lesson is store together what you have to retrieve together easy then you should be paying attention to avoid the very big partitions which means not so many not too many cells not too many rows and not too many you know megabytes in your partition there are ways to estimate these sizes uh depending on on your application needs and data model and then you should be able you should avoid the you know uneven loads so you should be able to evenly distribute io and storage as much as possible that's more or less it for partitioning um there is another point that is very important for completing this way this this chapter and it is the clustering because uh so far we've been seeing the whole primary key part of it is the partition key what about the other columns because in general there might be columns that are in the primary key and they are not in the partition key they are called clustering columns and they define how rows are sorted within each partition think about it if i have columns in the primary key which are not in the partition key like the blue ones you see here that implies that potentially my partition will have many rows right because they you might have different dates and different reviewers for pizza and you there will be more rows several rows in the pizza partition so the question is how are those rows sorted well they are sorted by clustering columns you see in this case clustering columns are date and reviewer so the leftover if you if you forget about partition and you can see that within the pizza partition the rows are kept sorted by date and if there were different if there were equal dates for two rows then the sorting would be by reviewer as is in the solid partition so what is the point cassandra is very effective in keeping this data sorted so everywhere within the belly of cassandra after insertion data is already sorted ready for you to be browsed in in that particular order very efficiently and the point is that one because when you query a partition you can query the whole partition part of it whatever but data within the partition will be browsed in that particular order so even choosing the right clustering within the partition is important and it will be dictated by the needs of your application because if you have cassandra scroll through contiguous browse in a partition cassandra is happy if you start having cassandra jump across different disconnected parts of your partition that doesn't work that's ineffective and cassandra actually does not let you do that in general so even the clustering is important and that's what i said so how to choose clustering you have to look at your queries again because cassandra is made to scroll in that order no jumps so again depending on what are your queries you have to choose a different clustering so let's say your application shows pizza reviews so reviews by a single recipe which we already know means you partition by recipe very good but then what do you want to do within the pizza reviews do you want to sort them by date do you want to sort them by reviewer yeah those two cases require different clustering you see here if i want to sort them by date i probably have to put date first in the clustering if i want to list reviews by reviewer if i want cassandra to give me reviews for pizza by reviewer um i will have to p to put reviewer as the first clustering column in the primary key now that being said uh in a sense so many queries will require different clustering but let's so don't forget that if i there are queries that are good maybe with any in particular if i need all reviews for pizza i want to get the whole partition so no big difference probably but still so my point is that clustering within the partition is important because even for clustering depending on what your query does i have to choose a different way of clustering now i i appreciate that so far i haven't shown you a single as a single cql statement a single line of sql now here we go that's just actually it's not so different from what you saw what we saw this morning in the in the hands-on small practice session this is how you create the table of the rib of the recipes in cql so this is so here you see on the on the top of the slide you see the partitioning so recipe name is the partitioning which together with data reviewer makes for the primary key and i have two other fields and this statement creates table is how you do that in cql which is not so different from sql right so create table name followed by column names and their type data type and then there is this important statement primary key primary key is recipe name date reviewer and in particular recipe name is also enclosed in an additional set of parentheses which is what tells what the notes the partition key as part of the primary key then for the clustering columns you see i also want to specify the sorting whether the sending or ascending and that's how we create a table easy okay that was a very big section of today's presentation and i want to summarize it with this one sketch so my table has a primary key which is connected to uniqueness of rows and besides the primary key there are the data columns so rating command whatever and in turn and this is very cassandra specific the primary key is split into partition key which has to exist and it will define partitioning so any partition goes to a single node every query better goes to a single partition otherwise performance is bad which means that partitioning has to be chosen very wisely the rest of the primary key if there is any determines the ordering within the partition so how the rows are structured and kept within the partition and how are they browsed when you query and this also is uh has constraints on what queries i can do so it will be my queries so my application will determine how i choose the clustering as well okay i appreciate this was pretty mouthful of concepts but it's very important so i would like to stop one minute and maybe ask alex how are we doing in in the chat so in the chat you have jeremy and me and that means what everything is answered yeah there is just one very fresh new question from narendra what is the default ordering of clustering columns uh frankly speaking i always prefer to define uh it explicitly so i just really don't remember where the full set i think it's ascending i think it's ascending i think it's ascending sure should be ascending but usually yeah explicit is better than implicit because you might have to share i mean the the the statements that make your data model are a documentation for your data model so it's good if they are self explanatory but right yeah you can actually you can actually create a table and then do a describe table and you will see the defaults play but yeah i don't remember either anyway and there is a great question by rajiv so you mean to say application requirement will drive the data modeling more of a top-down approach and my answer was yes exactly that's you got it perfectly yes and we will soon see how it works yeah soon we explain it in more details yeah it's nice okay i'll i'll save my comments on that for later i mean we will come to that in yeah 15 minutes or so because we are almost on time so we should make it yeah that's the most important part so yeah i would say every section here is the most important part so pay attention please okay so let me continue if that's okay and we move to the section about how you query data and write data in apache cassandra because armed with this extensive knowledge on partitioning and keys and primary keys and everything we are now able to look in detail at how queries are to be structured now reading is more uh let's say important than writing but let's say reading is more has to be approached more carefully so we will start with writing writing is not so difficult to understand in cassandra there is just a very big big premise i want to make cassandra as we said is designed to be fast in writing which means that generally speaking if you're writing cassandra you just write what do i mean by that i mean that there will be not no helpful santa claus in cassandra that goes looking in your table when you want to write and checks if the if the row is there already and maybe issues an error nothing like that so if you write a row in cassandra whether the row existed already or not the last right wings so if you happen to overwrite a previous value it will just happen silently that's very simple that's because going to have a read before the write is executed will be terribly slow in general and in most applications in most cases you can design your data model in a way that doesn't need to do this read before right and actually this is an anti-patterning cassandra so be careful because if you write you may just happen to overwrite a previous value if there is any indeed in cassandra insert and updates are basically the same and there is a word called absurd that encompasses both i say almost the same because there are uh there are corner cases connected with counters but that's let's say that's a special topic let's forget about counter so far so let's say in certain updates are the same you just write and that's important because in some relational applications there is a pattern of trying the right and then catching an error if the role existed already and maybe the application behaves in a way if the if the raw existed already that's not something you can do with cassandra but that's again for the sake of extreme speed in writing you're just right right right okay that's a very important caveat because yeah this is how it works um in cassandra obviously if you want to insert or update a single row you have to provide the full primary key because otherwise how could you identify properly the row you want to write to so this is how you do an insert in cql that's really similar to sql sometimes also a deceiving similarity because there is a very different underlying architecture but still insert into table and then you write a few a list of field names column names followed by values and then a corresponding matching list of values so this is how i insert a new review or maybe a pre-existing review which is overwritten into my table that's it that's how you write okay so writing is basically out of our way let's focus on reading and there is a bit more to say about reading because as i said the apparent similarity so the the superficial similarity of sql to cql might be deceiving because there are uh in the belly of cassandra there are big differences compared to typical relational databases you should know many of them by now so this is how you do a reading and that's nothing fancy i guess select columns from table where column equal value that's it so this is how i want all reviews about pizza from the table and look at the results it's perfect no reviewer rating command and i get everything i need my point is that behind this statement there are there is a lot of fine print all coming from the many subtleties with clustering and partitioning that we saw earlier this translates into some very strong constraints on the on what i can put in the where part of this select let's look at them because you remember i want my query to reach a single partition that's one point second point reads within the partition have to be sequential in clustering so what are the implications of that well first point i want to reach a single partition that means that in my where i better specify the whole partition key with equal sign so as alex remarked earlier i cannot use greater or lesser in the partition key columns because that again would imply having to look at potentially a lot of partitions and that's not efficient that's not going so that would not limit my query to a single node so i have to specify the whole partition key with equal signs first point second point i might want the whole partition yes or i might want to to get part of it maybe just a single row anyway if if i specify some or even all of the clustering columns i have to do that in a particular way because if i use a clustering column i have to specify also all the columns to the left so the more the more significant columns if i may say so think about how rows are sorted and kept ordered within the partition so if i want to specify a particular clustering column i have to put an equal sign to all previous clustering columns that's because cassandra does not like to jump within the partition it has to go contiguously through it so yeah only the last clustering column can have an equality so the last one i specify can have an inequality the previous ones have to be there with equal signs but again nothing prevents me to from just not writing anything about clustering and i will get the whole partition that's fine that's a pattern no problem it will go to one node all good and third point my where condition just can't reference any other column that is not in the primary key at all so you see there are pretty strong constraints compared to the freedom you have in a relational database but they are in a sense the price for performance for speed for scale for distribution of data now there are various remarks here in order one is about indices so you can define indexes and i will have some words on them by the end but let me just say this yes there are indices but your the bulk of your data model should not rely on them should be more like design in the right tables vanilla tables in this sense the second point is that there are ways to overcome these limitations which basically tell cassandra yeah i know i am doing a full cluster scan please let me do that and this is this will work but this is something you don't want to bring over to production this is something more for you know testing or for very small tables very small databases not something that will scale to production so the the very famous close allow filtering i will pretend it doesn't exist today yep as we usually uh say as we usually say everything what you need to know about hello filtering do not use a low filtering yeah unless you know very well what you're doing which will come later in your journey into cassandra i would say okay so let's look at a few examples on based on our good old recipes table so recipe name is the party is the partition key and date and reviewer in that order are clustering columns so with this table these five different where clauses are all allowed let's have a quick look at them so the first one recipe name equal pizza that's good that's a whole single big partition but that's one single partition so that works this is a query that works the second one recipe name equal pizza and date equal something again that's good let's specify a portion of a partition but if you think about clustering within the pizza partition that specify a contiguous chunk of data within the pizza so that's good even recipe name equal pizza and the date greater than something is good because within the partition inequalities are okay and this is still a contiguous block of rows the same goes for the fourth example where i specify recipe name equals salad so i go to a single partition that's good date equals something and reviewer greater than that's good again because the first clustering column is an equal and within that part of that within the portion of the partition of that date i will get a chunk a contiguous chunk in reviewer greater than and that's fine because there it's contiguous rows all good all nice the last example also is good because nothing prevents me from specifying date greater and date lesser than this is still again a contiguous block of rose within the solid partition so these are all valid where clauses so if i if i'm designing my table this is important to keep in mind there is pretty some freedom once i design a table of queries that i can do but still there are queries that are just wrong that will not work look at those um rating equal 9 that's not even a a primary key column that's probably that's sure not working no second case i specify a partition pizza and rating equal nine no way still rating is not in the partition in the primary key i cannot just i just cannot use it in queries no third example recipe name greater than pizza while i appreciate the idea of using the partition key there's an inequality so again i behind the scenes that would ask that would require a cluster scan i would have to contact a lot of nodes potentially and that's not good so no fourth example recipe name equals salad good so far and reviewer equal card wait a minute i'm skipping dates date is the most significant clustering column within the res the partition and i'm skipping it and that means i want to get leapfrog rows within the partition salad so that's not good either and the last example uh is just wrong because even if i specify a date like this with an inequality that would be good so far so recipe name and date lesser than would be good but then i when i say review a required card again i i would like to have a leapfrog access within the partition and that's just not good so all of these queries are not forbidden for button no no no yeah okay just for your for completeness this is the full formal syntax for the select statement and this is just something you can look up in the documentation and just i i put it here just to make you aware that there are a lot of constraints on what i can put in various parts of this statement depending on the shape of the table so there are some pretty strong constraints and again this is somehow the result that cassandra chooses for the compromise between you know speed performance and flexibility this is just its philosophy so okay so um reading and writing in a slide so let's not forget that when you write first insert an update is the same operation and when you write you have to specify the whole primary key to to to tell cassandra with what is the role you want to touch basically the important thing is when you read when you read you have very many constraints as a consequence of how the table is structured and now partitioning work so you have to put equal signs to all columns in the partition key when you read and when you specify clustering columns you have to keep in mind that you cassandra wants to access contiguous chunks of data so think of what you have to specify in the clustering requirements and uh you can't use any other column in the word close so you see there are a lot of constraints on the on the day on on the reading so that's why you have to first think carefully of your queries of the queries for your application and then you create the tables so i think now this is making more and more sense to you okay so how are we doing with questions i think you're keeping pace with anything there you know what uh yeah in general yes but uh ck wong managed to ask a question what got us unprepared both jeremy yoshi and me uh what how cassandra handles situation when we change value of uh partition key like update something you can't do that no no no no not alter not alter but yeah no no uh you can't do that i think it you you you get an error in sql you have to delete and then reinsert explicitly i think it's i i hope uh some of ours will make a little experiment because it's easy to check especially i think you would get you get a very big right error in uh wait maybe [Music] no that would take us too much time maybe but okay uh okay so that's answering live set video id equal a video id is without underscore sorry oh yeah so update comments by video set with uh with set id equal let's just do something where either the equal no no big deal but paste and user id uh you don't have to put user id i believe here oh sorry comment id oh yeah i mean oh yeah no because i still have the big fonts so yep ah sorry you you find my my little clip about the secrets this is okay let's see yeah video id found in set part so yes that's i mean the structure of the table makes it makes it impossible so yeah you get the big red error and if you really want to do that that even conceptually means that you have to you are not updating a row you're just deleting a row and creating a new uniquely different one so make sense that you get this error that was a great answer stepping on just perfect okay so uh you see live answers are always proof of a truth unfortunately i think we are starting to run out of time so i better go to the data modeling proper because that's the core of today uh of this this presentation and let's look at how you basic how to how you really practically build your data model starting from your application okay so um this is the basic let's say flow chart on how you build your model with cassandra um let's say there is a big uh there is a science to it there is a whole formal procedure you start with this and follow the steps and then it's almost like an algorithm that will bring you to having your final data model all nice and ready but there are also some choices that are left to you to your sensibility in a sense to your preferences so it's a mixture of art and science but all in all the methodology to create a data model is a mature practice now and i will just describe it step after step the main point as we said already is that you start with your application you identify what your application does and what are the objects it works on which are the two first blocks so entity relationship diagram and application workflow you map one on to the other which will make it evident what are the queries in your application now you know the queries and we are at the logical data model step and we can build a table for each query the table will still be somehow an abstract kind of thing so a logical thing we will express it in a specific notation that is friendly for cassandra tables with the optimization step we will do last checks and define a few small things and check everything and optimize and make it concrete ending up with the physical data model which is basically equivalent to having our create stable statements written so that's more or less the the flow from left to right you start with a general abstract idea and you end up with create table statements one per query in general okay so let's start entity relationship diagram well that is the same as in a relational database you just take a piece of paper so to speak you speak around with you know product managers ux experts whatever and you end up with the abstract idea of what items and relations are in the game and what are their attributes so speaking of the pizza and the recipe application we have recipes we have reviewers and they are related by a relation as you see here so nothing new for relational experts um both entities and relations in turn have attributes so recipe has a name maybe a preparation time reviewer might have a profile picture url i don't know stuff like that reviews also might have features attributes such as date rating we saw and this is just an abstract schema so you see this is relations first it is indeed very the same as you would do in a relational data modeling process at the same time and in a sort of a mutually influencing uh fashion oh yes or this is also a step where you start thinking of whether to use natural or surrogate keys you remember recipe name or recipe id with another table stuff like that but still okay at the same time you think of your application already before any table is laid out so i can imagine an application where you see there is a proper workflow a flow of the application so what are the various steps the various interactions of the user so the user is at the center and it's so the user experience is at center in this in this process so i think my landing page would be something where i can click on pizza and look at all recipes so all reviews for pizza so this is the first box i want to be able to select all reviews for a recipe sorted by date okay so let's imagine there will be a table behind that then two things might happen the user clicks on anita because there is the name anita in this page and they want to see all reviews by anita regardless of the recipe maybe so there is a second block that is reachable from the first one in in our application flow which is i want to be able to see all reviews by anita sorted by date so pizza salad pasta spaghetti falafel whatever probably there is a different table i think we saw already this case and there will be a different table definitely now uh they might also want to see some more details about anita and this maybe this third page is reachable uh in various ways anyway i want to see some info about carl age email profile picture i don't know so i should be able to select all details of a reviewer by name for example and that probably calls for a third table so you see this is a very important step i have to i need to have clear in my mind what uh the applica how the application works what is the workflow of the application and usually every one of these steps will be a table and will be a query at least okay so now it's time to combine the entity relation diagram with this flow and to do that the mapping step requires me to start thinking in terms of queries so i can i can tentatively translate these three queries that were expressed in english into cql so look at what i did look at the first one select reviewer rating comment from the table where recipe name equal pizza and date greater than something so these are the fields that i probably need from a diff from the table i am about to invent and look at the where close let me go back look at q1 select all reviews for recipe name sorted recent first and this is the where clause of this first query recipe name equals something and date greater than now i i write date greater than because i know that this will basically involve induce my sorting within the partition we can already say that and also because in my realistic application i want to put a a lower limit in how far i go in the past no that makes much sense nobody wants to see a billion rows in my web page maybe at the cost of two seconds loading time or whatever okay now i'm almost ready to do the mapping and this is it so how do i get to the logical data model you see this is the step where i start from my query and i write the first draft the logical form of the table now the logical form of the table is expressed in this blue diagram which is called chiboto diagram after the name of the researcher who invented it and it is especially suited for for cassandra kind of tables you see there are column names and symbols that tell you if it's if it's a partitioning key or a clustering column with its order or other data column now this is still a logical data model a logical diagram you see there are no not yet data types and stuff but the point is that from the query and keeping an eye on the entity relational diagram i should be able to programmatically build this table because i start with what are what are the the the attributes the fields i want to get back you look at the select reviewer rating comment and so these fields have to be in the table okay then you look at the equal signs in um in the where close recipe name so that's how that will become a partition key then you look at the inequality inequality means clustering columns so i put date as a clustering column then i make sure i put the right arrow so in ascending descending and so on the ordering within clustering columns if there is any that would be it except i also have to make sure that uniqueness is properly handled in the table so reviewer even though this query does not need reviewer to be necessarily a clustering column but still i have to obey the uniqueness requirements so i have to promote reviewer to part of the primary key indeed i have to we saw that already and that's it so by applying these steps i end up with tables at least let's say i i end up with a good draft of the table because i still have to do some practical things so to speak uh yeah okay so have i have this draft it's a good time to start thinking of um you know whether i can anticipate hot partitions partitions that are too large ever growing partitions so whether everything makes sense in the light of the practical but pitfalls we highlighted earlier let's say it's a good point to carefully review every problem that might arise and now it's time to make up this model into an explicit create table statement with everything which which involves in particular i have to add data types to columns now there are a lot of things to do here to be said here cassandra offers very many data types so i have to carefully choose the right one you see i have text dates integers uuid you also saw some id type data types this morning that's not the end of it because i have very many solutions to handle the normalization and creative ways there are user defined types which might be just i can have a column of type user because i define the data type called user which is structured thing i can have collections and so on and this is a my small intermeds about data types very quickly because i mean that's just something you can look up in the documentation so i have text integer binary blobs date times you name it uh i will not mention counters much more than that because they have a special behavior and you can maybe learn how to use them later with all their limitations and powers important thing is that i have i can define a column of type list set tuple so there are collection types and you can also nest them i can have a column of type map of maps for example which is a way to handle one too many the normalization since so i have some freedom that's where the the the art part and fantasy the creativity part enters uh user defined types you see i can define a type reviewer id name photo url whatever and i can just define a column of type reviewer okay so back to back to here my only optimization here just to keep it simple is that i noticed that rating is a integer yes but it's always between 0 and 10 so why waste buys when i can have the small integer data type so that's it i pick rating to be a small integer and other than that my table is ready so my physical chabotka diagram is ready and it has become as you see here on the left a full-fledged working create table statement ta-da yeah so this is the end of the process so that's how data model works and you notice and i hope you appreciate that in order to successfully walk through this process you need some knowledge of partitioning querying and everything we saw uh before that okay so this is the end of the data model section and basically the main gist is that you start with the needs of your application and you end up with physical tables being created yeah more to the point you start from queries and you end up with tables in particular partition key is dictated by what groups of rows i have to get at once for my query clustering columns are related to arrangement within the partition so sorting and ordering and basically clustering columns maybe and for sure are the other columns are what are the actual data my query needs for my application to work then you finish the work with the performance considerations estimates and you know physical details such as data types and such and my my my main recommendation is spend a good deal of time on data modeling because as we said already changing it afterwards maybe when your application is working is scaling up it's starting to show its limitation and you have to be you have to maintain uptime and migrate to a different schema different data model that might be a taxing end of all so yeah oh okay so we reached the end of the most important part of this presentation the core of it let me stop one second and ask alex how is it going in the chat all good all good i hope there are no too many puzzled faces after this oh no no no it was a long ride but uh indeed it was it was a long ride but very important and it's mostly done and i can say what uh there is nearly zero drop rate so you did great it's good to see so much interest and uh yeah so let's let's finish this presentation with just a quick mention of other tools for your belt but let's not forget that what you just saw is the core so the main pillar you should base your data model on is already something that is already what you saw so far what i am about to mention and i will mention it briefly because we have not much time left and because it's secondary let me say it's just you know side things collateral things so first you might be a bit uh annoyed by when i say that inserts and updates are the same so there is no way to check if the if the row was already there or not i'm sorry you will be even more uh annoyed when you will learn what insert update and delete are basically the same right yeah because we didn't mention tombstone at all at all but okay anyway yes any any change will never go looking at what was before in the table that's point but i appreciate that there are special cases where you have to so i want to create a user in my user table but i don't want to overwrite a user that has been is being created at the same time with the same email because that then it's a mess or i want to update the status from in-store to shipped only once i want to update the quantity of an item only in a consistent way so there might be some small cases where i want to avoid concurrency and i want to be aware of what was in the table before the change yes so if i do that at application level that's bad because i might run into race conditions you can imagine two different apis simultaneously reading incrementing by one and writing and i might end up losing the count for example so what do you do now there is something called lightweight transaction so you can actually by adding this special if not exist statement to the insert you can condition the execution of the statement of this insert condition and it will be executed successfully only if the row was not there before so either fails if the row existed already or not in the same fashion you also can add if condition to an update so that the updates succeed only if for example rating was equal to 2 before doing that so i will get an outcome that is either yes i succeeded or no i couldn't because rating was five very good and nice so this is how you implement these special cases again the the price uh sorry updating your account in because you made a purchase creating a user role only if the email was not there or changing the password only if whatever yes so you can do that and those are called compare and set transactions or lightweight transactions lwt but there are a lot of there is a lot of attention here because um a very important thing is that you should not build your whole data model on top of this concept because it's heavier than the usual uh cassandra the usual way cast underworks and if you if you are mainly based on this mechanism then you are getting your that you're probably you have something wrong in your data model you are uh kind of penelope you're damaging your performance a lot because this is a mini transaction it requires nodes to communicate which is what cassandra goes to grant great lengths to avoid and do not be fooled by the word lightweight because yes it's lightweight in terms of it offers light guarantees but not performance is light okay so there is no global database lock it's not a transaction it's something a bit more localized and yeah so use it only really in sparingly so yeah that's it i will leave it at that because i want to quickly go through the rest another quick point is batches so you can uh there is a way to send a bunch of commands inserts updates and so on to cassandra at once and have cassandra execute them in bulk so to speak and it is an atomic kind of thing but it's not a transaction in the relational sense so there is first there is no rollback and then it's not isolated so rights are still executed one after the other and you might happen to read halfway through its execution and get past par partially updated results and partially not so this is very different okay so this is a good use case i want to execute i want to insert the same data on two rows on two tables that you remember that they just arranged the date the same data differently but the partitioning might be the same i just have different uh clustering it's very legal and fair to do a batch because it will go to a single node and it will be e light to lightweight to execute it's just a way to reduce network communication overhead in this case because i'm inserting basically the same row in two different forms it will hit one node and so on another case similar case is i want to insert different rows on the same partition in the same table so again i'm going to a single node so i might as well pack those inserts into a single batch and i send it super nice the problem starts when i want to use batches for different things so batches are not like bulk inserts i cannot just pack everything together and send it to cassandra who will then take care of it so this is absolutely anti-performance there are other limitations and in particular if you use batches for something that requires more than one partition to be involved then prepare for a perm performance degradation now sometimes you might want to do that but you should know very well what you're doing so again as for as for the lightweight transactions yes be aware that they are there they might be useful but uh use them with knowledge after careful checking and do not base your whole data model on it please okay so we have a few minutes left so i will just mention that this was also mentioned this morning by alex speaking about the problem of ever growing partitions a way to keep that into under control and maybe also achieve other goals is to cassandra offers the possibility of attaching a time to leave to data in particular to cells so you can do an insert or an update specifying the time to leave after which the data will just disappear but be careful because this is per cell so even if you insert a whole row with a time to leave and then maybe you update it and you update the time to leave just to a few columns then those columns will disappear the other will remain and you will you will you will end up having a basically a partial row which may be something you want but just know but actually only no time to leave is very useful to implement various mechanisms especially if you want your data to just disappear when it's no longer needed you can have cassandra deal with that i would uh sorry i would add one more point on that notice what using ttl uh for example for purposes of keeping disk space consumption on some reasonable level uh ttls do not lead to the immediate data deletion from disk uh so data will be hidden and you won't get that result in your select queries uh but data will be first the data will stay for some time on these can physically will be deleted uh with the next compaction which we didn't discuss today because it's more for developers and compaction some more for cassandra operations we have a special course on cassandra operations on the academy so if you are not so much of a developer but more of a devops or someone who maintains databases and let them fly then you may want to take well i believe you should take our cassandra operations course at the academy the datastax.com yeah that's a very good point and uh yeah so the point is that regardless we didn't speak about compaction the point is that uh time to live is uh obeyed by cassandra exactly when you query but when exactly these will be freed depends on internal asynchronous cleanup mechanisms in cassandra and you don't have visibility over that from a developer perspective so just keep that in mind nothing now well now with virtual tables you do have uh but yeah i know what you mean yeah exactly right so right cassandra four yeah yeah because we didn't mention that's incidentally after a few years of a very big effort in towards stability and the testing coverage a few months ago cassandra 4 came out and it's by far the most stable release ever very strong and stable and it offers a bunch of new features so it's it's never been a good as good as now a moment to try and start with cassandra by the way okay so something that i will just mention because we might consider it uh advanced or and or collateral topic so far we've been describing data modeling in the standard way but actually cassandra supports indices yes you can build an index on an existing table which will make it possible to query the table in new ways but there are some there is a lot of fine print there are some caveats and i suggest you to go and look at look it up carefully before starting using them because indices will have data distributed according to the original table in general and there are some limitations on what what are what fields are good candidates to build indices on and again in many cases you are better off by just designing another table and keeping it aligned in your application but know that indices are there and i think with that i can conclude um so closing words it's been uh i appreciate it's been a very dense two hours and you know what data modeling is very much more than two hours so there is a lot more especially you start learning how it works only after practice and luckily we have you covered because on this website that maybe alex might drop in the chat if you please yep i will you find very nice exercises which are uh again done interactively in the browser with the real cassandra installation running for you in the cloud there is some theory some explanations interest in intermixed with exercises that you will do in in these interactive scenarios and they will end up with you uh having learned some things and uh just as i mentioned these scenarios were devised by artem chibotko the very same researcher who basically formalized data modeling in cassette so i would say a word if you are going to take an exam and certainly to get the certificate for developer i do recommend to visit this link i sent in the chat okay datastax.com learn data modeling by example there will be questions on exam based on those examples yeah so be we'll be aware of that so every one of this scenario will end up teaching you something and at the end of the scenario you will see a nice congratulations screen saying oh yeah you made it you finished it and you know what if you're interested in getting a completion badge you finish any one of those scenarios you take a screenshot and you find that you you send that that to us you see here the are the way to contact us on linkedin the sdx dot io slash alex or stefano which is the two of us and you will be awarded a nice completion badge um which again is not the same as i can do the exam but still it's a nice start and this is how the congratulations screen looks like so yeah i think with that i can finish here it's been two long hours i'm sure for you and i hope the concepts were clear and yeah really this is just the beginning because yeah data model is a science and an art in itself and i strongly encourage you sorry to go to the academy and enroll in the developer certification course because that will teach you a lot and it's also fun and full of a very nice well done material and it will strengthen your skills in data modeling a lot so that being said it's what uh 15 29 for you in singapore so perfectly on time alex huh yeah that was amazing okay and very very useful so i hope you will be you have written a few new questions in the ask me anything because that's going to start i think in a couple of minutes give us time to collect our participants and we will be back here right yep so we will be back in a couple of minutes we've asked me and yep [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay hey hello everyone we are back we've asked me anything session as a part of a cassandra day singapore and today with me uh stefano lattini right from the data modeling session i bet you know him already uh jeremy and yoshi and i guess yoshi is a new face so could you please introduce yourself yeah i'm uh um [Music] yeah yeah okay so so far we have cassandra days in online mode but i hope then sooner sooner than later we will have them also on site like it was before that would be great okay uh gentlemen so we have 37 questions asked and we have not so much time and i suggest us to start uh getting like from the very top of the questions and as we have first question define it with six first question define it as a winner obviously with 16 likes like very much supported by fred hey fred in youtube chat you have links to contact me and stefano so please contact us to get your well deserved prize we have a great question with people ask us just all that time what is the difference between cassandra versus mongol uh that's one of the most popular questions i can admit on many other events i will start with the answer and then i hope team will support me first of all those are different databases with different approaches and many many many differences the discussion may take an hour or more easily and we have a lot of more questions so i will focus on two biggest differences between two of them cassandra follows strict schema schema and mongodb is so-called schema-less or better to say flexible schema schema is just exist it's just hidden under the it's just hidden from the developers so if you never know what kind of data you're going to store and throw within a collection mongodb as a document based database can be a good choice and then you understand what you are going to store cassandra can be a good choice big difference for me is scaling for writes because if scales very good for reads for read operation like select or like retrieving some information from the database then you speak about uh them writing data to the database cassandra beats quite a lot because cassandra skills for writes very well because of the decentralized model and in this case scales for rights much much much worse those are two main differences i would mention and maybe gentlemen want to add something well yes i'm sorry uh yeah mainly maybe the schema of the distinction the master architecture and all in all all in all i would say honestly cassandra has more potential to scale to very large numbers very large exercises that's that's more or less the main points maybe one more uh change maybe one more difference i would mention also has a traditional uh let's say master slave uh architecture and therefore it has single point of failure if the primary node is down in you cannot write to it anymore and cassius cassandra is decentralized you can write to any notes in the cluster yeah so yeah that's a good point because let's say let's say the master goes down then not always because then an intellectual process takes place in a little time a new master is dynamically selected but still there is this delay small interval when so there is a weak moment that being said as we like to say there is there is an application for every for everything so there are sure applications were excited for example you can imagine a very early application whose precise shape is not yet determined and as we just saw in the um if you want to be able to tweak your application along the way start up you're starting to define your your future project how to make it work is this is so much freedom so somebody said that the power of our programming language is the the more things that the programming language makes it impossible to do the more powerful the language and in a sense so having all the freedoms this is that um so it's very important to be honest and realize when it's time to switch to a more structured kind of database even even without taking scaling considerations that's i mean that's being fair to the various databases that are out there jeremy joshua would you add something you are muted i believe sorry i was trying to get the echo sort of um so i would just say that that i think um so there's operationally for a database and then there's from an application developer's perspective or interaction um the the choices that have been made from their perspective like we talked about earlier i think one other significant thing is that application um at all it serializes for you within the system it's just naturally distributed um i believe in an underground if you do want to do starting you you have to kind of explicitly define that and um so the other thing um i would say from an application developer perspective um me too it really may work to mention stargate which can help api yeah points um from that from a start gate or you can see a rest api or a graph api and it goes directly down to the database or you can see the document api and the document an api is um something that allows you to have a schema design you can persist uh json and it um um uh sorry it's uh i'm very sorry found out it was on my side it's fixed by now okay okay so so that that's another alternative is i think that we're through astra and then through stargate there's an open source project called stargate that can run on apache cassandra without any additional software or through kate sandra which is a kubernetes way of deploying cassandra along with different components such as stargate that allows you to to persist the data in a document form so from an application developer's perspective obviously through the discussions that stefano just had there are very specific ways to model your data and you can index your data or through stargate um you can use it as a schema-less document api so that's something that kind of brings those two worlds together a little bit more from an application developer standpoint right okay so i guess we answered this question in all the possible ways maybe even too detailed and i like this one this is kind of my favorite cassandra is using eventual consistency or strong consistency my very short answer exactly as i say during the first workshop cassandra is using configurable consistency and depending on your needs playing with consistency level you can reach different ways of a consistency from eventual to strong but my recommendation is to stick to immediate consistency uh gentlemen i'm done anyone wants to add something i think that's most of it uh that's most of it just yeah just let me observe that in the cup triangle it really doesn't make much sense to to to say goodbye to the p so that's the choices between ca and and that sort of cp and ap so yeah that's all there is to say yeah [Music] okay one down i love this one thank you for asking will there be cassandra day usa at this moment it's not scheduled uh currently we have upcoming cassandra day australia in new zealand and we are working to schedule cassandra day brazil but there is not yet cassandra the usa planet but that may be a mistake so we have to fix it and we will discuss it for sure so okay i have to add something here as well because that question was was also on discord and i answered exactly how you said so we are trying to cover the whole world in cassandra days because that's a project we we believe in a lot and our goal is to build local communities so obviously we give priority to places where the community has still to be somehow brought to the light so since in the u.s cassandra is already a strong presence so it will probably not be priorities um at least there are some other countries that we consider more prioritized to to you know help building a local cassandra community but again we will have a global tour of the world in 2022 so who are we to say we will not cover us as well so yeah yep okay uh so uh how cassandra distribute the workload equally across the notes i guess stefano let us give uh jeremy and yoshi to answer this one how cassandra distribute a workload equally across the nodes would you like to take this one yoshi or right either one no um i think i hope you can hear me yes yes all good well good yeah sure basically so uh when we talked about the architecture and how the partitions are distributed among the nodes that's basically the way that the workload workload will be distributed among the nodes as well so the thing is that you would think of well if it's not a hot partition like you're just bombarding one partition key otherwise you would expanding all those workloads to the nodes in the cluster um so i did talk about just mentioned about the partitions which is basically saying that i'm just going to talk with this partition key in that case you're going to bombard the the nodes that have the replica so in that case you wouldn't think of it as distributed in a way so that's some part that you might want to have in mind when thinking of workloads as well if that makes sense yes definitely i would uh oh sorry uh jeremy you wanted to head i think just from a load balancing perspective typically you don't put a load balancer in front of cassandra what you do is the driver if you're using cql the driver itself has awareness of where all the data is stored in the cluster and by default it will and you can specify different load balancing policies that will round robin among the replicas so if you're going to read from a particular set of data it will round robin among the replicas of that data so there's some intelligence built into the driver to make it so that it works well with um load balancing yeah so you you cover both the client side and internal within cassandra also work is pretty well spread yeah that was exactly uh the point i wanted to add and uh that's something lost the signal uh no no no we recovered already something happened with skype it somehow switched the connection on its own but okay we are good now yeah okay so this one is answer it uh boom uh that's our again question what people ask us on basically each and every cassandra event or conference when shall we use cassandra what is the minimum data volume for cassandra to be used first point i would like to mention alpha cassandra is indeed designed for uh to handle big data pressure uh sorry that's not always about exactly the data volume so you you have maybe not so high data volume but you have clients across the world and you require very fast response time perfect fit for cassandra or you do need like highest possible availability on the market you are not satisfied with 99.99999 you want to have something like 100 percent of time with cassandra properly done you can have it and to have it as a real disaster tolerance solution that's not going to be simple and cheap but it will work so it's not always exactly about the data volume uh the general idea thinking of the data volume like should i already consider cassandra or not for me is quite simple if you using a relational database already and you start to think of sharding then mostly probably you have to consider cassandra then your data doesn't fit single server you mostly probably have to consider cassandra notice i'm not saying you have to use because it's for you to decide in your situation but to consider that's for sure that would be my answer gentlemen yeah i agree completely especially in light of this stargate layer that we mentioned it's even somehow easier than it was but in than it used to be to use cassandra even if you're used to different kind of workloads like a document to be so you get the benefits of an underlying cassandra without having necessarily to rethink your data model if this is what you prefer to do so yeah i second completely yeah and i do think that there's the scalability factor that you could start small thinking of growing big bigger bigger business maybe start from starting from local and then grow your company into a global business then you're like covering all over the world and you have that kind of scalability but you could start small or you can use it for like development purposes very small um [Music] some ci cds type of things might happen as well um the scalability is there for you so um that's one thing you also have to want to have in mind as well yes uh oh sorry jeremy do you want to add something uh well just uh it's it's interesting you if you're looking for a use case i think that oftentimes you can pick something that has strong requirements for cassandra so like availability or having multi-data center support or things like that and then get familiar with it from an operational perspective and then that way you get comfortable and confident with it so that you can expand its use where it makes sense we i don't think any of us would like you to use cassandra where it would be a bad fit and so what if you can start with something that um is maybe like greenfield or provides value then um you can get familiar and confident with that yes and that's a very important point thank you jeremy for mentioning that because i completely forgot take a look there are no silver bullet in uh software architecture and databases if someone tells you what this database is the best just the best abstractly don't trust this person because he is mostly probably going to sell you something that is not one size fits all and you shouldn't blindly go and put cassandra on your production just because of great yes it is great but it doesn't matter what your use case fits cassandra and there are other great databases what can be in your particular scenario a better feed some developers sometimes like fashionistas they see what google uses microservices and they run and put microservices in place without real understanding if it will help them or create more troubles for them so don't blindly follow the fashion but really realize what you have and what you need that's a very important point and yeah in some cases astra may be a better choice if you want to stay in cassandra world but don't want to maintain it manually also can be a good idea so we have to move on uh okay yeah i have worked on earth relational database i guess like sql server oracle how big database like cassandra has benefits over sql server i guess the main point is what are the biggest benefits over relational databases so well sorry you want to take it oh i could start maybe um i i i was at a conference back in like 2011 or 2010 and um some somebody uh i had a cassandra t-shirt on and uh somebody talked to me and and said hey so you know about this or this or this and it turned out he worked for the apple gift card redemption team and they were looking at apple had a big contract with oracle back then and probably still do and they were redeeming gift cards after christmas and they they did a year-over-year uh forecast of how how bursty the traffic would be to redeem gift cards and they found that no matter how much they paid oracle in the next one or two years that system would just fall over it wouldn't be able to keep up and so in in that in that um scenario for the throughput of data for right throughput um they needed something else and so they chose cassandra for that and i believe they're still using it today you know 10 years later um to to do gift card redemption so i think that it can complement existing relational databa database systems um and so for so for example also like in banking systems or for telcos and other things like i remember in the u.s verizon for like iphone launches they migrated to cassandra for phone activations for instance um because uh the the relational database wasn't able to keep up and they would have slow downs on on those days somebody else have thoughts on that yeah that's more or less that's more or less uh the main point because there is i mean relational database is a far from being uh imperfect actually it's the most formally well formulated way of managing data the problem is that it has a some some constraints that makes it very difficult to scale at the absurd scale of data today so you have to somehow make compromises and yeah most of what we were discussing today is about the kind of compromises that cassandra chooses to do compared to relational databases to be able to scale so much so basically when you have a very high scale need you have to say goodbye to relational the comfort of relational world because some concepts are very well formulated but they just do not support scaling indefinitely high that's a bit of the bottom line yes okay so next one uh quite in yeah this is quite interesting one does a higher replication factor value impact performance from read write perspective okay the let's say it very much depends on your consistency level so for example uh doesn't really matter what's your replication factor i mean 3 5 40 not recommended but let's say let's imagine uh if you have a read with consistency level one for example or right it doesn't matter the fastest answer will count and therefore uh it will be fine but you see the point consistency level one is not widely used so because it can be potentially dangerous from consistency points of view much more often you use a consistency level quorum for example and with consistency level quorum you have to wait for the majority of the servers if you have consistency level three oh sorry consistency level core multiplication factor three you will wait for two answers for two fastest answers and there is a probability to run into slow response from two servers so as a result delay will present but it's not usually um an often use case so normally a p99 is a very very good p95 especially and when you have um consistency level quorum and god bless your application factor 40 that means what you will have to wait for 21 server response and the chance to run into the some delays from my point of view will be significantly higher um so our recommendation is to stick to normally replication factor free per data center in some cases you may want to have more and in some cases for analytical use cases then that's not a real data center what customers are working but and data center dedicated for ana another kind of olaf workloads with spark for example uh so that's isolation of the different workload types can isolate customers from a lab then in this case you may have even sometimes one if you can afford losing this data center for some time but that's not a general use case that's a specific use case yeah gentlemen so yeah if i may add in practice it will hardly be convenient to go higher than replication factor three which so there is a diminishing return kind of thing so if you usually you stick to three so that means that you usually have quorum is two and that's it um on the other hand yeah as alex said what happens synchronously it depends on on the consistency level so even if you have quorum so even if you have a high replication factor maybe many of the communication happens i think happen asynchronous asynchronously so it would have not terrible impact on on performance on io performance but a bit yes and that's the price to pay to have availability of data so resilience but yeah okay so i'm about to close this one if you don't mind okay looks like we are good uh good uh das cassandra has cloud only option available can i have cassandra set up in my company own data center not on public cloud so you have to distinct cassandra and astrodb cassandra is an apache open source project you can deploy everywhere you can deploy an arduino if you want it's not recommended for production workloads but it will work you can deploy on your own data center of course you can deploy on your laptop then you use astra manager cassandra as a service delivered by datastax you have to choose between one of three cloud vendors and that's a big difference astrodb is not exactly cassandra and cassandra is not exactly astrodb asterisk manager solution they give cassandra you define yourself where you want to install it and of course it's available for your own data center gentlemen i'm going to close this question because i believe i transferred this one and the same goes for the next question i think because short answer if i may just say so is cassandra is free because it's open source software you you can install it and do whatever you want with it according to the apache license yep yep and uh so for cassandra there is no pricing our phone and for cassandra is a service in the cloud so data stacks astrodb that's a different story and you better actually just check on the astra website but for educational purposes for low amount of requests it will be free yeah and if i may add a small point on on the astra offering it's serverless which means that in general compared to many other managed database solutions uh it's cheaper indeed because it doesn't you usually uh in the best in the basic case no dedicated servers are provisioned so the prices are it's very different from the typical 10 15 20 per month typical thing of any database offering in the cloud [Music] but this is something that yeah you should go to the website and check the pricing it's not specific to cassandra uh okay how we have uh answered many questions in the beginning amount was 37 now it's 35 looks like we managed to answer only two okay they keep coming good yeah that's great yeah nine rounds left how will cassandra handle inconsistencies in replicas in case replicas don't come back and timeout happens in hinted handoffs very good question so hinted handoffs is a kind of graceful period of time when database will recover with self-healing if node recovers within hinted kind of uh time it will be self-healed if a note don't come back within this period then it has to be fixed with repairs or maybe um i've also made a recommendation quite often but in some cases if a note was down for a day or two it's better to take it down completely decommission it from cluster and bring it bring it back as a new this way it may be like more reliable way to bring it back but maybe yoshi or jeremy will give you another recommendations yeah so um as alex said um so by default uh the hinted hand of time window is like three hours and but that's configurable but you want to you don't want to make it too much long because you're going to retain that the amount of data on the coordinator node so um usually you don't want to spend that so if it goes over that you would have to re-synchronize that upcoming node with the other nodes which is using a command called repair there are some auto automated ways of doing the repair itself it's a command line but there's some tools as well open source tools as well um called reaper and um [Music] but as i said if it's like quite a long time for example my machine has just got burned up and i need to provision another machine from somewhere and it's going to take a week to get back and nowadays i think it takes quite a long time to get the new machine so in that case it may be better to decommission it so that the data will be go to well if there's if well if it's off there then just remove that from the cluster and then add it back on and bootstrap it with the other the data that is remaining on the other nodes so um probably that's the better way i'd say right and just to add on to that really quick um i think to try to just um summarize i think um cassandra because it's a distributed system and because it was built with from the ground up to say we know we're going to have a lot of replication throughout the cluster and we're gonna do our best to keep that in sync despite any one of a number of circumstances there's multiple levels of of of defense against getting things out of sync so hinted hand-off is one of the first ways you have breed repair that happens in the background so if you read something at quorum and one of those replicas doesn't match in the background it'll fix that after this after that read so the next time it reads it the one that was out of sync will get resynced up and then like yoshi said there's repair in the background that you can have running continuously there's all sorts of ways that cassandra keeps things in sync and then as an application developer the thing that you protect yourself with is if the business rules require it develop your code to just have immediate consistency the way it's been described today but in the background the database is working all the time to keep data in sync yep okay it looks like we have answered with one and uh next one i will take very quickly to save us some time where can we find checklist or backpress best practices for client-side programming and cassandra administration so there are two answers first answer is of course always academy.datastax.com there are free courses for development and administration and second link i'm putting in the chat right now those are recommendations of our data architects and field teams on how do you handle your cassandra cluster and what are the recommended settings best practices and so on i'm going to close this one do you have to add anything well there will be a small presentation on how to write applications for cassandra after this ama and this is just scratching the surface but yeah uh on there is also documentation on the drivers which also guides you through the best practice and how to use the drivers which is a good first point to start from okay done does cassandra support dynamic columns where columns do not need to be defined beforehand and all rows need not have same columns cassandra percent no but the help of stargate mentioned it many times already stargate dot io then you can use document api to work it to use it as a as a document db if you have no need to take care of a schema can we take snapshot or backup of cassandra db that is a good one so point is you can so with cassandra reliability usually you don't need a real backup in case of emergency and some loss of data especially if you have multi dc deployments but still there are mistakes may happen and some developer can occasionally delete something and so things happen and backup is still required with cassandra it's very easy to organize thanks to as tables immutable files what you can just basically copy or make a link on that file if you uh well or you can put them to s3 object storage if you want yes so uh snapshotting or backuping cassandra is very easy because of the append only approach and because of as a stable of immutable as a stable files it's really easy gentlemen only one thing before doing backup don't forget to flash memory flash uh data from memory to disk and then files already yeah i think that's it the the point is immutable files make make it very easy to take snapshots and they are actually smooth i was just going to say also in the in the kate sandra so there's commercial tools that allow you to do this and then there's also so data sex enterprise has something that allows you to do that and then in the open source kate sandra has something and even outside of kubernetes um there's called something called medusa inside and outside of kubernetes that allows you to do regular snapshots as well into s3 or another s3 compatible data store right okay does cassandra support secure communication and data encryption in short of course yes that's an enterprise level solution which supports all kind of encryption and security you may expect from the database used by banks and financial institutions so i don't think they need any clarifications i would close with one yeah so there is support yeah how cassandra is different from our nosql databases like dynamodb or ryac speaking exactly of dynamic b dynamic db is aws database it's a proprietary database available for you only on aws cassandra is an open source project you can use basically everywhere on google cloud or on your own data center which you cannot reach with dynamodb in general there is a lot of common between them between so there are some principles in dynamic db and cassandra the what are very much the same basically partitioning for example uh but in general uh question how cassandra is different from other nosql databases guys for real there are hundreds of nosql databases and differences may be huge and very different from one to another so it's really hard to answer a question we have uh how much time do we have left zero zero okay yeah let's quickly run a couple of more questions yeah um so just we have a dedicated workshops uh about introduction to nosql databases where a bit of a taxonomy of non-sequel databases is also done along with hands-on practice so you might want to get to go in that direction reach us for more details if you want yes and we can discuss more questions in discord yeah so maybe you want to reach us in discord and we are there are there is alex there there here i am there and many other are there we can help you with more specific questions okay and maybe the last question i want to answer even though i understand cassandra is distributed for safety but isn't it an overhead to keep same data set in multiple nodes which takes more space in total my answer is very simple disk space is cheap reputation is priceless yeah if you lose data you have saved money for nothing yeah basically i mean notes fail that's a low of network you have to plan for to plan for failure that's the main point yep uh there this one is also great no sql database use cases are often coupled with nlp search engine requirements elastic search solar can cassandra act as nosql database and nlp search engine buff yes basically you uh can calculate with elasticsearch or solar or apache spark or other solutions and they perfectly work together so yes answers yes there are yeah there are even specific projects such as alessandra right that's aimed at making the integration very smooth yeah but still it's a matter of plugging this layer on top of cassandra which acts as a storage layer basically yeah okay and i'm afraid our time is over thank you many very very much for questions will the stream be available for replay after today yes always at this link just easily you go to this link and you will see the recording yes okay so i think we are done i'm very sorry it's hard to stop yeah yeah it's hard to stop but we have to we have a next uh workshop or next talk coming in but seriously please join us on discord so that is as we said at the beginning this morning there the discussion can continue so if you're curious we are very much happy and please let's meet on this court and we will answer all your all your questions okay so uh thank you so much at this moment we have like one minute break and we get back uh to you after this little pause and we will proceed to the last workshop of today application development with apache cassandra speaking of drivers and how do exactly you work with cassandra in the application yeah so thank you yoshi thank you jeremy and most of all thank you all our dear attendees it was a a great time together next time we will try to allocate more time to answer your questions but patients were great thank you so much thank you yoshin jeremy thank you everyone and see you in a second see you in a second [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thanks okay so let's see okay i'm live so hi everyone um alex yes i need my screen to be oh i'm not sharing sorry that's my fault i will sorry sorry guys we are almost there uh we just had to fix this little technical thing and there we go we should be seeing my screen in a second very good there we go okay so hi everyone um so this is now um this is the last talk of today i hope you can so okay i'm i'm sorry i will have to jump back and forth so please tell me if you're seeing me loud and clear if you if you're hear me and everything okay great so let me start uh application development with node so in particular with node actually this lesson so this workshop or better this presentation is about how you write how you use the driver for node.js to connect to cassandra and we will see a bit of basic operations with it uh luckily most of what you will see is um valid for the drivers for other languages too so these are actually more the best practice to to connect with cassandra and use it in writing your application okay so um let me let me jump to i have uh you will see a bit of the nuts and bolts of this presentation because i have to jump back and forth to drop a bit of links let me immediately give you a link to a repository this is the repository that comes with this presentation and it will contain code snippets and a few other instructions so as many of our readmes sorry for the mizuna beam effect most of what you will see is sorry here we go okay so this repository has a nice readme i will show it to you later so which makes it possible to be used as a self-service kind of exercise it will just be a bit of a snippets of code for easy illustration of the concepts and let's go back to the presentation okay so let's start from the start you you want to write an application we just saw in the data modeling how you plan for its backing database and all is right and nice and the engineers came up with a nice data model and you have the database here ready to be used and you have your application you need something between right you need a layer to communicate between the application and the database usually you need a driver [Music] so your api or your maybe your serverless functions whatever your architecture will communicate to the database using a driver nice and good and that's the standard answer as we happen to mention a few times today this is not the only choice because there is this layer called stargate that is an open source tool and it provides a data layer and multiple paradigm api that makes it possible to interface to your cassandra database with plain all the simple http requests and also offers as we mentioned a document api data api so you can graphql you can access your database in various ways and that makes for a say uh offers many options to come communicate and connect to your database but today we will see the traditional approach if you want the drivers one now drivers for accessing cassandra good news is there are cassandra drivers for most popular languages so c c sharp ruby node.js python java and they more or less offer the same set of advanced features so you can they have a synchronous api object mapper api they hold they they can maintain a reconnection retry policies health checks uh load balancing so they are a bit they are all pretty advanced and that being said today we concentrate on node.js that's just an example it's a very similar to the other drivers obviously with obvious differences and the feature the features are more or less the same now here is where you find the documentation and as i maybe okay here there is the link to today's examples now you this is not a hands-on practice because we have a limited time and there will be there would be no time to actually have to go all of us to to do the exercises so this is this will be left for you as an exercise if you want to get more in detail and by the way in the repository you'll find also the slides so you can go and look in and look at them at your own leisure oh i did something yes i clicked the link sorry okay so i don't know what happened let me go back to yeah presentation mode so maybe okay let's go like this maybe it's bad sorry yeah okay maybe i can do something better now so let me go this this this this and here we go okay so this is it very good okay sorry for okay so let me jump to the repository here and show you uh yeah so this is the repository that i just gave you the link to and it's pretty well documented so you can just follow along and later do the exercise by yourself obviously we do not assume you have installed cassandra you have your own installation of cassandra to do the exercise and by the way they differ in how they are installed so in this repository i will not assume anything and if you follow the instructions it there will be instructions to connect to any kind of cassandra database including astrodb now in particular for as3db uh this is what i'm going to live demo today so i will have my own astra db database as you saw this morning there is a one called not practice that i created already and you might want to follow the instruction to do the same when if you want to play with a strategy as an example and in the repository there are instructions to do the setup the setup uh okay since these uh these are just a bunch of snippets of code that exemplify various aspects and various ways to access the cassandra database there is some preparation needed namely you have to prepare a work workspace a key space sorry and you have to fill to create a table and populate data and set up a bit of things for connecting luckily for you this is already on my machine and so there is some setup connection to your database creating your astrodb or your local cassandra if you want you can you should create a database name and a key space name with a particular name just to make the examples work smoothly uh then you should check that you are able to connect that involves creating an authentication token and similar things it's all documented so i will not spend time on it now um then you should check that you can connect with astrid b and you can you should create a table and populate it so there is quite some preparation which would not fit in the time we have today and this is why i will i have done everything already just uh every step in in this repository is well explained and there is also some in inline help with animations that show you how to do everything so i will start the practice later from step four when everything is set up and ready to just run the code so back to back to us and back to the slides let's get to the point so uh let's speak about node.js first first remark is that the same drivers are good for connecting to any kind of cassandra in the white sense so not only open source apache cassandra but also data stacks enterprise which is the commercial version or astrodb as well indeed today i will exemplify a few commands with astrodb so how do you install it we are speaking npm we are speaking node.js so you just do an npm install which in dependencies translates to this snippet so nothing fancy here you just this is just how you add the dependency all nice so good and let's get to the first important parts how do you connect to your database from your application now you remember cassandra is a distributed database the nice thing is that the drivers are very smart so you can when you connect to the cassandra data center to the ring to the cluster you just give the drivers on your application side you just give the drivers the address of at least one contact point what is the contact point any node you give the ip address of one two maybe better three nodes just in case one is down and uh from these contact points the driver will ask them hey who are your peers and this contact point will answer with the whole cluster topology because you know within cassandra clusters nodes speak constantly to each other using something called the gossip protocol and they are always very much up to date with the status of the cluster so uh this is an operational remark but if you add a node to a cassandra cluster you don't have to change much in the configurations because basically the node will learn of its of this new node dynamically so this purple contact point will reply yes this is the whole cluster and the driver will then keep them into in mind for later communications with the with the database so that's cool and that's all automatically handled by the drivers okay so that being said how do you practically connect to a database well this is how you import in your node application this is how you import the package then what you do you instantiate a client object cassandra client object with giving it there's a properties various parameters configuration in particular these contact points addresses and from this point then you you specify a data center and the key space now these examples of today work on a key space that they call chemistry and they you will see them they contain basically the periodic table of elements in a cassandra table and other things that you will see okay so back to how you do it you create this instance of client and then you call connect you do your things and then you call shutdown that's it and that's how you connect to a general cassandra database now in the case of astra the situation is slightly different and the only difference is actually in the config part so astra is in the cloud so it's not much based on a list of ip addresses and but there is there is a file that you can download from the astra ui it's a zip file containing a bunch of certificates and ip addresses and similar configurations you just pass it to this client it will be able to process it and if you pass this connect bundle so it is so called this zip file containing certificates and stuff and also uh credentials that you went to the astra ui to create you're able to connect all the same and from this point on usage of this driver is very much identical so i say that because all examples in the repo are able to run in both cases and today my little practice will be done will be run on um with the astra case so let me let me go to let me go to the astra console here and first i will show you that i have this is something that i've set up already as it's described in the readme so i already have my database called node practice let me open it you see there is a radio key space called chemistry and since i cheated and i had this ready for you let me quickly go to the cql console just to show you uh what is in this key space so if i use chemistry which you remember means i just take the cql console and i tell it please let me work within the chemistry key space so are there tables already there i hope so there is a table called elements let's see how it is made selects platform elements let's say limit 10 oh nice this is a table with f with columns symbol atomic mass atomic number and name and as you see it is just chemical elements not much fantasy here so symbol is the partition key and also the primary key so you see carbon etc etc this is just a test table that is made to work with the examples by the way nothing or nothing fancy um okay so back to the slides um this is how you connect to astra and this is the first so i'm i have a lot of very small snippets of code that are made to run as a standalone uh scripts in the repository now uh to to better illustrate them in this presentation i will try to run them in a repo in an interactive node.js console just to keep the connection open for throughout the examples except for this one this will run as a standalone thing and this is a full-fledged small script that let's look at what it does it creates the client instantiating it to connect to a database you see client equal new client as we saw before and in the main function i connect and this is how i run my first query using the drivers you see i just take the same query i would run in the cql console as a string and i called client point execute then i do something with the result because client point client dot execute query is the argument will return a promise on which i can work reading the rows iterating over the rows and printing something so you see here i select symbol and name from the chemical elements table and for each one of the rows that are returned i print something so very simple and then at the end i will close the connection so let's see if i managed to run this example i should have a console here and let me make it a bit bigger maybe that may be too much but should be at least you should be able to see it node code 0 1 setup sorry node code02 connect connection astra let's see okay i think oh that's some ah sorry yes uh yes i forgot one very important thing um in connecting you see okay this is sorry yeah you see uh this is what you see on screen is the example to connect to a generic vanilla cassandra installation but actually i'm connecting to astra and if you look at the code here what it actually does is it reads environment variables for secrets as its standard practice and i just didn't source the file that contained these environment variables so yeah sorry for that so that is now that should not work it will oh look everything worked so that was what the code does it reads the table it gets a bunch of rows and looping over them it prints what you see so very simple example just to check that everything works so this is how your minimal example to connect to astra or to cassandra in general would work very good very nice now i think i can now that was something i run as a standalone code again all of the details how to run these things are in in the repository so now let me just open a repel node interactive console and instantiate my client for later usage don't worry i'm just repeating the connect part to keep the connection open easily okay so back to the slides this was just the first example how you run a generic query you take a string and you call client dot execute now before executing more queries let me get this out of the way uh actually when you pass the configuration to the client you can give more you can specify more stuff to how the client will communicate to the server you can set a specific load balancing policy as jeremy just mentioned in a q a question session you can specify parameters on how to reconnect in case connection is lost you can specify a retry policy when a statement would ever fail and so on okay so with that being said let's look closer at how queries are executed as we just saw um you have a string containing a sql statement and you just client.executed don't forget that this statement returns in general a promise so i'm here awaiting it just because i want to block until this finishes and then resume my execution and if you look at this statement for javascript is just a simple string but for sql this creates a table because i'm not happy with having just a table for chemical elements i want to create a special table for metals why not and it will have three columns that are kind name and density in particular i will have kind as partition key and kind name as a primary key so unique uniqueness don't mind much this kind it will be clear i hope later so let me just so i i want to create a table but for kicks and fun i want to create it within node why not so here it is so maybe i have to make this a bit just a bit smaller this is exactly the same creation command you saw in the slide let me just paste it here so this is a scheme operation it will take a couple of seconds more to execute because it's a huge thing as compared to just a very quick insertion and everything and apparently it worked how do i check if i created this table for real well i can go to my astra sql console and i can try you remember this command maybe describe tables let's see and sure enough i see my metals table so this is a simple execution of a statement that i sent to the database for execution to mysql through the node drivers so it seems to work back to the slides okay so in these drivers are generally based on asynchronous execution because there is a lot of to gain in this kind of i o bound statements in any programming language that supports them so this in javascript takes the shape of promise based execution or you will i will show you later callback based also but this is not so different in other languages so there are the equivalent asynchronous ways to use these statements okay so let's have a look at a few right statements because you might say okay if i write if i have to write data to a table i know how to do i take a string and i client dot executed yes so look at this one i'm inserting into the metals table a regular metal named copper of density actually this is very much wrong from copper copper is much heavier but let's not mine this okay so this is a very simple one line insertion and by now you know how it works so let me let me take this copper insertion and run it into my rebel it seems it has worked and i can select from metals there you go copper is there so i know that my node drivers are indeed working because i can see the results in in my sql console in astra and it wouldn't be different if i had a regular cassandra installation so that's all good and nice and back to the slides this is one of the many ways i can insert and i can write data to cassandra indeed it's not the best because you see it has various problems so this is a very much discouraged way of running insertions because i have to everything is just a big string so i have problems with serializing because this is a waste so this is a number and i'm using four bytes for it so this is a waste of bandwidth i have to escape say there is a a quote in a string i have to escape it by hand that's terrible and i am also prone to you know injections say this is an api behind a web application that's very much insecure because in general uh script key this might find a way to you know inject their own statements somehow so what i'm what is the best practice you separate the statement from the the values and look at what i'm doing here this is a very similar insertion i'm inserting the regular metal called palladium with that given density but look now client.execute has an argument which is a template for insertion with placeholders here insert into blah blah blah columns values are placeholders and the second argument is a matching array of values look they are a string a string and a number very good but then i need a third argument that contains type hints that's because uh earlier we saw that cassandra has very many fine data types so there it has floats integers doubles binary blobs a lot of data types and they do not match one-to-one with javascript types so we have to provide the driver knowledge of the type of the fields of the columns in the table so i have to say text text float matching this list and this way the query will work and let's see now let me so now i'm i'm running this query to insert palladium and you will see it worked now uh you will soon get tired for of uh having to check on astra but there you go let me go back to the statements and let's let me just show you what happens and i anticipate a serialization error if i just forget about the type hints oh oh there's an error and this error boils down to a serialization mismatch see it was expecting one thing and it was getting another thing that's because there is no way for the drivers to guess the proper data type here how do you make this easier to use there is a another best practice here that is using prepared statements that's very important because usually your application will use the same statement over and over the same insertion over and over let's say i have to insert a lot of metals what you do is you pass this third argument prepared through to all execution so you see now i'm inserting zinc no type hints anymore but just prepare true and later i'm inserting mercury another metal prepare true again what means preparing statement it means that between the driver and cassandra a communication happens and the the nodes on the cluster maintain memory of the of this template this blueprint for state insertion statements they know the typing there is no need for type hints anymore and as a bonus the statement is quick and ready to be reused so i save so the handshake needed to to get knowledge of the data types is done only the first time and then insertions are fast so statements wait there to be reused again and again on the client on the server let me show how it works this is so this is how you do you just pass prepared through so this is what i'm doing also here in the console i have a string that is my statement string and i do my first execute to insert zinc it worked no type hints note just preparing and i promise you that if you run this second insertion of mercury it will just work again and it will and the statement now has already been prepared and is there for me waiting for on on the server so i save a bit of milliseconds again okay so that's now the customary check on the table that's you see mercury and zinc are there all right so let me see okay so apparently i'm doing all insertions all right and that's not the end of it i just want to illustrate how you so so far so far i've been lazily awaiting all statements because that was not what i wanted to showcase but now let's go a bit more in detail with the promise asynchronous way of handling uh executions in these drivers so we say that execute in general in general returns a promise indeed i can change this execute method with a 10 and a catch as you can as you usually do in javascript so client execute some insertion then i print something and catch i print something like an error message so this is the standard way of handling uh promises uh just for you to know uh i'm trying to insert so somebody hijacked my my metal table and they want to insert a metal band so instead of inserting you know copper palladium platinum whatever they insert ac dc and the kind is not regular metal but it's banned okay that's just for fun but this is how you would work right so client execute then you had you get a promise and your chain with the standard way of handling promises so let me show you how this works i just paste the same snippet of code you saw in in the in the slide and maybe i'll still do yet another check on astra console and there you go with our new metal band so all nice and good and let me go further so um this is not the only way of handling a synchronicity in these drivers because there is a nice thing if you don't want to deal with promises but you like callbacks you just have to pass a fourth argument to the execute statement so the very same execute statement statement arguments so parameters and prepare the fourth argument can be a callback see if i pass a fourth argument which is a callback of to a function of two arguments this will be invoked when the insertion finishes and this execution will not return a promise anymore so a synchronicity is handled as a callback in the callback framework so you see in this case if there is no error i assume there is a result and otherwise there is an error so this is just all contained in the callback so now let me insert this uh metal band iron maiden let me go and get this callback code snippet which is just working as expected so the insertion succeeded and the code within the callback was run the successful branch and so i get my my insertion if you look at the code in the repository they are a bit slightly different than what you see in my notebook here because there are the connection is they are all standalone scripts so the connection is closed within the branch but that's the only difference so no no big deal okay so that was it for writing let's look at reading because what do you how do you get some results back from cassandra in your client application again the execute method is there to help um so again this is the typical way you would you would read data so client execute what again first argument is the template of a statement to execute where i have my placeholder second argument is the parameter so now i want to read all metals of where kind equal band which is a partition incidentally i prepare this statement why not and again execute as three arguments it will return a promise so in the then branch i will read so the then branch needs a function of result which is the the promised content i will read rows of result and i can iterate over these rows and for each one i will be able to access named fields named after the column so this is how i loop over the bands and i will print them after run the query after running the query against the cassandra nodes so i expect to be able to read ac dc and iron maiden let's check so this is the promise based reading and there you go so this is my result everything worked maybe i'll just skip the okay so callback is very similar again um let me skip this because we i want to get to the to the final part of this presentation but this is not different so i will i would uh sorry i would have a callback and i would so the same thing that we saw for reading apply here to this case so no big deal now there are various other ways to read results from cassandra because the client object that we instantiate also offers a native each row method that is there for me ready to use so not so different it has a slightly different syntax again statement parameters prepare and then it gets two different callbacks the first is executed at every row that comes back to me you see now i'm printing it just just it and the second is uh can be okay the second is both for errors and end of end of results so okay you will see the this fifth argument is a function of error but if error is null that means i just reached the end of the results otherwise there has been an actual error okay so this is now i'm reading the regular metals so i expect to be seeing copper zinc etc and i will print the density as usual just so this is the each row based way of running so each row reading let me run it again clean the screen a bit there you go indeed everything works so this is how you do the each row method so this will just get all rows and make them available one by one in a callback-based way okay now you saw batches already i will skip this demo for reasons of time if it's okay for you uh let me just say that there's no big difference you just prepare your statements more than one in a in an array and then you pass this array as first argument to something that is the client batch method which again will return a promise and so on and so on or a callback the usual the usual convention apply so this is this is it for batches okay so let me see you know that i have to have a look at the chat at the youtube stream now and then sorry okay so uh let me go to another topic which is maybe more important for serious applications because a real life applications might have different workloads so within a single application i might need some reading to be done at a different consistency level some reading to be done with a different timeout why not some others might have a different retry policy they might want to reach a separate data center and so on all of these can be done in a very clever way with a single client so usually what you do is you define execution profiles as you see here i'm defining several execution profiles which contains some subset of settings and they have a name and when you instantiate your client you pass them in an array and then if you want every time you run a single statement with client execute in the options you can you can pass execution profile this one actually execution profile this other one and those settings will be applied for that one query and this is how you achieve mixed workload kind of situations which comes very handy because you know real life applications might have different needs so let's say there are there is a table where i can tolerate missing a bit now and then and there is another table where i want to make sure the reading is consistent so i can have to change the consistency level between queries and that's how you get to it uh okay actually while we speak of queer options to the query again there is more to it because you might also want to just set consistency for example on the fly when you run this one query you can set timeout you can set policies and so on just live when you run a single query in particular look at this fetch size parameter because that's interesting i will show that a bit more later because you know so far we've been running queries that just go to a partition and get everything of that partition which is good usually but sometimes the partition is too big for that and it's better to you know get results a bit at the time to avoid you know having network packets that are too large and this is when paginations come in but so far we just say with this fetch size we just say this query will be treating results in blocks of two so i will just get two rows back in this case uh by the way the default is 5000 because we assume rows to be usually very small so 5 5 thousands is not that big remember they are supposed to come only from a single partition if i did my data model in the right way so that's not a problem with latencies right but okay so this is it now [Music] no demo is is good without a complete working example of a mini api this is what i always say and there is that is the reason why i have a mini api ready for you to show so let me show you this mini api what you see here is the whole code of a express based api that makes it possible in a rest inspired way to get the list of metals get the single metal and insert a new metal in the table and as you see there is nothing new here it's just a few pieces glued together so there is some back some infrastructure as express js requires me to do and then i just attach to various routes various operations so i have a shared client instance here and they do different kind of client execute uh returning the rows in the case of getting all metals uh preparing the specific query reading query parameters for the query to to cassandra if i want to get the scene if in the endpoint that gets the single metal and uh preparing some insertion uh in the right way if i want to run in indian points that makes it possible to insert a new metal so nothing particularly new just putting together stuff so i encourage you to have a look at the repository for the code but let me run it if i in very simple way node code 0 for api api js that should be it so the api is ready and as you see here the api can be uh so to test it it's so simple that i want to test it just with a couple of curl messages uh curler commands so here let me try the end point to get all metals back and there we go so i just you see curl look i lost port metal and this is why how what i get back so the reading is working let me get a single metal you see now the i'm querying the endpoint metal silver seems that i did something very stupid somewhere okay so that's funny sorry don't know why now i know why maybe not found i see maybe silver i didn't oh yes i know why that's sorry because i was afraid to go out of time so i think i didn't insert silver indeed so let's query for mercury right so do you like mercury let's see mercury yes and there you go so he this is how you get back your own metal and if you look i just create that execute with one of the parameters taken from the request parameters so i just take this silver from the request name i put it here and this is part of my client execute so this is how you just you know transport the name silver all the way to using the driver now we do something funnier and we insert a new metal called harmonium which i don't think exists so just for fun insert it through and this is something that i want to check here in the cql console and indeed harmony is inserted into the metals so everything seems to work very good very nice okay so this is my mini api now i want to spend a few words on pagination but i i notice it's a bit late on time so i will leave running this example as a homework for you to get acquainted with it the drivers just very simply uh i just i already mentioned that all the read queries we saw so far are made to run to return just the first page of results so fetch size defaults to 5000 whatever the value of fetch size this is the maximum number of rows that the query will return if i want to get more with a pagination mechanism between the driver and the server i can just use there are various ways one is using the asynchronous iterator so uh basically it is construct for a weight etc will make it possible to uh automatically handle pagination in the driver because the driver offers this a synchronous iterator that handles you know getting the next page that's one way sorry but i have to skip the live demo now another way is to pass auto page through to the each row method that's absolutely behind the scenes i don't even notice basically that pagination is in place it can just trust the driver to handle everything behind the scenes and that's also good and nice but you know there are cases where i have to handle pagination manually because i might have a web application with 10 results and then a button next so i have to let the user decide when i i want to go to the next page for example that's why uh that's why i so the driver also exposed explicitly and a string that is page state and i can just use the string coming from the previous call the previous batch of results i can pass it here to the next execute invocation and that will make the server return me the second block of results so i can go on and manually handle this page bookmark and consume the whole set of results please remember you you will be able to run these examples by yourself there are other ways so you can also use a method next page explicitly within uh the each row looping construct and this will also trigger execution trigger arrival of the next page and there are particular workloads where it's best to use this client stream method because this is uh really on demand so if you have a cpu or time intensive computations to do on items as they arrive and you want to avoid you know filling up your local buffer you should use stream that is uh yeah stream based so there is no it handles back pressure in a sense okay some something else that i want just to mention is that so far you have been seeing uh cql statements basically but that's not the end of the story because uh the node drivers as well as other drivers offer also an object mapper that makes it possible to treat basically an unmodel a model around the table which is automatically created so you can create look at this new element here i can create a an object with fields as in the column names of the table and then this mapper can insert get remove and so on so you can work with and by the way the mapping of data types and everything is handled behind the scenes for you so that's pretty good and that's not the best thing because in my opinion the best thing is that when you create the mapper here look at this first yellow part when you create the mapper you can give more than one table name to this model and according to the name of the columns in the various tables this one single insert statement might trigger multiple insertions on various tables exactly has the denormalization dictates so that's very friendly with the normalization data modeling way cassandra is based on so this might be very useful okay so far for for the driver features uh remember that these are also basically the same in the other languages so drivers share the same set of advanced features we've been showcasing in node now i'll come back very quickly to stargate we happened to mention it a few times already today because that's cool and this provides a good alternative to drivers because you might want to use a different paradigm to access your data other than sql why not so you might want to use a document-based less kind of thing you want to use graphql which is all the rage now and to do that you just you can just plug this stargate open source api data gateway on top of your cassandra and then all communications between your client or your api whatever and the database will be done by uh http requests actually there are also sdks to to make this easier but the concept is that you could also do that also with playing all the requests if you want yeah so as i say this target as is http request and it offers various interfaces for the same data basically so okay these are just example this is a small set of commands that you can run in in node so you see i can basically this is a document based api you can get documents sub documents uh variable schema schema ls whatever you want to call it you look look at this find syntax so it offers something very similar to we were mentioning a few times but all of these as you see here uh if you don't want to rely on sdk on a particular language you can also do plain old http request and they are the same uh that's not the end of it because as i mentioned you can also do graphql kind of queries as you see here this is a big string but it's actually a graphql kind of a mutation or maybe not this is a query sorry but that's the point and you can embed them in your in your code and stargate layer will be taking care of making it into uh so making it possible to interface your data from outside with variable kind of communication api specifications okay so this brings me to the conclusion i gave already the link to the repo please go there and if you are interested just have a look at the code snippets they should be able to run out of the box uh after setting up your database whether astra or cassandra no problem if you find problems just yeah reach me anyway for example on uh on discord and we will or if you're curious just yeah let's keep in contact uh yeah this is the link to astra if you want to have a quick database to experiment with and this is about stargate and speaking of stargate uh if you're interested in this other way to write to communicate to your database from your code i spent most of today speaking about drivers and when it comes to stargate you are invited to visit our workshops because we run many workshops several per week and those about writing applications are usually using stargate so there you find a lot of coverage over the various use cases graphql document api you name it and again there there are a lot of repositories which are again self-contained you can just go to the repositories explore them and running them locally or actually on git on git pod so nothing to install usually and you will learn a lot and you will see much more detail than what we saw today about about using stargate yeah with that these links i think you already saw so academy for learning and getting certifications um yeah um community if you have questions it's a bit of a stuck overflow about cassandra uh let's keep in contact again and in particular reach us on discord and i think that you can now start writing your wonderful cassandra applications great job thank you i thank you uh thank you and that's incredible job i'm very happy what uh you made it with us and that was incredible uh would you like to run their closing words or i will yeah yeah let me find them okay here it's really a few slides yeah not too much yeah so yeah so i think it's been a long day that's for sure all of you and maybe for us as well um yeah so we've been looking at a few so many of you probably started this morning without a very good idea what cassandra is because otherwise you wouldn't have attended now we consider ourselves successful today if some of you developed an interest and if we were able to give you some uh to to let's say to wake up your curiosity and to give you some starting points to to to begin your journey because yeah cassandra is a big thing and that's only the beginning i just hope that you've been having fun today and that we were able to give you as much information as was possible i am afraid what there may be some hats exploded during the workshops yeah okay it will take time to digest all of it but luckily everything is recorded you can watch and rewatch and rewatch you can reach us for questions you can look at the github repository the material and study and get prepared and get your certification and we are all happy because in a sense our mission here is to bring the power of apache cassandra to as many developers as possible and make them know this very powerful technology and maybe ensure you are using it the right way so to to make its power to use its power yeah i think um this is the wrong one sorry i forgot to change this and i apologize for that but the important thing is that we would really like to get some feedback on how the how this cassandra day was for you and because you know this is a series of events that started and it's growing and it will become better and better especially thanks to your feedback so this is why we ask you to uh give us some feedback and actually there is a link here maybe alex you can paste this in the chat there is a real dts xio cd singapore voucher and that's a feedback link that we use to collect a bit of suggestions for the next events because that's not the last cassandra day and probably it's not even the last question today singapore who knows and the important thing is that by filling out this form you will also be able to uh receive your free voucher which might be valid either for some credits some additional credits on astra besides the one that you will get monthly for free and in particular or in particular this will be a voucher valid to get to take the certification for apache cassandra certified either developer or administrator for free and this is something that would cost 100 and something dollars and this is sponsored by us again because it is in one in our interest as data stacks that as many people as many developers as possible are using cassandra in the right way so yeah because a lot of people misuse that but you are not like them you are much better yeah and there are one point voucher gives you two attempts so if you are successful with developer certification you can also pass administrator path and take administrator exams so you can get two certificates out of one voucher of overall value of almost three hundred dollars yeah and those certifications are really can change your career and in your life in the end that is quite cool yeah so the certification can give you a competitive edge for real in in the job market uh so yeah how to how to start with uh preparing for the certification yeah academy datastax.com is a very good starting point then there are the interactive scenarios we gave you the link already and if you want to if you want to see how the exam works in practice and with some sample questions we used to run a workshop about the certification exam with sample questions and discussions and if you watch there are some recorded workshops on that in our video section on youtube so if you look for the certifications there you will find examples and you will be able to run sample questions there for yourself so you can have an idea how the exam would look like you spent so many times with us and that's incredible now you maybe feel tired and that's well well deserved i guess it's yeah it was indeed uh very a lot but you know what it was uh not uh time it was invested time and these investments may grow into something great and beautiful in the end now we ask you go and build something great so first take some rest you deserve it but afterwards enjoy your weekend what's left of it yes but afterwards go and build something great build a better engineer out of yourself build a new great project or upgrade your existing one that also counts and we always happy to hear your feedback and success stories maybe sometimes not so success stories so we can help yeah both ways so success stories welcome and if you have trouble if you run into trouble on your curious just reach us and there is alex there is myself there are a lot of very very valid engineers and data architects ready to answer you and help you on the chat on academy as our own community on the on the discord channel and we are also happy we are always happy to help and you know what that's very important if you have some stories about your usage of date of of uh cassandra next time you might be the one speaking at the next cassandra days absolutely and we are always happy to collect stories of real stories in the field and maybe you find out some specific interesting advanced topic because you know you're studying and studying and we will be happy to hear that and for the benefit of the community that's exactly how the community is built so please reach us also and in particular if you will in the future have something very interesting to to tell the world about yes so i believe we are done yeah that should be it thank you for warm feedback enjoy your weekend and it was a pleasure to be here today and yeah see you a little bit of see you next time see you next week and a little bit of music in the end to realize you do deserve that and we do database music you mean right schemas yep sure oh very good very good thank you thank you liam thank you thank you narendra and uh thank you ricardo campo and all the others who stayed with us for such a long time for all the others who was not able to stay for such a long time it was incredible saturday enjoy your weekend thank you bye thank you [Music] on the same page [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] you",
