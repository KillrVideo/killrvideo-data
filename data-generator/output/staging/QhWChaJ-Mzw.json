    "text": "and welcome to another episode of the data stack c-sharp our getting started here just launched JetBrains writer somewhere on one of these screens aha and we're going to be getting back into the kasi schema migrator there we go well that's a bit it's a bit oddly oddly crazy let's see do that no let's do that here we go looking to make sure my table isn't gonna fall over on me here put it in the standing desk mode haven't done that for a while so kind of a new experience almost let's zoom in on this see where we are here as with good practice last time we left off I had just added some docker examples for some automation here just starting up docker with like docker run kasi and then Cassio docker stop exact docker etc that was just a little example and then we had got it into spinning up and spinning down for the test so there's a specific test that is left which is to start writing code around the actual migration of the data schema so let's do that let's run the test and get to started get to started what kind of word is that to started let's get started on the next step which our tests will show us as soon as we pull up unit tests scroll that up there's our last execution let's run all of those again that's the one that should come back as unfinished or throw an exception or whatever beautiful looks like code executions faster - I'm not sure what that is but this needs to be the test the migration against the database used to test to test the migration against the database alright so as with any of my streams that I'm involved in if you have any questions comments thoughts etc please do tell me I'm just gonna get into the code here and then we'll as always talk through the different bits all right here is execute up migration double click there it brings it right here here is the exception that I left in here the purposely thrown exception currently this is just the stuff around the code to start up the environment that needs to be there for this pertinent integration test so let's hear docker run kasi docker destroy kasi hmm so and this this docker helpers here is in not in the examples it is in the core Lib test here so here it is so it's in this file just for clarity we have our except you execute docker and then docker run kasi docker destroy kasi they're all static because it's just static helper functions or helper methods whatever you want to call it back in here let's get going alright so the question is with our first migration we need to write our first migration into the test data because actually let's let's run to right here in debug mode so we're gonna run these tests and this one is gonna run in debug mode or to stop right there were going to take a look at our migration path which is the executions that need to be executed to commit to a migration to get them migration done and we'll look at that and we'll see which file is gonna run first and that file I'm going to add an actual migration to so to have migration path here what is that oh that's yeah that comes back that's that's the directory that these files and stuff are written in so if we go here migrations to execute is what we need to actually work off of and it's ready and it has nine migrations in it now some of these are down and some of these are oops they're not all down some of them are up down down there's one up up up down so some are up some are down right and we just want the ones that are specifically up and we want to execute those so we want to say migrations to execute dot migrate is it migrate yeah migrate oops like that and then we'll do an assert that is true true no wait true right yep true and then we're gonna put this in here because it just returns true if the migration has been completed any other results we're gonna run right out to the table where we'll track the migrations but otherwise this right here itself needs to just confirm that it has executed successfully if true or not executed or failed somehow false okay and we'll log do everything else into a file because technically speaking at the time of execution they're laying appropriate is to say it's succeeded or failed that's all you want then if it failed you want to look back and determine what occurred if you succeeded you want to then do whatever your next step is so with this as is I can now run this and let's see what let's see what we actually get whoops I did not run the right thing let that finish so now go back into here I'm gonna run this unit test [Music] [Music] all right it failed as it should because this shouldn't return anything but failure right now we haven't implemented it so let's go to the declaration just bring us over there and there of course I've just got it stubbed out with it returning the false statement so the question really is then at migrate what do we want to do we want to just make this call out to something that's gonna migrate the code or what that is the question so really what else we need to add here we need to add so migrates gonna execute it the path will just give us the path but we want to state and migrate what path we want we want to up or down path right so let's put migration in here we'll change the signature migration up down and then here we're gonna actually get path okay so here we're gonna say migration path no ifs what did I do oh there we go path equals and we're gonna say we're gonna write this dot path and then here we're gonna pass our up/down that'll give us the result here locally in the actual method okay whereas in the test that one's derived independently of this one okay but we're all ready to work now so here we want to initiate connection oops connection too actually let's see we got this brings up some questions so we have file selection which is the process of going through the files selecting the files etc etc etc but then the migration path is specifically responsible for putting together the actual migration path okay and put putting the contents together for the migration path right so it gets together collects and then provides the things to execute but it shouldn't be particularly the thing that will execute the actual code against the database there should be a another class that's responsible for taking the set of commands and executing them right so let's actually look at our test and it's your dick doctor hookers kasi core does it about core Lib tests alright let's let's create another test file and this is gonna be let's do up migration up so that fixes at least the test it's still gonna fail and we need this to continue to fail because that one's not implemented so this this looks good uh-huh so we can get to that but then let's go back in over here actually let's change the theme to this this is a little the blue is a little funky on the eyes it's good a material theme it's good of this one what do we get any better yeah okay so it's just a little offset in color even though that's that offsets not so great either let's go with Dracula theme how's that look there we go that makes it stand out a little bit more okay that'll work for us so I'm going to go into tests create a new well I guess I'm creating a new class test summers Cassie Core lab tests and then let's do this one as Cassie schema no gasps Cassie poor Lib dot file selection migration pass what what should we call it did database maybe well it's schema for database database for schema schema for schema database remote path origin yeah come on what the hell should I call it database a database destination destination database that's what I'm gonna call a destination database we'll add that like that [Music] actually let's do this I've just I'm just putting all of them in that files what I've been doing so far I should break that out to individual things so this should be I don't like that at all damn it let's do edit rename I do that so in here let's get rid of that part database tests how did I actually you know what just freakin a dad delete delete okay we're gonna go in here and start here even though don't particularly want to but I'm gonna start here some fact public void verify execution database so this will verify that the doctor container is there et cetera I need to figure how to do this regardless whether this is a good test or not it's good integration test but we need to figure out how to make the connection and initiate from that point of view right now our database it's most likely not spooled up let's pull up a terminal terminal and we'll see what's out there I'm stalker PS what's active so that's out there running right now well because I ran that test half way then I stopped it is that what happened I think so so let's let's actually stop this one docker stop Cassie buh-buh-buh for testing and docker removed now I got a bunch of them out there so let's do this one move this one and then a docker remove this one alright so now we got nothing running stuff is in here okay so all those are in there and cool all right so then we can go in okay so I have it where it spins up that database Stan spins up that container database verify destination database all right so in here we'll write an unfortunately poorly designed test which would be what let's hear first we want to get get to class and we're gonna call it the VAR database let's call it destination EB equal new destination database like so and here we're gonna create the type now I don't want to do that just yet let's let's actually do this then we're gonna say destination DB dot what do we call it verify or no yeah very verify connection like that and then verify connection pause with me one second [Music] all right I'm back oh okay we got that so then this is gonna be a method and we'll just do a cert dot true and that'll need to be true okay that's that's gonna be our test its how clean and simple it's gonna be so let's get this built create this type is that gonna actually create the type yeah okay it did so then we're gonna take this though I'm going to put it way yonder over here in core Lib call this Ana destination database I had that and let's hear that it's the same yep okay so now with that there I can go back oh I should show you this other trick actually forget that I didn't I didn't put it there okay let's take that out edit delete delete go back in here to our test select that alt enter we're gonna create the type okay now it's over here it's in the test file okay but we don't want it in the test file we're testing it but it needs to be in the functional library so then in here that that is correct it's a class I want that so let's right click here refactor and do a move and we're going to move it to another type of namespace folder I think another file let's try that hmm so yes we'll put it in that file okay we're gonna okay so we got it in this file now but then let's see if we can refactor this we'll try to move to a folder I don't see how to I don't see how to put it in another project just yet add let's see if we can do it from here refactor move let's try another namespace No so I know there used to be away with resharper too target folder not on wanted in that folder I want it in ah here we go Cassie schema migrator oh no that's not my Cassie core live that's what I want right there so put classes in a separate file preserve hierarchy folder name don't want that I want the namespaces fixed allowing change internal visibility public when it is required I think that is what I want so then this yeah so that that should be it let's see it do it I'm going to add that file so now we have this here in the core Lib namespace right and over here we should now appropriately have up here okay so it's shown here and we have Cassie Cortland pulled in which I believe was already done but now this is mapped appropriately to the actual constructor of the class or of the class that is over here so currently we just have the class designated because that was the refactoring I did now so here I want to click on new though and all enter and let's hear it says inspect those generate code let's do generate code and generate a constructor oh that's that's stupid why did it put it there that's not what I wanted let's try to get it to actually do it for the class refactor extract no that's not what I want okay well in here I can do this though so right-click on this say create method and that's going to create the method in here so do Bowl it's not implemented yes yet and we're gonna want a constructor they should actually let's see about that generate code refactor refactor write or no generate where is it there are generate code and let's do it in a constructor oh yeah I didn't didn't really do that much but yeah so anyway there's our constructor okay and we're gonna do an override constructor to public destination database and we'll take in a certain IP yes IP address and then let's do one that says public this nation database with a string address okay now basically this one these these top two here let me rearrange them these top two are gonna call this third one the third one's gonna have the bulk material in it but this one is going to have the get default slash configuration based I P and then the Skol the destination database and pass in that address which will be bar address equals we'll just give it one for right now well not to dot actually let's give it the actual database how do I not have the connection oh yeah cuz it's doing it off the queue it's creating it so what is that test help are doing test helpers docker helpers there we go it's a network default hmm so he said start so the first thing is we run it then we stop and remove it okay so I would not actually give it hmm how can we get the IP out of that hmm that is the inherent issue right now we need to get the IP dynamically so that we can actually connect to it so let's okay let's take a look at this one we'll take a look at actually let's man you manually create this thing that we were looking at it here so it's docker run docker run - - name will say kasi manual test network what is the network what did I call it Oh default we're putting it in the default Network default SD then Cassandra 3.11 for whoops for write 3 1 1 4 yes ok so if we do that mm-hmm doing something it's not letting me let's let's try that again there we go okay docker run named Cassie manual test and then Network default HD saundra 3.14 here we go okay that created it so now if I docker PS there's that one so let's let's go out to the terminal here docker yes here we go so docker inspect let's do that one it's currently this is the IP so the question is start talking man how do we retrieve just the IP oh I bet this is an easy hack let's let's take a look that's what I'd want right here I knew that would be readily available somewhere someone somebody had it wanted to do that before expect kasi manual test whoops hmm all right so we'll take that what happens if we do a little bit more and then we're elegant way instead of bash tricking oh yeah okay let's let's try this that looks even better honestly dude uh here we go does the autocomplete oh that's beautiful perfect so we want to do this it's your inspect that about it okay let's do public static Punk static I'm gonna do click static IP let's do I pee static address get docker address did this there we go okay so the command is that so let's call turn exec docker with first yeah let's do string command equals dollar signs this thing and then here we need to do single one of these and do a kasi name yes Cassie name alright so I look right that looks good let's do that command oh I don't need a return true or false so I want that to happen and then process start so see what is the result of the process start I'm going to when it returns a bowl process start dot - string is that oh goodness what the heck is going on here maybe there's a process that start my process has exited my process that refresh constant right line Oh weird okay so my process process that start this is what I want to do I want to do this actually let's do this using docker man like that I think I can do it air trap let's do this let's do a public static string IP with you add address or address something like that okay so then this will be the result I just fussing about now this is process to type bool thought that's what it just said it does yeah well whatever okay we're gonna take out this we're gonna take out this I'm just gonna have it right stuff okay and this is I don't need this then I saw the exact talker I do this do not need to do that void here this is boy too Oh oh shoot oh I should do a try yeahi there and then finally if all that's hunky-dory then we do this one and this here we'll go right here we get rid of that if and that's actually a little cleaner there I don't know why that's even there remove the parameter Oh [Music] destroy and there how does it determine what to destroy anyway well look back that that minute it seems like this should go into name sec docker my process yeah same kasi named Cassie name is this here oh yeah yeah yeah okay hmm [Music] so that that might not actually work we're gonna look back at that and I might need to turn this into instantiate a class so we get the name and only one name actually let's let's put a pause on this one I'm just ctrl alt / there we go and then let's look back at and this should still work as is so that gives us a refactor on how that runs but it shouldn't break anything and then if we look back in here we got that and I shouldn't do anything except verify connection which it will let's do return false till we actually make it do something here so these instantiations are are gonna be coming it out for just the moment [Music] then let's run the test one more time [Music] you you you I don't know what that was whatever it was though it was some epically thrashing code like to the nth degree I don't know check my CPUs OBS Ryder etc just went off the hook and I'm not entirely sure what exactly just happened there it was not it was not computer friendly that is for sure so let's let's get back in there we're gonna find out what in the world just went down with this thing so there is our start/stop bit I think for safety's sake maybe we come back out here to this simple a simple app see this one docker example docker examples I'm just gonna run it you know let's that looks like it worked let's see if we owe you a let's see if it's actually docker yes there's okay docker stop the kasi there the docker PS alright so that's all cleaned up let's instead of what we were doing so we want to stop want to run stop remove docker again if this works as it should so that's gonna run Cassie stop Cassie and Cassie is gonna get removed okay so we're doing static all over the place here let's actually do let's make this not static like this and then let's let's create a new object here we're gonna call ourselves docker wait Cassie right hmm I should call it docker for tests like that and then I'm gonna save our darker more tests Eagles new okay so then I'm gonna create a class here eternal class notes gonna make it a public class because I'm gonna move it in a minute it's good new project and let's call it class library yes and we're gonna call it docker for tests yeah that looks good so create that there's a class and let's call it da kurung yeah let's let's do that and then we're going to alt insert generate a constructor container well if nothing will create one otherwise with a public docking container name like so and then go back over to program here take that out of there actually I'm gonna take this and put this docker ring and and this probably knows yet reference docker for tests like this so docker examples is gonna use our docker for test class and then all of this stuff whoops let's do this years okay I can hear let's do this sync the name right type in doc oh not add a dictionary dah current rename file to type match type yes we want to do that and then this is going to be a string name okay and we're gonna put these down here and we're gonna have one with container name okay it's string network and we're going to do kasi version yeah okay so and I guess I guess we'll make this a thing your name to docker is that one no docker oh let's call it just happen come on oh there we go docker cruft there we go okay so then we're gonna have the exact docker him here we go so this one it's gonna be the main private thing for everything and then this one it's going to be public all right and then program here yes and then docker dot docker run kasi docker for test dot stop Cassie and docker for test her removed and that all should change to more appropriate names I realize that so let's get that done okay don't you have to do and this is gonna be kasi name then Network yes and then version and you didn't need to move down there network there we go okay so all those bits are in there what is this fuss about it's not match to brew local variables this name is docker for okay fix it then there we go alrighty so then in here we'll want to make this a what create field let's create a field and then just make it a string then private string Network private string kasi version are a darker crushed are Croft so this is gonna make kasi name this network this and then kasi version this okay so this should be Cassandra boom 3.11 for what's for right and that'll be default that'll be this yep network is default they want one for nope is this fussing about let's see here it's back nope Oh import let's let's do this to convert yeah - intro interpolations and go down here and then this will be Cassie name equals container name network network and then cap it's Cassie version equals Cassie version okay there we go and then it's private don't really to see it okay so this is gonna be let's refactor it to run docker Cassie I know yeah I'm gonna keep it at docker right Cassie I'm just gonna leave it but this one I want to change so factor [Music] aa-are are renamed to docker remove kasi there we go okay and then we'll switch to interpolations here will switch to interpolations here same and here we go okay so we're cleaned up we have it in a class so it can be called by other things then doesn't have to be just called by the examples it add functionality to it if we want to even for example so we've got docker run doctor stop talker remove so let's see those things work now so dr. example let's run it hmm so what happened here oh do we need hmm so I did it let's do that for each of these let's do console.writeline so we're gonna have our command and then here is screen command equals this bit they're okay and actually that's not thinking very smart here okay this I need to say console.writeline say docker space jaakor space a command like that here we go so then I don't have to put that in there I could just put in the single line here we go okay then I got logging and everything for that one too so we got run stop and remove so we got instantiate so let's do program now let's run it let's run it and see what is up here alright first line so then we go to the next line and where's a console okay so write bitter terminal docker yes we got two of them so one of them should go away momentarily though so let's go back to where it's a debug console let's go to the next thing boom so we stopped kasi so if we go back to the terminal docker PS okay so one of them has stopped the 9cc version so if we go to docker PS o we'll see that one there's nine CC right there okay exited 13 seconds ago so now if I go here and hit the next one this 9 CC should be gone so I'm gonna pull this all the way up so it's here yep 9 CC is gone okay so the delete is occurring but now if I take out the debug let that run then run it again I'll probably get a break let's see what happens yeah so it's it's happening too fast and it's not able to remove because the stop hasn't occurred or vice versa or whatever so what we need to do is put in some a little bit of little bit of sleepiness here so docker cruft go down here let's do one right here dot write line do dollar done executing and then I put in a sleep where's it thread dot sleep yeah and we'll put in 10 100 milliseconds so one second let's see if that works that looks like it worked so let's take a look here docker PS okay we got two so lets docker stop kasi 8dr remove kasi eight docker stop and docker remove kasi okay nothing's running and in the list here so let's get rid of docker remove kasi one something and docker removed kasi c and docker remove kasi manual test your yes and Cassie oops make it run up somebody saw that once real quick docker remove tender McCarthy yes whatever that one is no that was one of my variant attempts at the other stuff clear alright so nothing running nothing in the queue that's awesome alright so I'm gonna bring that back down let's just run this again and it should create it and then remove it okay so let's just for visibility do three hundred created oh I didn't stop it first let's do 500 I saw their still yeah yeah okay let's not do that here let's do that on stop Cassie let's do it right after that let's do ten ten why is it not stopping the container dammit all right you get the idea what I'm trying to do here which is not a simple thing to undertake so I guess let's try that mini let's see we get I want to get this to run at least one time and then we're going to call it a day you know Matt I merge these two episodes which is frustrating or this split episode from the crash tennis your response Damon stop before doing whatever air response so let's do that all right so let's look at these docker containers docker PS docker stop Cassie let's be okay so did it stop it and it deleted it yes no maybe it seems to have so that looks like about how long it takes so let's put this one up to 20 this one will leave at 500 now let's let's put it at yeah there there okay got done so let's run this again whoo okay so exact docker let's put in stopped container right and then here we're gonna put in just add in an item to the signature then removed container and this one is going to be running container finished statement finished state there we go okay let's run that there we go start running containers stop container remove container excellent okay so then it last a little bit here let's see if we could do this real quick public string get docker I whoops IP let's just call it I address go here and then it's gonna be oh this is this is the thing that's weird so we want to say using this this this command is gonna be inspect let's your get IP address from container yes it was this one and that needs to be let's do this a string command equals this let me clean it up just a little bit make it a little more well easier to read and this just needs to be name yeah at work so then here put in command as such process dot start and let's do this using yeah my new process process that start oh yeah okay so that's not how it needs to go it needs to go like let's just snag this this new process yeah okay so command would go into here a darker Oh No yes okay actually I could probably do this docker yes and this would be right you shall execute false file name hello world this needs to be docker then in that case and then this process dot dot command in the process whoo not all that stuff just put the commanded so passing the command so my process dot so we're here what is to do hello world true create new window our Minister is true these know I'm God that's the kind of Docs that just aren't really there father okay you shell execution may be fine command that's what I want to do but I want to get results from it that is the inherent freakin problem here get results of process start oh here we go and there we go okay it's a proc new process start info new process start info this is gonna be docker this is gonna be the command shell execute I don't think so enemy there so then start while proc standard up and in a stream string line read line its to console dot write line fine God seemed like a lot of work there as our Oh return turn I'm and we're gonna do void no we need to I need to return it darn it so let's just do this I don't need to do all that stuff so just do return let's return that whoops there we go okay so let's do bar line equals this then we're gonna do return line and it's stopped doing that line here we go and then this is gonna actually be declared here so straying line let's empty string there we go and then we're gonna do VAR string down empty what's it fussing about typed keywords sure okay [Music] so then get docker address should be able to be put into the center of started and then we'll do a console dot write line docker for tests whoops dot docker address oh let's see what happens here you know what just happen what hell okay yeah whatever okay I don't yeah I don't care oh that is that is not the command all right well this is gonna be one of those just we didn't quite wrap it up cleanly but you get where I'm going with that it's been a battle serious battle so with that I'm gonna say adios for now and we will come back to this in the near future I'm just gonna leave this like this kind of broken and I'm gonna leave the tests in their test State which is let's run this and see how many we have it fail so it's in a bit of buildable State and we're getting there but I need these tests to be I need the test to work
