    "text": "hello I'm Chris Bradford and here is a demo of data Stacks mission control I want to note that we are running one of the release candidates right now um and most of the functionality is here and present but uh just want to give you a highle walkthrough of what you can do here with mission control so first things first we're at the login screen in our web browser mission control is already installed um and we are running on top of a gke cluster in the US Central 1 region and I think we have either nine or 12 pieces of Hardware that we're going to be connecting to and talking with so the first things first we're going to um log in here um and after we've authenticated oh and everything asks us if we want to save uh where we going to go ahead and accept it's worth noting most installations you'll be authenticating with uh ldap or oidc um that username password is just as a like a a fall back should things go horribly arry and maybe your external authentication system isn't functioning uh so here at the home screen let's talk a little bit about what's present here you can see we have our our account information we can log out um additionally we have uh the project that we're connected to right now projects are analogous to kubernetes namespaces but ultimately they're just ways to group clusters together you could have a project that's production or you could have a project that's a specific line of business particular application team what have you um and you can create new projects here note that whatever your your name is um there will be some suffix added to it and that's just to make sure that a project name doesn't collide with any of the reserved um name spaces within the system um but ultimately we're going to use the demo project here and we can see I've already started to provision a cluster we're going to let that run while we walk through some of the other U pieces here we have a cluster view so if you have more than three clusters here uh you'll have a list and you can search for them further if we want to create a new cluster um we click create cluster in the top Corner give our cluster a name I'm a big fan of Fu choose the type of cluster we want to deploy so datax Enterprise or Apache Cassandra uh we support dsse 6.8 and Apache Cassandra 3.11 so once you choose your type and specify a version number you then describe your topology we're going to run a single DC here um um we're not going to enable any advanced workloads we can override specific configuration settings choose uh where we want this data center to be deployed if that's locally within our control plane or to a remote data plane uh and then finally describe our racks we're going to go with a single rack with one node we describe the number of CPU cores we want to have available so 1,000 Mill CPUs is one virtual CPU and that's fine for this demo and we'll run with uh uh 4 gigs of RAM we choose the type of storage we want and this is just the PD SSD inside of gcp and the amount of data we want to use this can be up to we can put a terabyte in here I'm just going to say 5 gigabytes because again this is just for illustrative purposes finally we indicate that we want to enable authentication on our cluster we can provide credentials here um the username is defaulted but we can provide a password if we don't provide a password one will be generated for us and then finally we have a button to enable internode encryption this automates the process of issuing certificates and all that if we were to be um connecting to an existing cluster that already exists we could put IP addresses for existing nodes here and we would discover those um so that's all let's go ahead and create this move my head out of the way there we go oh my data center size is invalid let's see see sure it's one node y looks good let's try that again there we go and that's going to go ahead and provision and we can note that that cluster that was already provisioning is now up we have these indicators of the amount of data that's available disk throughput that kind of thing so let's click in and look at what a functioning cluster looks like so this one is actually still bootstrapping you'll note that notes one and two are done the third note is coming out we have information about each of the data centers so if we were running with multiple data centers they would appear here we'll take a look at that here in a minute and for each individual node in the system we can go and um trigger actions on our nodes including restart upgrading SSS most no tool commands we can also trigger bulk actions across an entire data center or the entire cluster individual racks um and then that's the core of this page next up is observability so these are where all the metrics flow in you can set a frequency for how often you want these metrics to update as well as the time period that we want to query from in addition to metric we have centralized logs so here we can go to logs and look at the logs for a particular node if you want to search for a particular string that's available as well um and you can provide a time period for what you're looking for okay next is the backup and restore service um and while this cluster doesn't have backups enabled uh you can see that there's functionality to create backups schedule backups um as well as uh the repair interface for repairing individual tables and this is all automated nothing that you really need to if you want to trigger a repair you can do that or set up a schedule um but it's designed to be as TurnKey as possible we go back to this overview we can see that third note is up and ready now and we are in a good spot now it's worth noting that anything I can do in the UI here I can also do via an API and so over here I have um the the MMO file that actually describes that cluster definition that we were looking at just on the uh the other screen and so here I have um I'm saying I want to run dsse version 6. 8.38 these are my storage requirements options like the Heap the number CPU cores and memory available um next we describe our data center the number of nodes within that data center and any rack definitions here I'm pinning this logical rack named us Central 1A to nodes that are running in the US Central 1A region so every node and piece of physical Hardware has labels applied to it and so these can be key value pairs so here we have a label that's Rel related to the availability zone of the node um but we could also have ad hoc labels such as line a business or um environment account information what have you to pin specific workloads to particular pieces of Hardware I mentioned previously in the uh the introduction deck how Mission Control can handle scaling up and scaling down um let's say we wanted to change this cluster and add a another data center um we would simply add a new definition here we're calling it dc2 with the size of three we go over to our Command line and we say Cube Cube CTL apply are manifest and so that has actually been pushed out and here in a number of seconds we'll see the next data center uh appear here as well as any new nodes come online uh while that's running we can go back and note that the cluster we created via the UI is up and running and we can modify the shape of this cluster if we wanted to up cre this cluster to another version like say 6837 all we have to do is change that version number and the operators will go out and replace the nodes one at a time um bring them up to the newest version after all the nodes are up and running on the latest version we can then go and trigger an upgrade as a stable action again that happens in Rolling fashion uh next we want to take a look at the alert system so the interesting thing about alerts inside of Mission Control is uh they are defined using uh promql or the Prometheus query language which is um very expressive in nature here you can see our sample expression here um this field is uh has code completion enable so if you wanted to use functions that are present within Prometheus um as well as or in addition to looking for particular um metrics that are present in the system we have completion for metric so if I type in Apache we can see all of the metrics that have Apache in their name and the type of metric that it is so as you're building out your rules um it gives you support further you can describe the alert and um provide any context description what have you U but when it comes to receiving alerts we can route alerts to uh slack and uh email out of the gate we're looking to add additional um destination in the future but at its core once you provide a webook URL for slack we can configure recipients that could be uh individual it could be a particular slack Channel and we can even have policies that say Hey does this notification match a certain severity is it for a particular cluster or data center um and how often should it um be sent out so that is the core of Mission Control we should see yep this is the one where we're adding a new data center um it's starting to provision that right now and it's a couple of minutes per node it doesn't take too long um to to have those resources come online I did mention that projects have um some extra information after them if you're using the API and you can see that here in the name space where it has a suffix applied to it um if we wanted to create an additional cluster we would just create a new Yo file submit with Cube CTL one then interesting things about this is this also supports like gitops workflows so if I wanted to say prepare to scale up because we're going into a holiday season I could change the CMO file check it into a get repo and open up pull request have a number another member of my operations team approve that pull request and then have that merge DMO file pushed out to the cluster automatically I don't have the demo of that here but that's something that uh we'll be looking to provide here in the future so um with that said you can check out Mission Control today thank you bye for more information on data Stacks Mission Control just head on out to data.com product/ Mission contr Control there you can find all the information you need including downloads and documentation thank you and have a great day",
