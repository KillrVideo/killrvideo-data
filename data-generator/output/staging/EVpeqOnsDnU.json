[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so it looks like it's time to go right so we are starting good luck hey welcome everyone looks like we are all set and ready in life if you can see us if you can hear us please press the thumbs up on the YouTube chat so we will know we can start but on my side at least it looks all good what do you think yeah all right all right one thumbs up so let's roll everyone we have a lot of things to do today and we don't have time to wait for too long wait for girls who are late um welcome to where our very own data science developers summer series series of free workshops two hours each plus some homework is going quite a contribution from your side but if you do it you will be become a much better developer engineer maybe data architect or whatever your job in ID is understanding of no SQL databases and how do you work with them in the right way is extremely available um okay that shouldn't be the thing well on my side it looks good how about how about from here right is it me who's giving the echo or there is some echo in my audio I really have no idea uh okay I think I have an idea just a second I know know how to fix it perfectly no lesson oh how strong is that is it because I cannot find any echo on my side right now so I'm Alex and is echo my side that shouldn't be hi this is Rags is the echo on my side oh my God foreign okay um so guys I will ask you some questions uh while metal uh take care of the sound I think I know what to do if you give me a moment um [Music] and how about now it should be better one two three one two three now it should be good okay same unbelievable okay I will start with that a couple of questions and meanwhile I will take care of the um I will try to take care of a sound it all looks very good on my side so I don't expect anything but we can see okay so um while um yeah absolutely yeah so I I need to keep talking for about 20 minutes I'm just kidding uh anyway uh my name is raghavan srinivas I go by Rags because people for whatever um um you know whatever reason they have a tough time pronouncing my name so I just go by Rags Rags not to riches easiest way to remember me um my undergrad was in mechanical engineering and I like these workshops I honestly really really like this workshops because number one I learned something new even though I'm presenting uh and and I hope that's the experience with a lot of you as well because I know that many of you come back to the workshops and all that and I think you know there's a lot of interaction helping each other and so on uh and and one of the things I like most about these workshops is that you can see something move and as a mechanical engineer you know when it comes to software that's the closest you can see um I like to teach and communicate I teach undergrad and grad courses in the Boston area which is where I live um I also I'm a big big big fan of the inner loop uh um you know basically where you do this uh edit compile profile debug you know whatever cycle like uh 100 times during the day and then eventually when you're satisfied you push it to an outer loop right uh an outer loop is like more of the uh Jenkins CI CD uh you know more robust uh loop the inner loop is a little bit more informal but I think there are plenty of productivity games to be had especially in the Inner Loop uh with that said uh Alex how does it look with respect to Echo Alex back to you foreign buttons okay guys during the next step I don't want to block you okay thank you for reporting it I will see what I can do with it now it works all the fun of kind of dealing with the new laptop right yeah I just got my new equipment and it'll be hearing sorry okay so let's move on I will fix it at a moment No it should be single device so good we have top repository with all the workshop content we have report uh and that is IDE in the cloud you have three noses you have new nurses you have more homes and very many different devices do not help you set it up at all it will take for hours to stand alone we go with Depot it's just like uh vs code button browser and works like a charm so you don't have to install anything and we will go for absolutely is Cassandra in the cloud you will use it soon refresh yes after the Beats free uh has a very generously here even for some production reports um now if you do this job you will get your range and this page is uh basically to confirm your achievement but over that you can get a free voucher for certification okay guys I see I will see what I can do it really looks on my side I don't understand what's going on [Music] yeah should be good okay so few questions before we start please answer using plenty.com and here's the code you see on the screen and you can get a code using Community command so you will see the code and the link in the browser please answer using plenty right now it's not so important but at the end uh it will matter a lot uh because uh you can win a prize if you participate in our game so please answer using mandy.com and code on the screen okay a lot of people from India and some from United States rural Alabama that's nice too right okay I tried something maybe uh Echo will go maybe not tell me if it's got better okay can't you okay great okay so let's move on now we are moving quickly because uh you will need that for the upcoming quiz with the prices so what's your response with relational databases goes with what the hell and what about now something now what now about Echo oh this is with SQL databases right you know we are not talking about nosql yet so and that's the reason why we have the question and join yeah good uh what's your experience with no SQL databases oh it's better now that's good that's better now okay I think I know what was that a new laptop was a lot of pain sorry everyone but I hope now it is good it might be better to answer on mentee rather than on the chat um especially once we get to the uh the contest aspect of the presentation or Workshop good and uh final question what's your favorite programming language foreign guys good no one for typescript would you vote for Java ion okay so looks like python Java and JavaScript are linking here I see some JavaScript I guess it was JavaScript before uh okay so we are done with those questions please do not repaint him you will need many in the last part of the workshop to answer our questions and maybe we have some prizes but you know what please be very careful with that uh you have to follow you have to listen very well during the workshop and pay attention and mental code is right on the screen uh on top or I don't understand there is a upper part about on top of the screen and you can get it by typing exclamation mark minty uh in the YouTube chat so let's move on uh there are a few questions we are going to uh cover today Echo I believe is reset and uh story is simple I know simple Cassandra some very important fundamentals for distributed architecture and how exactly do you work with Cassandra uh first why no SQL before speaking to what is noticeable we have to say a word about the databases because database is still database or we better say database managements interface is the most important thing for us because this session is mostly for developers and usually developers don't work too much with the database management storage or execution layer because it's more on the operation side if we want to improve something format language transport everything about database interfaces so for most of the databases what I use it nowadays it will be mostly probably sick as SQL and most of you as I've seen before have experience with SQL very well it will help you a lot in today's Workshop um so there are some people saying like stop SQL drop SQL it's like no sequel is everything that is totally wrong two things its own goals and its own purposes and relational databases are great they're totally great as long as they fit into your case they're very well uh we have to understand though that there there are two different kind of cases uh on the line of different database groups I mean like we have hundreds of different database engines and each one and maybe good in some particular case what is the General Distribution of those databases some of them tend to be more transaction processing and some of them tend to be more analytical processing and that is a very common misconception what is what online transaction processing databases are usually customer facing databases they have to be ready to work with a lot of data answer within many seconds and that is very important a lot of data a lot of transactions extremely quickly so fast processing you as a customer do you really want to wait no as a customer you don't want to wait you are not happy if your application you are using so you will just switch to a competitor and uh there's a story online transaction processing is for customer facing it requires very unique answers uh and there is a second side of this line which is online analytical processing online analytical processing is different online processing is for understanding the income uh for some complex queries complex situations where you need to understand your behavior your customers behaviors better and you can wait but your queries are very often extremely Advanced uh what are the customers who made some who bought something last summer from Automotive section but didn't want anything last winter of uh some uh different story um there's queries may be extremely big and complex but usually you can wait on this Oil City to all up uh distribution of a database relational databases were in between they weren't really fast in comparison with databases indicated for fast performance but only on small data sets um and then there are they were able to execute some complex queries uh but then not so fast you can run a query of a 50 joints with different aggregations but you don't expect them to be quick right so we go for uh all up as slow but complexity but very fast but ready to sacrifice something for that so now why I'm talking about relational databases sir they eliminated the market like 99 versions of a databases for thousands of years we're all relational what happened then and why a world now works and photos more and more about no SQL databases story is the volume of data relational databases work very well as long as it fits in this single machine in the single server then you have multiple uh when you have more data you will need to go sharply sharding the Spain you better not repeat and um destroys all the relational experiences with rankings and so on uh new requirements has come of a volume velocity and variety first about the velocity beforehand if you are like me from 80s you're a member of a sound of a Modern Collection by USL robotics maybe according to a next calling to a internet service provider by phone and top speed top velocity was like 56 kilobytes usually lesser and you have to wait so by those times performance of your database wasn't really a big thing because everything was slow and you don't need a clean databases your bottleneck is your internet service provider right agency yeah it was such a Time now everything works faster and faster and my my mobile phone is like a super computer of those times like super top computer and now we want things faster now we have new requirements we have a velocity and the amount of a parallel usage as well what we had how many customers Facebook had and it starts uh I believe there were some hundreds and thousands of people now we speak about hundreds Mills billions and that is a very different step but also volume amount of digital data on the world that's interesting there are a special report uh ordered by CJ maybe you know Seagate company uh they ordered like a huge research but estimate account of Digital Data is around eight zettabytes now but by the time of France is going to be more of getting close to 200 zettabytes and zettabyte people it's a huge number so like it's really a lot of course most of these volume belongs to a kittens pictures and movies but still of course much more pressure now on a database and finally we're writing before we stored everything or as a file or as an SQL rule right basically two options file or SQL which stored in the file in the head but still that was pretty interesting thing so volume changer drastically the Lloyd's team changed it vastly all right now we need to store more kinds of data sometimes it's similar sometimes we don't know what we are going to store sometimes it's objects sometimes we care more about the relations than even relational database can give us but most of all for us on this slide relational databases have limited set of use cases and limited scalability form uh first name no sequel was born in a meet-up on June 11 2009 in San Francisco it's a well-known fact and this story it's changed a lot uh mostly because of that Giants or first times like Google like Facebook needed more and more and more distributed by Design because there is no single server in the world what can get close to what Facebook means or any big companies like Netflix or apple need you cannot have a server like that you have to distribute your workload over multiple servers but also now we don't agree to wait and we hate down times if you're if you're trying to use an application and in sound what you will do switch to a competitor right that means your data needs to be replicated also more faster distributed and higher availability that's their new sequel was born and we use it to think now if I ask you what is noticeable many of you will answer no signals that's because one of the most used most simple databases in the beginning was model if you are saying no sequence please stop it right now I like I'm very serious about that stop it right now um this is very serious no sequel can be documented databases like uh or some other dog disease but there are Ledger databases tabular databases and they have different interfaces in like a different approaches tabular databases requires Street schema and key Value Story will be very simple but very fast and the graph then cares about relation much more than relational database here about relation so our idea is very very very important here there is no logical you better think of that lack of different groups of different databases and then you get to a real power of nosql Cassandra is in top three list of nosql databases players in the world um Apple IBM Activision many hours basically if you takes uh firstly is the most of the companies will be using Cassandra because when you need a scale you have to scale your data across the world you need to have highest possible availability and you have a lot of data there is basically no other choice there are some options like proprietary databases like that for example but if you go with them you lock yourself in for a proprietary vendor and you cannot easily migrate to any in other place if you prefer to stay unlocked open source then Cassandra is really the only choice is that please uh they have dozens thousands of database servers running with Cassandra only and the most active Cassandra plaster handles 30 Millions operations per second and ultimate time is some within milliseconds singles for the seconds very often and that is a very important because you need fast a lot and everywhere you did that centers around the globe Apple usage is even bigger but Apple uh doesn't really open information about what's happened what are the main features of Cassandra were so big companies it's just for you to decentralize it database management system what are the primary features it's ready for data of any sites Apple handles petabytes and petabytes and petabytes with Cassandra and that's a lot actually in stream read write performance scalability availability stir automation because clusters can be perfect and you want cluster to take care of itself not hiring hundreds of operation jobs right geographical distribution and your customers are everywhere you are limited to a performance of your database and if you run it only on a on one data center in Europe when you're Australian customers are not going to be happy that's for sure well then it's platform agnostic and vendor independent very important thing is already questions data over multiple servers it means what each server is responsible for the range or data not for the wall pieces of data because we have to be ready for data of every size and data of a big size does not fit in this single server so we have to partition it read write performance everyone is single Cassandra server is very performant but cluster of multiple nodes uh extreme level of a performance they work together and each server is ready to handle each request there is no like a primary server forward server architecture like we used to use before it's so-called masterless architecture where every server is able to handle every request is its right or ringed and that is very important linear scalability some databases can scale but more servers you add than less and less boost to a performance you get and at some point you run in this situation when you add more servers but it doesn't really increase performance is not like that on the right side you see a great investigation done by Netflix Netflix to 300 servers and notice how nice these uh straight line is by adding more servers you are getting more and more that's right but there is no downgrade there's a totally straight line it's called a linear scalability no overhead on your nodes added it scales with your note and by the way do you see these a little star on scales with your needs it comes with a price you need to understand data modeling please on the second Workshop one week later and you don't want to miss it so book your time for the next link Workshop right now then highest availability that's very important feature yes you don't want to be downtime what Cassandra thinks how Cassandra handles right first your data is replicated it means what a very same record will be stored in multiple servers on multiple data centers if you have them of course there is no single point of favor because of a decentralized technology and Network Technology available data placement so your data a different replicas of your data will not be stored on the same server or on the same server Rack or on the same availability Zone if you are using availability zones on the cloud so and then very strong uh reconnection and refine mechanism on the client side as well so uh most of the Cassandra drivers for different languages programming languages will developed I'm proud to work with and uh there is a very strong retry and smart reconnection mechanism what we can connect me to the next node if this one is down automatically good self-healing and automation is a big thing with the cluster huge cluster of thousand servers can you imagine amount of the people taking care of his cluster if anything goes wrong obviously Cassandra designed it to be to have self-healing and automated recovery when it's possible in most of the cases Cassandra cluster recovers itself status itself as long as you have your servers running of course you still have to take care of the service if you're running Cassandra on your own uh we will take care of it geographical distribution I told you already it's trademarks of Cassandra is known to Data Center deployment for all companies it's extremely important to have data not only application servers but database servers also close to their clients preferably as close to the last mile as possible and that is very important and now imagine that if you are coming from relational world like most of you then like everyone thinks okay I will have one master Data Center and two four data centers no no every data center is an active data center so you can write to each one of them and then it will be replicated to others Cassandra is platform agnostic so you can run it everywhere uh it's open source application what you can run on premises and basically you can build a single cluster running on multiple different clouds and on premises at the same time and it will be a single cluster replicating your data this way you can afford losing a whole cloud provider and still being captain like all AWS is down but you are still running live that's pretty cool and finally a very important thing for me Cassandra does not belong to any of the commercial vendors it's not controlled by some Enterprises and Commercial companies it's controlled by Apache software foundation and a bunch of software Foundation I believe is one of the best and most known software foundations in the world working with open source and you absolutely know Apache software Foundation products already if you have heard of Maven hadud Zone keeper Kafka spark and many many hours of iron flow is getting very popular right now and many hours there are hundreds of projects software Foundation governance of course there is a lot of commercial companies behind Apple did a lot Instagram did some great contributions to Apache Cassandra data Stacks over time Netflix and there are many other key companies even Amazon actually but and still they don't own Cassandra Cassandra is an open source project truly and it will stay like that Cassandra is under independent okay uh so I uh we'll give the mic uh to rest arrest yeah good uh it's your turn now because we are going to do a first step uh We've um our practical part I was talking over time now your turn to push the buttons and I guess you will be sharing your screen yeah I already started it uh I don't know if you can see it give me a moment oh uh should I maybe say a word first about what Astra is uh maybe you should yeah yeah and now everyone I see a lot of questions in the chat I will answer them as soon as we complete um these practical parts so very soon so two words about us from Astra is a software as a service platform running on top of different Cloud providers it consists of astrology and Astro streaming I don't talk a lot about today it's out of scope is basically Cassandra is a service uh it's a totally great thing it has a huge free to use tier uh it's about thousands billions of millions of operations per month and you still stay on a free tier so very generous one and no operations it's taken care by us uh so we go to that one and uh refs I'm switching us to your screen yeah you are life okay great okay great so so when whenever whenever I'm working my workshops sorry no no I'm uh basically the instructions are very uh clear and all that I do is follow along um you know with the instructions so so the first thing you probably want to do if you don't know about the where the GitHub repository is is just put a um exclamation GitHub okay or bang GitHub or whatever uh on the chat and it'll give you the uh and I'm gonna do it for everybody here you know just do a bank GitHub okay and start with that link okay so that's the link I'm starting on uh right now uh basically it's github.com datastacks devs Workshop Cassandra fundamentals right and the first thing you're going to do is you're going to create an astrodb instance uh I think uh Alex already talked about this basically Astra is our database as a service where I don't need to worry about you know I don't need to worry about the operations on their day-to-day operation right um as a developer I just want you to be out there I just want to use it right I don't want to worry about you know how data is uh backed up restored uh how data is repaired if required all that how it's distributed nothing you know I don't really care but I just want to use it and that's really what astrodb is uh and that's what you're going to be using today okay so the first thing you're going to do is you're gonna push this button which is basically the create as to DB okay so when you create astrodb okay you're going to get get to I'm gonna push it anyway okay and you should be able to you know get to something like this where you can sign up using either your GitHub link or your Google link or you can use your email address or whatever okay since I've already done this right I'm not going to worry too much about this I'm just going to go right there right so I'm gonna go to this is what we what we call as Aster console right so we're going to get to the Aztec console so I'm going to sign in I'm going to put in my email password and I'm going to sign in okay I have signed in for just a free tier the free tier gives me 25 uh thousand per month um and and actually it's um did I say it right 2.5 k um so basically you can do some fairly significant um workloads you know just with that okay um so so all that I'm doing is like you know it talks about kind of no credit card required 40 million read write operations 80 gigabytes of storage um really sufficient to run small production workloads right um and if you want to put in your credit card uh then you can obviously get more uh and also you can pick um you know what cloud provider you want right now um you know Google is is the one that's uh readily available okay all right so for those of you gonna you know start who have never created a database uh before you're gonna press this create serverless database okay and basically what this requires you know is to create serverless database is you will require to provide a database name and a key space name okay so so all of that again you know is explicitly stated right so make sure you use the same names uh you can actually use other names as well if you want but it just complicates things a little bit you know just easier just to go with these names but if you really want you know if you really don't like it you can you can always change that okay um so putting those um I I've already done this and some some of you might have attended our previous workshops so if you have already attended our previous workshops all that you're gonna do is you know you probably already have created a database called workshops so you know I already have a database called workshops and a bunch of key spaces in there all that I'm going to do is I'm going to add the key space okay and even this instruction is is there okay so if you already have a database workshops simply add a key space called sensor data okay and I'm going to create the sensor data all right let's go in and create that okay so so I already have a um a database called workshops and and one of the questions that we frequently get is what the heck is key space a key Space is really a logical grouping of your you know of your table suitable or logical grouping of your data okay and we'll see that in just just a moment so it's really not a big deal okay um so once you do this your you know your database is temporarily going to go into maintenance mode don't worry about it but it'll come back to active the moment it's created right so so here's my um key space that got created sensor data okay uh and we'll we'll walk around that a little bit okay um so I uh what I would like to do at this point is even if your database is in pending set just put in a thumbs up in the chat so that we know that when you're not running into uh issues okay foreign you know the process has changed a little bit and you may have to um you know copy a token and all that but but you know let me know how many have started creating the database and then we can proceed from there again it will take a couple of minutes um all right we already have few thumbs up was I supposed to create tables as well uh Alex or uh as as it explained it's um on the as I explained it on this uh instruction [Music] I think we are good without creating tables I think we must be good uh yeah just creating new database or wake up an existing hibernate database if you're kind of uh uh out of sync with with the rest of the workshop uh you can always come back get started on this it doesn't take too long to catch up so and and you know God forbid you know you still are not able to catch up uh it's not a big deal again uh you can you can do it uh at your own pace because the instructions are pretty self-evident okay all right so Alex back to you with the presentation okay if any of you are having trouble uh creating um just let us know and we'll try to help you out okay right and and oh one thing I forgot to mention is the region uh which you probably already have done uh just select Google cloud and the area closes here okay yes uh every month uh voucher so you can go before not only gcp but in general I recommend in the beginning to stay safe seeing to them uh free tier and uh 25 so uh yes there is a way to get a security token it's via organization it's explained it now but you know what I want to be lost some time to this Echo issue so let's move on for the next slides I want to say on time and let me switch back to my screen [Music] boom uh good and let's put him back right perfect so we are done with lab one and we are moving to the next step next step is okay Cassandra is powerful Cassandra can do a lot of things with our database scanned but how exactly it works and uh yeah how exactly first let's take a look there are some very interesting internals you need to know uh before that I wanted to answer a couple of questions because I don't see them answer it in the YouTube chat let me get quickly to eat oh yeah okay good uh Marwan ABC asks does Cassandra use crdts for synchronize it out of sync replicas in the event of letter partition so there are multiple mechanisms of protection I first of all there are multiple mechanisms for recovering from the same monofino's didn't get an update um repair and read regular repair he's a fan of and so on and then for the second part um for in the case of a never partition plus mechanism protection in this case is consistency level I will explain soon so thank you for asking me good question does this does the crdtts is that the kubernetes um you know I don't know what to see or BTS clarifying but I think maybe it's a typo maybe it's a typo I think it's crd is maybe um you know which is really what kubernetes uses right but but let's not go there yeah you can explain it you know without that it is anyway so then prasenjit Kumar asks how much data can single node of Cassandra plaster can hold so I've seen uh installations with up to 50 team terabytes but that is generally very very very bad idea so usually we recommend to have up to two terabytes for a server if you want it to be really performant and we were currently on a big cloud project winch is going to provide more but Frankly Speaking I don't know a current status of it so usually we recommend to have around one to two terabytes so instead of instead of larger disks and few of them you would rather have smaller disks and more of them correct yes that is the story I asked a cloud database architect from Netflix I asked if you like how many Cassandra servers have running in production and he told me well I don't know the amount of servers change it because we have more flexible uh infrastructure uh to I mean like tomorrow we will release last episode of last series of the Game of Thrones and everyone will be watching it like everyone in the world but for very next day let's say everything is quiet people are visiting finally it's no one who's watching movies and they don't need so much servers to handle this big lot and if you have not huge servers in terabytes of data but smaller servers with let's say uh some half terabytes on them then you can bring users to the cluster or vice versa scale downward cluster removing servers from it much faster and that means what you save a lot of money keeping your infrastructure to a current demand and you don't overpay on your don't stuck in the situation and demand aside but you don't have enough servers more a higher data density more data per node then longer it takes for new node to start just because it has to get the partitions it's responsible for and it takes times more terabytes per note you have longer it takes so some companies prefer to have intentionally lesser data per node to stay flexible that depends on your strategy and one more how much time need well for one repair on that new data in one DC so uh first of all Cassandra has a Dimitri erosion asks Cassandra has very strong mechanism on writing the data and we try it in the titles so repairs especially big repairs is not so it's not what happens every hour right if your network works if your data uh uh if your data centers are operational there are multiple mechanisms as say before to protect data from this kind of a situation and a repair on a set of data in case of a big outage a matrix award of course but you don't have to worry about that because still there are so-called Quorum mechanisms so you will get your data repair does not mean downtime repair can take a while per day if you have a lot of data like Full Repair which is not so often be executed on the neural under normal circumstances but the story main story is what it's also important because customers will not see it good are there any more questions you want to answer okay I see is already here okay great and so one more question from Vijay kaushik I think is relevant how many tables how many tables can a key space hold uh do you want to take that uh Alex or uh really it's just a logical grouping right so how many tables in key space can hold I remember a number of 100 but I don't remember if it was a recommendation or uh if it was a recommendation or a hard limit oh yeah maximum recommended number of tables per key space is a few hundreds each table has an Associated memory data structure okay yeah yes Turkey right here answering questions okay so let's hope we have not so much then all servers are created equal what does that mean remember like how we use it to work with a databases leader server Master server server lights you use it to be known before uh follow our servers leader server is for rights and for read only what's the problem of this architecture okay what is the benefit of this architecture it's simple you have one master you write to the server and then it distributes data to all our servers and your simple complement that's why it happened to be the first one has some problems if you lost your master uh if you lost the leader server you cannot write to the system anymore and you will need to have some fallback schema and follower servers will have to elect a new leader server and then you will be able to write down queries only then and it takes time then in previous leader May recover from a situation when you have a new leader what has been re-elected and that's quite a nasty story and there are a lot of problems with that so what does that mean yeah yeah I think the golden rule in distributed systems is there shouldn't be a single point of failure right there is a single part of failure it's going to happen that's sooner or later you know no matter how much you protect it right it's just a question of time correct and legal follower foreign architecture harder to scale for rights with this case you can spawn as many followers servers as you want but you cannot simply go add a new leader server it will not work it's not possible and therefore you can't skill for read very well but you cannot scale so well for rights that's by the way not only about relational databases very same architecture happens to be often in all simple databases as well for example  scales good for reads great interest but when you need to handle more rights you are in much more troubles because of leader follower architecture and finally issue what heals up in working supplication developers from time to time application needs to know where to write if you have some bunch of servers application needs to know where to write because if you will try to write some insert or update to a follower server it will not happen folder servers are real Cassandra follows different architecture in spirit of verb masterless architecture they're each node the decentralized architecture plays as makes the same role or all of them are Masters or none of them are Masters or whatever you how do you prefer to look at this situation but the general idea is no single point of failure you can write to any of the nodes and data will be delivered uh it scales well for both rides and Rings If you need to handle more pressure you add more loads and they will join the cluster and they will serve your queries and you are good and application can contact any node so you don't have to think like which server I have to adapt this time it just doesn't really matter usually Cassandra drivers know which nodes to conduct but it's out of scope of a regular developer uh things to take care of second thing which brings a lot of power and a lot of problems data is repeated so what does that mean it means what at the very same piece of data or to just inserted information of one of your customers will restore it not on a single server but on the mutual servers is the file of a replication Factor replication factor means the number of elves used to store each partition I will explain partitions soon uh then you create a key space can you define keyspace name and you can find a replication strategy plus and you Define replication Factor per data center for example in this case I'm going to use Network topology strategy and I'm going to have replication Factor free for United States respond and for whatever reason replication Factor 5 4 Europe is true but a recommended replication factor is free for most of the cases I may have more data centers for example I have data center in Asia but I think for these data for this sensor data I am working with I just don't need to store in Asia then I don't Define replication for the data center in Asia and therefore these spaces are consumed and only two data centers handle these data regarding the replication strategy it's very simple to remember currently there are only two simple strategy and network topology strategy simple seven simple strategy is good for your laptop and bad for everything else and network topology is great injectors of a data placement away would replicas will replace it as far away from each hour as possible so for example if you use cloud they will replace it in a different in the same region but at the different availability zones so if one AC is down your date is still available in the hour agents or if you move if your own data center they do data to different servers so if you put data in there because if all free replica are on the same server rack and then power is down for This Server rack on all of your attackers are down and you cannot access data so Network reputable strategy is your best friend if you don't want to have down time it's smart and it puts data far away from each other to uh take care of the reliability so verification factor mean one means what every partition storage on a single node replication Factor 2 obviously means what every partition sort of loans and as remote guess replication Factor frames whatever partitions certain females you may have more but our recommendation most of the cases to see to free it's a better way and more reliable way in some cases you may have also have five but it's a rare story now finally a source of a lot of a confusion data is distributed we all come from relational database World a relational database world all the wall table is stored on a server like a leader server Imports in your server let's see and only if it was huge like really huge and single server cannot handle it anymore you will go with sharding and we will have multiple Master servers for this uh chart uh for this table and different parts of this table will be on a different uh servers and you run in a huge huge huge levels starting with relational databases is not native and it is extremely painful oh some flashbacks like yeah uh you don't want to have shouting on your data but still Cassandra his big day to read Cassandra is ready to handle data of each side how does that work the story is what is the partition right away from the beginning for example here on the right side we have these sensors by Network and the table we will explain in more details uh later and uh data will be spread it over multiple servers so it's still the same thing but different parts of this table will be stored on a different servers with some applications of course now we see uh what this has a partition key and primary key in this case partition key is what matters for us because particularly defines partitioning yes quite I'm quite confused today right so with a partition key we see what the different sensors have different networks and we see here for example sensors so1 and soo2 above belong to the same network that means what we will be stored together because they belong to a single partition and each server responsible for a range of partitions it's not one partition per server it's multiple partition per server so data is organized as distributed payments it set a lot of power in these and also some limitations coming because of that how it hurts then you create the table we will work a lot of this answer the interplay um if you're familiar with SQL this statement should look very familiar to you free table key space table then some value type then but I also sorry code Type column type and finally primary key in relational databases we use sequential ideas uh it doesn't work like that in distribution databases I will explain soon and then we have to define a partition it's defined by partition key I want all my sensors to be grouped by Network as table name States and then a sensor is a clustering column I will explain soon that's what brings me to this situation as I Define it uh Network to be my partition key my sensors will be grouped by Network how it works very interesting mechanism of partitioning in Cassandra I need to distribute data evenly over multiple servers if we cannot distribute it evenly if like our server will be responsible for a biggest part of your data and all the other will be responsible for the small part of your data what happens then we run into troubles because one server will overloaded hours will be idling and we will be no good answer for a customer waiting of course so that's how it works then you designate a network as a partition key in this case forest forest CC Road on the time you write an income value of these uh colon or columns because you can have multiple columns are as a part of a compound partitioning then a partitioner of Cassandra it uses more more free caching out I like the name like Oliver sounds like cat is working inside Cassandra uh these cats hashing algorithm a real partition value of that like for example forest in an integer Forest becomes 59 C becomes twelve Road becomes 45. uh don't get me wrong usually numbers are much bigger than just simplification for our tutorial today but usually numbers are significantly and now that's the trick instead of the partition key value we got token and each of the Cassandra node in a data center is responsible for the range of tokens it's called a token range basically so if we imagine what result of normal free hashing algorithm is always from 1 to 100 then e that means what if we have a data center of four nodes uh first one of them will handle of the tokens ranges from 1 to 25 second 26 to 50 51 to 75 and so on and then you could guess what uh Forest equals 59 as a token goes to each node right to a third node it will be stored by a third node and C token 12 will be handled by first node and finally 45 robot will be handed by second note and fourth server stays without any data but well there is a very small table right only six rows we are ahead of him why partitioning that's important to understand working with Cassandra you don't love partitioning and I promise you will hang out delivery depths like totally fainted partitioning blank's problem when you distribute data over multiple servers it brings a lot of problems there will be no joins there will be a lot of issues there like if search queries here guys that's not going to be easy but if you want to handle petabytes of data and still get your answer within some single digit milliseconds you need partitioning and there is no other answer to this problem basically there's no opportunity for uh for you to have your data dispatch weekly for customer facing as Cassandra's customer facing reduce oil tipping uh instead of speaking data into chunks and spreading them over multiple servers there is just no other option so now we think we are getting frustrating take a look each server is responsible for a token range each row with a partition key token from 1 to 25 will go to the first node then 26 to 50 to a second node and so on and we have four node in a data center now imagine we have a lot of pressure we have a lot of customers using our application uh so we have to do that and we have what scaling be easily we just launch and there is a great question by Maroon at the sea again man thank you for your questions or uh lady sorry I don't cannot judge by the name um that second good great question in a row I will answer that second in the second later sorry housekeeping works I launch a new server uh Rangers Android and tell to it hey where is your plaster who join it and uh Cassandra a new note 5's Master hello everyone I am new here what's going on like what's my work to do and then cluster calculates beforehand we had this token range from 1 to 100 spread it over four servers now we have five yay much better and that means what each server as a result the token ranges will be recalculated and each server is responsible for Less uh or less token range and there are four for lesser amount of partitions and you see what happened now first server is responsible not 1 to 25 but only one defending and for each server we have less partitions to handle and all the partitions 81 to 100 will move to the fifth server so each server will handle lesser amount of operations and they are much more performant and now imagine our Black Friday is over all the goods we were selling are both out and people now are counting their money in disappointed oh my God I wasted so much money this sale I'm not going to buy anything next month you know how it goes right then what do we want to do we don't want to burn our money on infrastructure on service when no one will use and we have to go for scaling in and we are removing amount of servers vice versa moreover we are going to go from five to three servers and we go to Blaster and say like okay cluster we are not going to have a lot of pressure next weeks so please take down two notes and two notes will be taken down and shut down and uh total ranges recalculation as we see each node will be responsible for bigger token ranges and therefore for better amount of partition 133 34 to 66 100 oh my god there are lightning strikes right here I hope we won't get out age if you lost me it means what my IC or whatever was eaten by lightning but okay I'm still with you I'm sorry so we just went from four node Center to five nodes and went to three and that's the magic there is no down time all scaling appellation separations alive all this time data center is serving uh operations serving requests from customers and doing it very very quickly and you don't do work you just tell that is new server for this design and now okay I want to take down those two guys and Cassandra Blaster does that you don't do anything I'm a very lazy if I can dodge any drop I will go to his job you know my manager is looking the stream so I better not say things like that uh but that's exactly the situation so before that I promise you to answer a question number one ABC asked like uh how does that different to shopping so shelving and partitioning are two different approaches to handle the same problem uh they both are developers to handle the situation when you have too much data what doesn't in the single server differently uh what is charting you have small table on a server this you have more and more clients this table grows grows grows grows grows and you are like okay I my server can't handle it anymore I will go for what vertical scaling vertical scaling clients you buy a bigger server and you migrate today usually without him and you take down the preview server and your new server serves further then again this table grows grows grows grows and your V server cannot handle it anymore and you do what you go buy a bigger even bigger server migrate your data and downtime discard preview server and that situation may repeat a couple of more times in the end we find out what there is no server in the world what can what can I handle such pressure too much right operations and relational databases are great but not so performant as some low relational databases and then you are like okay there's no server what can handle such example that means what I have split with stable in the parts in the charts in the charts and distributed over multiple uh servers and there comes a problem charging means what you have to manually designate which parts of the data will be served by each node if you are going to scale with sharding you are going to uh manually um and migration will be the downtime and it doesn't work like a charm and uh quite opposite partitioning is a native mechanism which starts to use the mutual data from the very beginning and you don't go with vertical scaling you go with horizontal skiing you need to handle more data at one more server you need to handle even more add one more server as a result it's getting significantly cheaper on a big volumes because super servers are extremely expensive um so with commodity the servers like Cassandra prefers to work that is a way better thing okay so no downtime all scaling operations are live and I hope I answer a question what is the difference between partitioning and sharp and in a professional life of each of you or most of you I hope because you are the best people you come here to learn and people who learn are the best they usually get the better roles better worse more and more responsibility more money and that means well at some point working for relational database you may hit in the situation okay now we need sharding and there is a trick if you need charging with your relational database then mostly probably you better consider migration to no relational database like Cassandra let's move on so bringing that together you can discuss it partitioning Massacre certification now we are bringing the things together this replication Factor one each server will be responsible for each part of the overall token range if overall token range is from 1 to 100 then therefore each of four servers will be responsible for a quarter 125 26 to 50 and so on but we bring replication to it even if we add replication Factor it has what each server will be responsible for two token ranges and server one responsible 1 to 25 26 to 15 second server responsible 26 to 50 51 to 75 so basically thank you taking responsibility for its neighbors too and you can tell me like wow about that means what each server will have to handle more partitions and as a result the time of this space consumed will be significantly bigger and I will answer come on people mask space is cheap but what is priceless your reputation is priceless replication means High availability if you cannot afford downtime if you read the business matters to you you need to have replication on core endings or another form so partitioning and replication with replication Factor free when we are going to write some data for example we are creating two new sensors for the forest Network and these uh insert because the right data is insert like in SQL gets to a server Beach first This Server it's in this case um server number two let's say so this one is first this one is second so server number two gets these data and first thing it does it makes this conversion from a partition key value to a token and we see what token is 59. now we see what means a second node is not responsible for a token range of 59 but every Cassandra node is very smart so Cassandra node knows which or which servers which nodes are responsible for this token and these server will immediately dispatch this update to a broker servers and servers responsible for a partition um is usually called replica servers notice what for different queries different service will be replaced because of a different partition very for different open range different token different token range boom difference server so those three will be token will be in responsible for the token range of a partition number 59 and this update will be deliberate so that's how data is spread but even better than this I told you what these second server second note notes nodes which servers are replica servers for this partition it's called token aware mechanism but for this sorry actually even drivers in Cassandra are talking aware so usually a situation like these will never happen because your driver Java driver python driver JavaScript driver knows those servers are responsible for this token so firstly this query would arrive to This Server or this server or this server but in this case let's say we use it to retry mechanism which got key to a wrong server but again it's not a big deal because each server in the cluster is able to handle its request if it's a replica it will get your data if it's on the replica it will distribute your query to a proper reference so it's not a automated like this database makes my life easier and I like it so each Cassandra node and even each Cassandra driver knows data allocation in the driver it's called a tokenovator so your application can conduct literally any server of a cluster and still get the answer or update information if you are writing something laughing data is globally distributed we discussed it already geographical distribution running multiple data centers in multiple regions works like a charm totally great and also you can run different centers on top of the different Cloud providers it's quite advanced placement so usually we don't recommend that I mean like in such easier to set it up with a single cloud provider but if you want to have 100 percent of time then you cannot move your single cloud provider if you want to have 100 percent of time you have to move with multiple power providers um now uh what is the biggest problem of replication I believe some of you understand already my thing actually I want you to answer I am speaking over time now I want you to say a word or type a Word what is the biggest problem with replication oh yeah I should have guessed who it will be hey Rex you shouldn't answer okay so you guys are giving good answers but right answer arrival for first first of all replication brings three problems and I see you are uh you know what you do yes RV costs Financial or time storage right certification de Mayo makes more uh disk space consumption um a replication delay yeah replication delay of course present especially if you write to a data center in Europe and then expect these data in Australia there will be replication luck no doubts but the most by the biggest problem of replication is totally mentioned Again by mauran ABC give this body give this guy a medal uh with inconsistency take a look uh Okay so take a story uh what's the story of this uh inconsistency then you have to write a same new value like previous price of an item was 12 now it's getting more expensive and new price will be 13 if one of the servers was not able to get the update for whatever reason uh Network outage power outage whatever outage therefore we have the situation then two servers have a new value and one server get an old value and in any that's not about Cassandra that's about each and every distributed system even without distributed system when you introduce cash that is already introduced a second storage for revenue and you have to keep very very serious control on cache and validation and of course that's double as important for a distributed systems um so Cassandra has a layered self-defense mechanism from inconsistency Cassandra takes consistency very very seriously um first layer of this defense call it hinted handoff then you've write some data data is will be processed by one of the servers yes it may be retica usually it is replica it may be not replica still fine the queer event server processing your current query is called that query coordinator it's not master it's just a server what got this message and moving to do something with it so each server is a credit card manager whoever processes your pairing right now is the query carbonator for V squaring so we got these insert or update and this query coordinator processes it calculates a token defines what uh servers are responsible for that because it knows all radium and writes these data to those servers and then whom we have a problem one server does not confirm what it's got the data what happens then query coordinator stores a persistent hint or hinted handoff this game at handoff will be stored on a disk and as soon as failed server recovers our query coordinator will see what he got back because of the gossiping mechanism and notes talking to each other what's going on in the cluster have you heard node number 5 is down again such a lazy server I don't want to work with him like that and then query coordinator within sword on disk sees what uh server number five has recovered it will dispatch uh hindut handoffs to the server so it will be recovered automatically and you don't have to do it take a look you voltage view some servers down and wake up in the morning only to find out what your plaster recover it automatically isn't that a major greedy there is some magic in 18 that is main chicken native and navy will be delivered and we are good but that is just the first layer of the defense actually there are more I will explain some of them in the future steps and some of them are out of scope for today because it's the course for developers not operations but Cassandra is very well protected from means uh inconsistencies hit the head office repairs and read incremental repairs and some other mechanisms okay um Rex are there any good questions to answer right now before we move on leader but imagine a request Handler and the leader are geographically dispersed so uh first of all forget there are no notice in Cassandra Cassandra is decentralized and that is important as long as you think in this terminology Master server leader server um things like that SQL mindset we will try to use Cassandra as my simple revolved joins and you will fail because Cassandra is not my secretary audience forget there are no leaders and if you mean very coordinator it's not a leader it's just someone who processes and orchestrates your query processing right now at the moment for the next query it will be next server so um and um queries first uh execute you see we cannot get too deep in the multi Data Center deployments but query carbonator works at the data center level so uh and replicas are at the data center level so they will be within the same region within the same availability zone or multiple availability results of the same region and it's totally fine so there is nothing to worry about that and as I said already by default Cassandra driver will reach um will reach a lot of Rapid service there is no partition leader again each sir it's a decentralized system there is no meter a replica you see as soon as you think remember you inside your single point of failure stop it um and then lingers down next leader has to be re-elected and that works as soon as you have free servers but when you have 3 000 servers it doesn't work uh so then you may ask a question of how do we get consistent data and I explain it in the next slides so that's still very good questions okay then we work with distributed systems it's very important for us to remember Cap CP theorem operates free features availability inconsistency and partition tolerance availability is the easiest concept of those availability basically means uptime you ask the question you get the answer if failure of a single or even multiple servers does not lead to a no response no downtime your system is highly available then consistency means no stale data you ask for something you get the most recent most up-to-date value if you ask something from a cluster and your cluster returns outdated information that means your system is cross node inconsistent and then finally partition tolerance the first concept of cap the third concept of cep the most misunderstood concept partition tolerance means the ability of a system of similar system to survive Network partitioning please notice Mass partitioning has no relation to Cassandra data partitioning it's uh just different ideas what is Network partition Network partitioning means what your network of your data center is a put all servers are running but some servers cannot reach in our service for example uh there on the screen you see a network partitioning there you have six servers running but four of them group a operational can be conducted by client but cannot reach and Ruby running operational can conduct a shower can be conducted by customer but cannot reach group a uh never partitioning is a very very bad situation if you don't keep it under control it will lead to so-called brain problem and spare brain problem with uh like in the relational database world of multiple Masters selected and we have groups with one master we have Ruby rubber Master now our database Works in network partition State uh for a couple of days or for a couple of hours some operations are stored in group as and operations in group b data is a totally inconsistent and there is no alternative way to handle this problem because of the split brain we have to like different brains and we will you will have a lot of fun trying to handle this situation that is a very bad it's much worse than uh downtime seriously so now what about cep program for these simulated systems and why it's so important to understand it CP favorites stands for in the distributed environment in case of failure in case of emergency in case of some problems you can have only two warranties uh only two qualities out of free I mean like that Russ's green skies are blue and there are rainbows and everyone is shiny then your databases consistent available partition turn around whatever everything is great but then there are some emergencies problem lightning strikes um and some servers down you cannot stay in the center you have to sacrifice something and under no circumstances you want to sacrifice partition tolerance like you remember this joke a job can be executed uh quick or cheap or a good quality and you can pick only two job can be executed click and boot but it's not going to be cheap or job can be executed a quick and cheap but obviously quality will go is going to suffer exactly the same with the cep fair run Distributing database we usually speak of CP and AP databases as we cannot sacrifice partition tolerance under no circumstances we are going to have all database and this side consistent air partition tolerant or on this side available and partition tolerance and that means what for the AP databases you will always give a give an answer but under some circumstances you may get outdated answer and for CP databases you will always get a consistent answer but you will not always get the answer because if some servers are unavailable CP database will tell you no man I'm not answering your question I don't know what's going on something is wrong please recover menstruation and then I will answer all your questions strongly consistent database a city eventually consistent databases are 80. now there is a very big question people use it to call Cassandra AP available in Partition tolerant but an eventually consistent I consider this as I say there are many people right now watching this we will disagree but I insist Cassandra is to be configurably consistent dear Cassandra we have two letters two notes uh what Define our consistency requirements in our situation and if you launch your data for example the replication Factor one you are consistent I mean it cannot be inconsistent and then what's the situation right tunable consistency yeah that's what I'm trying to say is it's tunable or I Define it like configurable consistent terrible consistency yeah that is a polar cancer so Cassandra is humanly consistent with uh replication Factor one I will have always consistent answer but if anything happens with a server I will have no answer it all so my database is CP um so how is uh consistency defined in Cassandra it's extremely important question for example Cassandra is widely used by Banks but do you want your brain to dispersion in consistent information about your underground's sake no you don't so how it's handled from Cassandra that is the thing can I call the stands very well two two things you need to understand so replication Factor we discussed it already and then suppose a consistency level also very often misunderstanded conception Cassandra consistency level defines how many acknowledgments or confirmations you will wait before response is dispatched by query correlation and great things of that a consistency level can be defined other pair query bases so like you see your verification Factor we defined for a key space and in this key space we will have some tables and the Stables will have some partitions things like that consistency level is different I can say different consistency level for different queries in driver or working in Cassandra query language hell it's certainly configurable um how does apology affect here good question I hope our team will answer but we have to move on so there are multiple my friend consistency levels a for writes one local one two three Quorum local forum and so on how it works and what does that consist as a level one in this example take a look we have a data center of six servers and we make a right so we inserting data with consistency level one now I really seen it many times on step overflow people think what if you're insert data with consistency level one it means what it will be delivered to only one replica no whatever consistency level you use right will always be delivered to all records doesn't matter if you go for any if you go for one or all data will be delivered to all reddits but uh very coordinator before dispatching confirmation to our client also to a client I got your data Will Wait only for one fastest answer so where a client rights to our manager client writes to a node this node uh becomes a calculator for his query dispatches someday to all free servers and plans for the fastest answer because you are asking free servers to ask asynchronously of course so it's executed in parallel for sure the one note for us as soon as first node answers uh answer is immediately dispatched they have consistence level quorum you will wait for a majority of answers so Quorum basically means most of the servers for example with replication Factor frame most of the servers will be true with replication factor 5. most of a service like half and a little bit more um should be quite simple so with consistency level Quorum we will wait for two confirmations out of three and we can set consistency level all and wait for all the confirmations in this case our date is consistent but I thought there is a little trouble CB theorem is here and you cannot break it so if you write a consistency level all but safety is still where what happens when you write a consistency level o you basically move your database for this query from apient site to CB side that means you sacrifice so when you write with consistency level all and if one of the nodes is down you will not get your data story because we have this downtime and that's because you select the consistency level on now very good question we cannot write with consistency level all but we still want to get as close to the center of C theorem as possible like if there is a magic in ancient world then could we use this magic to try to get a sweet spot of the center of a cap take a look mathematics to rescue science to a rescue there is a creek if you write with a consistency level Forum so we write to we know what a tasks do about our free servers got the update and then they read with consistency we will always ask to uh servers then you always get consistent data take a look if data was written to all of the nodes a query right query still was executed because quora requires two or three and two are available even though uh third one and then we ask data and with Quorum a query coordinator will ask all reddits and if uh first two replicas to answer will be updated when again we get Force up to date values so we are consistent and if one of the radicals to answer first will be one what was not updated then what will happen clients will get most up-to-date value most recently updated and outdated server will get an education amen you lost your track wake up please what's going on something changed it and let's go let's repair on read when drag the read will notice it was something was outdated still data and our data server will execute a repair on this piece of data recovering first to uh that's the two most update safe and that is the second layer of defense for cross note inconsistency uh good so are there any good questions to discuss I believe we have to warn okay I see it's a foreign [Applause] if only one node is consistent and two nodes are not consistent that is a bad situation it meant it means what you wrote with low consistency level uh consistency consistency is defined by a developer per query it's safe to assume what 51 percent of replicas should be consistent if you write a consistency level of 51 percent you see if you write your data with consistency level one then there is only one option to get consistent data oh yeah that is a good point by the way so Villas hedge thank you for your answer let's imagine the situation we write our data with consistency level one it means what we know where data was received by at least one replica server but we don't know if it was received by others and now we read data with consistency level Quorum can we be sure what data is on sale can we be sure what data is consistent please answer in the YouTube chat now all the chat will answer your question at least their opinion on that right one reads Quorum I'll be sure what data is consistent any more water it's so hot here today foreign my question which consistency level we need to use on read to be sure what data is consistent and I'm not saying it's the right way to work no not one not one not Quorum because all the rushler that is the right answer maybe I I see many people saying one guys if I'm writing one and reading one there are no guarantees at all you totally can get our date of information normally it's not happening because there are repairs and many other things but we speak about 100 guarantees right if you write consistency level one when to get most update information 100 always we need to read with consistency level all but we just discussing the consistency level all is very dangerous because then you go to this trap of cep theorem and then you may get no answer at all our recommendation is right to reach forum for most of the scenarios there are some cases where you may need some more some different configuration about those are narrow edge cases and usually you don't run into them if you handle really billions of operations if you have strong iot and factories and dozens hundreds of factories across the world with hundreds of sensors on each of the factory device dispatching in state every second like you have huge volume of incoming operations you can decrease consistency level on right down to any which is kind of hopefully consistent and just because you have so much operations what you have to decrease your requirements if any one of the single changes uh for a single second will be lost for whatever reason you still can survive that but you definitely don't want to have this risk for your bank account so Cassandra works with different data and you have freedom to set up it in a different way but to do that you have to learn how to hunt right so we will run quickly through data modeling very quickly because for the data modeling it's extremely important we have dedicated next week I will be talking about stakeholdering next time full session for hours only data modeling don't miss it it's very important but now very quick introduction so cell of a row and a column Source data must be simple uh then row obviously set of cells so together now you think what's not present in many our partition people with SQL experience very often forget about partitions if you forget about partition it will strike hard at you and you don't want it a misunderstanding partitions are the most common root cause of a problems with Cassandra never forget about party purchase partitions love you they never forget about you and finally table from cable is a group of Bones and rows storing partitions multiply contribution and we are going to the laptop gray tables aerax wood Roofing sorry yeah I put myself on mute oh can you have yeah can you hear me now yeah yes uh I'm switching to your screen are you ready yeah I'm ready yeah okay let's go all right let's go so we were at the point where we created the database I know we have only 15 minutes to go but uh we'll try to do as much as we can um you know I think uh the whole Space of um um no sequel is kind of very interesting because you don't really and I know that I'm maybe steering a little bit of Alex's Thunder here um you know you don't really tired um you know with the data but you start with the use cases right and and that's kind of what you're gonna see um you know in the examples that that are going to be seen here okay um okay so again back to my GitHub link right I uh um basically created the database and now I'm at a point of creating the table which is step five okay so I'm gonna create the table to be able to do that you know remember I had created a um you know a database called workshop and with a key space called sensor data right so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect to this and there are a number of different ways of connecting to this um you know you can do document API you can do graph API uh there are a bunch of graphql uh but but you know today we're going to use uh SQL okay and uh pretty straightforward to use it all that I'm going to do is I'm going to press um you know go to the SQL console and I'm good to go so just in case you know it's not obvious to you I'll go back and start again okay and all of this again you know is outlined in the GitHub link um so if you can go to workshops and just hit connect right uh workshops is the database that we were talking about right and and basically you can say SQL console here and that'll bring up the SQL console okay so it knows it's connected to that and and you can start playing around with it okay so you can describe the key spaces um it you can do describe or you can do uh you know just desc right and um actually it even has uh um command completion okay so if you just do describe key spaces it'll it'll show you all the different key spaces including some of the system key spaces and so on okay and some of the key spaces that I have created right uh so kind of take a look at that right and then kind of keep going right so now what we're going to do is we're going to use this particular key space called sensor data to be able to use that we just say use and provide this key space name so notice the prompt changing right you know now you have sensor data um as your key space that you're going to be manipulating with so now we're going to create a network table you know pretty straightforward right it has a name it has a description it has a region and your key is name right and again we'll talk about partition key primary key uh and you know uh start again you know composite case uh clustering keys and all that uh in a little bit but we're gonna just go ahead and create this table now for now okay so create the table so by the way SQL is Cassandra query language it's kind of similar to SQL right I mean there are some parallels I shouldn't say similar uh but in in philosophy it's the same basically you will be able to query your data using this uh Cassandra query language so I've created the table it's always a good practice if not exists right because if it does exist you probably don't want to overwrite you know you may you will get an error but you know it's always a good practice to kind of do this okay now again let's go and describe our tables and now we should be able to see um you know this particular table as well which is uh networks table right so describe the tables disk tables again you'll see here networks right uh one of the things that we recommend that you don't do is kind of do this right because what this is doing is it's going to every partition and pulling the data from there but since we don't have a lot of data this kind of gives you at least some familiarity with SQL okay don't don't do it um right now there is no data in here um so we're probably okay but uh imagine if you had like uh millions of these very unlikely you'll have millions of networks uh but you will definitely have millions of sensor data so I would definitely don't want to do that with the central data right so so it depends on the use case um but in general whenever you have a select star you know just think about it right so let's create a sensors by Network you know how um you know intuitive right you know you you you organize your data around your use cases that's really what it comes down to and and you know Alex is going to talk a little bit more about this right so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create this table and I'm just going to copy this part of it okay and I'm going to create it okay and you can see here it's pretty straightforward you have primary key is the network and then within that you have a sensor so essentially it's ordered within the sensor within the same uh um primary key or partition key okay all right so now we have done that let's go back and um see why this is bad because what we are doing here is we are creating a temperature by sensor without really using the date and we will correct that in the next um invocation but let's do this anyway okay and you can see here the clustering order is by timestamp descending so you can have ascending descending in in you know all kinds of options uh I mean those kind of options there okay so so I'm doing that okay not a good idea to do that so because um again you know we probably want to include date within it so what we're going to do is we're just going to drop the table and we're gonna create a new temperatures by sensor which will include the date okay so we're going to drop the previous table and we're going to create the table with the correct fields in there okay so we're going to drop the table and sometimes this takes a little bit of time and you might even get a error um you know just try it again you know if so as you can see here you know you can see the CN error but let's not worry about it right now I'm going to go back and take a look at it in a second so this is the temperatures by sensor table okay and here what I'm doing is I'm creating um you know the sensor the date and the timestamp and then order it based on timestamp rather than here where you know it the uh the primary key did not include the date and you really should have included the date right so so what I'll do is I'll just make sure that my um bad table has been deleted right you'll see here if you try it again you know it will it'll basically come back and tell you that you know that's not existent which means that it already got deleted okay so now let's again go ahead and describe the tables right you know just again all that I'm doing is following along right you know step by step describe the tables and you'll see here I have the temperatures by sensor that I just created sensors by Network which I created earlier and then of course the networks table okay so again you know if you do a select star from not a good idea but just to for illustration purposes by Network yeah very important working with Cassandra don't forget how to work with Cassandra and doing select all from a table means full clusters come asking all of the servers for all their pieces of the same table in most of the cases if you are doing select star it's one huge mistake and from table without work conditions it's a second huge mistake so this statement has an absolute art Department of Cassandra exactly right so again I'm having said that I'm going to do it anyway right you know again uh the idea is I'm taking a look at the key right you can see here it includes the sensor the date and then it's ordered on based on timestamp okay so all of this was based on how I defined the table okay so that's good I've described tables uh uh now I'm going to start inserting some data right and typically like all operations what we do is we insert right so those are referred to as current operations based on you know the popular uh rest Paradigm right you know which is create read update and delete right um and and really I mean that's exactly what you do with data anyway right so creators to insert data reads to read the data update is update the data and these delete the data and and you'll see examples of all of this okay so let me show a few I probably don't need to go into all of these right because they're all kind of uh just few samples let me show some samples at least and and just to make sure that I'm gonna select star for networks you know just make sure that I inserted it correctly okay and you can see here this is exactly what we inserted just a moment ago right we have forestnet we have volcano net and they are based on forest fire detection Network volcano monitoring Network and what are the region sits in there right okay so so we have that uh keep going right we inserted that we can insert all that I do is again cut and paste it and I'm good to go right okay so just keep following along with the steps I insert a whole bunch of things in temperatures by sensor you know all of this is done manually I mean you can easily imagine this being done programmatically right you know we have an iot device you know which is pumping these devices I mean this is uh data uh and into the database either directly or maybe you know like we have a streaming um you know software called Pulsar so where Pulsar is listening to these sensors and depending on which region or which network it will automatically uh you know put it into the appropriate database you know depending on you know the location and so on right so so did I insert this or did I not let me do it again anyway okay so so just follow along with that okay and um keep going with that okay and and there are some questions every now and then uh don't do the select star but it's okay to do that uh probably what you want to do is something like this because this is not like what Alex said you know it's not a full cluster scan this is specifically going to the forest net Network and looking for that right yeah so so so let's take a look at this particular data right foreign and you can see here you know there's a whole bunch of data associated with that as well um or you know something like this as well okay and you can kind of play around with that okay so I think that's a reasonable um representation is there anything that we need to talk about because I know that we are kind of approaching the end of the Workshop right um so you can get a partition and delete at the row level and then read again so roll over delete there is partition level delete uh all of this are you know enunciated in the instructions okay um so try these try a combination of these um and and and and see how it goes and and kind of play around with it you know so that if you never use SQL um you know definitely uh getting more comfortable with this will will definitely help you a lot okay um anything else I need to stress uh now I think they are good uh anyway we will have to do it all on their own as a part of homework so I think we are good to go okay so let me switch back to my screen and I'll link that in a moment uh first of all there is a question I wanted to answer very very very important question uh so good and painful question um where is it uh so somebody said uh one two three no it shouldn't be do I have Echo foreign okay uh so I wanted to answer a question uh before why Cassandra having better right than read uh that is a good question by Kevin joshing and that is a common not really misunderstanding but its news of Cassandra now take a look Cassandra writes a very simple very fast and there is nothing uh what you can do wrong with the symbol insert there is nothing but you can do wrong it can be sequel uh malformat or something like that a typo then it will not work at all but if it's a correct signal and your service are running you will get your data store it nearly instantaneously because of her only can It Lock all the things like Cassandra is very Advanced and very well optimized for rights but the statement Cassandra writes are better than Cassandra it's totally wrong Cassandra reads are as fast as Cassandra writes except of one real problem this Cassandra writes uh someone writing data cannot do anything wrong okay you can use local watch those are not really fast in the case when you don't need gold watch but there's a special keys right but in the normal General right generic right you cannot do anything wrong but with reads you can I have reads there are so many people misusing Cassandra just running to use it without reading implementation watching our videos you are not like that you are best of the best you are watching us right now but there are so many people doing it wrong so as a result they do just stupid  trying to use Cassandra as my SQL below joins Cassandra is not my sequel revolutions then they fail and they say Cassandra reads are slow will be slow but that's not because they are so because you are doing something wrong if your partitions of the size of a terabyte then scanning this partition will be slow is Cassandra wrong on that no you didn't have your data so Cassandra writes a very fast Cassandra reads very fast what's wrong is people using it in the wrong way they say I love you you are not like that you are learning so now we have to run through some points uh and we are certain time so we will discuss it very briefly and for uh and for next week so this one is the sneaky on the Mastery content yeah Alex Peter uh Peter had a point and um there's this thing that your voices are and I I until now it was fine for me but now your voice is very odd you know it's like I don't know what's going on there it sounds very very different like uh no idea what it how how to put it water free I don't know guys it's fine now it's fine now keep going yeah so so we will do a quick run of some parts of an extreme but please take it seriously uh right now you cannot go to your uh Cassandra hell no you are only starting to learn Cassandra and one of the most important sessions will be next week but now a quick run through for some parts of that designing this model the Cassandra is essential data model done wrong is the easiest way to failure if you are not failing to fail you better learn later this way first finalize customer Behavior or how the application is going to be used if you have heard of user stories very much the same we identify workflows dependencies of those workflows to be explained later based on these workflows purifier queries what will answer to those workflows customer workflows and knowing the queries we design tables using generalization to be explained nicely so in the data modeling methodology created about our very own here uh right uh first two steps have to be executed before we proceed is we have to understand our data and we do it designing a conceptual data model and describe it with entity relationship diagram and then also we have to identify access patterns with application workflow model we do it with application workflow we describe it with application workflow diagram uh our thank you in attention thank you for great questions and points on the chat uh sorry you have to please next week uh let's try to stay for longer together because there is an Enterprise okay then one thing together conceptual data model we identified while understanding our data and access and access patterns and describe it in our application or full diagram we apply very first approach and we basically write to queries in the file the lateral logical data model then putting some Cassandra optimizations on this logical data model we optimize the Implement that as a consequence of physical data model which we already then use to create a Cassandra per language statements what will create plan SQL statements to create the tables oh so energy relationship diagram you could have seen before with a relational database world because of basically more or less the same what you used to want to understand your data in this case working for sensors storing temperatures and sensors grouped and networked we will have networks the flame description region a number of sensors this network has some sensors longitudes of locations or characteristics and each sensor records temperature with a timestamp and a value and that has to be quite a simple EOD using a little so much bigger right it is Overflow to understand because well each use case has a workflow on your application in this case for example I want to see all low temperature for a sensor number 15 16 whatever for for a sensor knowing nothing about the sensor knowing nothing about the networks as soon as though I cannot there's so room temperature values for a sensor I need to know ID of the sensor in a network and then finally Q3 displays on sensor in the network can execute a standalone out of nothing in the middle of nothing in the middle desert no the so-called sensors of a network I mean two names later priority of the center and that means overpower pro has one on the balance first I have to show to customer all sensors on all Networks uh so he or she can click on this network and then I can display all sensors of this network and here we're going uh downwards we made a totally perfect sense as a customer as a scientist working to sensor networks on the temperature or across the move ment we serve as a meter for clarity and then I push the button so all sensor networks I get over sensors networks because refund has no dependencies I just want to see all of them then choosing the sensor choosing a network I will see all the sensors in this network because I already know my ID I clicked on this network and then having all the sensors in the network I can click on the sensor and show all room temperature values for the sensor and this query can be executed because like entities has some relations but from workflows have dependencies too that's very important to understand okay and then what happened to talk never entities to their workflows are going to access them I see which query will be answered which a wonderful self will be answered by which table we are starting to think of really long tables and we can see what networks may be named description we don't know sensors sensors by networks will be Network sensor coordinates temperatures by sensor will be sensored daytime stamp and then you very simple I have key here is proficiency and seamless lost twinkle and we will explain it actually and I'm sleeping YouTube because a small Advanced case we will again analyze safely and now optimizing the remaining some organizations finally we are doing it very simple latitude and latitude of sensors will be just decimals sensor ID will be just the text I'm fine with the platform you will be just text I'm also finally bad characteristics will be a map of that steps because characteristics can be different from sensor to sensor because I'm going to have millions of sensors we will be from different uh producers and very forms so I will use this type map for text X and I'm fine simply choose by sensor uh this uh and this network there is a very important and interesting optimization I can yet all the networks at once or it will be a full cluster stand right if I do just select all from networks we're all specifying to particularly it's totally wrong but if I just move to get all networks then how do I get rid of them I'm going to burn this farmer okay uh and oh thank you so and there is a question I'm going to get some Networks how do I get if I don't know uh if I want to get all of them ideas in this case one of the optimization statements we will use markets of a very simple thing and a couple of hundreds I will create uh just Market type that's for well and name is in the future uh some of my Approach will change and I will need to store millions of Networks so I will just distribute them over women's markets and I will be good of that so what as simple as that so you see how we went from a entity relationship diagram describing entities and application workflows describing workshops uh workflows mapping them together entities and workflows with Aquarius defining logical data models and physical data models because when you have this one then you have query running very simple and a lot free will be your homework out of your homework first of all some of you definitely deserve some prices so all of you deserve some prizes but I see there are many dozens of people think we're still watching us and we cannot dispatch dozens of surprises we have our own budget is limited but some of you will get the prizes so what we do right now we go to magic ask your questions and if you answer questions faster hey fantastic is back right on time Chris is starting to remove so that's perfect now please do not answer in the YouTube channel if you answer on YouTube it's all great but you won't get your advice you don't have to put your mobile phone or email or credit card number you just have to enter the code h290-8577 and you are good I see 36 people just joined us and we cannot wait so we launched at least in five three two one all systems ready here we go please during the quiz watch on your mobile phone or whatever tab you have to open the quiz because YouTube has a little delay and on YouTube you will see questions a little bit later I'll switch over and the faster you answer more chances you have to win if your answer is right so let's start question number one answer first to get four points how many muscle rows does Cassandra cluster think at least three per cluster free tornado Center and after our hair consists I think not a single one the sound is decentralized how many masternodes does Cassandra Foster need make her seek and I will be fired not a single one Cassandra is decentralized and there are 10 people who still answer it uh wrong so because there is no integration of a master note in the sun it's a decentralized please don't please my SQL thinking you will fail number two answer fast to your own points our date is being distributed all the atheist places to each server my partitions range the partitions per load with others locators examples oh okay and shot is smart everyone is answering so busy with me I wish you all the best I wish you too right it is being distributed by partitions range of partitions per note and guys who answered all data is replicated to each server Apple handles with Cassandra hundreds petabytes can you imagine a server you can squeeze it into a single server there is no such machine in World mode can be what is able to dispatch this data within milliseconds no no no by partitions it is foreign foreign is that right I mean it's like I can do it all day all right right it is free you definitely cannot have 1.5 so it was simple but school was fastest and the fastest move like that's pretty fun Mr Walker was Hostess well done well all within four ten points so you know it's anybody's game now yeah yeah yeah it's nothing is decided so super fast to get more points what is Australia oh that's an easy one constellations it's a local memory version of Cassandra it's Cassandra it's a development it's very tricky question I don't want to give any hints because I before time was over after definitely can use its development but the correct answer is right fastest okay a lot of points but the fastest moves radical are jumping on the sixth place and Sumit Kumar Praveen tour and Kevin are in the top three and that's question number five so it's very fast to get more points what is a primary kill ers does not apply to most simple databases we need to identify this rule it's the score in the partition key is the main housed so keys are very important and we will discuss some more details safely but we've even got that from their first trip all right primary key when he cleans and defies the room right so well that joke by the way uh soon uh well it's not safe because primary key has proficiency and optional clustering columns primary key present at no SQL database so I mean it was not so fast on the very first place Crown looks really good for the first place uh someone Avatar so when does a great job and that's question number six to get more points what is a partition key a consecutive number applied to initial record a designated vehicle your table to partition your data an optional table field for optional partition a key partitioning this reality from the next what is the partition key the effect most of you made it right it's a designated field to your table to partition the data it's another contact number and it's not optional it is required remote partition because we will not know where to place your data made it made the right answer but it's a little bit slow the rush was the fastest and Praveen goes to the fifth place out of the three from the first place to the fifth place oh that's so sad but the game goes on guys brothers or brother and sister or what or just it's a Tamil last name in India right but anyway let's move on motion seven of eight transfer fast we get more points executing six query without the application key is recommended way to retrieve data uh right way if it was inserted without a partitions you know what on my free time I won't get no secret bugs and I totally believe what has to be illegal and financial sadly It Isn't So the last option is wrong but with the first reader right most of you made it again uh if you will do it as a part of the sequel police I will come and arrest you and then uh rightly uh if data was inserted from automation key you can not answer the remote conditions because [Music] he was very fast when Rush was fastest so Girard jumps to the first place Sumit Kumar and welcome are keeping the second and third with Su and Bravia to one on the F450 accordingly and that is the last question so first time without warm up your fingers and get ready I'm launching the last question of the series of the first Workshop of our series you know what to do not so fast we start modeling there's a conceptual data model an application workflow there's a physical data download foreign I see most of you made it are you nervous do you want to see the results let's see who was the fastest jumping on the fourth places you are getting the prizes from data stocks uh don't quit and make a screenshot of your winning position you will have to send it to make screenshot of your uh your first place second place third place will read it salary I don't uh but um you know it's going to be cool but but like you said it's really being part of the workshop you know um being able to participate in the chat and up leveling everybody's knowledge I think that's the most rewarding part of the workshop I guess yes yes uh now I will keep this window open so you can answer even after a workshop uh what did you like the most what should we improve and I'm sorry for Echo you found it already and fixed so it will not happen uh next Workshop I'm very sorry use it up for your laptop and you software so you can keep up so what what should we improve his voice what does that mean yeah I'm sorry for that so we are getting a step four homework is very important because let's say you apply an original rate and get better in that really homework is experience and Humanity has some rewards remains for it so uh how to submit your homework uh Sumit Kumar you are good uh still uh you please contact UM can I use a little screenshot from where YouTube will not help but still contact her do we have a slide for the whole contact oh okay so how to retrieve your uh page uh sorry how to retrieve your price please contact me I'm sending my personal link right now please everyone catch me on uh following this link and if you made it to the top three and dark mirror and send me your screenshots Summit tomorrow just contact me I remember your name and if you would like to contact me fresh I prepare it a short film for him as well perfect thank you uh right so please contact us uh we are data science developers to work with you and help you in your customer questions or ask your questions whatever uh so first three places please catch me it's necessary uh following the lean database student chat and just contact with also if you want to add Rita thank you for such a nice feedback hello don't forget to do the homework to get your base homework link is right here thank you uh join our Discord Community it's like getting closed it's around 20 000 people talking about Cassandra and different things whatever making things so where are we are present there and many other developers beginners experts everyone is there so it's very nice Discord server I mean one one thing I wanted to mention was uh you know I think this is a great opportunity because these three sessions back to back to back right now it doesn't happen very often so so if somebody any of your friends have missed the first uh session it doesn't matter ask them to attend the second and third they can always catch up with the first but but this kind of gives you a a complete 360 degree view of development with nosql because you start you know with intro to nosql you do a lot of data modeling and then in the final one you're going to do some programming so so I think it's a great opportunity you know tell your family and friends you have to attend and maybe they'll win some swag too you know so yeah right so so someone asked how to subscribe to our upcoming workshops that is a link to our upcoming workshops and now a very important thing if you have something yes Rex and thank you so much for saying that I totally forgot but also it's never late to catch up uh you cannot participate in today's menu because magic is over a piece is over but you still can share with your friends so you can watch your recording and as you like that then please recommend it to them don't forget to like And subscribe for YouTube send this link to others that's it which day the homework has to be submitted good question so we don't have any sweets there liar but we kindly ask you to fill their homework uh one week so we can review them that is the manual review process because we want to see what you are thinking how you are doing that and as a result uh you have to we we will review it till the end of the week so please don't ask for a great uh tomorrow uh what's the secret area to get vouchers so for this Workshop series let's stay prepared to get vouchers if you get if you make all your homeworks you will totally get it so if you make your homework and the classes you will be good and homework it's a beginner level work okay so it's not going to be like being protecting and defending your PhD uh nothing like that that's going to be just full of instructions learn uh pay attention and you will be good yeah um and uh as soon as you don't need screenshot just contact me on Instagram with a link I sent you earlier it's yes Alex yep so please everyone catch me on the internet I will be happy with everyone no I think that's great uh again you know two more sessions to go uh please come back and uh you know thanks for everybody I think we took a little bit longer than we anticipated but but we covered a lot of ground so thanks for the wonderful questions you know I learned a lot so so it was a lot of fun thank you yeah thank you everyone thank you for coming and see you next week bye",
