good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you are you know we have changed up the format a little bit thanks for adapting uh i know that you know we are usually do the mentee after we start but you know today we decided to do the mint earlier uh the feedback that the overwhelming feedback we got from attendees was that we want to keep it tight i know that you a lot of a lot of you enjoy the mentee or enjoy the the workshops but we also want to you know know that your time is valuable so we want to keep it to two hours or as close to it as possible um so with that said uh aaron do you want to say hi and if you can get some thumbs up about the music uh about uh though okay the quiz music my bad is that still going yeah okay hello everyone yeah that'd be uh that'd be really great actually [Music] [Music] [Music] i am good to go rags yeah [Music] all right um i suppose i should get started then we all ready to go rags all right what well um just again wanted to uh you know do uh do a shout out to um our entire team because uh there there's definitely more people behind the production of these workshops than than just uh just rags and i we're we're merely the the tip of the iceberg you know there's uh there's so many folks who uh who work hard on um on you know trying to uh trying to get this right and get this to you so um so yeah just a quick shout out to everybody and uh and uh i'm sure you'll see some of them in the in the chat as well helping you out um so yeah but otherwise why don't you thank you can you people hear me now uh i think uh i had something off uh i usually don't do that but but i think i might have turned it off by mistake uh can you hear me now uh can you quick thumbs up quick thumbs up yes great okay so my name is raghav and sunivas but for whatever reason people around the world have a tough time saying my name so i just go by rags rack's not the richest easiest way to remember me um i i'm mostly on the java side and and essentially i uh my undergrad was in mechanical engineering uh and and i think i like the workshops because that is the closest i can come to see things move right um i really love to teach i love to communicate and one of the passionate things i i hold very dearly and and something that i don't think we have gotten there despite a lot of advances in distributed systems is how easy is it to kind of do the inner loop you know in fact while we are working on the workshop itself we saw this happening where you know we had to do multiple iterations of kind of uh figuring out how to you know set up the end points uh how to call the apis and so on and we do this over and over again so we want to simplify this make it easier and make ourselves more productive with that said aaron up to you all right um well as reg said uh you know my name is uh is aaron fletts um you know i uh have worked in the uh the cassandra world for um although the better part of a decade now in fact i think last month was 10 years that i've been 10 years that i've been working with apache cassandra so i i know isn't that a a crazy long time it really doesn't seem like it's been around that long but um but yeah um so so yeah i did a lot of um you know engineering on the uh um on the app back end application as well as the database side for um you know a lot of uh fortune 50 companies like ww granger and target um i currently leave the stack overflow tag and uh for cassandra in uh in rep um you know so i've done a lot of work out there if you've asked questions out there chances are it probably helped you um and i've also you know worked as a bit as an author um i wrote the uh the most recent edition of mastering apache cassandra and um i wrote a few chapters in the seven nosql databases in a week book so um so yeah that's that's me all right so real quick um hey reggs why don't we go through some uh some housekeeping things just uh you know kind of kind of about how the workshops go we actually uh stream on youtube we also stream on twitch because occasionally youtube has hiccuped on us um but the only thing we monitor the chat on is on youtube we don't monitor the chat on twitch uh but ideally what we would like you to do is you know if there are any in-depth questions uh we'd like you to go to discard uh but you know it's perfectly fine to chat on youtube as you can see uh see there's a lot of chatter going on uh one suggestion that we try to make is you know when if at all possible uh if you can limit the chat when we are actually going through the workshop you know if you can pay a little bit of attention um then you know the instructions are pretty self-explanatory in fact i hadn't just tried them out this morning just to make sure that everything is working fine um so so you can try them out later but you know if you can limit the chat for that time that'll be great uh as as always we have benty you know where you know thanks for joining already um if you if you don't know the code you can just put a pound mentee or exclamation mentee in the chat and it should come back with the right code hopefully um but we will have a few more mental questions uh and then we'll dive right into um you know into the meat of today's uh uh content right uh the idea behind mente is so that you know if people are struggling in a little bit late um it's okay you know we still want to recognize those who have come here at the right time so we want to keep it right and hopefully we'll have just a couple of questions on mentee um and and breeze through that as quickly as possible all right all right so should we go ahead and do the mentee or are there a few more slides as always you know you know what it's uh mentee and there is github you know there are complete workshops and labs um you know if you if you go to astra you will have a link later github github.com datastaxdevs and and we'll have links of this later as well uh you will you will get complete workshops and labs um you know including this one which will be available pretty soon as well including the video recording of this so this video recording can be watched later on the same link all right next slide okay let's finish up the mentee then uh and then we can come back to the um to the architecture and the meat of the content that we're waiting for right so let me go back to the mentee okay and i'm gonna get rid of you and myself or make ourselves smaller all right and make sure i have some little bit of quiz music yep oh yeah i got it architecture it's like all right and yeah and i'm gonna put some music and we'll go with minty you guys ready keep it short and sweet right again if you want 69166752 okay just a few questions what is your primary programming language we want to make sure that we are talking to the right audience java python11 java winning all right typescript a few others c-sharp a few that's nice typescript python front-end js really not many backhand quite a few java that's very cool yeah you're in the right place then you know i know we have that up category but um i i wonder what what other is so anyone who's clicking other go quite a few python as well all right so i think we have an idea um you know we were hoping that you know um java python and um you know javascript node.js probably going to be the same and that that's kind of what we're seeing here which with the bias to java which is fine because yeah most of the content today is going to be around java all right i i see adam speaking rust for the rust [Laughter] all right [Music] what is your role as a developer all right i'm not a developer we may get quite a few of them right but nobody's you know if you're not a developer we will still um you know have instructions that you can follow along uh we have had a lot of not a developer so you are in good company yeah well the one the one person and operator dba that that's me so yeah exactly i think this is a great mix right i think this is a beautiful mix you know it has pretty much every everybody front-end developer back-end developer a few cloud-native developers a few operator dbas like you said um so that's that's really cool all right yeah finally what's your experience with nosql databases and this could include you know really any no sql databases um you know it could be astra it could be cassandra it could be really anything okay i'm a master two of them we always get those right yeah we'd like to you know hopefully you know have something that in there that that might really um you know advance your skills as well uh the really the yeah yeah and a lot of people yeah exactly it's good and where the goal is to level up your skills we have some people with experience never used it no worries i think um anything else that we need to talk about uh i don't know i think this is kind of what we expected right um yeah i think so yeah we're doing well on time so have you attended our last question did you attend our previous ecom workshops this will help us in kind of yeah right so first request you know if this is the good point uh yep good first it's one of the e-commerce series that's okay [Music] oh hey somebody from back from december wow nice nice there we go yeah lots of new people though again that's good we kind of expected this right so yeah um this is great enough okay moving on i think we are done with the questions and we can get into the content right all right as you know data sounds good uh this might seem like a marketing thing but anyway uh certification is great because like you know many of us say uh it helps boost your career it helps boost your salary too okay all right with that said for sure let's move to the content and give me a second before i put you on screen all right um to go okay well uh back to our agenda here so let's uh let's start by digging into um you know a little bit about the architecture and you know some of the components in our stack that we're going to use today um so this is part three of you know common detail use cases um and we're gonna the whole idea here is to show how to build like real scalable solutions backed by data stacks asp and uh spring boot um you know so if you've used a lot of java um you know honestly i've been a java developer for a while um before i was a dba actually um so quite a while but um this project of building out an ecommerce app this was my first uh the first time that i used spring boot and i was just amazed at how how quickly it it really helps you in terms of like wiring up things and um eliminating a lot of like boilerplate code that you'd have to throw in there so so yeah i really thought thought it was pretty cool to be honest all right so i haven't talked about this yet in any of the the prior two sessions and rags and i were discussing this and and realized you know it's a good idea we'd better just make sure that anyone building an e-commerce website make sure you're using https you really do want that that end-to-end encryption so i'm just going to throw that out there make sure that we set it make sure that you're you know getting a certificate from a valid certificate authority um and if you're going to do it i actually have um an article on how to implement it with spring boot later at the end of the session but um you know we i just have a little bit of the properties that that come back that you'll need to uh need to set here um and i just want to throw out the warning to you know i know folks when they're they're doing local development they want to use a self-signed cert just i i can't caution against that enough because i've seen self-signed certs make their way into production and i'm i'm not going to name the companies but i'll just say you've heard of them all right so just that's that's the danger of self-signed search just yeah they're quick they're convenient but uh let's make sure that they don't make their way beyond your local machine i don't know i think yeah um so do we want to mention the hypocritical aspect of this because for the workshop today we're going to do http having seen all that right but but again you know we're doing it just oh just make it easy for you yep yeah we we just go with with regular you know http just because we don't want an extra layer of um complexity along with this as well but just just you know for real life application make sure you're using a an ssl cert there all right so a little bit about um you know the the architecture stack itself um essentially what we've got here is we have um uh datasets astrodb as our our backend database um we have spring boot on top of that which which helps out with um you know running our restful service layer as well as implementing you know some of the um or extending out some of the spring data cassandra classes as well to um to make wiring up the repositories and things um you know a little quicker as well um and of course a big shout out to uh chris wilheit from our team um for building out the um the node.js react app on on top of this as well um and he did a lot of that using the the tailwind css um so if you found tailwind css it's essentially just like a library of um you know like web components that that allows you to um oh hey regs i'm seeing your desktop that's but anyway i can say that the tailwind css um you know again it provides a bunch of ready-made you know visual components that allows you to uh to quickly build out uh build out a site and uh and again yeah chris if if you're out there thanks thanks a lot for your help uh we exactly could not have done this yeah i think i think your screen is showing me maybe it's you um you know if you don't mind um i think you need to go in presentation more aaron yeah oh yeah maybe i get knocked out of a presentation is that what happened oh i bet it was yeah that's really strange all right let me yeah so so i was going to mention one thing which is you know if you you you will get git part and what git part does is it clones the repository so don't be too surprised if there are some pushes that chris is going to make you know as we are as we are working so you may want to do a git pull you know to to make sure that you have the latest okay and and we'll talk about all that in a second uh but but you know a lot a lot of work that's a good point i i was um i i actually almost made a push like i don't know a half hour ago but i'm like you know with with the the workshop coming up in a few minutes i may not want to do that but yeah anyway so that's a good point to call out work in progress so you know we'll get a lot of questions too um you know and i see this in not just and not just this workshop but um you know some of the other workshops that we run as well is is why astrodb you know how can other databases handle this you know why not mourinho db um you know why not you know some some other some other database well we'll we'll try and touch on get that out of the way first right yeah um but but basically um your your database selection really goes back to brewer's cap theorem um and bruce captain for those of you who haven't heard of it um came about of a paper that um dr eric brewer and dr armando fox wrote back in 1999 called um harvest yield and scalable tolerance systems and basically it talked about like how all distributed systems try to achieve consistency availability and network partition tolerance but the reality is you know they can really only pick two so what you have to do when you're designing a distributed system is you have to kind of think ahead of time about what's more important to you um and really kind of make a trade-off with well maybe we don't need consistency as much or maybe we can we can live without high availability you know that's that's really what it is trust the fact that you know um when when there are no failures which is which is kind of rarity in distributed systems then you can have all three but when there is a failure you have to pick or you have to sacrifice one of those or you have to pick two of the three right yeah you know and that and that's a good point too regs um one of the other interesting papers that came out that's kind of foundational in the design of distributed systems is amazon's dynamo paper i have a link to that later on actually but um but that's the one where they talk about amazon scale and they talk about just how many thousands of servers they have it's probably like in they probably have a million servers today to be honest but it's like when you have that many it's like nothing is ever working 100 all the time so that so that's where you're gonna have um some nuance there but um when you start looking at cap and you start placing it out on you know like um like a diagram of like three points you really start to come up with different designations of distributed systems you know so if you have a system that's both consistent and partition tolerant that's a cp system you know if you have a a system that's both consistent and available well that's a ca system you know so it comes to um these little like uh like designations you know and then if we we move on from there and start looking at some common databases um what you'll see is you know your mariadbs your postgres your oracles your my sequels you know the relational databases are are going to be your ca database you know where traditionally speaking they're both consistent and available but they can do that because you know traditionally going back they have you know obviously they have the benefit of 40 years of computer science behind them but additionally they're usually only contained in a single system so network partition tolerance isn't something that really comes into the picture now when you start looking at um you know systems that want to be distributed yet consistent you know now we're talking about like you know your document databases like your your couchdb your mongodb um you know where where you'll have they'll have things set up where they'll they'll make a decision ahead of time like we want to be distributed but we also want our data to be consistent and well if folks have to wait for it to be highly available that's okay so that's really what what goes into those systems now when you start looking at ap systems like apache cassandra data stacks astrid uv um and you know some other databases like like react you know fall falls in there too um where it's like we we decide hey we want to be distributed we want to support network partition tolerance you know or failure um and and we we we're willing to sacrifice a little bit of data consistency to achieve that um and the reality is is when you start getting to like high throughput systems you know you're you're talking about always wanting to be able to give a response that's what high availability is about um and really when you look at at sacrificing consistency for that um you know you're really talking about a difference of like double-digit milliseconds usually that's that's what we're talking about so it's not that great of a um of a of a concession you know if i might uh might follow with that so uh i don't know i think niraj verma has a good question which is uh a sequel doesn't follow the cap theorem right and and and really i think the lines are blurring quite a bit here uh and it's hard to say you know sql doesn't i mean everything has to follow the cap theorem no matter what yeah everything is right but the point is that um you know there are some no sequels and sometimes it's referred to as new sequel databases because actually these databases what they do is they they kind of provide the sql properties and and also acid properties so so there are ways of getting around that but but again you know that's a little bit nuanced and maybe you know aaron will touch on that but i don't know aaron if you want to add anything to me it's uh my answer to needed yeah yeah i i would just say that the the new sequels um like um what is it like fauna and yugabite and uh and cockroachdb um google spanner of course is a good one um yeah they take they take a different approach to um to solve this problem you know where they'll they'll put you know um consistency and availability as as being really important but you know they'll also do extra things on the on the network side to try and make it partition tolerant as well google spanner actually does an amazing job of this but again you have to remember that google spanner only runs on google and they can do what they do because they own the network um you know so there's there's extra things that that they can put in there too to kind of make that work um i think i think one of the things that i learned you know as a developer early on was this i don't know if you've heard of the seven fallacies of distributed system um you know you will assume that the network is always stable and and that's a myth you know uh even if you're if you're google we've seen you know you know things break down and on network so uh you know on the cloud so so um you know the idea is that you know it may happen i don't know once in a blue moon but still you gotta you've got to be able to kind of address that that's right that's right all right well so you know we we talked about that a little bit um you know i suppose we won't spend as much time on on these slides just just based on the last one as we we've done in past sessions but you know ultimately with a relational database i mean even you know i know that postgres has has in a a way now that it's it's like distributed but you know scaling is still is still kind of limited um you know data like you know like i was kind of kind of alluding to their data distributions more of an add-on rather than a core component um and again when you're out in the cloud this makes like geographic distribution and sinking across those geographic regions that can be problematic when you're talking about like a like a vast um you know amount of distance there um so so again that's where that's where um you know aster and cassandra are kind of going to be the better choice there um hey document stores are good um you know the just the thing that i've noticed you know with um you know again just kind of kind of my experience is that it's um it you know scaling becomes a little bit harder um you know when you're when you're focusing on consistency first that does tend to limit throughput a bit um just because you know when you look at like how a lot of uh cp systems are built they'll have like a like a primary node and then maybe some secondaries um and i know gets around that a little by allowing like um like reads off of the secondaries you know that's a that's a setting that uh that you can take um but but again what happens is that rights become like funneled through like a like a single or a subset of the nodes which um you know can kind of um can kind of slow things down especially especially if you start hitting it hard with reads i found that reads will become cpu bound um you know a lot of the document stores will say oh yeah we're schema-less well anyone who's used them for long enough can tell you that yeah schema actually is kind of important and even though they're schema-less you really do want to think about that ahead of time um you know and then i talk about um you know heterogeneous node types can complicate devops you know you look at a lot of these and they they distribute because they have special kinds of nodes you know like config servers and um you know routing servers and primary servers and secondaries and you know it just makes it makes managing it kind of problematic that's all so hey now to ask your db well the great thing about astra is it's a database as a service so there's no operational overhead um has geographic awareness so you can go ahead and set up your key spaces to be replicated like in you know us east u.s west um central europe wait is there essentially your boards or just like east and west europe um i forget exactly but um asia pacific you know that that's another one where you can have your your data replicated to um astra is also not bound to a single cloud vendor um so we deploy and replicate to um you know any any um geographic region on on azure or gcp or aws um and we also offer no touch scalability which is which is really important too you know i can tell you from operating in the cassandra world for as long as i did that when you need to scale up um and you haven't it's already too late um so it's a it's a good idea to you have to kind of plan that and say hey you know our workloads are going to increase by such and such on this date so we want to expand our cluster out by a third um it's yeah there's that kind of planning that goes into it but uh with astrodb it kind of takes care of all of that all right regs i think we're ready to jump to um creating an asteroid this must be a record right for getting so early but uh but i think all all the power to the attendees for giving the feedback and uh i think we're doing good with respect to that so let me go ahead and show you what i do in terms of steps so you should be able to see my monitor and i'll bring up yep i'll bring up the um typically what i do is i start with the github link and and if you just do a pound github uh you should be able to get the link and i'll i'll try to put that or maybe aaron you can do that um and and once you get the github link all that i do is basically walk through this you know just just go top to bottom right so so yeah there is a little bit of introduction you know there's not worry too much about that uh we'll just jump right into creating the database instance so in terms of steps you have a register you have a create a free plan we like to say this the free plan is actually pretty powerful you know you don't have to put in a credit card you just have to put in an email and actually you can do you could run some fairly substantial production loads you know with this uh database name is demos and key space name is e-commerce uh if you have already attended the workshop before i know there were two people who attended both the workshops and there were some who attended one of those right um so you probably already have a database name and you probably already have a key space name okay but it doesn't you can you can just go through the steps again you know just just to make sure it's it's a good um you know reminder anyway right so then what we're going to do is we're going to create the database and you'll see your database is pending in the dashboard okay um and and that's fine and you know eventually it'll get to an active state as you can see here um and then you're good to go okay so if you have already created a database and for some reason it's in standby state and and we and it does uh because you know what we do is um yeah we uh actually let me put this in full screen mode so that you can see it better all right so hopefully that's a little bit better and and here what you'll see is it's in standby mode um and you hit on that connect and you'll see something like this message resuming your database please try again shortly and within a couple of minutes it should be up and running okay so let me walk through those steps right now okay i'm not gonna go through the login and all that but but essentially again just follow the steps right so you you know you have a register here this is going to take you to the link i'm going to open the link in the new vendor just just for the heck of it right and and basically you can put in your first name your last name your email and your password and you can create an account okay um let's assume i've done that right and then once i've done this right follow this guide to set up the pay-as-you-go database and then what we'll do is we'll create a database okay so so for creating the database we're going to use the database name as demo and key space name is e-commerce okay so i'm just gonna so pretty straightforward create a database okay demos e-commerce okay and then um i think google cloud is probably the easiest and typically what we recommend is um you know something a region close to you so i pick um us east one you know i could have picked eoc's four it doesn't um you know some of those regions may not be available if you want that particular region you can you can start the chat and and get it going or you can you know basically put in a credit card money talks right so so all of those regions will be unlocked for you if you put in the credit card okay but right now i i probably only had this available right and you can see here um you know once uh i had this i picked this region okay demos e-commerce okay and i can and just hit the create database and and it'll be up and running okay um so why don't we did i cover everything that i wanted to cover here um why don't we pause for it yeah i just jump ahead yeah i think that's okay regs because it'll take a couple of minutes exactly for those days so why don't we pause for a little bit and get a few thumbs up of those don't don't worry if it's in pending state it will get to active state in a couple of minutes but let's see a couple of thumbs up because this is typically what we do in our workshops we wait a little bit you know just to make sure that you're not completely blocked right and then we proceed but we won't wait for too long because you know the instructions are always there uh so as soon as we see a few thumbs up i think we are good to go right so basically what you're going to do at this point is create a database you know register create a database uh database name key space e-commerce and so on and one of the other things that i wanted to show you was you know if if it's in a pending state okay and i'm again bringing up the dashboard here you can see there is another um demos database which is in standby mode okay so all that you need to do is hit on hit connect right and then if you go to sql console this is probably the easiest there are a number of other ways of doing this it will give you this message resuming your database please try again shortly and then it should it should be up and running in a little bit okay so let's see a few thumbs up we've got one from ankit uh any more thumbs up um you know and then we'll uh start the presentation yeah yep hey i also see a question out there from a nurage about that can you oh yeah yeah i knew i forgot something a key space is really a kind of a logical grouping if you will um you know like for example uh if you look at those demos you know this has a number of uh i mean this one has only e-commerce right uh but in if you look at workshops it has a number of workshops that we recently did you know i had a native java which is native java uh to-do's uh and then you know drop drapitiska you know stefano is listening to me uh it's an italian for spider which is a cool spider game and so on so essentially what it is it's a logical grouping of these different databases and that's really what you know key space is and if you dig down into a key space you know let's say we look into uh to-do's right so if you if you take a look at this and i can show that in a second um so use students and describe tables this will have everything all the tables associated um oh if only i can spell right describe tables and um you know it'll have just two-door items right now if i were to go to demos right which is what we are working on today and do the same thing right you can see this is going to be a little bit different right use uh demos oh no what is the oh use e-commerce and again describe tables right and you'll see it's basically like a logical grouping of the different tables and whatever is needed you can see today you will go through this category the price the product the user by email and all of this today okay a lot of thumbs up so let's not wait for anything more and i will put you on just give me a second all right you're good to go all right well getting back to our agenda here let's uh let's have a look at the um the specific use cases that uh that we're gonna be talking about today um so of course you know i mention this in every every session that we do but um you know there's um there's a lot of components that go into um you know building out an ecommerce website there's a lot of sub-systems um so really these first few sessions were we're kind of concentrating on what we're calling like like the core subsystems like things you absolutely need in a uh you know an e-commerce site so really what we've we've been talking about now the the first session was was around like building out services and models for the for the product component um last session we we talked a lot about the shopping cart and um you know some of some of the architectural nuances of that as well and and again how to like model and architect that out and today we're going to be talking about the user profile uh so we have a we have um yeah there there was a whole lot of work that went into that went into today's um you know we we did a brainstorming session about a month ago on oh hey what do we all want to have for uh for user profile and we had all this great stuff um but um we had to trim that down substantially just you know really it's uh it's only rags myself and uh and chris and uh you know we we had to come to the realization that we can't build amazon.com in three weeks i mean i think it was good especially with with all the attendees so i think we can do that all right right okay so moving on oh there we go um yeah absolutely yeah so so essentially what what we are doing in this um i mean really um you know the whole um you know workshop uh is you know the different installments uh is essentially we have the um the cassandra drivers and we're using spring data cassandra to essentially um you know kind of provide the orm or the object relational mapping you know even though this is not relational database uh and to be able to kind of view that as an object right um and and of course we have a front end you know with italian tailwind css that we are not going to talk about here uh but this is kind of the spring boot java uh aspect of this that that many of you might be um you know familiar with right uh and what we're gonna do is you know kind of dig into some of this code uh and all of this code is available for you to to try it out uh as as aaron was mentioning uh you know when we started talking about brainstorming uh what modules can we start adding um you know because again rome was not built in a day our e-commerce application was not built in a day either um so what we did was if you go to the next slide uh we basically what we did was we added spring security uh and you know what spring security does and i myself learned this um you know is it provides you with or2 login or to login might seem really really complicated and hairy because what it does is it it redirects you to a uri to be able to log in and then passes a token on to you and that's the token that you hold on until it's expires and so on you don't have to worry about any of that as a developer you know that's the cool thing about spring right basically what it does is uh you know whether you're doing github whether you're doing google whether you're doing facebook or whether you're doing any of the social logins uh you can incorporate all of them into spring security and and we will see that today in action um you know where you will you uh incorporate uh the google login okay so we decided to just keep it simple again uh but but we have tried it out with github as well and and you can you can try that out so that's kind of how spring security uh fits in um and and you will you will get to experience it yourself uh it's a lot of steps i mean still a lot of steps despite all that uh but but it you know uh we have the instructions and you can follow along and again let us know if you get stuck at any point okay all right next slide right so yeah so this is what we're going to cover today is um just the the user profile um you know so so really it's just about you know hey any data that um that pertains to uh to a specific user um and um you know the ways that you might need to might need to access that data so really quick um one slide on on cassandra data modeling um you know the whole idea with um with cassandra data modeling is is that your your data modeling for performance and you're going to build a table to suit a specific query and and a lot of times in the cassandra world that means you build you know if you have you know three queries that you need to serve you might have three tables built to serve those queries and that's and that's okay um and the idea is that hey you get fast reads out of that you know you have a simple query model um but you know some of the cons some of the drawbacks are that well you have a little bit of data duplication i remember really um you know drive space is is cheap these days so data duplication is that i mean that's okay um you know operational cost is really the uh the driving factor these days um but sometimes enforcing that um that manual data integrity is uh can be a little complicated um and i actually do have um a slide on on how to do that with spring data a little further down but you know just an example for modeling you know in the relational world you'd have you know to serve one query you'd have like two tables you'd have employees you'd have your departments and these are you know in third normal form where you're working down all your um you know all your dependencies and all your redundant data and you'd select from employees and you'd do a join on departments well in cassandra and astrodb we don't have joins available so we you know we use a technique we call denormalizing or denormalization that um turns that essentially into this so where we have that query where we'd normally do you know from employees join on departments well now we just have the table that has all the data which we would be um querying anyway we serve it in one shot so that's that's kind of the idea behind um how you model for um specifically for like ap type of databases i think i think you know really the cost of disk and storage and all that cannot really be overemphasized or at least the lower uh lower costs um and and you know i mean oh right i might be yeah you and i might be giving out our ages but maybe not you at least me you know i was so excited when i moved from a 20 megabyte megabyte remember mega right no we are not even talking anything else a 20 megabyte xt to a 40 megabyte 80 okay i was so i was beyond thrilled um so disc was very expensive you know even if you think about it about 10 years ago so it's okay to denormalize um you know you don't need that strict normalization which was all invented you know at that time but that's not the only factor you know obviously there are other factors to consider as well um just just you know just to add to that you know and that's a that's a interesting point to bring up rags just to get some perspective out there my first computer was a tandy 1000 ex my second shooter did have a 20 megabyte hard drive so i was pretty stoked when i uh when i got that so so yeah i know what you mean all right so of course um you know i have this in every every presentation we've done so far um tips for large scale cassandra modeling for you know obviously apache cassandra and data sex aspd as well um mainly what you want to think about is um and you know and regs and i kind of alluded to this as we were going along here but data that's queried together should be stored together that's uh that's a good tip to have um when you're thinking about you know which which columns you you want to make your um make parts of your primary key think about think about um columns that have a high cardinality or or a high range of um of values um obviously the uh the low side of that is to use a boolean where you know you've got true and false that's extremely low cardinality um but like a high range of values is definitely something you want in your um you know in the homes that you selected to be your keys um no full table scans try to avoid things that scan an entire table you know specifically i can think of select star from without a where clause is something you really want to try to avoid um and then really just the last tip i have is try to keep things small you know small partitions small column values um a small number of um like rows in your result sets um the smaller you can keep things the happier you're going to be when you get to like a really large uh data processing scale all right so um you know i threw together a quick uh conceptual data model um you know but uh it it's it's very simple what we're what we're doing here and it's it's sort of similar to the one we used last time you know where you know your user has you know some personal data you know of like email there's an id um it might be a locale for their browser you know um it might be you know their addresses as well um and that uh that personal data you know that user also has shopping carts you know so so they're gonna be linked together by that by that user id and that card id you know kind of going over a little bit of of what we talked about last time um and when you break that down you know really for for um you know the purposes of what we're doing with user data is um we're trying to query user user data by id and we're also trying to query it by email address um and and you'll you'll you'll understand you know obviously you know these queries make sense but um it really drives the table design so so when you look at the logical data model is yeah we we really have oh i spelled password timestamp wrong um we really have a like a single repository of user data and we have things that we want to be able to to pull it back by but when it comes down to like a physical data model this is what we're looking at we're looking at a user table that's that has a primary key of user id and then we also have a user by email table that just returns the id now that might seem counterintuitive to how you'd want to design some of these systems and i will explain that in a little bit but really um this design is driven by one key factor and now you could go ahead and just have user email be your primary key but that's not a good idea because what do we know about user emails i mean they do change you know your user will come in sometimes they oh yeah you know i'm i'm with a new provider now or oh i i signed up for this account using my work email and now i've changed jobs you know they'll there will be situations where user emails will change so you really need to be careful about the the amount of data that you actually like associate with that and how how difficult that could make changing that email address so do we want to spend a little bit of time on partition key versus primary key because partition key is not just the primary key as you know sql um people from sql world uh kind of understand that right you know um yeah that's that's a yeah that's that's a good point rigs yeah you know what you look at um you know down here in the um you know i kind of have a little bit of a definition of hey this is the partition key the pk you know this is the clustering key the ck we actually don't have any clustering keys for this week um i think we did last week yeah yeah yeah but um for this one we don't but the idea is is that together the partition keys and the clustering keys make up the primary key that's that's really what drives the um the primary key definition now your partition keys in and of themselves determine those are what get gets hashed and that hash is what um is used to figure out which node the data is on which physical server it is so really that that partition key helps cassandra and astra figure out especially in the distributor system i think the partition key plays a big role right yeah yeah big time big time yeah yeah um you know what and and i have a slide that that kind of that kind of shows why that's important in a little bit here um but and the clustering key is is um inside of a partition you know how do you want your data to be clustered or ordered so the clustering key is what actually designates like um you know the column that your rows are going to be sorted by column worlds um so you can have multiple and of course you can have different sort directions to either ascending or descending as well so all right so user profile again it's uh it's pretty simple um you know we have i i think this is an exhaustive list of the properties that are that are on that table there might be a couple other ones that you find in there now that i say that out loud um but of course we have our user id that's our primary key um we have our email you know google brings back like a picture url so i thought i'd include that if if anybody wanted to make use of it um i don't think our app does um you know we have first name and last name you know locale if you wanted to set your browser locale based on on what like google or github has um addresses addresses is really worth worth talking about a little bit um it's a list or so you know a collection um that's that's a frozen collection of a udt or a user defined type um so we we kind of build out address as its own special type you know of like you know street and city and you know postal zip code and uh country you know you know a few other things basically everything you'd need to mail something you know over to over what does it mean doesn't mean that i cannot just test [Laughter] oh no no because you can have multiple addresses that that's the whole idea behind the collect um and you'll you'll see this more in like a like a b2b like a business to business type of a transaction you know where a business will have like a headquarters address and a mailing address and a shipping and a billing address and they could all be different um so that's that's important to understand too for for e-commerce um and and the the frozen keyword might um you know might add some extra complexity but really all that does is that a frozen collection in cassandra and astra means that it's going to be stored as a blob or you know like a binary large object essentially and that's just for terms of uh for terms of updating now when you have a collection of a user-defined type it has to be frozen that's kind of a restriction um so that's uh that's why that that keyword is in there oh yeah of course password hashing um this should go without saying you know kind of like uh building an ecommerce site with um within with an ssl certificate but make sure your password is never stored in plain text um and uh you know one of the common industry um practices is to make sure that you're using you know a hash because a hash is one way um and to accomplish this there's actually the um the bcrypt password encoder that comes with i think it's with spring web security is is the library that that's in um but that allows you to do a real quick um hash of the uh of the password as it as it's coming coming in from the site and the idea is is that you still you don't store the password itself you hash it and store the hash um that way if you're you're not using like a like an oauth or a single sign-in login like google facebook github whatever you know you're using the traditional username and password what you would do is take the password from the site hash it and then compare the two hashes that's that's really what um what it's doing behind the scenes um although you can send the uh the comparison example that i have here it's um doing a p encoder dot matches of uh the raw password which is is uh the text based password and then the hash password that we have stored um and and really what it does behind the scenes is it it hashes that raw password first and then it can compare the hashes and and kind of move on from there but um you know again just just making sure that we're we're coming out and saying this don't store passwords in plain text jelly is saying that it's great info um i think uh you can geek out on just security um alone for a long time right you know but uh but again you know we are trying to do an intro here so a lot of topics um we're gonna cover that but but again you know feel free to jump on this card if you're if you're particularly concerned about one aspect of it yeah yeah and you know i suppose it it um it's important to call out as well that um you know hashing and encryption are not the same thing and i think the difference is that a hash is one way but encryption is two ways so you actually can decrypt an encrypted password um but uh but storing passwords as a hash as a one-way hash is uh is definitely an industry practice so yeah and you can go ahead and google that difference too and there's a lot of great articles explaining you know why why one you know is better for certain scientists as well solid you know i i think we should we should just move on yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah i should have mentioned the salt because the hash requires assault but but yeah the bcrypt encoder kind of does that itself under under the covers so so yeah all right so i talked a little bit about uh the user-defined type of address which again allows for for multiple types and again really all this is is just um you know it's um you know your mail to name the type if you want you know so we can save that in there to help distinguish it from the others um you know your street address you know sometimes there's a street too if you have an apartment number or a suite or things for po box things like that um city state and province you know i know not everybody calls state states and you know sometimes they're called different things um postal code in the us we call that a zip code but you know every every country has a has a postal code i'm pretty sure and then of course country to uh to kind of help that out as well and if there are others that are that are unique for you know for where you live and you want to make sure they get captured this is where you'd add them in if you wanted to uh you know wanted to alter that a little bit so um santosh is asking what is get party url uh can you hold off santosh we'll get to it in like a couple of steps so just hold off for a second yep all right so user by email oh i i've been waiting to uh to talk about this slide and the next one um user by email is our oh and um yeah you know what edit this live because i totally we are building the plane as we go cut and paste building it as we go there we go all right so use your python and essentially what that is is that's a way for you to get the user id just based on the email address because typically you know again in the user table we're not storing by by email because again emails change and primary keys in cassandra and astra cannot change that's that's a important distinction there um so you might be wondering why this um why this strategy for data modeling here of using a manual index is um is needed um so let's so let me talk a little bit about you know a secondary index because um cassandra and astr actually do have a secondary index capability where you can do create index on you know like email on table user and it'll you know look up by that but again what happens is it comes down to the cardinality of values that are in there that make those indexes efficient or not um and really what what happens and i have another slide that demonstrates this as well but on a secondary index the node or cassandra can't isolate which node has the data so it has to look at all of the nodes in the cluster um so that actually um you know isn't isn't very efficient at all in terms of um you know streamlining some things you know we we have found there's some articles out there um richard lowe of apple wrote a great article several years ago on um on the sweet spot i think it actually is called the sweet spot for secondary indexes and cassandra and he talks about it being hey if the cardinality of your column is about the same number of nodes that you have um so what we call middle of the road cardinality you know it's not a boolean but it's not unique it's kind of in the middle um that's a good fit for a secondary index now on the other hand an email address i mean that's that's not unique i mean that's that that could be a key in and of itself because it has a great degree of cardinality um so so that's where a secondary index wouldn't be a good approach so now of course that's going to mean that we're doing two queries to query by email address but let me show you why that's better if we we go here um let's say we're doing a secondary index query so i've i've created my index and i'm querying from select from user where email equals homer at simpsons.com right and user id is my partition key and it's not a part of the where clause so right off the bat um spring boot here can't determine which node has the data so what it does is just kind of picks a node to be what's called a coordinator now aster actually does work a little different in this regard but this is this is like a like a straight cassandra um answer as to how it how it would handle that um so there's a there's some there's an algorithm that goes into picking a coordinator um you know it looks at things like how busy is the node what's the load on it what's the least network distance i mean there are things that go into it it's not completely random but suffice to say for this example it just picks a coordinator um the thing is though is that coordinator then shoulders the load for querying all of the other nodes um and it has to do that it has to look at all the other nodes in the cluster to build its result set and this is super inefficient because really it's result set in this case is just one it's just one entry so it's got to look at everything just to find that one needle in a haystack kind of uh kind of an approach so now i know this doesn't look that bad because this is a seven node cluster but try to think about how many arrows would be on the screen if we had a 70 node cluster or if we worked at apple and we had a 700 node cluster um something like like that would be like would be super inefficient and potentially even time out if you um if you tried to use that at really really large scale so now we move on to the manual index query where we have our hey i remembered a user by email this time ha ha all right so so now we're querying user by email and the good thing about this um is the driver knows exactly which nodes have the data so in this case springboot can say hey that node has my email data and it goes right there and then it gets the response of the user id and now it says oh well now i know which node has the user id so it's that node over there so i'm going to go ahead and grab grab that data so this regardless of how big the cluster gets is only two calls over the network all right and that's assuming you're going at like consistency level of one of course but again you know the ratio there of like two calls versus seven or two versus seventy or two versus seven hundred you know that's where you start to think about you know how the scale really plays into uh really comes into play here all right so of course we have multiple tables you know how do we keep those in sync well cassandra and astradivi actually do offer an atomic batch um now there's a lot of controversy out there around this because what happens is folks tend to use that wrong because it's named exactly as something else in the sql world in the relational database world but it works totally different um so really i i do coach people a lot to try and stay away from using batch but this is where you'd actually want to use it when you have two tables that you need to keep in sync and the way that spring data lets you do that is with this transactional annotation and really what that does is um is as of i think it's as of it's one of the more recent versions of spring but it's one we're using where um as long as you're on that version transact transaction support is like pre-configured it's already it's already running it's there so you don't need to do any additional config to turn it on but as long as you have that transactional annotation um mutations that happen to the database in your method will actually be rolled back if one of them fails so that's that's the whole idea around it so like in this case when we do a create user and we're saving out to the user repo and the user by email repo if one of those should fail for whatever reason it makes sure that that right doesn't happen to either one um so really that's that's kind of a protection you'd have to uh to help enforce some um some data integrity so aaron i'm gonna put you in a spot here um i know there are a lot of java folks here but what about python and node.js what what what do those people do oh um so so yeah you you that's that's where you'd have to use um i think it's like begin i'm trying to remember the exact syntax but if you look up cql batch um based on the language and the driver that you're using it will actually show you how to do this i i think it's like like a begin um begin badge or begin unlocked batch depending on if you're like multiple over going over multiple partitions which in this case we are but they're just there are so few entries that that's not a big deal but yeah so as long as the driver supports and you know the uh sql semantics are there i think um you know it will be handled appropriately correct yeah yeah and then they are they're they're in all of our major it's in all of our major drivers so yeah yeah all right all right regs i think we're on step three of uh so make sure that we're doing okay all right so let me go back here again all that i do is follow the self-explanatory instructions right so create your schema okay so um product data model um shopping data model etc etc etc so open the sql console on astra okay so if it's not obvious it's pretty straightforward all that you do is you um let me actually go back to the dashboard and again if you can pay a little bit of attention and we'll turn you loose and then you can try it yourself okay so so here's my dashboard right so i click on the appropriate um database right and then i go into my sql console right and just to make sure that you have the right one if you just do a describe key spaces you know it should show all the key spaces in there um and the one thing you're looking for is the e-commerce one that you created right so then what i'm going to do is i'm just going to do use e-commerce okay and then follow along that's it right so use u-commerce and then create a table if not exist which is always a good idea because you don't want to overwrite something and lose all the data right uh so so just just make sure you do this you create the product data model okay so i'm just going to cut and paste from here and put it in here right so where am i let's go back to astra right and basically hit us and it should work fine because you know i already have it right and and you can you can look look that up by just doing a described tables again and you should you should see all of this right you know the ones that we just created so create table if not exist feature product groups fee create table if if not exist product um and create table if not exist category uh create table if not exist price all of them right so you can see here there's price uh there is uh featured product groups um and so on and so forth okay so you can take a look at that and once you have the data model for product the shopping cart and the user profile right you know this is the one that we added for session three okay just make sure that i create this too although i think i've already created this but let me do this again okay hope that it works right uh already exists so so again you know if exists so we should have done that we didn't do that right so it's already there but but you know if you have not created it you're fine because this is the first time you're going to be creating this anyway right so so let's um get that out of the way and and i think even if you don't create this the programs create this for you so you may be okay uh doing this um um you know and then you populate the data yeah we want the product tables though because that those have to be seated ahead of time yeah so you definitely want to do a session one and session two um or so yeah session one and session two but session three may be optional but but you know do it anyway and and uh for for as a note for ourselves we should we should do the if not exist right you know we should end all right yeah yeah so now we add the data okay uh add all the data in there and we can do a select star from category not a good idea to do the select star because like what aaron already talked about it's going to go to every node and and pull out all that you know which is probably not a good idea you really want to select based on the partition key okay but since we still have a manageable number of categories um select start from [Music] category okay there are the different categories okay so it has the parent id it has a category id uh it has an image of that uh it has you know a name and and what are the different products associated here right and this is the denomination part that aaron was referring to okay so all that i do again is cut it and try that out okay so you can see that all right so keep going and uh you also need to create a token that we're gonna use in a little bit okay very soon so what you will need to do is create a token and to do that again very straightforward right i go back here to my database okay and in my organization i'm going to say organization settings okay and then there is the token management and there are different roles that you can um you can use and and you know again going by the principles of security you want to provide the you know use the concept of what is called as the least security privilege so provide the least privilege possible but since we are again you know we are doing this just for um you know for the purposes of the workshop it's it's pretty straightforward we'll we'll just go with uh database administrator okay and then generate token so the cool thing about this is you got the token but if you navigate away from this page this is gone forever it's gone in the ether okay so what we advise you to do is download the token details if you download the token details um you know it will be saved in like a spreadsheet or something like that that you can use going forward okay but if you for some reason navigated without copying um you know no worries you can always generate a new token okay although not a good idea you know always want to keep keep track track of that but but really what you want to do is um you know kind of put it on a spreadsheet and we'll be using this very very very shortly okay um so i know that i'm done with this save your token locally um you know if you don't want to put it in a spreadsheet you can put it in node because what what it lets you do is you know you can copy paste this right so for example if you want to client id you can copy this and you can put it in the notepad or something like that if you want you know you can do you know whatever whatever stores your fans um i think that's that's it from uh you know four and five perspective we're going to get to six shortly right okay so oh we're back to six okay okay yeah you're right you're right yeah let me uh let me get my slideshow going again here okay all right so um yeah thanks riggs for uh for taking us through that um you know i know that can be that can be a little tricky sometimes but um you know so now we've covered um you know getting your token um the idea behind how the data models are architected as well as implementing it and uh you know loading loading up some of that data as well um so now we're going to talk about the uh the restful service layer um so yeah now as part of um as as part of them i think it's um oh what is it is it open api that um that that we implement to um to build out the uh build up the swagger spec um but basically what what that is is um you know it's it's a uh you know kind of uh think of it like a like a dictionary of the rest services that are available um so if we you go to that url you know when you're when you're running this you can actually see these laid out like that you can go in and test them out and things like that too anyway i digress so if you look at the swagger spec for um the user get services what we have out there is we have we have three um so we have one that's just user user um without without any parameterized you know without another parameter on there and that's the one that actually handles the redirects from that that third-party oauth provider so like like google or github when you say hey log in with google you know and it goes ahead and it goes out to you know the google api you know based on the the client id and the secret um it's going to come back with that that response that payload um this is the method that gets called um so that actually handles you know hey does this user exist um no so okay we'll create a new user hey does this user exist oh okay we'll retrieve that user and make sure we're returning that back to the website um the next one here is that um you know and again a lot of these you'll find that um you know if you're if your site is working on like a traditional username and password type of authentication you know you'll um you'll be using the user id and email ones more frequently um so so again user user user id retrieves a user by user id and simple simple simple right and then of course there's the email one where um you know user email and then the email address goes ahead and pulls it back by just the email address so you know again if if you have a new user coming on and they give you that address or if the address is all you have from like you know another part of your data model you can quickly pull back a user just based on that so for example here um you know i know this this might be a little difficult to read because it's it's just a lot but uh you know if we're doing uh you know select star from user um and where our user id is like a specific user what happens is um you know you get all this back um you can see yeah my email address is in there um you know some of my some of my addresses in there as well um so yeah that's that's kind of that's kind of how that uh how that query works behind the scenes specifically too is that if you go ahead and query you know just by user email um this is what that that you know user email email service is doing where it's taking that that email parameter and running a query behind the scenes um and that's where you're going to come back with your user id and again that allows you a quick look up by by email there all right um of course too we all we also want to be able to um you know you know a payload coming from google isn't going to have like all of your information um you know so there there is a way to go ahead and then update that um you know so that endpoint is uh it takes a put um and it's user user id slash update um and really what that takes is again just um you know any data that you've updated in your profile on the web takes it and persists it um into uh into the database um and i think there's also a i don't know if it made it in here or not but there's also a post for user user v create um and again that's about um you know if you're using username and password authentication that's where you're gonna go ahead and um you know need that functionality so essentially the idea is you know you you manipulate all of that via apis right um it makes it easier uh that's right whichever service you're calling you know just calls the api and boom done right yeah that's right that's right all right rags i i think we're on to um um i know that you guys are waiting i know there was already questions about git pod and and i have to go on record saying that um you know git part is a great company you know and and we use get part can't say enough about them uh last night i had all kinds of issues with git pod which is very rare but but you know it's like any piece of software right you know it does happen uh but they were they've stepped to you know i told them i was blocked uh and and they immediately fixed it um you know so i'm i'm really thrilled i really want to thank them for that and uh because of that i'm going to be able to demo you know all of this and get part just like what you guys are going to be doing um you know i had planned out doing it on localhost but localhost is so 1980s right i don't want to do that because i want to get to get part is really okay so with that said let me go to my um presentation again open and get part some people actually you know don't realize that this is a clickable link okay so all that you need to do is open this link in new window open this link in new tab or open link in new private window i'm not going to do that because i already have done that okay so so you'll see here it's timed out so you know i'll bring that up again okay and and hopefully this is gonna work fine yesterday i had some issues but i should be able to see this uh up and running pretty quickly yeah yeah that's a good sign all right so you'll see here it's visual studio in the in the cloud really that's what it is um you know you have the file explorer window right you know which is very similar to what you see in visual studio code and you can see here uh it's building a lot of stuff for me uh this is the italian css that you know aaron was referring to and then of course you have spring as well uh all of those are in like you know like back in directory uh ui directory so if you want to you know kind of figure out what what the heck this is doing you can kind of take a look at all this right uh you can dig into source you can look into main java and look at the application ecommerce application java which extends the security adapter and this is kind of how we're going to make social login available in just a little bit okay so take the time to kind of move around this um and and um you know kind of figure out you know what what exactly this is doing uh what exactly is the open api controller doing what is the opening documentation doing and this is the one that you know aaron was talking about right um where you can you can get information um about the swagger document okay you can take a look at the service itself like let's look at the product service right yeah product.java product entity.java if you look at product java you can see there are these get recital properties um you know which which are available uh then you can kind of walk through that uh your user cards your price you have you know all of these you know you can take a quick look at this uh and again all of this will be available for you um you know after the workshop too so um you know if you don't have the time no release you can do it later as well okay but suffice to know that there are three parts now which is the uh file explorer window and then there is the editor window if you will and then there is the terminal window okay so what you're typically going to use is the terminal window um and and the editor window and we'll talk about all of this in a second so the first thing you're going to do remember we we put the token uh somewhere in a safe place right all that you need to do is uh you know kind of follow the steps again so i copy the env.example okay so go back here what's going on here okay so let me clear this yeah what's going on okay i don't know what okay i don't know why that's happening but give me a second here okay that's much better all right let's go with this yeah okay that's fine and and i'll just increase the font a little bit a little bit better okay so you can see here um we have provided a dot env dot whatever that was right was it example yeah yeah it's like that's saying so you can see here you can copy this.env.example.env okay i've done all this and then what you can do is you can open gpopen.env okay so this is so that you can enter the um you know as to db ide the token and all that um you know the db region and what is the key space this is already pre-populated for you once you have this then you are pretty much ready to connect to um to s2db okay and remember these are the values the token is the one that you got from uh um you know from uh what what you did by downloading the token right and then you can get the uh dbid in the region if you go back to the dashboard again okay and all of this is is illustrated there okay you can see here you have the database id okay so all that you're going to do is you're going to copy this database id okay and then you know which region it is is you know basically if you click on it you know it'll tell you which region it is so you grab the region from there just make sure you don't do anything with the data center id that's only for us but you do the database id and the uh uh what else are you looking at um database id the region and the token and you should be yeah and the key spacing is in there right right okay good point all right so once i get this going right the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to make sure i'm able to connect right so we have some very simple tests it's all test driven development right you know you want to make sure you are connected before you can do anything right so again just follow the steps right you know the first time around when you do maven it might download the entire world as it does right uh but don't worry about it yeah it takes me maybe a couple of minutes but you'll be good to go in a little bit so i'm just going to go to back end and run the test and see if it works okay so hopefully if it's not working then usually it's you know something yeah i knew this was gonna happen so what you can do is you can source the dot env and and all of this is in the um is mentioned in there okay and yep basically i can run the test again okay and hopefully this time it should be able to connect okay you'll see you know it has stargate stargate is kind of our uh unifying api you know and if you attend any of an intro to cassandra or intro to nosql um you will see you know you can see here there are a bunch of product categories right the ones that we saw in the sql like for example if you go back here and connect to this database again right so go back to demos and e-commerce and connect and use e-commerce so nothing magical everything you can see here right and describe table same thing right same drill and i can't describe describe today i don't know why okay select star from category again not a good idea to do select star but since we have limited um you know so this is kind of the the output that we saw there you know cups and mugs tech accessories and so on and so forth so if you go back go back and look you know you'll see here um you know the tech accessories cups and mugs and so on and so forth okay so good we are able to connect okay so let me see if i was supposed to do anything else uh maybe i ran a little bit ahead but give us um um i think i was supposed to do this right run the unit test and then we'll do the social login in a little bit okay um yeah yeah we can yeah just think yeah and you know you can you can do more stuff yeah like like basically go through this you know there's different programs as well which are all test test driven okay and hopefully you know i haven't tested this in a long time but but hopefully this is still working okay um and you'll see here you'll again get back some output if if the connection uh successfully complete so once you have this you're fairly confident that you're able to connect to astra right uh one of the things that i forgot to mention uh no i don't think we need the security workshop right i mean the the zip file because we are actually providing the token um so i think we are good to go with uh let's see some thumbs up of having completed five six and seven or is it six and seven i forget uh six which is setting up your application open it in git power right and then grab the token from there uh that you already downloaded and plug it into dot env okay and then what you do is you know just make sure that this is running right and then um you know maybe i missed that uh env part you may have to do that the source dot oh it's in here so make sure you do this and and then run the unit test and and you will be good to go okay so shall we get back to the presentation i don't know i think we're doing reasonably well today all right yeah um i think there is one slide and then we're right back to um perfect yes um so essentially what happens you know i i alluded to this earlier you know this is the same slide actually uh essentially what we're doing is we're using spring security uh to be able to do this social logins right uh today we're gonna do google but you can do github you can do facebook you can do whatever you want right now there are a bunch of other sites you know like even octa which we use in the enterprise you know you can you can do all that using uh spring secondary very easy to do that and and hopefully we will walk through that in a second okay uh but essentially what we do is uh integrate spring security uh and and able to do the social login and that's the next part that we're gonna see in a moment um do you want to add anything else or this is this is this is really essentially you know the essence of session three is adding this yeah yeah it it really is yeah yeah and and that's um you know rags i just want to say that um the tests that you just ran as a part of uh part of maven there the junit tests were super important during the development and the implementation of of spring security um because i found out right away that spring security was uh was nailing down and uh and preventing me from going to the category service so that's where i figured out that i needed to add in a uh you know an additional route to make sure that those that guest users you know users that that didn't authenticate could still get to those services because it was preventing the tests from completing kudos right now it's always yeah yeah that's right so i just noticed uh i had a typo in my readme and i'll talk to you about that in a second um let me bring up my monitor okay and you guys can see see this it should be really a cd uh i don't have the cd in there okay so make sure you are in the current directory so i don't have this if you type it in your you know you'll get something um no big deal just do a cd and e-commerce app and you're back in the top directory just to make sure that you're back in the top directory okay so i noticed noticed i made a typo so i just wanted to bring it to your attention all right so now how do i uh integrate google into it right you know that's the that's the million dollar question right uh so so let's go you know basically as it suggests i'm gonna get rid of this um i'm gonna open this up in a new tab okay so open this link in a new tab so just open that i'm already logged in okay i'm logged in as data stacks okay but really it doesn't matter you know you can you can add an account i can i can try something else it doesn't really matter um you know you can use any of the google accounts it should it should work right that's uh and then what you do is follow the steps right the first thing you may have to do is go into this oauth consent screen and make sure it's external i think by default it's internal and then do a create okay and then you come back and you know you may have to provide the app name support email and some emails and all that if you want you can put the app domain as get get part.io it doesn't matter but once you're done with the consent screen with google right based on the url there now click on the credentials tab and plus create credentials just follow the instructions right so rtfn i'm creating the credentials and then let's go back and look what it's saying it's saying oauth client id make sure i put the right drop down or client id and i know that this works because i think aaron you just tried this out right and then what you're going to do is you're going to say web application name as ecom you know i'm not going to create it because it's probably going to warn me anyway oh maybe it didn't okay and then you have to add the uri and add the redirect uri so to add the direct javascript origin uri and the redirect uri we have provided a convenient script here okay so basically what it this does is it provides you with a way to use this and copy it okay so if i go back to my terminal window and run this command okay you'll see here it substitutes https with http and all that you're going to do is you're going to take this okay and plug it in right so you add the uri okay and just say this that's it right and for the um redirect uri you hit the add uri uh the redirect uri and again go back here this will tell you how to use the authorized redirect uri click that go back again um to my so we have you know just juggling types a little bit but but you know everything is available out there okay so you can see here now i take this and i put it in the redirect uri see the radio uri is warning me that something is not working right so if you want github how would you do this exactly the same way login or two slash code slash github okay and once you do a create you're gonna get the credentials you know i'm not gonna create it because you know i've already created one so i'm going to go back to my credentials okay and look at the credentials here okay you will get this client id and client secret and what date it was created and all that you know i don't need to worry too much about that i'm going to copy the client id in the client secret from here if you do it with the create it will provide you with an option to cut and paste it so all that you're going to do is you're going to grab the client id and client secret associated with with the google login okay so there are lots of ids and secrets going on one is for the astra this is for the google service right so so we're gonna um grab those okay so when you hit create you will get something like this oauth client created okay um and and basically it will give you your client id and your client secret your client secret is going to start with the jio and your client id could be ending with dot apps dot whatever okay so so you're good at that then what you're going to do is we have provided a application yaml that sample that you will have to copy to application.aml because this is the one that's going to actually um you know provide the sso credentials to be able to use the google login and and and you know do your ssl okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to skip this step because i've already copied and i'm going to open this okay so let me show this open here right and you should see this and you will see here i have set up for github also but for google i have put in exactly you know the client secret and and the client id uh that i got from the google uh authentication okay all right making progress here um it i know it takes a little bit of time and don't be too flustered too concerned if it doesn't you know if if you cannot keep up there is always you know you can come back here okay so then what you can do is you can start this application i mean this this really doesn't you know you we don't really worry too much about that but let's go back and look at this uh url that where the application is going to get served right so i'm going to go back here and do the gpurl8080 okay and i'm going to take this and i'm going to use a different browser here you know it makes it easier for me you know just to run it right and obviously i get it 8080 not found because i haven't started the application right so so i'll have to start the application and and this kind of walks through the steps okay so if i go back again yeah i know this is i know this is tricky you know when you're doing this on your own you can go ahead and fill api with um you know just localhost 8080 but uh but yeah for this one you want to make sure you're grabbing you know your unique like git pod url and yeah goodbye point yeah actually that's a great point yeah i had forgotten to mention that but how do i start my application pretty straightforward all that i do is and i'm gonna run through this application really quickly okay um and then i will turn you guys loose we still have 20 minutes which which is pretty good right so we are doing reasonably so yeah all right so all that i need to do is just do the start.sh and again nothing magical here if you look at the basically what it's doing it's sourcing the env you know this is the token the database id the region details right and then it's going to go into um back-end and and build the uh the application and run it okay so so i'm just going to run this and let's see what happens all right fingers crossed exactly exactly yeah i know this one has a lot of moving parts so um you know if you're not getting it right away don't don't worry about it um it's it's definitely you know the video will be available after you can go check um and of course the instructions and github are out there too so sometimes you might get this as well uh you know allow the pop-ups so just let all the pop-ups from this particular git pod io and and you should be able to get the application and you can see here the first time around you have a login right so so let me go ahead and log in first let me use this different browser because it's easier for me to do it that way i'm going to clear the browsing data all power to me clear the data i'm not going to do that on my browsers that i use because it just makes it easy all right and i'm going to paste the url hopefully i still have it there okay and your application should be up and running right there you go right what i can do is i can go look at whatever i want i want a jacket today i'm feeling like a jacket today right and i'm gonna pick a large one it's really nice you know what it's so comfortable i fall asleep in it all the time that's really cool i i'm gonna add to the cart and these parts you know the international delivery the loyalty rewards and all that nothing is done yet uh but at least you can go and check out your card right you know you can go look at your cart uh and things like that right and you can you know again checkout is not implemented yet but but it's getting there but let's look at the part that's implemented right let's go and look at login so if i do a login the first time around it might get the consent screen and all that but i've i've gone through all of that all that i need to do is i'm gonna say github right if you i'm sorry google login right or you could have github login and so on i just log into my account okay i can pick whatever i want okay i'm gonna pick uh just for the heck of it i'm gonna pick my data stacks okay and since i have doing it the first time it might even ask me for uh what is it called the two-factor authentication but let's see if it works all right right but this is the nice thing about using um okay i did something wrong here memorizing when you don't get remember the password all right remember folks this is okay so sorry basically asking me for um so i'm gonna do that let me make sure the user authentication works right and and i'm gonna go ahead and do that so i'm authenticating and just to make it easy i'll just do a try another way right and i'm gonna get a verification card and i'm going to put that in and hopefully it's going to work there you go and i am all authenticated you can see here that the screen changed right and just for the heck of it what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back uh actually not here i i'm going to go back to astra right and what i'm going to do is i'm going to and aaron you should correct me if i'm getting this wrong select star from user there you go it it just added this just a moment ago okay yeah yeah so so pretty pretty exciting right you know describe tables and um let me do wrong describe tables okay and you can see user user by email this is the one that adam was talking about right and you should see that as well okay so so this is how the two are connected to each other right uh and this is what you know aaron talked about kind of building that manual index and making uh access fast and notice here it has a lot of information uh about me you know especially the email address and and you can get you know the other information as well we just haven't kind of populated it here okay uh [Music] did i miss anything else that i had to do or uh are we good to go um oh hey i think we're okay yeah yeah we walked through the login um did you show i know you looked at a product did you add it to your cart i did add it to my car right no i did not let me see if i did oh that looks like you're not logged in though that's weird no it is it is logged in yeah it is really there shows my shopping cart uh and i can check out and all that and i can you know uh i think we have had some issues with the log out we are working on it but but you know we are uh we are you know we have done most of it now if i go to my username you know i can update this as well okay so i live in a city called chelmsford nobody has heard of that except a few people in the uk you know whenever you do a google search for chelmsford uk comes up but so if i do a save i can save my profile okay and it updated your profile right if i go back and look at it on my database hopefully this should have updated my user and you can see here it updated it to whatever that is james wood okay so so hopefully that kind of gives you an idea of how to do this um oh one thing i would like to do is show how easy it was to pull this off you know obviously i have some some debugging statements here right because we've been debugging this uh but let's look at palm so you know the palm xml actually has uh let me go look for it it might be easier that way oh auth so you can see here um i didn't miss that yeah there's the word over to client okay so all that you need to do is include this or2 client okay and then what happens is if i go to my static oh not here where am i so resources uh oh yeah are you looking for index.html um oh there it is oh okay there's the uh no that's not what i'm looking for um i'm i'm blanking out for a moment here uh i'm trying to see where we set up the um static okay there it is and that does okay i'll find that in a second um hey let me let me do it this way yeah all right okay so i go the hard way right okay that's what i was looking for thank you so if i go to java com and and look at the security adapter that's kind of what i was looking for e-commerce application java you can see here um all that i needed to do is authorize the request okay and and and essentially provide that ssl login and the logout options right and spring will take care of all of that for me by just using this or2 login okay and that's the that's the library um that we included in the pom file you know in maven and and you can kind of do this um you know with with other languages as well uh maybe not to the same degree as uh easily as with spring boot but again um in principle what we are trying to do is set up the google sso and and integrate it to our uh application so that when the application hits that endpoint it's going to figure out whether it's already authenticated if it's already authenticated no problem i'll get the user details if it's not it'll send me to a redirect url it could be google github facebook wherever i need to log in there now i'm going to get a token that and the application says i'm happy now i have a token i'm going to serve you right and depending on your level of access you get the right level of access okay so that is briefly what we did you know which which actually takes some time uh and my suggestion again you know we have we have gone easy on the homework um but our recommendation is that you know if you want to you know try this out yourself um and and give it a shot uh do we see any thumbs up you have anybody already did uh i know orlando is saying not connected but uh hopefully somebody's helping him i saw i i think i saw a couple but uh but yeah i did see some folks having problems we've uh i i have um you know recommended some folks jump onto our discord sure i think stefano they're trying to help them out so okay okay perfect yeah yeah um yeah maybe sometimes what happens is uh you know you you um don't have the region right or something like that right um again you know if you run the test application um that's really a time saver you know life saver really um you know essentially what it will tell you is it make the connection because if you can't make the connection forget about it nothing else is going to work right so so make sure you run the at least the connect uh part of it and then you can proceed through it and and you can see here the workshop actually goes through quite a bit of detail of all this right um it it kind of talks about how to um you know do the uh the single sign-on it talked about swagger the open api that that actually you know aaron referred to and and let me see if this works you know i've never i haven't tried this in a while but but hey i live dangerously let me try this right so let's see if this works there you go swagger is up and running right this is our e-commerce back-end right and what you can do is you can you know of course this is a small so typically what i do is i take this out of the browser and move it to the browser okay and then you can get the cards you can get the products you can get whatever you want okay let me see what i can log let's try this what the heck right i'm going to try it out i never tried this before but i'm going to try this anyway execute it okay and and basically i get an exception right so that's why they you know you shouldn't try the same right but but you know we should we should we should have tried this but but uh you get the idea um you know if you want to try the uh user cards user id cards you can you can try all of that uh let's look for something like this product id let me see if this works okay so let's try it out and there is an example here let's maybe that will work okay and you can see here beautiful right it's a annotation t-shirt uh what is the brand and so on and so forth so all of these instructions are contained here uh if you can't do it today i know there's a lot we threw at you but but you know you will definitely be able to at least get to this part you know um including the google login uh and if you're really really brave you can even try the git power login right all right so with that said um can we get a couple of thumbs up of people having at least done a little bit beyond have a card saved in the mobile phone without user id oh okay i don't know what he's doing but but that is cool oh you're probably using my um my application oh how can i retrieve the session oh yeah santosh this is a discussion that that chris and i had quite a bit um yeah you know um spring web security the way it's designed is that you shouldn't have to worry about um about the session id itself um but that being that being said um you know we we did have at one point in the project um some endpoints designed around retrieving that session id on um on the service layer side but um yeah you shouldn't need to worry about that that's yeah yeah spring web security takes care of all that i know that some of you are having issues and it could be as stefano put it um you know could be a spring boot issue um so feel free to put it on discard and and uh you know some of us will try to jump on it and and see if we can help you out uh again you know um it's it's a lot of things we have thrown at you so so just just feel free to get get some help in this card so with that said aaron back to you quicker eggs um the the folks are seeing an issue around um an inability to instantiate the web security configuration beam type um yeah the client registration repository um so so yeah um i'm actually seeing that now too and i'm not sure why that is but um you know we will have a look at this and make sure that we're getting a uh it's got to be somewhere in the palm xml we'll make sure that we're getting a corrected uh version out there after the fact here so it's what it's working for me not for the others that that's usually it looks like it works and it looks like it works in get pod it worked for me and get pod but for me locally i'm getting the same thing okay okay okay so yeah yeah one of the things that i forgot to mention right in the beginning is you know we do uh support local development because you know that's that's probably what a lot of people will be doing but uh but you know we test out our instructions extensively for git pod so so you know if it doesn't work locally just go and get part right you can try it out yeah yep yep yeah so get pod for now at least um yeah i'm a little disturbed that i'm seeing the same thing locally to be honest so yeah i'll um i'll get to work on that right away for sure all right now the presentation is obviously and let's start um the presentation mentee and hopefully we'll close on time today maybe about five ten minutes late yeah yeah all right so so jumping back yeah um you know we'll make sure we have a look at at discord and get to the bottom of what's going on with maven here um but um really as far as some you know other sessions go we've got um we have one more planned now there's all kinds of other subsystems here that that i'd really like to get to and talk about and maybe we will in the future but we have one more for sure and that's going to be the um the order subsystem um so next time that's what we're going to talk about we'll get checkout working um i'd i'd like to get um you know something working with um you know like our our streaming service so um so aster streaming which is actually built on apache pulsar um i think that would be a really cool integration to do so um that that's the way we're going to try and build it out but yeah we'll we'll see what we get to with uh with that one i mean you're not doing a patchable search just because you know data stacks cares about it it's the way to build scalable systems you know is to decouple and and do streaming that way yeah yeah so i think it'll be cool yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure um yeah a little issue with my extra reading slide there but um you know i i mentioned a lot of um you know like outside works that kind of influence the path of this particular workshop so i have them all here in the slides and the slides are available actually out in the git repo as well um but here i mentioned you know the dynamo paper we talked about that um dr eric brewer and dr armando fox's paper that kind of founded cap theorem um there's a tutorial out there that talks about um you know how to get started by building a simple spring boot app with um oauth with both it walks you both through google and github so that's on here and then of course you know i mentioned um bildungs uh quick tutorial on doing like spring tls setup so that when you're running a spring boot app out on the web that you can actually have a a good valid um ssl certificate out there with it as well for yeah for for tls tls 1.2 i think is the thing as a current version that uh that you'll want to be running on so so yeah all right so what's next regs i i see a lot of oh you know what these are all old i think no this is fine yeah this is the boot camp i i personally put it in there uh the reason why i put this in there was because you know it walks you through um you know the different uh steps you start basically with the intro and then you have a data modeling and then you kind of build the back end and then you kind of you know build the entire application as a micro service so this all happened before but the point here is you know the middle part which is the recordings are available so go take a look you know if you want more information on this i'm sure you can use some of that experience here and vice versa right so yeah yeah for sure for sure all right so yeah let's finish let's turn let's start the minty going again right okay so i'm gonna cut you off and i'm gonna take over okay and hopefully i have it up and running somewhere all right so we're good to go um let me see go back again to six nine one six six seven five two okay i'm just going to show you again okay take a moment let's see how many people are there all right so let's start quiz time fun part and what do you get for uh winning the quiz uh you get swag cool swag and and really we can we can send it to anywhere in the world um let me make sure that i have two small heads and i'll put some music on because it's been a long journey and i'm a little tired i've been fun but tired tired fun right so let's see yeah can i turn this music on yeah i see that uh some other folks there oh yeah santosh is saying it works on his work done git pod that's good that's good you know i was going to say true for the interim if you you run um maven with um the dash d skip test i think it'll work but but yeah we should definitely look at why those tests are all of a sudden throwing a fit gotcha all right um if some reason i'm not able to turn on the music but i think i should proceed because we want to be doing this on time right that's our goal today all right so get ready question number one more than one window i've had this problem before hmm all right let me get rid of that sorry about that okay all right let's try now oh all right you probably saw that answer for the first question right but that's fine it's all fun right all right so let's get let's get to about how many people are reviewing i'm just wondering we have should we wait a little bit or should i just go ahead how many how many do we have in 19 16 yeah let's let's get everybody everybody in there yeah let's six nine one six six seven five two at this point i'm an auctioneer can we get to 20 at least can we get to 17 one more person no okay let's proceed okay question one of six answer fast but more importantly answer correctly why is astrodb a better choice for e-commerce than a relational database there could be more than one answer for this one too it could be i think right yeah yeah good good clue good point a lot of people got all of the above that's cool and some people didn't really want to answer um all right okay moving on let's see the leaderboard wow i haven't seen these names before that's cool jen is the fastest kiara is next chance salahidine is close santosh lewis once hajj krak any of them could win it all right moving on next question question 206 answer fast but more importantly answer correctly what is the importance of a partition key or the importance of partition key it's just another key no importance it helps fulfill the app access patterns application access patterns it distributes data across nodes of data center and it's just another name for primary key what do you think it is all right it also does fulfill the app access patterns if designed correctly you know so if you do it right then it will fulfill the application access pattern all right yep so we're good to go next one see the leaderboard and see if it produced any changes hmm looks like jen dropped off and luis valenzuela that's a cool name um santosh salahuddin croc monsaj kiara anybody's game all right question three almost at the halfway point now what did i do here question three answer first but most importantly answer correctly what data modeling technique are we using to query users by email address did we use a manual index i think aaron covered this did we use a secondary index did you do a covering index or did you do a bitmap index and do you want to talk about the last two options because i know that you purposely wanted to talk about those right maybe after the answer has come right oh yeah yeah um hey there we go oh manual index wow yeah yeah that um yeah we we might have we we might have um done done some confusion there um yeah i know that those can be uh be difficult concepts to kind of follow but yes the correct answer is manual index you know secondary index is one that i where i had that slide that showed all the the connection arrows to um you know illustrate why that'd be a bad idea to to try that but yeah anyway all right what about covering index and bitmap index you've got it from sql yeah i think i'm pretty sure those are those are in sql i know i've used a bitmap index before those are usually good if you have something that's like um extremely low cardinality covering index i'm i'm drawing a blank on as to what exactly that is right now but maybe somebody's you know maybe we have a relational database expert out there who can uh you know put a quick note on that chat yeah and and salahaddin mahmood and orlando um you guys are have a pretty pretty huge lead but but you know i think i think you know people could still catch up could be anybody's game all right four or six two more no four five six right so we have three more oh i do this all the time all right question four of six answer fast how can you invoke an atomic batch in spring data i think uh aden alluded to this why an atomic configuration with the batch annotation method with the transactional annotation method on the method or implement a foreign key or implement a bulk key you know how do you do this with the transactional method a lot of people got that that's cool and it was a little confusing via the uh atomic configuration and the ad batch annotation let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up looks like luis might take the lead no yeah okay louise was fastest but still salah held on a couple more and we're good to go right five or six two more and so fast but more importantly correctly right which spring boot authentication library did we leverage for achieving user sso is it or2 is it springart is it user login or use it capture all logins and i think we talked about this a little bit time's up and some people got spring off but but most people got or2 which is the library that we um that we leveraged today i mean there are other i'm sure there are other authentication libraries but today we leverage this and let's see how the leaderboard shaped up looks like it might change maybe no salahuddin is holding on louie is a second in kiera out of nowhere is up there all right last question for all the marbles question six of six and so fast but more importantly correctly right what was or is the previous name of the open api specification we probably didn't talk too much about this but i think you should have an idea of what this is i i actually did mention this but i i yeah we only had like one or two mentions while we were looking at the uh the rest services yeah let's see let's see if people get it time's up most people got swagger which is cool all right all right so let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up and you know we say i leave this leaderboard up you know the screen up for a little bit all that you're going to do is you're going to grab a screenshot and send an email to jack.fryer salahuddin congratulations he held on held on head on luis venezuela and second and cada in third awesome job um and and all that you need to do is uh take a screenshot and send it to uh gary.harvey and we'll have this i'll leave this up for a little bit so that you can take a screenshot okay and then we're gonna go back to our presentation all right so let's try to wrap this up on time um you go back to this yeah we're not horribly late right and i'm gonna get rid of this and this is what you're gonna do you're gonna um the first three are gonna send mail to gary.harvey datastax.com and include a screenshot of humanity screen all right and if if you missed the screenshot um just remember we'll have the video available um out on youtube at this exact link so you can go back and uh go to wherever we are in in time and uh you know take that screenshot absolutely missed it yeah all right all right your presentation keep going yeah um so let's see you know what i think we're i think we're skipping homework for this right but i know but we recommend that you do it on your own you know just implement the google login but don't worry about submitting it just yet we'll have the instructions on how to do it at the end of the series okay so i think it should be github right because we uh no no it's implement the google login yeah you know just make sure make sure it works yeah yeah make sure it works yeah yeah make sure it works yeah all right because i know that some people had issues uh getting it done right so so make sure it yeah that's right that's that's true all right okay yeah we have a uh a hackathon coming up that um you know we're doing in a partnership with angelhack um so it's an astrodb build-a-thon you know the the theme is you know making side hustles a reality um so that is it's actually just started but um there is time for you to get in on that if you want so um so yeah um you know it it's going for for like a total of like three months three rounds of challenges you can join for one month or or all three if you want um and there's like 41 000 worth of prizes i mean wow you know that's just uh that's a that's a lot um and i think my head is covering up the uh yeah there you go the the link to it the uh you know if you go to bill buildathonhack.com this should um you know if you want to sign up that was uh that's where it's at all right now my head's just moving all over the place um hey you know remember too we have our discord out there you know i mentioned it to some of you um we will we will definitely get to the bottom of what's going on with um you know the uh the libraries there with uh maven pulling them in um and we'll uh we'll get a fix out there and uh yeah you know and that's just one thing that um you know is worth mentioning with these projects is that it's a work in progress and and that's the reason why we split it up into like multi-part multiple parts because there's no way we can get this done in one part you know uh we will have this for three days and and you know it's it's going to take forever so so nobody's we can you can pace yourself and hopefully by the end of part four you know you'll have the complete application yep yep all right um hey don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel we have lots of videos out there um you know the the previous two videos for for this series are out there as well but we have others in in terms of like you know if you're you're still getting used to or still learning no sql databases we have we have a session out there for that you know we have one that's just you know focused on how to connect and how to work with astrodb um there's so much out there for you to uh take advantage of so much information so yeah uh hit that subscribe and um yeah definitely check out uh check out what we've got yeah i think uh you know coincidentally i think next week is intro to cassandra and the week after that is intro to nosql or something like that so so a lot of intro material as well um you know even though we do cover some complicated stuff as well for sure yeah i think today's was complicated yeah a lot of stuff coming together but but you know i'm sure you know you know there is this gratification of having done it right for sure for sure all right rex i think that's it um so thank you everyone thanks everyone uh you know again let's let people know that there's one more installment of this where we'll briefly go through the the beginning and then you know we'll round out the application so so thanks again ciao see you some part of the world some sometime and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats you",
