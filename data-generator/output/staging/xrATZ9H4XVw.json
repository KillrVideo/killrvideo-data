  "title": "Distributed Data Show 72: Cassandra at Yahoo Japan with Shogo Hoshii",
  "description": "Patrick welcomes Shogo Hoshii to the show to learn why Yahoo Japan is running over 200 clusters of Apache Cassandra and why NoSQL databases are starting to gain momentum in Japan.\n\nHighlights\n0:15 - Patrick welcomes Shogo to the episode and we learn that there are over 200 Cassandra clusters at Yahoo Japan\n1:25 - 90% of internet users in Japan are on Yahoo \n2:00 - The main use case is the advertisement platform - tracking which users watch ads, for how long, and this information is used to drive which are ads are shown most frequently\n3:19 - Yahoo is unique in Japan for the scale of their use of Cassandra and other NoSQL databases. There is still a big preference for relational databases \n4:29 - Hiring for NoSQL skills in developers and operators can be a challenge in Japan\n5:10 - Shogo’s team is solving this problem with automation, especially metrics monitoring. In some cases they are sending actions to instances based on alarm conditions such as running compactions.\n6:13 - Another struggle is finding space in data centers - they can’t increase the number of clusters indefinitely. Shogo’s team is looking into running Cassandra clusters on Kubernetes to utilize resources more efficiently.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large scale distributed systems hi everyone Patrick fatten I'm at the distributed data summit and this is a distributed data show today I am talking to show the Hoshi from Yahoo Japan welcome hi my name is Joe Gavazzi I'm manager of the team that is running under a quorum or investor in the company and we are managing 200 so yes Yahoo Japan is is that probably or is that your largest database there or one of them in terms of numbers my Shukur is about in terms of the number of regrets it could be so how long have you been working with Apache Cassandra I have been working for four years four years so you're gonna do a lot of data and I think it's a a lot of people don't know how big Yahoo Japan real 90% of all Internet users in Japan uses user to Japan Japan that's really cool so what's a typical use case what is otherwise inevitable we are Yahoo Japan has advertisement platform and we show [Music] with the river many odds not only Yahoo site but also media partners right so we have we got so much data for example we store job induces advertise impression and which is a trick how many times as I use a watch they are you they are used to frequency control all the earth so the private is so cute yeah it's very appropriate so in your talk today you said this is a very unique problem in Japan and having the need for this much in a sequel is it because of the use cases you're talking about yeah so what are what are some of the challenges you have working with Kassandra at such a large scale the first challenge is to hire noosphere engineers it's really difficult in Japan noosphere database is not so popular in Japan even really know the name of a company Roxton Roxton is our biggest e-commerce companies but number cassandra knows is I heard that number because under lagrasta thunder knows in Japan we can manage the data with relational databases in most the case but now we handle so much laid out so yeah the last time I was in Japan I was a cameraman and rocket ah I do think that's that's a problem everywhere it's finding engineers that understand that'll work developers as well as operators yes so that means for growing and my company and but we cannot increase the number of you know SQ team a member it's just hard to find people yeah so I was gonna say well how do you solve a problem like that or you don't have a solution yet do we are developing automating it suits that is such a monitored a matrix of Cassandra and they are running on each Cassandra nodes and they can detect some some sign of area and rate concept and actions some incidents and for example if partition is growing from one cluster we can compact data with I'm around you can about simple tombstones are everyone's problem so did you see anything today that was interesting did you go to any talks you liked yeah we are we are lucky we are lack of space fish part space right Japan is relatively narrow countries right so Reed are we happy but we have to pay a lot of money to build in our space so we cannot increase the number of Craster's infinite infinitely right so we are we are going to maybe we are going to use kubernetes and running Cassandra in optimizing I think that's an interesting trend right now how to run more Cassandra right well thank you very much thanks everyone we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data stacks Academy and tell us what you think you can also find us on the data stacks Academy YouTube channel or find our podcast on iTunes Google Play or wherever you get great podcast while you're there make sure and subscribe so you don't miss a single episode [Music]",
