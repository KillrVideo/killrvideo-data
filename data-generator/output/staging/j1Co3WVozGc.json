    "text": "in this video we will demonstrate how to backup datastax enterprise data to amazon s3 and restore that data using op center as shown on my screen i'm using op center to manage two datastax enterprise clusters cluster one a two node cluster and cluster two which is a three node cluster these clusters are running in separate clouds one cluster is running in microsoft azure and the other in amazon web services i have a small amount of data loaded into cluster two i can select cluster two choose the data tab and i have a cycling key space and a hiking key space which we'll use for this demo to begin a backup we'll go to the services tab and select the details link for the backup service we're going to create an ad hoc backup alternatively you can schedule a backup for later that either repeats on a regularly scheduled basis or runs just once we'll choose run now to create an ad hoc backup from here i can choose one or more key spaces to back up for clusters with multiple data centers you can also select individual data centers to back up this demo i'll select the cycling and hiking key spaces i'll select true to be alerted if any failures occur next i'll choose the location where i want to back up the data the location menu includes backup destinations to an amazon s3 bucket s3 compatible location azure blob storage and local file storage such as a network file system both s3 compatible locations and azure blob storage were added in the op center 67 release for more information on backing up to s3 compatible locations in microsoft azure see the op center documentation at docs.datastax.com in this case we're backing up to amazon s3 we'll enter the name of our amazon s3 backup bucket which is op c backup bucket and we'll also need to enter our aws key and secret for the region the default aws region is u.s west one if your bucket's in a different region select that region from the menu my bucket is in eu west one so we'll choose that one from the list now a few options are available for our backup 2s3 on large backups and environments where bandwidth is limited you might want to throttle your backup speed to s3 which you can do by selecting throttle s3 transfer rate because this backup is relatively small we're not going to select that one and for these other options see the datastax documentation for an explanation now that we've defined our backup we can save that location which is now listed under location for our backup op center checks the aws credentials when saving and notifies you if credentials are out of date or incorrect an error message would indicate any issues which you must fix before proceeding so now we're ready to take our backup we can also add more backup destinations by clicking add location in this case we'll back up to both amazon s3 and our local machine that's running op center so now we will create our backup and now in the activity tab we can see that our backup to our local machine is completed we can see that our two key spaces were backed up and that they were backed up to amazon s3 so after we back up our data we can restore it for the sake of this demo let's drop the key spaces that we just backed up on cluster 2. using data stack studio i can drop both my key spaces pretty easily in data stack studio we have a few notebooks we're going to select the notebook for cluster 2. first let's select a table in the cycling key space now let's drop the key space let's run a select statement on the cyclist's name table to confirm that the key space was dropped an error is returned saying that the key space cycling does not exist because we just dropped it which is exactly what we want and we'll also drop our hiking key space we can go back to op center and restore the data that we backed up earlier so now we can restore our backup so we'll click restore backup and we'll see that our options are completed backups point in time backups and other locations so other locations or backups that might have been created by another cluster not managed by op center or backups to amazon s3 ns3 compatible location azure blob storage or the local file system let's take a quick look at point in time restores a true point in time restore once enabled can restore to any moment in time without needing to take backups as this message indicates i must enable commit log backups to complete the point in time restore if i close this window and go to the settings tab we can see that commit log backups is turned off so cancel out of this click configure and now we can enable our commit log backup we need to specify staging and storage directories for the commit log backups the backup staging directory specifies where commit logs are copied temporarily until they're transferred to all configured destinations the backup storage directory specifies where commit logs are stored and retained on each node so we'll go ahead and enter the default locations for both of these directories then we'll click save so op center prompts us to restart the cluster which is required to enable or disable commit logs because we are enabling commit logs for the first time we'll skip draining the node before stopping it on a production cluster we'd want to first drain the node and ensure that all mem tables are written to disk so now we can restart the cluster we can go to the activities tab we can see here that our restart was successful so now that the restart is complete let's resume restoring our data we'll select the point in time tab and then we need to enter a point in time that we want to restore to so let's enter 12 p.m as the time and we'll keep the current day for the backup location we'll choose the s3 backup that we created earlier so i'll select the cycling and hiking key spaces that we backed up because we want both key spaces and there are no others in the backup i'll just select all key spaces looking at the options it was not actually necessary to drop my key spaces in the first place op center will automatically truncate or delete the existing data before the restore happens thanks app center so let's kick off the restore process this is a good time to discuss a new feature in op center 67 that allows for restore speeds that are three to six times faster when the cluster topology matches the topology of the cluster when the backup was taken a matching topology means that the data ownership on the ring per node matches the data ownership when the backup was taken if op center determines that the topology is the same it automatically and directly loads your data into dse without streaming additionally there is no need for additional compactions or other processes to run after a restore takes place and if you want to restore clusters with a different topology no sweat op center automatically supports that scenario as well it looks like a restore is complete let's verify in data stack studio we'll describe key space cycling and there you have it our data is beautifully restored not only can we restore data to our original cluster but also to another cluster that is managed by the same op center instance we can also clone backup data from another location to a different cluster such as from azure blob storage by choosing a location from the other locations tab when restoring we'll select our backup to amazon s3 to restore from we'll select all key spaces just like in the point in time restore but choose cluster 1 as our target location for the restore now that the restore is complete we should see the key spaces in the data tab for cluster one there's our cycling key space and our hiking key space so with just a few clicks the backup data from cluster two was cloned effortlessly to cluster one in this video we've reviewed how to backup your data to a variety of locations and how to restore that data to the same cluster to learn more about backing up and restoring datastax enterprise with opcenter see the datastax documentation at docs.datastax.com thank you for your time and attention",
