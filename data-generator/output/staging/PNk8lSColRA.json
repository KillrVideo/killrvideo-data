    "text": "this is the c-sharp our and today we're going to be digging into data schema migrations for a c-sharp project in the previous session if you happen to see that I'd started I'd started a project in the first episode where we had our Apache Cassandra cluster and then we had her c-sharp project and then we kind of dug through well we got that to work just just connected with a driver but then I went beyond that and we looked into what a c-sharp project looks like if you create it with the.net CLI for dotnet core or if you create it with the JetBrains writer IDE so in this session I'm gonna go ahead and start looking we're gonna do a little googling and find out what data schema migration tools exist for Apache Cassandra that are let's just say c-sharp friendly preferably written in C sharp right like what's out there to use so without any more chitchat around that let's actually get into looking for some of this stuff go ahead and use Google Chrome to look on Google to find Google results of said information right off the bat let's see here data schema migration is for c-sharp migration C of core code first migrations not super worried about that oh I know we should do we should type in schema migrations for actually Cassandra you know I'm mad at my keyboard all the time so much so that I put my keyboard right beside my mic you know otherwise the keys don't press it's kind of like it is a Microsoft keyboard I got it I got a new one it's pretty nice but yeah I got it got to hit those keys or they don't they just don't press let's add in c-sharp see what we find what is out there so take a look at this one I'm missing c-sharp I want to see what's available out there red gate stuff I want to use red gate I know there's got to be some open source solutions for this stuff schema migration tool for Cassandra topic schema migrations contrast security OSS Cassandra migration I haven't seen that one before let's try reen let's look at that too migrations Cassandra take stacks connect to Sun or with C sharps sample code migrate your data not quite ready to deal with that problem yet this is just the schema that I'm looking into here which is which is basically the tables the key spaces those types of things the data types all those pieces that need to be built so let's see here quick quick tweak bring it bringing the music back [Music] you had to be dogs they're an Apache Cassandra exact city I like the stacked migration of relational data structure to Cassandra well that looks like an interesting read I'm gonna read that anyway data modeling alright we might actually just go with the age-old practice of write it in a script write the migrations in the script our next result was this project asunder migration database migration evolution code for Apache Cassandra sis it's a it's a shell script a maven shell script and source okay there is [Music] so this one's in Java how do we use it Cassandra is our relational database we know this snap transactions write requirements tested with JDK 7 so this has a bunch of requirements to have the Java ecosystem put together which isn't something that we particularly want to have to worry about having if we're writing a c-sharp project API yeah this is specifically about writing migrations in Java it's very very focused so that's not going to work for us trireme [Music] all right what is trying trireme is a tool providing migrations  magic a Saturday sex enterprise it's the solar commands are run using the typhoon invoked CLI tool yes I like the music the music pretty cool it's a pretzel pretzel rocks you just kind of put it on autopilot and let it run you know unless you're trying to find a very very specific specific type of music that gets a little more difficult but otherwise you just let it go and it plays chill string or music that doesn't get you muted on YouTube or twitch etc okay so that assumes that CQ LSH is in the past but will it do question is will it do [Music] that's one approach I guess not sure if I'm a big fan of this particular approach it seems like more work than just writing the scripts for yourself about this this is this is like an actual just a migration itself so we're gonna go with just writing the scripts to start with here unless this is something Paige should say app successfully started your CQ LSH to dump your schema and see what it looks like now this is yeah so not particularly a c-sharp option here again like I said we'll go ahead and start with just start with writer can I hear it when I oh the music yeah I mean I wouldn't play in music if I couldn't hear it I like hearing the music so yeah we're gonna start with writer create a project just a scratch one well it'll be like a hello world and then we'll start adding our schema migration into that we're just going to use scripts etc speaking of which let's see what we have here currently they will build for our last run here we had some docker stuff and we'll want to basically work from that perspective right we should have cqh installed think okay yeah I just tried to to run against the localhost one like you can have Cassandra running it low close but I don't have a node installed here but I do have options and dr. Parker yeah there we go Cassandra images here 3.14 etc so let's put together a little repo of that stuff so we'll start with a new solution we've created get the depository put the solution of project in the same directory yes please hmm I wonder if we should just make this a hundred percent console plays hardcore c-sharp app that's totally focused just on the schema migrations that might be an idea actually maybe we should write a schema migration let's start with let's start with a console app for sure we'll start with a dotnet for console application so we Mac OS or Windows and then we'll start with that net for app - to integrate all this [Music] like recent explorations good name Gracie Sharpie there and naming contact and don't want to put it in Frank's dated builder put it in here so it's a schema now it'll put it in I think I'll put it in the folder right yeah that's what this is saying and then the solution file will be in that folder in the project files for what our projects we have 40 let's get that in there nyan cat gets to work for me [Music] you might have heard that the landing of my Microsoft reactor as I set it down by the mic in the heavy thing is like a rocket ship of water it's awesome [Music] things running get started here [Music] look at that we already have our hello world done wait we didn't even do anything this is the beauty of like Microsoft's c-sharp tuning and ecosystems even when you have something like jetbrains as your key thing which is awesome it's really really awesome so let's hear whether the first thing we want to create is a way to spin up our environment DS right we want to be able to spool up like a test environment so I'm gonna spool up a little work to create some docker pieces and then add whatever pertinent things we need post facto of get the doctor stuff so maybe build the docker images or get some docker images get us something started that we can work against to create this schema and then we'll start with the schema so let's see here missing get ignore from privately definitely one of those oh yeah we want to add it for C sharp or dotnet or something no or they call it I think they call it yeah visual studio let's do it for that that will cover all the dotnet languages and such I think that's really it's just the visual studio should cover everything there's a terraform project that's cool oh yeah cuz it'll yeah what to what to go through that at some point time where I thought there would be a just generate that one I thought there would be a darker one we just got this one so that looks good this should run but it looks like our build is broken for some reason or another just I maybe I just had to open it I had a little thing in the way it's debug and just run a code real quick get our initial build bill completed its executing and there it stops on our debug line so looks like our editor is up and running good so I always like to make sure before I get started that you know the basic fundamental things are ready for us to work with in that context we should get a hello world in our console boom we got it right here so we're ready to get that docker stuff going now in a and a c-sharp project like that in dotnet we have our solution file which is almost always at the root unless you've organized your project in a different way and then we have the migration explorations project inside of that so really how do we where do we want to put stuff my first notion is to put things at the root of the project but that would be outside of the solution file and that's almost not really dotnet like in organization of a project but at the same time our big problem here is what are we really trying to emulate so like the old project style with all this stuff was have your solution file in the root folder directory and then have your project stuff inside of that but with the new way of things in the new way of the world dot net has changed a bit to work around the premise that you may have like docker files and and route repo files that are maybe a directory below the solution file what I'm gonna do in this particular instance though is actually just go here into my editor at the solution file let's see if we can add scratch fall it's her it added it that in there and let's see if we can move it down to the note it forces the getting nor file at the project level so you can go out here show in Foz and what we get so that's at that level but if you go here look at this here's our solution file there's your project file but in here the organization's a bit different well we'll keep we'll keep that set up like that for it that'll work for us so no specific dependencies we'll want to [Music] let's add it can we add a folder here to some project new solution folder let's add a solution folder and see if we put our schema migrations in it this can you just add a file yeah let's add US file here get your data source so here we can take the particular sequel or cql syntax that we want the editor to know that we're using so in this particular case we're gonna be using Apache Cassandra was miss Cassandra here we need to the latest drivers who grab that there we go this classic uses code style default I don't have any other those Styles like explosions some by Mike's all broken [Music] it's not peeking so maybe dry one thing real quick oh it's not selected the right one how about now oh okay my audio actually should be a little better cuz I did just make the local system select the appropriate mic instead of not the one I was using cool alright so back in here let's see what we did thought we just did that Cassandra and then oh I did I not hit okay AHA oh I didn't take the selection well whatever okay so we have that file where did that fall go so let me pick that with the okay let's let's try that again let's do add scratch fall we'll do a patchy Cassandra and then let's save that no oh is that why this is like a in-memory type of thing I guess so let me pick that well then how do you I want to save the file save the file so maybe can I drag it over there nope how do I even get a freakin file in here okay I'm gonna delete this cuz that's just not useful ah I can't I can't delete it that's super frustrating alright JetBrains you're killing me with this thing okay so we'll put a file in here then whatever let's let's create a directory first can I do that yeah Directory schema migrations there we go then we don't want any of that stuff we want a yeah I mean expect effectively a sequel script right that's your 2019 it's a date it is April 3rd inception we'll call it database inception database in Inception cql add that there we go okay some progress here and then what to have our down one so 2019 zero four zero three database decimation I love it it's let's see if I can rename it I forget the frustrating pieces of this here's rename edit renamed there we go and then let's get our actually let's let's create another folder and we'll call it a systemic environment ha big fancy one there we're gonna put that in here and then in here we'll have kind of building this in the context of sort of ironically for some a Moana repo and in this particular situation it'll probably show that c-sharp botnet stuff is definitely not well it's built to be in a mono repo but these other toolings are clearly not built in the context of how c-sharp directories and projects and all that kind of stuff were originally intended to fit together so you end up with some stuff the c-sharp projects simply just don't understand or don't know about schema migrations and then this one will be environment database so this will be our here's a bash script create let's see your dev up shell there we go and add that and also we want dev down there we go and then let's go in that directory and we'll get those change to the right execution permissions cool all right so now we should be able to shoot those mmm sweet and then it here what we'll want to do is let's create an IP value for what we want to assign to our docker container that's going to run Apache Cassandra right so we'll do 172 is usually a good range but let's go with 25 dot Z dot we'll start with 2 as our main IP and we're just going to do a single node at start here then subnet 1 72.5 dot 0 0 to 16 our cider in our gateway will be at 7 2.25 dot zero dot one all right and then I have a network name sir what should we call it we'll call it our migratory C sharping yeah and then our Cassandra node we our main container so Cassie tainer then I think that's about all we need for that so let's then create echo create docker Network so that's that we can give our we create a network so that we in that network we can put our executors container within the context of that network and then actually assign it a static IP so that's the idea there dudette docker network create subnet and then get the subnet in there then gateway will be the gateway we want to set it attachable and then let's give it a network name oops insert it a new line instead of Auto completing an item no enter sugar yes please make it complete items alright so that should get us our docker Network and then we want to let's here we want to create our pachi Cassandra a node at that point since our docker run will name that Cassandra node then we want to put it in the network which will be network name an IP set it to our IP that we put above all right then sir when it's set a variable for more information on the variables and all that kind of stuff on the container image check out the docker container image page you can just type in Cassandra docker and it'll be like one of the first results that pop up but basically this is just it'll know to broadcast from this IP and it sets it internally on the actual container image itself and then we're gonna do it in racket we drop in the background and use Cassandra image for three point one over four all right I think I think we're there then let's just make it do a list for us so we'll do better soccer Network insta let's see I think docker network list and then docker PS - hey you're actually PS should work and let's run that and see if we get our environment up and running it created the network created a node executed showed a list of you oh that's red and my machine actually crashed let me boot that puppy back up real quick it's weird docker docker really crashes some stuff run it in a virtual machine 8o come back up in just a second what did you just see Sonic was there something in particular that uh exploded things I think also the fact that I had I think I had like five other networks already running on there or something that's super weird alright back up and running though the beauty of doing this in a virtual machine right if you roast your machine you can just restart there we go yeah exactly craziness then complete darkness I mean just I glow then blow I need to set up some stuff in the background where it's just my head that would be good on the totality of the universe you should see the black matter fabric on my other stream that background super cool alright so let's just open up this and be careful and tread lightly and see what we got network list oh yeah let's let's get rid of some of these deputies networks Network remove conscious net and then dr. Network remove our migratory see sharpie so it created a network we know that so and then we have dr. images let's see we got in here so what's actually let's let's get rid of the thank you for do that one yeah what is it requires at least one argument I'm just trying to delete it let's do a move let's try that I don't remember how to delete an image now how do you delete an image anyway it's a delicate a nurse to move this one doctor and we'll go ahead and get rid of this one too doctor yes what is nothing's running the doctor he has a doctor move let's get rid of some of these just to make it easier to okay let's let's try that again we'll open up writer and let's see what's up see Sonic I'm in I'm just it's just blackness behind me right even bigger picture me pontificating the darkness of the universe as jetbrains rider starts in the virtual machine in preparation for us to automate the entire universe I think I should do maybe I'll do a whole I'm gonna do a whole episode it's just in that voice the pontificate voice oh it's started I'm waiting for something else to happen and I should know better alright come on open this one there we go slot flow float yeah alright so let's do let's let's manually create the network see if we break something real quick doctor network list all right so we just got the three Oh let's let's play risky let's just do it dev up shadow two eyes dev I'm not in the directory so schema what do they call it I called it oh it's just to make environment database there we go here list let's go with dev all right are we still running Hey look at there alright so something was flaky with having too many too many networks or something related to that but it went sideways as you saw new to my machine so now I have migratory C scharping there sounds like a bird migration right and now we want to okay so we have the node blah blah blah and we're at this IP so let's copy this and actually go over here in the editor and say add data source Patchi Cassandra and we're gonna put that in here port 9 0 4 2 should be good we don't even have a key space yet and we don't really have a user password it's wide open node right ah but no it does not like that so what is I'm gonna apply that just stick it in here yes cancel I'm still working here it's your 3 0 1 4 I mean 3 yeah did I miss something so let's here let's do docker inspect thunder notice cat kasi container there's our IP right pane 1:7 2.25 at 0.2 oh um did I need to what's running right need docker PS right oh it's not running it's absolutely not running but it has that can your docker still confused me sometimes so let's your docker images this docker PS all clear list is your list docker PS - all now let's here created eight minutes ago let's do docker remove gassy container here we go so now docker yes oh yeah that one's going ok let's actually go ahead and do our teardown I'm just gonna grab all this stuff and look in dev down and what do we need we don't really need this this and this what we need to do is oh yeah we need these two things and then we can just say removing dr. Network docker Network remove then network name all right and then let's do move docker container docker the move I can't put in the variable Adrienne not the name saundra node there we go and then just to ensure that it's gone we'll leave those two in there at the end this needs to be PSA let's go back to our terminal dev CD schema migrations it says to make varmint the database alright now we'll do dev down Oh funny so it connected to it and then it realized it's gone okay so our network is gone and our you can verify yep every everything is gone exactly as we want and then if we do give up okay keep your fingers crossed create a new there's a docker container so let's see if it's running looks like it's actually running this time so let's go and see if we can connect here let's let's remove this one yes and then connect to patch Cassandra datasource and we'll go with one seven to twenty five at 0.2 and then let's test the connection aha success so now okay we have environment build up and teardown scripts and now we want to build our inception file which will be in this directory but in and schema migrations from these schema migration so in here we actually need two files too and I just thought about this is a way I should probably be creating files and jetbrains writer instead of through the interface much easier if I just do touch and then the file name unless of course I want to create the fall and have it you know be you use the default file stuff this is live dis sock dis so she I am live coding some data schema migrations for Apache Cassandra we are at the very very very early stages of doing so and welcome to the stream let's see it and we're using JetBrains writer by the way if you're curious which editor I'm using I have a crazy font installed just for the assistant level stuff cool maybe you can help us write some of these migrations if you have any suggestions feel free to chime in let's ears I'm gonna do it up actually yeah per what I just said - I do want to actually use the right click create fall here because I'm going to do is I'm going to create the up script like this which is just gonna be up shell and then we'll have a down one like so and then here what we want to do here is color cql shell sometimes we need to do cql version like three-point whatever it is I'm gonna leave that off this time just see where see if it requested and I'm going to pass in a file and then run these accordingly like I would if there was a specific migration a schema migration tool that I was using to bring this data scheme up and then tear down the data schema so I'm going to do this in order since we only have one file so far for our up put that one in here so it'll be we're running the script in the directory that the files are so 2019 April 3rd database in Inception got cql there we go and then for our down we want to call the other direction decimation like so and then we're gonna run it against the IP of the particular cluster which is as we know 170 2.20 5.0.2 because we made it that area boom so up and down should be ready to go let's see here alright so now mod those for execution alright so let's see what up does Wow so did it just run I don't even know I guess we should put something in here to execute right so it's asking me to change the dialect again to cql there we go and since then it and the scratch file it should just work but in here let's do kind of the the cheat the way to cheat a little bit hahahah is since we don't even have a key space we need to do that and in here it JetBrains writer the the plugin for the database doesn't call it a key space we need a key space that's kind of our main root thing that we're going to put in all our tables in but in here what they call it is schema so we'll call that and you can see down there it understands the appropriate cql stuff to put in the command itself so that that's a big plus but yeah so it's it's a little weird like that though so it's called add schema but it's really you're adding a key space which in a sense is a schema from its context little confusing maybe not confusing I find it a little computer so anyway let's call this what should we call the key space any any thoughts audience on what we should call the key space senator I wish you were yeah I wish when I was first getting into Cassandra that there was a stream to it it is sonic a guy I know I know that specifically just because the plug-in is centered around SQL and building out our relational schema and looking at things from that context right because if you look at say Postgres or my Sikh or something like that where like for instance here the key space you got a system traces key space you would see the database there right and then in the database you would find the tables wherever they're listed under that so you can see the direct mapping when you're using it parallel with some of the other stuff which I do a lot of on my other stream under agent all DSC and spark at some point yes probably not on today's stream because I only got about 10 minutes to go on this one but we will definitely be doing some stuff in the future on DSC and spark and Kafka and like you name it we got a lot of topics in the queue so it's gonna be super cool for the schema though what what should be what should be the first schema name how about I don't know trying to think it stuff how about you Sonic how about this suck or dis so she just soaked so it's distillates what should I call the the first schema here maybe cats maybe dogs maybe something else oh let's call it um hmm maybe I'm drawing a creative blank at the moment maybe we should just go look on Twitter see what everybody's talking about and didn't do that no that's not a good idea is it I don't think so um yeah call it sonic damage oh yeah actually that that's the winner immediate winner so sonic here's another question for you same thing we need dis so what what casing what way do you like to name your key space you like sonic damage or do you like sonic damage is there a suggestion is there way to you know write this stuff based on a particular context camelcase guy so like that or should I do something like sonic damage like that maybe an underscore at the beginning can I do that so I think I'm gonna go with sonic damage like this actually okay so note it leaves you null here right so we need to set the replication but it's a good starting point you can't really execute it from here the other thing that I always like to do when I'm at least when I'm writing the schema is I like to add the if not exists okay because then you can run them indefinitely and you don't collide with stuff that may already be in the database it's kind of it like a safety measure in a way in this part though we don't actually need this through the specific writes I'm going to take that out but I am going to add with replication and get rid of that piece and du equals Rio reflection is not the word replication there it is if I use the thing right it would have given it to me right and then that's your class and then simple strategy - gee I just spell it right yeah looks good all right and then replication factor is going to be do you all know what its gonna be can you take a wild guess that would watch cool well we'll definitely have some of that just so you have it no Reedy folded RF one it's simple ah yeah it's not gonna it won't even create the key space if you if you do that you need to set a replication factor in simple strategy so we're gonna put one because we only have one node that's always started with in our docker container cluster will cover tweaking around with that and like making a multi node cluster on docker see how fast we can crash the virtual machine on etive so that's it's gonna be like half a second just probably but the poor VM I'll run something locally and we'll do it proper run it see what kind of resources were using kind of get a look into that container usage but right now all we need to create a schema is and the schema migrations by Association is this starting point right just one node and we can get to work on it now if I execute this OOP I should get a key space and sure enough there it is right and then I can go in and table you know pretty standard stuff and it gives you the syntax for it helps you build the table like this so speaking of I guess we could go ahead and do that but let me cancel out of that and get in this inception we want the key space right so depending on how you feel about things maybe you want to use casing on it with sequel a lot of people like to go you know all uppercase for the actual characters of the sequel cql or SQL characters themselves so you know we could we could do that if we wanted to keep hitting the wrong button there there we go so like we could leave it like that kind of makes it pop out in a particular way and then of course in statement let's go ahead and create a table and we'll add that to everything so create table and we'll say sonic damage that's here Thun Thun ID and let's see what do we got here see you got these things the types they show up in the interface which is super slick let's say tuned let's go a name and there's a text and let's go to another one will say artist text yeah and then release is a date what else do we want we want some other stuff right Postgres for a large part of my data for the joints Oh interesting it will definitely talk a lot about in this I will be talking a lot about setting up Cassandra and setting up your data accordingly so you know you still have that join data like in Postgres you just have it in your separate tables but you know you need to denormalize it and put it in collected tables in Cassandra to be able to query against it the same way you would somewhat with a joint - of course having the join you just write a select and then you'd be able to do a where clause or something on it but definitely more on that in the future what other column type don't need to add to this thing anything and I think that's pretty good let's let's make a giant I don't want that column I don't want column six we'll do release artist named as the can we set it as a new table key can we do that ah primary artist key we'll do that on it yeah it lets you make all three of them this is the first way I've ever tried to do this via the tool oh look at that throws in the syntax so I guess whoops there it is down here slick loving it oh we don't have a table name though let's get a table name sonic damage artists or maybe we should just call it artists the databases is already called sonic damage I mean to keep the key spaces so go with the artists let's actually go now we'll camelcase this one two artists and then yeah so let's excute that so you'll get here boom there it is look at that beautiful we got our primary key note composite primary key specifically and then we get our teen ID UID let's add this code in here whoops just added it twice and do it up like we want it create table artists and then primary key whoa all right now in our drop our decimation of this it's kind of super simple because we don't need to worry about destroying the tables right we just need to wipe out the Keith space so let's get actually don't put this yet and I'll show you I had that and see it already determined now just because of that key space key word that this is Apache Cassandra syntax right so let's do it drop though drop drop key space sonic damage see it doesn't know now for some weird reason yes use Apache Cassandra don't freak out there we go alright so let's try up here or actually let's try down because we just put all that stuff in there incomplete statement into fall oh do I need to do a let's refresh yep it took it down perfect okay so that's groovy and then we just want to create it back so let's do up no key space has been identified use a key space where it explicitly specify keys oh yeah you have to do this because when we're when we're connected doing it via the console earlier um we had the key space already because we are connected to a specific key space like when I went in here and right clicked let's create this real quick and I'll show you up there we go so now if i refresh this and we look at this we go into the key space and if I right click here it knows that I'm on that key space so even though you don't see it in the syntax it's already assuming you know that we're creating this table here on this particular key space so it doesn't put it there and can execute it because it already has that context oh look at that people hooking up info in the chat it's always awesome when there's like multiple streams of infos happening while I'm doing some in the stream so with that we've we've got our first migrations up in migrations down we've got ourselves we got ourselves a built docker environment with an Apache an Apache Cassandra node running which is super awesome and really we're ready for next stages but unfortunately we are at the end of our hour so tune in next time every Wednesday we're gonna be doing an hour of c-sharp focused around building things on the Apache Cassandra database data stacks enterprise and using the DSC Apache Cassandra driver for c-sharp so we'll see you next time again thanks for joining and uh anyway yeah see you then Cheers you",
