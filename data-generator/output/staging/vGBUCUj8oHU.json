  "description": "Full tutorial + resources: http://bit.ly/tutorials-recipes | A brief guide on how to Setup Your First Java Project on DataStax Enterprise. We have lots of helpful videos on DataStax Academy. Some cover big topics, like Apache Cassandra data modeling and some answer single questions like how do I install DataStax Enterprise. If our big course-long topics are \"full course meals,\" these single question, DataStax Enterprise Recipes are \"quick snacks.\"\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 5\nDataStax Enterprise 5.0, the database platform for cloud applications, includes Apache Cassandra 3.x with materialized views, tiered storage and advanced replication. Introduced in 5.0 is DataStax Enterprise Graph, the first graph database fast enough to power customer-facing applications, scale to massive datasets and integrate advanced tools to power deep analytical queries.\n\nLearn more at http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise and https://academy.datastax.com/resources/whats-new-datastax-enterprise-50\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastax?sub_confirmation=1 \nSite: http://datastax.com \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/datastax \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastax \nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/datastax\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/datastax \nhttps://github.com/datastax \n\nABOUT DATASTAX ACADEMY\nOn the DataStax Academy YouTube channel, you can find tutorials, webinars and much more to help you learn and stay updated with the latest information on DataStax Enterprise©.
