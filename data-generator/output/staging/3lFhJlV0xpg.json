    "text": "and there we go we are ready to start another data stacks Apache Cassandra c-sharp hour today I'm going to be working further on the Cassie schema migrator which is a because Apache Cassandra schema migration tool that I started working on a few weeks back that is going to work with Apache Cassandra and will eventually also work with data stacks Enterprise to do all of the schema migrations you need for your graph your distributed database Corbet's time series stuff whatever you need this is going to be the tool to do schema migrations for your multi model data stacks Enterprise or Apache Cassandra database with that I have popped open JetBrains writer to get started again but before we get rolling here let's talk a little bit about what we have been doing in previous episodes that's always a good question what have we been doing in previous episodes sometimes I'm starting to think that maybe hello ancient coder maybe I should do these every day so I don't forget what I was doing previously but fortunately for all of us involved I do actually remember a few of the things that I was working on last time one I don't really need to discuss it too much but we do have a build and now so then JetBrains writer if I go up and click on these show all files there is all that orange I need to change the background of that we have a new file called as your pipelines it is au mol file and it has just a few little bits here the pool is using in a boon to 16.04 image to initiate do the build and thus build this application for us on in or in the pipeline in the azure devops pipeline the steps are pretty pretty basic there's not a lot going on we simply have a command line step that does a restore which I've named restore and that's executing the dotnet core CLI calling restore against the caste schema migrator solution file which includes all three of our projects that we have in here so we have the Lib test console and all that good jazz and then we just do a build against that solution file which means it will then build all of these three projects now I need to add some other stuff too like actually maybe I should do that maybe I should wait I need to build a test or I need to have it execute test but I'm gonna hold off just a little bit we'll get to test real soon if we pop in here let's actually look at where we're at with tests so we have the test helper which effectively spits a bunch of stuff in a database for us so we can work against that to verify that we're we're initiating some migrations and this is just putting I'm sorry it doesn't spit anything into a database it creates files that will help us create a database is what that does for the test so puts the files out there and then the core Lib tests go through and we verify that the files are there or that they do not exist when they shouldn't exist that they do exist when they should that we get the path list path available etc the idea is we need to pull in all of these files and create a list so that we can work through each file one at a time boom boom boom boom boom as our migration steps in this particular situation let's uh here yeah in the helpers you can see what files I have in here that are named accordingly some of these like these last yeah like this one is one that should be avoided dot text should be avoided only the dot cql files which are the cassandra' files should be brought into consideration right the additional bit is that there should be a date at the beginning then dot something then dot up or dot down to signify that is a migration up to create the database and put whatever pertinent schema should be in the database in the database and then we have a dot down to bring down the database when we're done using it of course this is schema migrations are all about clean development environments to clean continuous integration and continuous deployment tasks vanilla cream it's good stuff so with that said let's run the test and see if we left ourselves some path to this future here so here's our test all listed out as this does and then we'll just as a run unit tests singular or run current session which should run all the tests so I'm going to run that get in there and see see what we're doing there all right we already have a trail there is a catastrophe one of the tests have failed as they sometimes do verify correct number tasks derived from files expected actual oh okay so can I go to jump jump to source that's what I want to do all right result count so test out set up migrations for tests let's go to Declaration to see what this method does for us okay so this set up migrations for tests there should be nine ah and then right below that is new file selection this is the part that we're really testing and it's gonna get the files and the result should have a count the results being yeah list of schema migration tasks the file selection migration path get files should get us a list of tasks put together in their appropriate object instantiation so let's go to the declaration of that and see what we're doing alright so new var files new files ok so that it creates this instantiate an object of type a list of type schema migration task schema migration task has let's look at that real quick just to clarify what we have in there there we go alright so we have in schema migration tasks a constructor which takes a file info object a string the CQL migration type date time order date and it puts it together so basically the tasks fall would be the actual file that has been picked up to to execute it's either a it's some type of valid identified file with the with the name format and everything meeting the requirements so that's a file info and then from there we're gonna read in the contents of the file which will be and should be cql we're gonna designate it migration type migration type is being I don't remember what that is let's go look at it real quick declaration so up down or invalid so it's going to state the direction of creation or destruction of the database and then the order date so these four things should allow us to determine what we want to do and what order those things should be done in alright so we've got that and I'm gonna go back over to file selection directory info is new instantiated object with operation path passed in files to check as a list of the files so we get the files yeah and then we start looping through here and this is where okay should get files to check file name split on that and then we got okay this is where we should step through so let's do this is this profile current session let's do this and then debug that unit test will get moved into it it's kind of interesting that two processes are running I don't know what the other process is that's that's running or even should be running it's just that one tests attempt to run come on dotnet you can do it build that c-sharp running it could go slower I suppose there we go all right so where are we at we got file parts evaluate that sucker so file parts for this one has three so we got the date at the beginning the name of it right the description of whatever is going to happen it's a down migration task and it's got cql in it feel like my is about to crash or something come on being do your thing either crash or quit Burwood here so oh the VM did crash though so that was one thing no telling what it crashes on it's usually some network related thing VirtualBox is not exactly the most stable thing but it provides me the cleanest platform in which to create new images whenever I want to build stuff from scratch without a bunch of cruft on the box so ah but I do think I am starting to feel like maybe maybe I should not use VirtualBox for that maybe I should actually get an alternate thing alternate setup to work with since it tends to provide some instabilities cleaner environments easier to show the audience what I'm trying to show but overall kind of more difficult in certain situations yeah dancing all right here we go JetBrains Ryder open it up schema migrator again so it's it's working on that in some of the background stuff running while I'm doing that there we go so if you've come back thanks for coming back to check out what we're working on here my apologies for the significant break time so hopefully you got a coffee or something during that time and we were on this test TPS reports reassigned to some summer whatever not even worried about it nor the our interpreter feel like I should just take that out so let's debug this test actually files to check so one thing we want to do is win a check so says there's nothing in there so something so first we want to check that there's files to check there should be nine I believe and then what we want to do is we want to determine that it's putting this together right because down here is where we create the object add it to the files to return here write that bit so here we are we're here file name parts we have four just like we did last time we're looking at the May 1st 2006 dot doing other bits down dot cql file the file to check specifically is this one at whatever location that is and then we have files to check something something something ok files file the check files to check so here's this count is 12 and we're actually getting back none there should be 9 there's 9 valid ones we know that just from we nipped because we know our test data alright so let's go to let's step in what is the get not what I want what if there's a debugging bar let's learn more about JetBrains Ryder build okay that's a super annoying song data migration I could just hit this and go to the next one Oh in Hindi Aires all these buttons oh it tells it's okay so f10 is step over and step over f10 step for step over step into is the left 11 shift F seven step helped run to statement force run to statement and then this is show execution point okay so let's do ten that should get us yeah okay so this is parsed yeah if parsed yeah is true charge okay that verifies that it's a date so if if date valid date also has to be less than now and father check needs to be CQL and needs to be up down so that's good where did we end up we ended up somewhere go up down it's false oh yeah yeah okay try parts filenames part filename parts Downton Lane okay so now we're on whoa directory [Music] so on the next file now file name is process but here this file won't be processed okay that one should bomb out actually because yet parsed yeah and then up down is gonna become false because there's no up down we should change far too bull so this is false extension is not right okay so let's do this let's run to here again okay so this one will be down so this should be true now false still false so filename parts down to two Oh file name is this so should be to oh let's do this alright we're gonna check this out so file name parts the part equals semicolon yeah then all right so there's parsed yes or no the part should be the thing that we're trying to parse oh wait what it filename parts that filename parts should be that there we go okay let's debug that I tell you it takes forever to get this stuff launched [Music] what the hell is it doing come on I feel like you got stuck again to do that and let's try to rerun all of them again I'm so bombed out shouldn't have done that it should have stopped let's go here again oh maybe it's let's do that one again that's probably what got the other thing stuck okay so there's our filename twelve files to check as expected and they collected data is there they are over there in this path come on collect data faster jeez okay there we go creation time duh that looks correct then we got directory directory name exists as core extension is CQL saw that looks that looks appropriate so let's step in all right so parsed yeah it's false now but should be true after this right yeah because we've got a date we got down we got cql so it should work so this now what is this gonna be four parts part two should be down so yeah that that is down so then this is down so up down is false so still says false so this this is wrong up down [Music] so I feel like I need to do up down tryparse the part [Music] oh we should do to ignore case - let's do that straining bouillon Tina constrain recitation in turn oh did I do that tryparse I didn't give it the type phooey Cody is do that I like that a little bit better since it shows that okay that might work for us I hope gracious be down and up down is true oh my god did we just fix it maybe we just fixed it folks that's not what I wanted so let's step into this oh my goodness okay we're doing it now so file check father check correct read all text of this file and then the migration goes here which is down now it had to be yet it needed to be it needed ignore the case because the migrations excuse me just to verify it looks like migration is down with an uppercase D so that would have never worked and then the date is five one six is a correct all right so then we're going to bump that down whoa sweet sweet mother Mary craziness something something broke let's look at all the stuff again we're gonna just loop the test start again we'll stop on this and actually look at the value see what we're trying to dump into the object all right so what do we got here we have file file to check that which that's that's the path then full-name is that thing yeah and then migration is down and then a date of migration valid in the given context oh okay let's stop that in treeview to CQ l equals that then let's put in retrieve CQ well let's see where that gets us oh it dork tup on the stuff crap come on try again you can do it okay it seems to be working [Music] it's like I don't know what it looks like looks like okay got a stop right here then let's try that again there we go father check let's see so this is a string let's copy the value and then let's get in there actually let's do this code take a look at the fall so there's nothing in here this is I don't know what this is I don't know what that is so there's nothing in there I wonder if that method bombs out if there's nothing in it we don't text Oh dot read all text opens the file reads all the text in the file was specified and cozy and then closes the file reads all the text in the file then closes the file allopath characters path is null path too long shouldn't get that I'm on Linux how does this work this is your right all lines to fall okay mmm the files are going to need something eventually to test with so let's go let's go actually look at those so the migrations for tests create these where is create these I'll create like create these so Oh fouled out create right here okay so and fouled out create okay so we can do right all wines so then something right all lines file dot write all lines all text rain okay let's do that one instead so then I'm gonna do string and the contents okay it's then so this is gonna be let's call this followed migration one up Oh gracious this gonna become a mess so let's hear what we'll do I think will work unless somebody's got a better idea I'm gonna pick the ones that I want to have data I feel like maybe I should do this via bash outside of well that ain't gonna work with this will work with whatever system whether it runs up Windows Linux or whatever puts files there and then pulls out pertinent test stuff so I really need to do it by file so I think what I'm gonna do is let's create a variable for this one let's do this refactor let's create a variable for it yeah bar sure that sounds good and then this is gonna be refactor rename call this migration one valid up actually fat up valid and this one will be variable and we'll call it migration up valid to be one there we go so then one let's do this then so the path is migration up valid one oh that's not going to be the path though that's going to be the filename and I need the path oh let's do this then let's take this take that okay we'll do this path combined directory got full name right I should get yeah okay and that so then I should get be able to do migration one migration to like so get rid of that one okay so that'll give us contents in there or well once we create here so then so this is class public class test helpers test static migration contents make this a public static class this public static actually whatever I want to make a bar [Music] migration up valid one CQ l equals the stuff public static and this should be named appropriately yeah there was the other one yeah make it read only so we'll call this select astrick from cheese select ask asterisk from cheese whatever those are valid statements so they're good enough for now so and then we need to do that for each one so let's get this four so go ahead and do these [Music] [Music] so this is down valid let's up up up up okay going in another down one heyo all right cool valid path to in-migration about path 3 I almost got them all all right oh what did I do with that one oh I mean phooey whatever there we go and then [Music] the junky ones alright so adding the junky ones down three and then bar migration no-go one equals this apart migration no go to equals that I just moved down here oh yeah okay just just tripping out and then this is bar migration no go three test I don't like this but hey Carvalho thanks for the follow yeah sure thing I'm glad with this initiative - alright so that's that's kind of messy we need to add this stuff down here and then I'm just gonna add junk stuff to do this so this is what I do so we have five up valid for down valid so let's do one two three four whoops four five and then this will be 1 2 3 4 right yeah I want to do four one two three four one is a four five okay one two four five is the down okay so now we can use these to build out the thing based on content and then these shouldn't though should never be do you yeah I do these this is something that I very normally work on this is something I've been working on for a few weeks working on a schema migration tool and I'm putting in some static tests so I can very specifically test for certain things I need some files that have zql in them to be able to test so right now let's your public static read-only string right now I'm just adding as you can see junk cql select star from cheese stuff that would never be in a migration for any particular reason but I'm adding it so that we can have files that have some type of content right that's your two and eventually the this will be each of these would be different not like the same thing like obviously I could just loop through this and add in the different things if it was going to be all the same but I don't want it to be all the same whoops this is the wrong thing so I did down I need to do file dot write all text migration up valid to test state content migration to oh here we go three four falen so I need five of these or there's gonna be five of these I should say five and then down it's for these things and we're all set pretty much there okay so let's get one one two three four three loops three four all right now we can put the content in here as we see fit this is what What's it saying yeah now if I rerun all these you should go back in to verify correct number test tasks derived from files so that it brings up where we were debugging last it should show us the specific piece of data cannot access the file what process cannot access the file being used by a different process that's silly talk let's run all these real quick now a whole bunch of stuffs bombed out oh I bet I bet I know what it is see where I added all this stuff so all these are combined then it adds that and then it file creates a bit I need to yeah if well it's there oh maybe that's file dot clothes was when I spend all lines you found rights specified string to the Father and closes the file oh I know what let's do this let's get rid of the for loop like that and then what we will do is we will add these three o dot write all text I will do my creation no go one test nothing to see here I do file dot write text migration to still nothing to see here either and then file dot write all text this file should be skipped here we go okay and we don't need that don't like that what is this sometimes the I don't like that it's not that's not cool all right there we go yeah I think they are accessing at the same time because I was looping it and it wasn't finishing some of the other stuff was catching up and trying to overwrite it so let's see if that works so you go back to the root here and run some of the other tests are passing though as you can see here so that's good oh look at there alright sweet so we're looking at this directory this file there's four parts to it it's down so this one should get all the text out of it yeah selectfrom cheez-its looking good looking good and we're here migration tasks if I evaluate it has what in it let's see collect data cql oh that looks good that is correct that is correct and that is correct sweet all right so if I just run it now okay so nine found nine recorded that is working it correctly finally alright cool cool cool cool cool so now the question is well we're actually at the end of the hour I added a little extra time there since I had that system failure with the stream we added that test Eric we got that test working let's create one more just so we can leave it broken to start on for next C sharp hour sorry let's hear we got all those added um this does not exist path what are we doing here we were saying oh yeah we need the nine files it's fact public void verify tasks are ordered so this will be basically we'll get our what we'll build build up everything like we do for each test teardown yep okay so we create everything and then we tear down everything hmm and then we want to get a result new file selection here we go migration path get files all right so that would give us the thing we want to test and then we want to that's your result that's just a list of the items see you next time koala trying to get this on a regularly scheduled time so next time it will be until the end Cheers thanks for the follow actually don't know what to do I'm gonna put throw new exception new exception Oh throw new not implemented exception test the ordering of the test test for only up or only down based on call probably want to add the pertinent functionality in [Music] here [Music] are four up up migration wind up hydration called [Music] verify tests are ordered prop really then we need let's ear up let's be down down migration win down migration called and then yeah tests for down my down based on car anyway okay that's good enough so now those a break next time we bounce in here so I'm going to actually jump out of this and open up the terminal you to commit this way so add the changes this should I don't think this is going to break our new build that we have but this is also evident that we need to add the tests to the build which will be interesting how how that will actually work so let's see let's commit adding tests prepared for next session [Music] there we go okay then oops this is Cassie scheme migrator ah well it's right here okay so this is yeah so let's go look at the last one here is it showing the one that just built I believe eight seconds 529 it is it's not 529 it's six five so let's go over here and see where we are with that ah this one's building okay so restore just finished so it should be yeah there we go alright we've got a good build obviously we know three of those tests would fail because they throw exceptions right now however builds good so next time I'm not going to add nothing there next time though I will add add that capability here and I wonder if if we start I wonder if they have more badges for github if we go in here boards work items but not it I don't want to add it oh crap okay so issues ethics status ah status batch there's the status badge sweet so let's add this actually there and then in here we'll do a new item and we'll say fix the build to include tests and then continue and complete the three addition puts additional tests around the file ordering and choosing the up or down files there we go something like that so anyway I'm in there charts so let's go back to github and then let's add that badge in there space and it lets your adding the task items from measure dev ops gotta hate typing that dev ops to the uh read me read read me whatever here we go doing zero I said doing well go ahead move it went over there look at the dirt yeah thanks so then one final peek I just want to see the badge updated there we go doing one item last build succeeded all right sweet so now we know exactly where we need to leave off or where we need to continue next time and we probably need to switch these things over to the other thing if we're gonna use that but anyway whatever that's here to there we'll fiddle with this stuff later for now I'm gonna keep everything here until next time everybody have a good one Cheers [Music] you",
