well so sound looks nice at my side picture looks nice at my side and I'm feeling great because I'm here with you and with all our guests let me see how it goes on YouTube so maybe we can ask our friends there if you can hear both of us clearly then please give us a thumbs up so we know we can go the picture is good if sound is good set that thumbs up and let's start yes thank you thank you sabjit thank you everyone so let's go we are going to cover a lot today so we cannot wait to start let's go then uh so welcome everyone that's uh introduction to nosql databases fundamentals uh with you today uh stefanolatini developer Advocate and data stocks and my partner in crime and uh alexnev also developer Advocate data stacks we work a lot with uh different databases with different applications using different languages e what is your favorite programming language not what you are using currently but what would you like to use if it would be for you to decide please write on the YouTube chat it's always very interesting for us yeah and you know what yeah sorry something very interesting is the difference between the two things you said I remember some statistics on the number of comments to GitHub during weekdays and the weekend and it was a totally different distribution because weekends are as are where you use your favorite language and weekdays are where you use the language you have to use and it was interesting that there is quite a gap between the two yeah yeah our difference indeed is pretty high uh meanwhile we will move on this Workshop consists of two parts first part is theoretical very explained the fundamentals and second part is Hands-On practical because we believe in Hands-On education you have to touch everything you have to execute commands you have to make it running and then only when you really understand how it works uh so for the Hands-On part everything is published on the GitHub we are extremely open source friendly and we try to publish everything we can publish so this Workshop is published materials uh has published materials as well as an IDE we will use cloud IDE in a browser gitbot you can use it for free and it's a great project we use it on all of our educational uh projects if you uh if any of you guys work from you if you are from gitbot then hello thank you for the amazing product uh then uh to avoid uh this just deploying and managing clusters uh what may be pretty challenging sometimes we will use Apache Cassandra as a service after DB is we can say Cassandra is the service in the cloud uh we have a very good free tier so you are very well welcomed here today you don't have to install anything and still you will have to push for buttons right in your browser executing commets stefanon you wanted to say something um I was actually configuring nightbot and uh that's maybe a good a good thing to remind our friends there we have a bot that will help you with a few uh answers in the chat so it will drop links for us and help us along the way so watch out for this nightbot friend it just told you that there is a GitHub repository indeed and you can go there and well we will go back there together anyway so yeah let's start cool next thing uh if you want to brag off your new knowledge well deserve it uh write a right to break on LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever you prefer then you can submit your homework submit your practical part um and answer a couple of questions and you can get this shiny beige to brag on LinkedIn good instructions are coming in the end of the workshop and meanwhile we want to know you a bit better so to get that understanding and you will have to answer my questions during the workshop and to answer those questions uh you should join main team thank you Stefano yeah link is right in the chat or you can use your mobile phone also work and uh you will answer my questions on mainly you can just scan the QR code right here I will give you a few more seconds yeah and the same is the link in the chat will make you join as well and let's start meanwhile main key instructions uh are always on top of the screen then mainly is shown so just go to mentee.com and use the code 44887831 or follow the link of the Night board in the chat and uh let's go so relational database experience at least everyone have some which is great I see I believe some students maybe here which is also great because well those who want to know more usually get better paid which is fine there were someone with zero relational database experience these Workshop may be a little bit Advanced for people with no prior database experience but still try to keep up and if you don't then just save this link video will be available afterwards so you can jump in later and again get over power when this Workshop is over only then you decide what it's over final question your experience with uh non-relational databases okay A little plenty cool many people if you've related with no SQL experience that's amazing usually we don't have a picture like that like we run a lot of trainings and most of the cases like most of the developers no I don't have no SQL experience that is good but it will be easier for you oh well so let's go and nice uh last question okay I will start with the slides and meanwhile you can answer this question what does the database you use the most we will get the results uh soon and now let's uh proceed with the slides first question I want to answer is why Cassandra but not why you should use Cassandra maybe you shouldn't I don't know your situation different databases for different projects but why Cassandra was created understanding of this concept really helps you to get into this software architect mindset because understanding of why it was created answers the question which problems it solves and then you know if it fits your problem or doesn't so I believe every developer wants to become software architect at some point so let's speak architectural a little bit we today going to answer a question how it works internally well yes how to use it of course too you need to know how to use it but for me the most important question is how it works internally you can teach monkey to push the red button if red light blinks that's not a big deal but I want you to be Engineers problem solvers Architects not just uh people pushing buttons without understanding how it works under the hood so we are going to make a dive under the hood today a very important disclaimer uh there are some problems I see in development teams I always try to address so when I say don't try this at home I'm of course kidding please try this at home but if you are going uh to deploy uh to include Cassandra in your stack and your production on your project like make it for your customers then you need to really know a few things beforehand first thing have anyone ever heard about Farm driven development please answer on the YouTube chat I really cannot wait for your answer if you have heard about that or if you haven't write on the YouTube channel or if you can guess what that means or if you can guess what that means so uh fund driven development is the development where architectural decisions are made based on what uh fund companies uh using like we are going to use technology this technology in our project because Facebook uses it or apple or Amazon uses it or Netflix uses it or Google uses it so that's why we will use this technology let's call it fund driven development and that is often a very big problem for um projects don't do that that is a bad you have your own problems Facebook has their own problems so you you need to think architectural to make good architectural decisions sorry in the chat hi Greg is smiling about fungal driven development yes yes hi Greg so please don't do Funk driven development it's not pro is an unprofessional think and Peak Technologies what fit your problems and your problems you are solving next thing have you ever heard of CV driven development CV driven development is even worse CV driven development and then the Venice technology for a project is picked because developer wants to add it into where his or her CV I consider it as very close to crime or at least like fraud over your employer you have to pick make decisions based on the problems your project has so don't do CV driven development and final thing great power comes with great responsibility today you will learn about the more one for most or maybe the most powerful database uh currently existing and you will see soon some stats you like will be interested by some numbers great power comes with great responsibility this means in this context you need to learn how to land your airplane before taking off if you just start to use it as it advances distributed technology you may run and will run mostly probably on production what will heart your project what will hurt your customers and that's not what we need so if you want to fly an airplane you first learn how to land then you take off luckily for you data stack sponsors education and certification for Apache Cassandra so you don't have to pay for that at all and you still can get trained and certified more information is coming to the end of the workshop so it's all started in the year 2008. uh in the year 2008 Facebook reached where first 100 million users I believe there were the first company to reach that magical number now there are plenty of companies who have similar numbers but uh waiver I believe the very first one and that is huge but actually situation the problem we were solving wasn't actually just a huge amount of users it was worse first of all like a little bit of situational analysis they had users all around their world on all the continents before that most of the businesses were strictly Regional whatever e-commerce whatever uh public web application but still it was operating most of them were operating at least in a single continent now situations started to change then fast internet connection I don't know if many of you remember the sounds of uh modem or Whatever USA robotics 56k uh I still remember and this fast internet connection it actually changed it a lot now we take it as a given but in the year 2008 more and more people getting fast internet connection why it is so important the story is before internet connection was a bottleneck doesn't matter how fast your database sorry um there are some people who remember the modem okay good yeah me too no doubt so before doesn't matter how fast your database is still ESP uh internet service provider connection will be the bottleneck but it wasn't the story anymore that totally changed requirements for the database development of a networks yes then much more data than ever before and more and more each year and then finally High availability requirements so uh fast answer fast answer everywhere considering speed of light it's a problem and then uh availability requirements for web application to be available all that time foreign in the year 2008 we tried to find a proper solution for that and we were known so uh Engineers from Facebook started to work on something would later become Apache Cassandra now as we think as architects today we are going first to define the requirements if we don't Define requirements when we don't know what exactly we are going to do and our requirements will be basically those four um groups let's say to focus their full focuses first Geo geographically distributed customers all around the world or at least in multiple regions very often then we are going to have volume and velocity volume may be petabytes of data maybe more and uh amount of operations millions of queries per second up to millions of queries per second up to thousands millions of queries per second now we have high SLA service level agreement so requirement definite requirements for our project response has to be as quick as possible preferably within single digit millisecond so very strict SLA for response time and then finally a very high requirements for service level agreements on the availability so we can go to nine nines if you don't know these nines I think it's like percentage of the time what your project must be available and the measure that in ninth after comma or after punked point in 99.999999999 um so how um how how long your database must be available for the customers what are the allow it interruptions so we want to go to incredibly strict requirements and based on these um requirements we go to design decisions and our decisions based on those requirements will be very um matching what we want to have as a result first we will need multiple data centers multiple data centers so single cluster multiple servers working together but we will be geographically distributed and launched it in multiple different regions that answers two questions at first first we keep our data close to our customers and that helps us to always give a fast answer if your Australian customers should not work with a database here close to Frankfurt right it's not going to be fast speed of light we cannot beat yet uh and meanwhile that is answer also for a high availability requirement then second thing to be able to handle data and for output of any size we have to split our data into partitions we split our data into chunks what solves the problem of scaling and handling of a data of any size meanwhile it brings some problems I don't want to lie to you there is a lot of fun working with distributed Technologies uh yeah but again as long as it gets paid well I'm fine with that then to answer requirements for time we will need generalization because the normalization is one of the most important improvisations improvements you want to implement to get your answers very quickly and we will need partition based routing so we will not search for uh partitional data across multiple servers but we will hit server what stores our data directly without any additional search operations otherwise it will be slow and then finally for a high availability team we need to have replication so our date is copied multiple times and store it on different servers so single server outage doesn't lead to a problem with the data and then decentralization to be explained soon um now for the dozens of years relational databases were dominating uh marked of the databases database Management Systems to be more exact and that is for a very important reasons first of all they are good there are some people saying what no SQL will replace uh SQL latest that's not going to happen relational databases are great um and um they are actually very versatile and their power is what their true multi-purpose so they can play on oltp field kinda and they can play on a lot field kinda also there are better solutions for both oil TP and Ola what is that I'm talking about like I believe most of you didn't map these definitions before oltp stands for online transaction processing uh and those kind of workloads are usually mean a lot of operations per second and very streak requirements that's all about customer facing data and your customers don't love to wait you as a customer don't love to wait if you wait for so long and your business business is not answering when you will just switch to competitors right that's what your clients will do so oltp is customer facing a lot of operations and they have to be executed very fast uh meanwhile on our side of a field is all up workloads olap workload stands for online analytical processing analytical processing means we work with the data we explore data a lot of data we do very Advanced complex queries with thousands of joins and we do also we work with historical data the iotp usually works with live data more or less fresh um principal difference of olap to oil TP it olap usually means what uh those who do analytical processing can wait because via your colleagues they um basically people whom uh get paid for what they're doing not paying to you and if a complex query if a dozens of joints find all customers who have both uh car tires last year and did not vote I don't know whatever watches previews here but then they bought car tires it was raining and their age is more than 39 years things like that like a lot a lot of joins going to be in this query and this query cannot be quick it doesn't have to be so yeah it doesn't end it doesn't have to be so that is the principle difference of all up to oil TP so as humanity went uh a walk evolved over time from the times where everyone was a warrior a gatherer a firmer a hunter everyone was doing the same job basically then we evolve it to specializations and now there are developers uh there are I don't know car Engineers there are many different specializations why because it's efficient exactly the same thing is happening on the database world so we went away from generalization to specialization and Apache Cassandra is distributed decentralized oltp first database why distributed because it's designed from the very beginning to run on multiple servers simultaneously you can tell me what my MySQL does the same and yes and no there is a great word in German language Yin it means so technically yes you can launch MySQL on the multiple machines or postgres or Oracle but they always going to have one single primary server or Master like we used to say and multiple follower servers read-only replicas Cassandra is decentralized what means what each node has the same duties it's traced or different data but each node basically is a master node through democracy everyone decides it's a very advanced technology you will like it then oltp means it's ready for high volume high road food millions of operations over of petabytes of data on a distributed data and that is an advanced thing guys now um it was in the past now we are in the year 2022 what's going on now on the Patrick Cassandra is anyone using it at all our short answer is yes even you using Cassandra even if you don't know it but you use Uber you use Cassandra you uh use any Apple device you use Cassandra you watch Netflix uh you uh use Cassandra you play I don't know World of Warcraft you use Cassandra and so on and so forth basically most of the global company is a using Cassandra at the moment 8022 Apple reported what their deployment of Cassandra includes more than 300 000 of Cassandra servers so it's like a one of the hugest deployments we ever have heard and I believe huawei's deployment is like uh also pretty big they store hundreds petabytes of data and serve millions of queries per second sadly Apple doesn't open too many details about that so we don't know a lot it's top secret uh what guys I really like is Netflix Netflix is very friendly and they uh tell us a lot about how they use Cassandra they have incredible Tech Block you totally have to subscribe and they speak what technologies they use how they use what they develop they're very open source friendly so for example those um not only Cassandra users but also developers because they contribute a lot to Cassandra they participate in Cassandra development Instagram Netflix Apple all those companies work to improve Cassandra and that is great um so and the Netflix reported what on their single most active cluster in the last year we were processing up to 30 Millions operations per second that is a tremendous workload they have multiple clusters but this one is the most loaded if you count it all together it will be much more excellent so I was talking and talking now your time to answer my question so keep an eye on your mentimeter yep uh now meanwhile uh we get the results uh database we use the most oh there are some people using Cassandra that's great um good but we see what my sequel uh  are leading and that does totally makes sense I see Cosmos DB okay I don't see this name often SQL Server Excel that was good okay uh so let's move to the next uh let's let's move to the next question now I will start so first question I'm going to ask Cassandra is best fit for olap's workloads oltp workloads both type of workloads there is a little bit um complicated question I'm also using Cassandra but not sure how to backup and restore if needed Umesh best tool to backup and restore is Medusa Medusa developed by Spotify originally and now maintain it by the last pickle um company which was acquired by data Stacks resume so right answer Cassandra is best feed for oil TP workloads although there are some kinds of olap workloads what can be executed over Cassandra if you just want to watch time series data changes like temperature in this Forest over time for the last year yes these kind of research you can be done but if it's no relational database there are no joints and any kind of the complicated queries with multiple joints querying data from different tables it's not going to be easier so Cassandra is first of all LTD specific very well so let's switch back and let's go yes a search capabilities indeed are very limited so what are the primary features people pick Cassandra um to use in their projects first of all it's partitioning because partitioning makes database capable to handle data of any size literally any size so we speak about petabytes and petabytes and hundreds petabytes of data then obviously read write performance as Cassandra is oil to be specific first of all it is very performant it is extremely quick um healer feature really killer feature is scalability you may uh like there are some people who say like but my postgres scales yes what is the most uh loaded postgres deployment you've ever seen we will speak mostly probably about dozens thousands of queries per second with Cassandra maybe there are some more advanced deployments um but anyway we will not speak about millions of queries per second with Cassandra we can speak about dozens of millions but most of all a real killer feature is linear scalability what that means as Cassandra skills horizontally so you add more servers to get more volume or to handle higher uh workload then you just have to add more servers some years ago Netflix did a very interesting research scaling their database from around 50 servers test deployment but real expensive servers up to almost 300. so they were adding more and more servers to Apache Cassandra cluster meanwhile measuring volume amount of operations per second client rights by node count and look how nice and straight this line most of the databases have overhead on adding new servers when you Auto when you add a server it will not really at some point it will not help your cluster anymore and this line is straight it has this linearity this is totally great feature what is very important for many projects now um do you see this Mark over here that you know that right when you sign a contract or when you get a credit or anything if there is a this Mark in the contract and like small text downwards you need to read it really thoroughly because there may be some uh hidden underwater stones and dangers uh yes there is Cassandra scalability is a shared responsibility Cassandra is a great tool but you need to do your data model right if you don't do your data module right it will not scale and then you may run into troubles it will not scale like that if you didn't do your part of the job luckily for you data Stacks has you cover it so we have three cools like real course around 15 hours I believe on how do you do proper data modeling with Apache Cassandra to make your application efficient if and fast you need to learn some things but again Cassandra developers getting better paid so totally work to me indeed highest availability we discussed already first your data is replicated second your data is replicated into different regions third there is no single point of failure because of a decentralized nature we discussed soon uh Network topology of your data placement so replicas will be put on different servers on different server racks on different availability zones if you deploy in Cloud so that is a very cool technology for if you cannot reach desired availability level Cassandra then there is no database in the world you can Vision basically then a client-side a reconnection balancing and strong retry mechanisms Cassandra drivers by the way originally developed by data Stacks most of them now contributed to Apache software Foundation are also very smart and reliable now operations on a huge cluster can be really exhaustive like I know I can tell you a lot about that so Cassandra is very smart and Cassandra claustro can execute many operations you use it to do manually if our databases Cassandra claustro can execute them automatically for scaling for partitioning for moving data starting in your notes and many many other operations we don't focus on that today because these courses firstly for Developers then Cassandra trademark is distributed to Global deployments but what really matters is all data centers are active there are plenty of databases what can have multiple data centers in their clusters but in most of the cases it will be active passive so in one data center you can write data in read data and in other databases in our data centers you can read only and you cannot write if Cassandra all data centers are active and you can write to them Cassandra is a Apache software Foundation project it's not bound to any platform you can run it everywhere on any Cloud moreover on multiple clouds simultaneously then Cassandra finally my favorite part Cassandra does not belong to any commercial vendors like data Stacks wrote a lot a big part of uh Cassandra but it it's controlled by Apache software Foundation which is a non-profit open source Foundation you already know like if you ever have heard or use it Hadoop spark Kafka zookeeper Maven airflow many other projects they all control it via Apache software Foundation so there are some catches you need to know it's distributed non-relational oltp database it's extremely powerful but it comes with some costs first there are no joints which means a lot of denormalization second running your queries you must know the partition key otherwise you will have to ask all the servers of your cluster I will explain it soon but now just keep it in mind there is price to pay very limited search capabilities in most of the cases you may want to use Cassandra with additional tools like elasticsearch for example or maybe Apache spark if you need to run some analytics over your data and they make perfect team work and there are plenty of Integrations partially developed by data Stacks or by other companies and last thing uh it requires qualified personnel both from development and operations in this case we uh as data Stacks help with that because first we sponsor Education and Training and certification for you developers what makes you make more money and then uh for uh we also have a commercial project like uh Astra DB we will use today which is uh like removes these operational headache from companies and our Engineers will take care of iterations question [Music] now you answer my question and we will see how good I was in my job how do you scale a Cassandra cluster scale up by upgrading servers scaling out by adding servers Cassandra cluster does not need scaling okay time is almost over and the answers are coming time is up right uh yes Cassandra scales horizontally by adding more servers and there are two people answer it Cassandra cluster doesn't need scaling first of all thank you we really appreciate it but uh well we wish that would be great but no sometimes you need to skip because on the cluster good news it's easy yeah uh and let's get back then um introduction to Apache Cassandra we discussed it with features but how it all works all servers are created equal what does that mean traditional architecture of database Management Systems follow Master Slave or leader follower architecture and that means what there is one server you can buff write and read and there are other servers you can read only first of all so these architecture is not bad per se this architecture for many kind of problems for many kind of architectures and projects may be a good fit why because it logistically very simple it's very easy to organize these and it's very easy to manage these so there is a plenty of benefits but also some downsides would make it unavailable basically for our project for Apache Cassandra first of all it introduced single point of failure as long as your master is out you cannot do your work anymore you are your application basically is down second it's hard to impossible to scale for rights scale for reads is easy launch new server and go have fun launch new follower and you have your scalability for reads but try to have it for rights no fun only vertical scaling vertical scaling gets expensive very soon and vertical scaling also at some points just not possible as you cannot have multiple Masters on different regions right having it as a single cluster and finally application needs to know where to write if you try to write a follower you will get an exception like man are you done uh don't try to follow her I can do it then Cassandra is peer-to-peer masterless all notes communicate with all notes each note is capable of answering your query that doesn't mean what each node store all data it's not possible we will speak about petabytes of data like really a lot of data so they displayed it into chunks and store it over different servers but even if you ask note what doesn't store your data it knows which one stores and it will redirect your question combine all the information for you and give you the answer even if it doesn't have your data so no single point of failure it scales both for rights and reads because every node is capable of executing write requests or at least coordinating write requests if it's not replicant and finally application can conduct any node uh which gives us again this High availability thing in case of failure just ask next note what your driver will do for you automatically question [Music] so far you are doing good like many uh good answers and say thank you uh Jose uh how many masternodes for a Cassandra cluster minimum frame free per data center Fuller replica divided by free no master notes at all foreign thank you everyone for answering my questions I love it time is up and yes right answer Vera no master notes you see there are still friends people who cannot believe in that they're so use it to traditional architecture no people know there are no master there is no definition of master or if you take it differently you can think of each note as a master note uh good so let's move to the next one oops looks like I occasionally launched your next question oh my God sorry guys I pushed the wrong okay yeah let's stick to this I will ask it again so data is partitioned very well what does that mean so first of all in Cassandra data organized in tables there are plenty of people who think what nosql is schema list again  nosql tries to group multiple very different kind of databases graph databases white column databases key value databases Ledger databases they are different you don't group them so the definition of nosql is pretty harmful if you ask me but so yeah yeah I mean that I mean that uh I really uh three hours Workshop introduction to nosql we speak about different databases we create schemas we work with tables we Define like very strict requirements for our schemas three hours later I asked students is nosql schema less like every verb student answers yes no SQL schema less where are you listening to me at all like come on man yeah um the idea for me is okay we will speak about that next time we meet uh is uh in Cassandra Cassandra schemaful actually even is not stimulus  is a flexible schema uh it's just marketing but okay uh sensors by network is our table our data we are going to work today uh we will speak about multiple sensors measuring temperature and sending these results to our database so in Cassandra we work with tables and that straight table sensor by Network which will have network name like state for example or area or factory with sensor is deployed then a sensor ID and temperature current temperature why integers it's actually must be flawed I guess but okay let's say integer so that is a table we are going to work with and that is a data center of seven servers uh Cassandra data center which stores we stable how this data is being stored data is organized into tables and uh data store it as distributed tables so basically you see each server is responsible for part of your data and then um as you can see here each server can store one or many partitions and each partition has part of your data how that works idea is it's a key based partitioning so when you create a table you must Define partition key we will explore more about partition key in the end of this session but for now you just need to remember what partition key is the first property of a primary key and that defines exactly how data will be partitioned so here you see I have a network as a partition key that means what records or rows with the same partition key will be grouped together Alabama California Kansas and so on so idea is pretty simple you split data into chats how it works internally again you are engineers um and you need to know how it works idea is a partition key value is being passionate by a partitioner which uses currently in modern Cassandra it uses more more free hashing algorithm more and more free hashing algorithm um is a very simple thing it takes whatever value you give to it and generates an integer value out of a pretty wide range and so Alabama becomes 59 Idaho becomes 12 and so on and then in your data center each Cassandra node is responsible for range of those tokens so for example we see here what first server is responsible for a quarter of our uh because we have four nodes second for quarter third for quarter four for quarter approximately notice usually those numbers are not like 59 or 12 or 45 of course usually those are huge huge integers like very long but uh in this case we just simplify it we will stick to short numbers I came from 1 to 100. um so when as you could guess it's very easy already to understand what if Alabama becomes 59 and then 59 belongs to a third note because it's uh the range this node is responsible for the token range which token fits in and uh 12 so Idaho goes for a four to the first note and Hawaii 45 goes to the second note and fourth note is currently unemployed let's say stores no data on this small table um Yuan asks uh high on by the way um question for aqueous what was the partitioning algorithm before murmur that is a really advancing a good one yes uh was it by toward direct I don't remember at the moment here like uh good so why partitioning is used again people this algorithm this thing helps us with scaling a lot but it also brings a lot of problem we will discuss soon so why to introduce no problems and new problems because we have one bigger to solve we have to be able you remember our limitations uh defining requirements from the very beginning we have to be able to handle data of any size what is the Big Data big there are many of scientifical definitions but I like the simple one from more of Applied field big data is a data what does not fit a single server simple as that maybe you don't publish a definition like that on Wikipedia right but it's pretty easy to explain so splitting our data in chunks we can spread them over more and more and more dozens hundreds thousand servers adding more when needed that's why we do partitioning to handle data of any site which now there is a very interesting mechanism called a token ranges recalculation uh the idea is Cassandra notes on your data center responsible for parts of overall big token range we see here what we have four nodes data center which serves for every node responsible for approximately a quarter of your data then let's say we work at e-commerce company and versus Black Friday is coming or Christmas sales are coming or whatever interesting thing and coming or via Netflix and Via releasing last episode of Game of Thrones and we know what our infrastructure at the moment is not capable of handling the peak lot what comes soon when we just launch a new server and add it to the cluster say where is the cluster go join it then all operations basically happen automatically uh you need to give your permission for bootstrapping but that overall all the operations are automated new note joins the cluster what leads to a token range or a calculation before every node responsible for a quarter now every node is responsible for approximately 20 percents right that leads to data being streamed to a new note and as a result as token ranges are narrower each node is responsible for smaller amount of data and we are good we can process more operations now with that then finally last episode of Game of Thrones is uh streamed everyone is disappointed no one is watching Netflix anymore and we don't we have too much servers we are paying for them Netflix aggressively uses AWS and they're paying quite a lot for their infrastructure wherever are some crazy numbers so when we go we want to uh downscale actually we don't need so much and we tell to Cluster hey I am going to take down those two servers then token ranges will be recalculated again each server will be responsible for approximately a third of your partitions uh token ranges sorry token ranges and therefore data will be streamed to a new replica servers you can take down to servers done and if any of you is connected with operations on the databases and familiar with sharding for example or operations over relational databases they know what usually any operations of a server may very often mean downtime and that's not a thing with Cassandra all operations are live database stays uptime all that time so it's not interruptive and it's automated what I like the most I am a lazy engineer if database can do my work for me that always make me happy question I hope I can request this question again yeah looks like I can how data for a table is distributed each server has all data one table on one server by partitions by charts uh meanwhile okay let me first transfer this question oh thank you Stefano I see you guys are already owning all the questions all right yeah I mean there is much to say but probably that's a bit of a side Advanced topic for now for today but I'll mention one side thing in the chat uh in short uh streaming process doesn't interrupt plus cluster performance I there is a question of sedan uh Deepak when the rebalancing is happening is the cluster usable or will perform less efficiently so cluster is usable uh but if you for example have 10 servers in your data center and you launch 10 more then there is going to be a lot of data shuffling and obviously nodes will be busy bootstrapping streaming and so on and so forth so the overall idea is you better launch OneNote at a time or two nodes at a time one by one and only the note is ready you introduce a new one um you can try to do more but maybe potentially dangerous or cluster busy with rebalancing uh that is a short uh answer to this good so most of you made it all not most of you all of you people you are totally lovely thank you so much that's great let's get back then yeah there's also a nice question about difference between partition and sharding that's a good question now that is a great question yeah who asked it sorry who asked this question about this sit down again okay oh man you are rocking with your questions thank you so the idea um they answer the same problem a problem is when you have uh too big data what doesn't fit single server you have to split it in the chunks you have to put them into different servers so we answer the same problem but answer is differently um sharding on relational databases is very painful manual downtime process when you manually identify charts Define them move them databases down nothing works it slowly it requires a lot of operations in your participation and that usually happens in the end over time your data evolves you have more and more data then you go sharding um one of the easiest and best answers of when you should consider Cassandra is if you do sharding on relational database then you should consider Cassandra already um now partitioning is a native from the beginning by design a process what is automated and executed automatically yes sharding is really painful even with non-related even with no relational databases like yeah right by the way people don't uh miss this chance with us is our own plots which is one of the best Cassandra experts and the book after um I don't remember the name Aaron what was the book you wrote about Cassandra and will you work on the next Edition for Cassandra version 4 releasing presently there are some changes major changes or you know what I have better idea there are some major changes coming in Cassandra version pie five which comes in more or less August next year so uh think about uh updating it uh next year I would say like writing one right now it means just you have to rewrite uh that uh in next year well if it sells it's still good yeah so I keep asking questions yeah that's a good excuse to mention that uh there are a few very cool features coming for Cassandra in the mid near future so stay tuned yeah good so first thing I want to mention here is data is replicated that is a very important thing uh without duplication basically you never can have proper uh reliability without replication you cannot have your database being available all the time so that's not a question to us we need to have the data replicated there is no other way to get data available all the time uh there is a question about version five um no um a release uh cycle is changed for Apache Cassandra after a very slow release very late release of Cassandra version 4 uh community and PMC uh the committee of nabash Safir Foundation working on Cassandra agreed on the release cycle of B weekly so it will be fixed time flexible features uh not like before and we expect five zero uh be released in August 2023 actually there is no uh decided itad because you see we need databases used in production by Giants and data needs to be consistent everything have to be extremely stable so we can adjust release a new version as so many projects many projects many front-end via JavaScript libraries being released daily we cannot afford that yes but there are easy transactions coming in Cassandra version 5 and that is absolutely incredible here the weight yeah absolutely worth the wait yes yes uh yeah and apple wants to have five zero basically tomorrow yesterday good so let's go enough of discussing of the future data is replicated what does that mean for us uh there is a thing call it replication Factor replication factor means count of the nodes used to store each row or better to say partition if partition uh when you create a key space and key space is just nothing but a group of tables uh so when you create for example schema in postgres you can create tables in this schema so key space is basically the schema of Cassandra um so key space when you create a key space you must Define three things name pretty obvious replication strategy and replication Factor first of all easiest is a name I don't want to stop on that then replication Factor replication factor means how many copies of this partition I'm going to have per data center in this case you see I have United States West one free replicas and United in Europe is two five replicas like it's going to be more hostile environment and I want to have higher reliability better now a networked apology strategy is interesting thing uh so class of verification there are two possible classes at the moment simple strategy and network topology strategy simple strategy is good for your laptop not bad for anything else simple as that the network topology strategy is a strategy what understands quite a surprise Network topology right um so networks apology basically is that apology of your network I'm being so obvious today with servers in different server racks on different data centers or if you deploy in Cloud so it will be different regions different availability zones idea of the networked apology strategy is to keep your replicas away from each other uh easiest explanation is like when you do a backup of your hard disk you are not going to store this backup on the same hard disk right otherwise it is hard days disk is destroyed you will have no access to backup it just makes no sense if you make a backup you store it in different plates same with topology's network topology strategy it puts replicas of your data into different places so if you have free server racks it will put one replica on each uh rack because servers interact tend to fail together because of power outage or network outage for example for clouds I said the same goes to availability zones uh then a very interesting question catch a question if this statement is uh correct and there are no mistakes and it will be executed successfully based on this statement tell me how many data centers I have how many data centers I have based on this statement Stefano please give no hints you know the answer I want uh to see some answers on YouTube chat foreign busy writing in the chat actually but I got a narrow writing a an answer from yes so there is no simple uh like each problem has simple obvious uh quick wrong uh answer uh story is the right answer is at least two because I can have more than two data centers I can have a dozen of data centers but you know there are some laws or regulations in different regions what you need to store data of your for example German customers in Germany gdpr uh same I believe goes for some things in the United States and so on and so forth so I can have more data centers but in some of them I may not be allowed to store this data or simply I don't need it if this data is used only by my European Branch I don't want to have copy of this data in the Australia maybe in the United States for reliability purposes but not in all of my data centers I just don't need it so right answer is at least two good so with replication Factor one I'm going to have one partition in unique way uh the replication Factor two two nodes and recommended replication factorial replication factor three um I know some scenarios for companies go to five but usually that means very hostile environment with unreliable Network and in general the commanded replication factor is free so each node each sorry each row or to say partition better store it three times obviously that leads to a higher disk space consumption but you know what disk space is cheap what is priceless is your reputation so we speak about companies what really care about Fair reputation then joining control together partitioning that it's very easy idea just each server is responsible not for single token range but for multiple token ranges for different partitions so for example with replication Factor 2 This Server will be responsible for its own token range and token range of its neighbor and so on and so forth uh and now how it works then data arrives like you write new data to your database it gets to one of the servers and This Server becomes a query coordinator so it will coordinate operations for this query this server is not a replica server for this partition this one this one and this one are and the idea here will be what credit card generator will then dispatch free rights to free replica servers to store this data and then data is delivered and we are happy and everyone is happy very important thing each Cassandra node and each even Cassandra driver or at least most of them understand data allocation in the cluster it's called a token aware so they understand token ranges and which server responsible for which token range so your application can contact literally any server and then this server will work as a query coordinator and dispatch your query to a proper servers but under normal circumstances driver will conduct replica node so this situation usually never happens because usually your driver your application will contact not this blue node but one of those three doing round robin balancing like uh recently I was helping some people on a Cassandra chart in Telegram and uh we occasionally found out what one of the Cassandra users bootwear Cassandra cluster behind HR proxy to have round robin balancing and that is a very sad and disappointing disappointing situation because people just killing their own cluster disabling have a token all the token aware optimizations just because we don't read documentations you don't need a proxy balancer in front of your Cassandra cluster Cassandra clients mostly wrote by data Stacks will do their own wrong Robin balancing using token aware optimization so you do not have need to have any age approxy or nginx or whatever in front of your password it's taken care of already good and then final thing date is globally distributed but we discussed it already so I don't want to stop on that for so long data is placed on multiple regions or even multiple clouds uh Stephano yes I think that's your turn now some buttons so let me switch to your screen and I will drink some water now nice [Music] uh are you sharing your screen um yes I am I think oops it should be all ready okay so uh okay so I'll keep an eye on YouTube to make sure our our faces are not blocking the view too much because yeah so you've been seeing uh a lot of uh how Cassandra works and how awesome it is I think now it's time to play a bit with it right so oh thank you for moving around okay okay so uh maybe we asked our dear nightbot to drop the link to GitHub again yes so please keep a tab open on that one oh you did already yes as we mentioned already um we have a nice repository with all instructions to go through this practice yourself and also find and more information the slides deck it's all there so um bookmark this for later use as well okay so there is a lot of stuff in this readme because that's also intended for uh faults who come across the readme without the workshop that's why we are going to skim through parts of it and do the practice but first you need a database so what we do it would be a bit complicated for you to just uh in the small time of this Workshop to just start your own Cassandra cluster so that's why today we are going to use Astra DB asterdb is well we try to make it very short s3b is a software is a database as a service ready for you in the cloud managed for you by data stacks and it is serverless that means uh that it's basically built on Cassandra so it works as you can interact with it as you would with your own Cassandra installed in your own machines but you don't have to care about operations maintenance provisioning the servers and all that so it's and because well it's also serverless so um actually it's very convenient also in terms of resources speaking of resources the nice news is that astrodb is gives you a very generous free tier so for example today I will show you how to create an account and then a database there and you will just stay in the free tier which well it's not only just for playing around but it will be well it will give you the possibility to actually run even small production workloads no problem that's because it's a few tens of a million of operations per month for free and also uh quite some storage as you can see here in the written it's all explained so that was by way of introduction and the first thing I suggest I hope you are all with me in the readme I'm scrolling down to start hands on here and the first step is we create our database instance so the first thing is you see this big orange button this is where you would be led to Astra DB to register to create your your insta your account uh you can use user password or you can log in with I think Google or GitHub as you wish now of course I already do have an instance and an account so I will skip this step let me and I'm going a bit slow because you will have to just provide a few values in the field when you register but in the meantime I made my window over GitHub on the side so I will start showing you what happens when you are logged in in astrodb so please go ahead click on this button probably in a opening a new tab to keep the readme available and you will have to register to Australia B and when you're done this is what you'll see you will see the astrodb dashboard and probably there will be no databases yet you see here no databases yet and also here well this will be a list of your databases but of course you will not have any as I am now showing simply oh let's get clear with the messages so uh maybe it's a good time to ask you uh if you manage to create your strategy to your Astra account uh maybe you can give me a thumbs up in the chat we will wait a couple of minutes maybe something like that um so again we are going to play a bit with the database today um of course there is much more of the great sedan you're done so you thank you I'll wait another 30 seconds or so I mean registration should be pretty easy Jose great well done okay so um there is a lot you can do with Astra actually there is a lot you can do with Cassandra and of course today we are just scratching the surface but as a nightbot periodically reminds us we have weekly workshops which cover a lot a lot ways a lot of ways you can use Cassandra a lot of ways you can interact with nosql databases and even we also touch on even other Technologies from AI to airflow and and back so please you can if you are interested you can join us in other workshops and there is always something more to learn okay so um I'll assume we can go forward and if any of you are still having trouble creating the account please uh maybe reach us in the chat or just uh go to the to the readme in asynchronously and then reach us on Discord or anything to discuss and or to troubleshoot okay so this is your your main Astra to be Astra dashboard and you see there are no databases so I'll bounce back and forth with the readme just to have the instructions it's time to create a database okay to do that guess what there is a nice button create database so if you click on it you will be asked a few Fields how do you want your database to be named and today I suggest you to stick with the standard names and usually for workshops we create a database called workshops uh keyspace there was a question in the chat so keyspace as Alex said is just uh well it's a bit more but let's say it's mostly a group of tables so it's a logical place where we will be creating a number of tables to keep them grouped we assign them to a key space and today the the key space is called sensor data I'm spelling it right yes as you see here in the readme please call your keyspace sensor data and now there is the last part asked where do we want the database to be created for you so um if you have preferences if your application API whatever server are going to live in a given cloud provider you probably you're probably better creating the database in the same provider and hopefully in the same region for Optimal Performance or you can also have multi-region deployments that's not a topic for today but uh let's stick to Google Cloud because this is what the free tier uh offers open to you uh on a freshly created account so please stick to Google Cloud here provider and pick any region you want and of course again some regions are not open uh to a freshly created free tier account so I'll stick to the US East one which is available so we are ready database name keyspace name and then you choose provider and a region here then of course you create the database with this button create database here on the right let me click it and it will take maybe 2-3 minutes to create the database in the meantime you can track the progress of the creation and you will you are also given something called token well that's a very important piece of information for you for your application because the database is out there in the cloud and you need some credentials to access it to any operation with it so this would be your way your key to access the database from let's say your drivers or your application whatever it does but in general you at this point we say keep your token store it in a safe place and blah blah blah and of course that's something we suggest today in case you later want to go the route of writing an application and whatnot but I think today's practice is just done here in the browser and it's automatically done so the connection to your database is provided uh behind the scenes so today actually you don't even need this token but maybe it's a good idea to store it for another time that being said you will be able to create as many tokens as you need with different permissions and configure the the power they have but that's again not the topic for today uh in the meantime I see my database has become active so I guess many of you also have your database active maybe you can tell me as much in the chat if your database is active then I feel better in moving forward at this point let's see okay very good so Alex where do we stop with this part of the practice uh I think we are done okay okay so okay good to go uh actually this is where we stop and we jump back to the slides for the second part of the practice we will make sure your decamations are all active yes so in case you have to catch up sorry in case you have to catch up the instructional here and we will resume from here with our database ready to go I'll let me just click go to database which brings me to the dashboard for my newly created Workshop database and we will start from here back to you Alex thank you cool so give me a moment [Music] and perfect so uh most of the things so with today we speak about open source Apache Cassandra so I don't want to stop on Astra for uh too long but the general idea is um Astra is a software service platform currently featuring kapasha Cassandra as a service and Apache Pulsar as a service most of you may uh never met Apple Sarah before you can think of Pulsar as Kafka on steroids um yeah I believe that's a pretty well comparison and it has very generous free tier so you can use it for your actually even small to like small production workloads totally free and it has zero look in so you can go to AWS or Google Cloud still using open source Technologies but managed by cast professionals as uh currently data Stacks consists of one of them it has one of the best Cassandra teams in the world that's for sure and the same goes for for pulsar but anyway let's go further and we will speak a bit about a distributed architecture and now it's your turn to answer what is the biggest problem of replication what is the biggest problem of replicated data biggest problem of replicated data is increased disk space consumption more Network transactions or potential cross node inconsistency what do you think that's always a good question to ask yeah and I'm all curious Okay so first of all I tricked you those questions technically all valid those answers those options to answer are all valid they all are a potentially big problem of replicate data we've replicated data you have increased disk space consumption you feel me replicated data you do have more Network transactions you still have to write to three different servers for example but the biggest problem is potential cross node inconsistency indeed you see deep space like there was a very good phrase if you can solve the problem with money it's not a problem it's an expense or those are costs idea is Cassandra is usually used by projects but Health would have money and then these increased deep space consumption is just a question of some zeros on the bill and they can handle that reputation is priceless disk space is cheap but potential Cruise notes and consistency can be a real really really really sneaky problem so let's talk about that what is the potential cross node inconsistency the story is when you have a different servers storing the same data you need always to update information all of them if Network operation never reached one of the servers it may get the sale data outdated information and that's something we have to avoid you don't want uh your bank account to have inconsistent data right so Cassandra is used by many banks how do they handle consistency first of all it's a problem of each and every distributed system or not necessarily distributed even if you have your cash if you introduce cash for a single host application you still may run into the problem of a consistency cache to real values location validation can be very very tricky on the big deployments on a distributed cache and so on so Cassandra features layered self-defense and there are multiple ways to answer this problem first mechanism what comes into the game is hinted handoffs idea of a hinted handoff is very simple then query coordinator writes data if one node doesn't answer query coordinator will store so-called hint or hint of handoff it's a persistent data on disk so it will survive a restart of the node and as soon a server learns what this node is recovered and will be delivered and that happens fully automatically our query coordinator storing Kindred handoff knows what node recover it because nodes are communicating all time in between whereas the mechanism called it gossiping so every node no state of their neighbors as soon as it knows what node recover it hint will be delivered and then consistencies recover it and you can wake up in the middle where you can wake up in the morning find out what your server was out during the night but now it's recovering and all the consistency and all the data is recovered and it's happened automatically and no one was uh waking you up in the middle of the night go save our database application is down customers are running away it happened with me many times and I totally love with our databases and I just adore this mechanism in Cassandra I really adore it people uh so yeah but that's not enough because uh we need to better safety on these and there are multiple mechanisms first one tinted handoffs I explained it already oh good question I believe Stefano will answer so in short there are other uh layers of Defense first of them hinted handoff's mechanism we already discussed it but that's not enough uh there is a second mechanism repair on read we will discuss soon but those two happen fully automatically it's Cassandra job so I don't want to stop her for too long on them we still have a lot of things to discuss then repairs is an admin job as today's session is for developers again we will not talk about repairs but the simple idea of repair is what plaster Compares uh data versions in over the cluster and if this is what one of the nodes is out of sync it will recover consistency by repair if you are responsible for database operations and you need to know more about that I strongly recommend a Reaper which is a great tool for Cassandra Reaper Cassandra you can Google it and that's how you manage repairs or use Astra and then you don't have to worry about that so consistency levels is something uh what developers are responsible for so we will stop on consistency level as it's very important to understand but before we are getting where we need to talk about whom to blame and don't blame me I did nothing wrong it's all Eric Brewer to blame about because he created the CP theorem and now nothing works as we want it to work uh if any one of you have ever heard of cep theorem before please write something in the chat I don't know maybe thumbs up or okay or anything so we will know what where are people aware of that uh meanwhile I want to explain so cap theorem operates three features and we need to discuss those features it is availability consistency and partition tolerance availability is the simplest one to explain availability means uptime you ask me a question you get the answer your system is up is available if you doesn't get the answer your system is not highly available uh then consistency we discuss it already consistency means no stale data if you ask something you get the most recent value database is consistent if you ask something and get outdated information your system is inconsistent then partition tolerance is the most misunderstood concept of cep so let's stop on that for a moment many people think well so first partition tolerance is ability of the system to survive Network partitioning so to understand partition tolerance we need to understand Network partitioning first what is a network partitioning please what in this case partitioning has no our partitions were mentioned it before for Cassandra but the idea of a partitioning is uh simple there is a group of your servers in the data center what are up and available and they cannot be accessed by customers but they cannot access second part of your service in a data center and there is a second group of servers in your data center what are up running and available to customers but cannot be accessed by group a and cannot access group a like uh right here group a up running available group b app running available but you cannot communicate in between but customers can communicate with a group a or group b and that first of all very often misunderstood idea people think what group b is just not available for anyone if Group B is not available for anyone it's called a how downtime simple downtime because of the network issues that happens people think what downtime is the worst what can happen with your database but that is a mistake because there are more dangerous things than just downtime some of you may now wonder like what do you mean there are things worse than downtime downtime database not working application is not working customers are crying managers are swearing and like everything is on fire what can be worse very easy people split brain can what is a split brain uh split brain is a situation for example in a relational database it would look like that imagine we work with a relational database we failover enable it failover is a mechanism of a re-election of a new master is previous Master is unavailable then let's say that was a master and that was follower follower folder folder folder and then there is a network uh partitioning so they cannot communicate this group behaves as before Master follower folder folder these group of two followers enables re-election and they create a new muster and now this is a master if your application starts to write to this guy you are deep in troubles because now part of your operations served by this master part of your operation surveyed by this master and let's call it a split brain and there is no way to handle it automatically so let your application run like this for a couple of hours or days and then you will spend months trying to understand uh what operation should be executed how to merge them there is no tools basically to handle suggestation it all will require manual job for a high level audit applications like whatever Apple deployments whatever deployments basically any big Company E that is a real problem so split brain is a disaster much worse than downtime you better go down time than split brain okay so when partition tolerance is viability of a distributed system to survive Network partition done with that now let's go to the theorem theorem by itself CP theorem is a very simple idea the job can be done quick and in a good quality and cheap and you can pick any two of them a job can be done in a good quality and quick but it's not going to be cheap and if job is done cheap and quick it's ain't going to have a good quality same with cep theorem in distributed environment in case of emergency you can have only two guaranteed qualities out of three and as we cannot sacrifice partition tolerance by no costs uh then we basically speak about AP databases highly available and partition tolerant and CP databases consistent and partition tolerant CP but not highly available and there are some solutions for CP databases there are some solutions for AP databases now people often say what Cassandra is AP database and that is that is a mistake again Cassandra is configurably consistent so Cassandra can be in CP or AP mode for different kinds of data depending on the data you have we have two primary tools to configure a consistency there imagine having a replication Factor one replication Factor one brings you here you don't have any replicas means you are consistent but obviously as soon as this replica goes down on which may happen totally then you don't have any access to this data you cannot store you cannot retrieve you are not highly available you are CP so if application Factor we can set to CP mode but uh there are another tool to understand consistency level what is the consistency level consistency level is the amount of acknowledgments you will wait before database will dispatch the response what are those acknowledgments then you write a datum you can specify consistency level one that means what if replication factor three we will wait for one and only one answer from the replica that means what we still of course store data to all three replicas but as soon as first of them answers we immediately dispatch answer to a client so we this kind of a fastest way to store your data there is only one way faster which is any but it's too aggressive so I don't want you to risk um consistency level one will wait for one confirmation as our uh write queries usually go directly to one of the replicas one is considered to be done as soon as replica persists with data so it's kind of a fastest why kinda because if all nodes are running fast then all of them will answer more or less quick and then there will be no difference if you wait for all confirmations from all replicas all your weight for one but let's take a look at our consistency levels when you write your data or read your data you can say quorum quorum means majority so half and a little bit more of the replicas as I have replication Factor free that means my Quorum will be equal to of course so that's why we usually speak about replication factor three five so a number like that because Quorum is cheaper um and then we go for Quorum that means what we will wait for two confirmations with replication factor three so most of the servers got my update and then finally with consistency level all uh we will wait for confirmations of all of replicas so three acknowledgments or free confirmations from all replicas what I have and now you may say oh yeah I love consistency level oh I want my data to be always consistent so I will uh go for consistency level all always and there is a little problem with that CP theorem is not canceled you know as you go uh for consistency level all you bring your database into CP state uh so okay it's consistent in Partition tolerant but not highly available anymore and as soon as you wait for all confirmations but one server is extremely slow it will be very low a very slow or if one of the servers is down when you get an exception cannot reach desired consistency level try again later better luck next time best part of the consistency levels is what they are on per query basis so if you specify replication factor of a key space then consistency level can be set for each query for example here we see some Java I remember some of you using Java so it must look familiar we've made prepared statement with session prepare inserting the product blah blah blah values blah blah blah and then to this prepared statement I can set consistency level Let It Be consistency level one and I can execute this query then I can execute this query with different consistency levels so for example you can think if you totally need to write your data and you cannot say to your customer try again later we are having issues you can for example thinking of executing query with a higher consistency level and then if desired consistency level cannot be reached you may soften requirements and go from quorum to one for example this strategy can be dangerous so in general use it with a very high cautiousness it may be a very it's a very Advanced case so Cassandra can be tricky on the example a little bit lower you see us working in Cassandra Cuero language sell what you will do very soon where we can set consistency uh get consistency with common consistency we see what it's said to Quorum and we can change for example to all well to set to all good uh well then now where's the question can we try to get as close as possible to the center I mean like okay Center is unreachable but can we try to get very very close to the center as maximum as possible answer is yes there is a solution known as immediate consistency immediate consistency speaking scientifically is a pretty simple idea if your consistency level of right plus consistency level of a read is higher than replication Factor your data is immediately consistent what does that mean imagine me writing data with consistency level Quorum and reading data with consistency level quorum first of all I write data with replication Factor free consistency level Quorum client writes to node node despite just free rights and let's imagine these uh bad guy went down and not available and not responding still so we technically we have downtime if it would be a master server uh on this traditional databases our application would be totally unavailable but we are better than that we are better than downtime so they didn't store it using two replica factors now this one recovers but let's say for any reason a hinted handoff didn't reach their goal so one of the mechanisms of a layer of Defense actually even to consistency levels and repair and read now I read data and I read also with consistency level Quorum there are two possible scenarios This Server will answer faster or This Server will answer faster If This Server answers faster when we have Google in here so this is a replica this is a replica we have Quorum we have up-to-date information and client gets up-to-date information that is a boring scenario like everything works as expected let's speak troubles let's imagine this uh bad guy was faster and it gave wrong answer no not wrong but stale right outdated then enter event situation is more interesting This Server sees what data is not matching actually not even data but data digests because sometimes you work with big data you don't want to transfer it all multiple times for no need if this server has the same and this and they all have the same it makes no sense to transfer them making your network busy so actually those servers by default sending only the digests uh sure very short values Eve digests are much ink we return to the client but in this case we see it's not that just doesn't match this value is not updated here then query coordinator Compares timestamps it always knows when data was written it sees what these data is more up to date the data it stores then it returns this data to a client and initiates repair for this partition so partition will be repaired and consistency of This Server will be recovered automatically with no human participation Magic so that and by the way as we speak about this formula uh you technically can do the same with write all read one or uh write one read all but as they include a consistency level all that is again questioning our high availability and we're trying to be in the center uh consistency levels you need to know so uh one Quorum all we discuss it already two three basically very simple you're just specifying exact number of response you're waiting for if your replication factor is different it may make sense then two very important things ideas of local and each first let's talk about local local one or local Quorum local means closest data center for example if your application is deployed in the United States and Europe you want a European uh data center based application server works with a database Center also in Europe not in the United States right so saying local one you say work with we expect one confirmation from one local replica not we don't wait for American guys or it will be too slow and working with local Quorum is exactly the same we will wait for cool room only of local replicas we will not wait for acknowledgments from replicas of our data centers we're going to be slow each Forum will require to to have worm in each data center so it leads to nodes in each data center but that potentially can be very slow of course because you will have to wait for all the transatlantic trans-pacific Communications depends on your network topology and so on but uh usually you stick to locals okay now questions actually even two questions first question [Music] the cep theorem says what unfailor in case of emergency C A and B are all guaranteed if C fails so do a and b only CA or CP can be guaranteed but not both of them simultaneously you making the good team people so I expect it to be right you made it so CA or CT can be guaranteed but you cannot have both in case of failure it's awesome yeah you are doing great nice then second question right away um recommended consistency level for immediate consistency read write one one read write one all read write quorum well this is also a very important Point let's see okay time is almost over okay so no one one will not give you immediate consistency one one is the most dangerous way it may still may have used if you have a lot of operations and want to decrease amount of pressure on your database when you work with data of a secondary importance uh in I don't know there are plenty of scenarios when you can afford losing uh one answer for a short moment of a time and then it's not a problem but when you work a date of a primary importance of a high importance then you definitely want to have immediate consistency and then you want to have warrant Forum which is recommended technically one all also gives you a minute consistency but it's definitely not recommended now the stop no yeah I have two two questions already right yes yeah I did good so let's get back uh Stefano yes let me change my story Into You yes please it's time to run some security code your life very good so um yeah I'm where were we we were at the dashboard for the newly created database you see there are a lot of things you can click around and explore and see the various ways to interact with your database monitor Health connect to it uh configure settings and all sorts of things today we are going to interact with the database first to create a table right so to start putting some data in it okay so to create tables there are various ways actually to communicate with Cassandra there are various ways um the most important is so the native protocol supported by Cassandra is called cql which is Cassandra query language and uh there you might just have a a client that is a console speaking in cql over to your Cassandra you can uh have drivers for various programming languages using under the hood this same protocol and speaking to uh your database and in the case of Astrid B there is also a layer providing different ways to access your database different apis such as a document API graphql and whatnot but today we're going to run plain good Cassandra code SQL code I mean but the nice thing is that you don't have to install your client today on your computer because in within Astra to be there is a nice console running in the in the browser for you to just type commands and see what they do and you're actually uh writing and interacting with your database so to you see this SQL console tab here this one if you click on SQL console tab here a console is created for for you now I think the font can be made a bit bigger so I'll try to enlarge okay you can I should jump to the new interface to collapse that side panel but okay let's try okay that's not very important I'm just doing that in particular to be able to collapse so this is um changing to the newly rolled out UI just to be able to collapse the side panel and make it easier for you to see what I am doing okay so here hopefully the the font size is a bit bigger and so this is a console like you would like you would have uh your own console in your machine but this is running in the browser and it understands the cql Cassandra query language commands uh SQL looks a bit like SQL but of course I hope we have convinced you that by now um we have convinced you that Cassandra is not a relational database so no surprise the commands available are slightly different and not everything is supported and so for example there are no joints but some of the commands look very much similar to what you would use in SQL if you have some experience with that so let's start by creating tables now um today's example well not that this is very important but today's example is based on a fictional iot network of sensors collecting measure temperature measurements and we we have to think of tables to store these measurements so there are networks of sensors and each sensor supposedly sends periodically temperature readings to the database server which has to store them in the right way that's not important but actually we have follow-up workshops about modeling the data and writing the application and they all build on these Internet of Things um example so that's why we that's why I outlined the briefly outlined this this point so um first we have to create the tables or even before that did you remember that we had key spaces so we can ask SQL console to describe to tell us which key spaces are there and uh how do you run commands in the SQL console well you type them and you hit enter key so for example if I write desk I'm trying desk basis usually cql commands have to end with a semicolon and then I'm hitting enter and you get you see we get the result and well looks like there are a lot of key spaces But Here There is a good sensor data all the rest are systemic spaces you should not even be concerned about but the important point is that there is a key space called sensor data here so we can tell the SQL console please use sensor data which means from now on every time I don't specify a key space I'm working on that one by the way maybe I should show that to you because that's useful uh Cassandra so cql console has tab completion so I just write use send then if I hit the tab key that's completed for me so use sensor data then I hit enter and you see now I'm working on the sensor data keyspace so if I create a table for example this will be created within that key space and that's exactly what I'm going to do so I want to create a table called networks see this is a table that will contain data to list which networks of sensors exist in this system so you see um here here's the create table statement that we are about to run and that looks almost like a SQL statement so create table well if not exist but create table name and then there are a bunch of columns with their data type so name is attached the description is a text region is a text and then there is a mention of the primary key now primary key is a bit different than what you would see in SQL maybe this double parenthesis will give you a hint but let's first run this command so I'm copying it and pasting it here in the console as you are suggested to do all all of you you should do the same so paste the command and hitting enter well it looks like no error so it looks like the table was created how do we find out well I I can ask the console to desk tables so short for describe tables and sure enough I see my networks table here I can even desk table networks and I will get back my create table statement so the table is all good all there and also a bunch of settings so it's related to how the table internal is how the storage works and all that that's not for today of course okay so um that's not the only table in this um iot application because we need a table that lists which sensors are there for a given Network and also a table to store the individual reading of temperatures coming from the sensors and that's why there are two additional create table statements which I'm going I'm going to to to to run but before running them if you look here that's what import the interesting part comes you see this table all Define a primary key this also defines a primary key and you see there is this funny thing there is an internal parenthesis with in this case one column and then there's another column that appears in the outer parenthesis well that's related to how partitioning works so um that will be seen later but the the to make it very short the innermost parenthesis contains the partition key so that defines what rows what data are going to be grouped together in a partition and the rest here sensor in this case and timestamp in this case the rest is uh the rest of the primary key basically so what makes the row unique but still does not implied different partitions for storage but okay there there will be more on that later so let me just copy these commands here and paste them in the console no questions asked I'm just hitting enter and I think it has worked so if I do the other tables here there are now three tables in my key space you see then it looks like it's all good um but well there is uh there is a problem with this table actually that was called temperatures by sensors bad the reason is related to this partitioning so uh of course I'm a bit jumping ahead because that is something Alex will show you better later but imagine readings come in and in over time with this application every sensor is sending new readings every time and they come with different timestamps but a given sensor will send more and more and more data to store eventually if you look at how the partitioning is done so this all data from a given sensor end up in a single partition sooner or later this partition will be incredibly big and that's of course there are physical limitations on how big a partition can be so this is not a good choice for a table this is this eventually will become not performant they you will have the problem of giant partitions too big so actually there is a trick that you will see in a slide in a little while but we can even drop the table I'm not I don't bother dropping the table now but I want to create a table that will be the final table for this application which is called temperatures by sensor you see there is not bad anymore let me paste this create command and you see there is a slightly different choice of partitioning I'm just leaving that here for you as a as a hint of what's coming next and Alex will show you uh more about how to properly design partitioning in tables but the important thing is that now if I run my desk tables I'll see well four tables in this case including the pad one but important thing is that we have tables ready to uh be written right and whatever um yeah so you might ask yourself how come we designed the tables like that why why should we have why did we put sensor and not another column in the partition key and so on this of course is a very big topic and it's the topic of data modeling and that's uh a huge important part of working with Cassandra today we are just going to mention that mostly the idea is that you design the tables after thinking of what queries you want to run on the table and that's my one liner about data modeling we have entire courses on data modeling so that's why I'm I force myself to stop here on this topic and I think it's back to you Alex just looks like uh thank you so much hands on Port is important guys don't be lazy do it on your own uh now actually sorry yes okay so last part getting very close to the end tables and partitions uh so let's go uh how do you structure data how do you work with data it all starts with a cell and cell is an intersection of row in column then rho is a single structural data item in a table that must be familiar to you then partition and we don't have partitions in most of a modern databases but we do in Cassandra and never forget about partitions partitions never forget about you so group of rows having the same partition token base unit of access in Cassandra and then in a table is a group of columns and rows storing partitions good data is organized as distributed tables discussed closer to the techies as it's a key based partitioning you decide how partition will be designed a partition key is the first argument of a primary key and that's a very important thing partition key basically we'll Define how data is distributed over a cluster and partition key decides of a size of a size of a partition um so in this case for example this data we have a partition based on the sensor ID in this case we may have too many partitions over time so we could think about a different model like sensor and timestamp being both parts of a partition key let's call it a composite partition key and it's totally fine to have in this case as timestamp is going to be unique we will have as many we will have as many rows as many partitions as many rows we will have one row per partition and that is totally fine percent you may have as many partitions as you want it's fine but designing model we need to think of free limitation first we need to remember the size of the partition to avoid it being too big second we need to think right time and second we need to think a reads time uh so how do we behave here on a right time can we write this data answer is yes when sensor writes its data to a database we need to know sensor ID obviously we do and when we need to know when it happened so we do have timestamp we can write but uh what happens on the read if you've read story is different can we do a read on that remember as partition key defines data placement over the cluster then retrieving data you need to specify all parts of a partition key otherwise what happens if you don't specify all parts of a partition key Cassandra simply doesn't know which server to ask and there can be thousands of them at first when Cassandra may say I am not going to execute this query it's just stupid I'm not doing that and as you are the boss as you have a programmer you can use some bad words some rude words call it a low filtering you can force Cassandra to go and make filtering on these uh data without specifying all the parts of a partition key and then people I don't know about you but when I order pizza I specify my full address three CT Street house number and then they can reach me delivery guy or girl can reach me easily query without specifying all parts of the partition key is as stupid as ordering pizza without giving your house number or room number apartment number then a delivery person will have to knock every door on the street and ask have you ordered pizza man no okay I will go to next one and then on the next door knock again have you ordered pizza sir no I will go when well I don't buy a pizza must be hot right so you need to specify the full address that's exactly the same with a partition key can I write this data yes can I read this data then reading this data I will have to specify both sensor ID which I know and timestamp of each record which I don't so these partitioning may be questionable for some of your access models on how exactly you're going to work with this data second part of the primary key is optional it's called a clustering column clustering column is used for two purposes ensure uniqueness of the data and establish sorting order if you need that and that's optional so first of all what do I mean for ensure uniqueness imagine I have primary key like that just sensor ID and that is the temperatures by sensor table with ID date timestamp and value that will happen then if I will make a second right for the same sensor after some second sensor being launched Cassandra uses absurd so new record will simply overwrite the previous record when I will have one record per sensor always as H next record will be rewrite to previous one I don't know if it's bad maybe it's exactly what you need for your use case but in most of the cases you want to have the history so this one will work but it will be not unique and maybe you need it to have unique when we could think about for example something like that sensor and timestamp which is already much better so unique on by sensor and then group it by timestamp or we could think about sensor and date and timestamp where we have it stored by date so we can get easily for one particular date instead of defining ranges in this case we still can get data by range but we will need to specify the full range which may be not convenient here we can just put the equal date something and get our data back still fine oh then uh finally primary key consists of a partition key and clustering columns if they are present it uniquely identifies a row like on this example we discussed at all the parts of a parameter Cube uh this is very very very very important to understand partition Keys Define data distribution over cluster based on the partition key data will replace it on node a or node b or any another node then clustering columns Define how data is physically stored written on disk what that means for us and why I am saying that is a highly important to understand the long story short once created data model cannot be changed you will need to create new table and migrate the data in data in relational databases you can think so you can do things like change primary key and it will work in Cassandra it will not work why take a look again at the slide what will happen if you change your partition key new Partition key will mean new token new token mostly probably will hit different partition that will mean to the need to change data placement everywhere and cluster will be busy transferring data from one node to another basically all data you have that is as bad as it sounds so that is not possible when we have clustering columns as we decide uh how data is physically stored a changing clustering column would lead to rewriting data on disk again all data you have and that is again not really the brightest idea you might ever get uh so either table exists in Cassandra aquarium language but it has much less capabilities you can change some settings you can add data columns data column is the column what is not mentioned in primary key so in this case data column is value uh so you can add or delete data columns but you cannot change any parts of a primary key schema is a mutable once created and data migration is no fun if you cannot afford downtime that means what you will need to do double rights to different tables uh while migrating so there is no fun at all in this now file last thing last thing or first day rules of a good partition it's very important to keep your partitions over under control and then they will be your friends that's like with Gremlins you don't give them food after midnight you don't let them contact with water and you will be friends but if something like that happens you are in real troubles so follow these three rules and you will be good so store together what you retrieve together if you are going to uh like YouTube video and we want to show all the comments to this video it makes sense to partition them by video ID so I will do uh need to do one query to one server to get my comments and we are good I will not have to ask multiple queries for multiple different partitions um so this part must be simple right you just don't want to make two small partitions but avoiding making two small partitions you have to also avoid big partitions if you partition I don't know your particular use case but comments there can be really a lot of comments for one video so for example that like there can be really a lot but good for us they usually pretty small I mean outer name outer ID outer name because we use the normalization uh common text timestamp comment ID basically five six seven fields and you are good and all of them are text and if there are limitations of amount of a comment they never will be too big uh but in some scenarios you do want to avoid big partitions because for example if you do partitioning for your user based on countries and there are some countries like San Marino like how many people live in San Marino or Vatican I don't know uh very small countries uh and meanwhile uh there are uh China or India or like huge with hundreds millions and that can be plenty of data so in this case it's obviously going to be first of all big which is bad and second of all it's going to be uneven some partitions are small some partitions are big it uh like doesn't help with scaling at all no fun so we prefer to keep our partitions of very limited size and we prefer to have our partitions more or less even there is a recommendations not to have more than 100 000 rows in a partition or not to have more than 100 megabytes in a partition a hard limit is up to 2 billion cells per partition that is a hard limit you cannot have more uh a count of rows size those are recommendations but believe me uh those are really recommendations you don't want uh to break but you want to follow a very important thing is uh also as uh Stephanie mentioned already nature of constantly growing partitions partition have no limitation on size uh on time and on the growth over time it may become too big uh over time like imagine if you're writing those temperatures all the time every 10 seconds in few months we will become too big uh so in this case we can introduce so-called bucketing uh bucketing means what we will create smaller partitions so buckets with the help of an additional value in this case you see in addition to sensor ID as a main part of a partition key we also introduce it month year what is a month year like today is uh December of 2022 so it's going to be 20 22 12. what happens then um in New Years happening and then there is a new month and new year is going to be 2023.01 so partition key has changed so partition token has changed so we create new Partition a new Partition will be put to a new server for well next server mostly probably not this one um and that is a very important and cool thing that can be other ideas like people again say why not to use timestamp why not to use date uh answer is we don't want to have partition too small also because if you make it too small or a right time it's all good uh on the read time again you will have to specify all the parts of a partition key if I'm going to retrieve data for uh last three months my query will be select everything where sensor ID equals ABC and month year is in 2022 12 20 22 11 20 22 10 so October November December we are good it will hit three different servers mostly probably because those are three different partitions so it's kind of violates the first rule stored together with Europe together but it's not so bad it's not 300s partition but if you bucket your database it on the date if you're going to retrieve your data for free last months based on the date you will have to specify all the dates you will hit 90 partitions and that's now going to be fun so that's the idea of keeping partitions of a reasonable size don't let them grow too much but don't have also too small and then finally avoid hot partition what is a hot partition hot partition is a partition what being accessed all the time while others are hiding imagine me storing the same temperatures from the same sensors with a partitioning like that there are some people in the chat like Aaron mostly probably now having a heart attack the story is imagine I have very powerful data center of 100 extremely expensive very cool uh very powerful servers and I have partitioning like that means on each date all the records will go to the same servers replication Factor let's say free so free servers are extremely busy and I have uh all the other servers are idling because we're not responsible for this token range and therefore for this partition and now I open five more factories or I deploy a dozen of new sensor networks and they start to write and now my servers are not coping with this pressure okay I'm a rich guy there is a big successful company I have money I will buy 100 more with them in expensive powerful servers what will happen will it help no because there still will be free servers responsible for the same partition uh so you see idea is isolate not only volume but also velocity and this case is a perfect scenario for the one partition being super busy while all hours are idling then scaling doesn't work I tell you these data model these Cassandra performance is a shared responsibility to share it between you and Cassandra Cassandra gives you tools but you need to know how to use them Cassandra is not a bicycle or a scooter you can see it and drive without understanding nothing Cassandra is more of an Airbus or Boeing and then you enter the cabin you have one thousand of different knobs and levers and you really need to know how to use it before taking off you don't want your pilot to learn how to land your airplane lie right in the middle of the flight okay um last questions number eight so select without partition key is index Aurora okay to get all data very bad illegal and punishable by law as a database police employee officer I should say what actually answer number four must be the right answer but sadly it is not a right answer is Selective Auto partition key is very bad technically it's not a syntax error because syntaxically you can do that but it is very bad and you have to avoid it at all costs and also stop your uh colleagues if you see it happening if you see a low filtering in your code then something must be very very very bad exceptions are like you can nearly never happen good and then last question what is the most important rule of the partitioning data try to have as many partitions as possible keep partition size under control keep together what you retrieve together make partitions bigger I'm bit curious of what you will answer time is up and keep together what you retrieve together is the important rule of a partitioned data but the most important rule is to keep partition size under control I mean uh you see the story is uh if you have inefficient data model what doesn't really answer your query you always can migrate but if you have partitions to pick then basically partition being to Big will uh start to interfere with node performance node is not performing will lead to Performance problem of the world cluster and then may potentially lead to much worse problems so keep together what retrieved together is the right rule you need to follow it but key partition size under control is the most important rule you need to remember today that brings us to the leaderboard and I want to name in person people who gave the most right answers nickname ND nickname Bell nakshatra and Deepak and I cannot see our names already because they're hidden behind Andy I kindly write ask you if you are in the chat in the YouTube chat please write what place you take in and that was a very very great job uh what's unique or what's your place on the leaderboard and thank you so much now with that said I'm going to give the oh um ik uh benign I'm sorry yeah very possible connection errors yeah that's always it just uh five fifth place that's a very good result uh congrats and I'm switching us to Stefanos very nice we already your life okay great thank you Alex so yeah um we have been well you've been learning a lot about Cassandra how it works and how cool it is and we have created a table uh well actually four tables on uh you have created four tables on your own a strategy instance now the practice goes on and shows you how to do crud operations so crowd operations are the the build basic building blocks of interacting with a database because they mean they stand for create read update and delete so the the most important most basic operations you do with data you put data you read data you change data and you take out data basically so there is a hole as you see here in the readme there is a whole set of instructions to try to do or various kinds of crowd operations and we are a bit short on time actually we are a bit over time so I'm going to improvise with a shorter version here and then you will you will probably benefit from looking at all quirks that you see here in the provided commands but most basically so yeah where were we we were the SQL console here in the web in the web browser and you were on the sensor data keyspace so if you remember there were a few tables one of which is Networks so I'm going to do a desk table networks just to remind me of its structure you remember there are three Fields name description and region they are all texted there is no voucher with a fixed size in Cassandra there is just text of any size any reasonable size and that's out of sized for you by the way and the primary key is name so um in well this syntax means that it is a primary key and it is also the partition key so actually every partition is a single row here and every value of name will be a single row a single partition but that's uh details so let's insert some data well maybe I'll keep this description a little more how do you insert data well that's something very much uh SQL looking and your what you do is uh insert into table name and then you list the fields you want to insert I'm going to list all of them name description and region and then values followed by a similar Tuple of use which have to match one by one the column names I put there so let's say I want to insert a network called my net which has the description my nice Network and it is in region uh I don't know Lakes whatever okay so you see I hit enter and this is how I insert row um how do you know this has been inserted well of course the right way is to run a select so select let's say the simple case like Splat from networks I'm typing the commands the keyword uppercase but that's actually not required I'm just trying to make that easier for you to read so if I just run a selects platform networks do can you guess what I'm getting I'm getting my row back so you see name my net description minus Network and original Lakes uh funnel enough this is not the very best way to query a table actually in a table with a lot of data this might not even work at all because you see in theory this queries needs data from all partitions now this is an easy table there's one row so it should work but in General on a real table probably this is just not working or timing out or going very slow or it is not the right way to access your data if you designed a table with name as partition key usually the only queries that make sense to run are those where you specify specify the value for name for example this is a good query this is a good query because as soon as in my where close I specify in this case name but in general the full partition key then the query will have to go to a single source of data a single partition even if a cluster is 1000 nodes it will be just a matter of one two nodes depending on the on the consistency level of my read and then I will get my data back so there is no need to ask around to all the cluster to get pieces of data so this is the right query this is the typical right query the one that specifies the whole partition in in a workloads and then you can invent variations so you just need the region yes that's something you can do and so on so this is how you query data the only reasonable way is querying a single partition but that does not mean a single row in this in this table it it the the two are the same but that's not true in general okay so let's see how do you uh update existing data let me try one thing I'm just trying to change now I'm just trying to do an insert of over an existing row I'm just doing the same insert with a different description so I'm writing again my net with a description that is now my lovely Network and this does not give an error it just succeeds well that's because of how storage Works in Cassandra basically it's a append Only log behind the scenes but it's much more but it's based on append only structures so it doesn't have to waste time in checking whatever is there on the on the database earlier and that's why this right just succeeds so this right has no way in general to to know if there was or not and a pre-existing row with that value for the primary key indeed if I now do my my read I'll oh sorry I have to read I have to select description in this case I will get the new way the new description the old ones has been overwritten it's not there anymore so basically an update is a write which happens which happens to work on a row that was in the database already well that's not to say you cannot issue a specific command update table Network update oops set the description equal my new description where name is my net this is also something that you can do and it will also result in a new value of the description but update and inserter 99.9 percent the same they are just absurds they write whatever was there before so that's an important point to keep in mind and that's one of the implications of the speed in write speed of Cassandra so this is so far we've we have written data updated data basically write data let's delete data shall we so that's easy delete from networks where name is right next that's it so if I now read from the table rest assured there is nothing to be found now we could we could tell a bit more about how Cassandra works and how to interact with it so you can have there are something there is something called lightweight transaction that is an advanced uh read and write pattern that allows actually to do some pre-check before actually succeeding with the right so that's how you can check what is on the database before a conditional doing a change and that's a mechanism that is there um we can also add that the fact that deletes you can do a single delete of a single row of a whole partition you can do a range delete so and that has implications on on storage and on on performance so you should do the widest single delete that you can if you want to get rid of a given chunk of data but I think it's 25 past so I will stop with these so you have seen how to write read update and delete data actually I will stop with boom because I'll do these through okay okay table networks and that is the widest delete because it wipes out the whole table contents so don't run this light-heartedly but I wanted to end on a higher note um yeah so again if you look at the readme there are a few more commands to test and and writes on various tables there are different data types to test and to have fun with so this is really just an appetizer and I hope you are now primed for more Cassandra and with that the practice I think is over right back to you Alex thank you so much and that was great that's interesting to notice what uh Cassandra insert update and even delete is exactly the same operation technically as we have to be ready to work over petabytes within single digit milliseconds extreme required extremely quick we cannot afford doing any changes on disk on any kind of operation actually because it's going changing operation on disk finding replacing updating it's always very slow so whatever actually happens under the hood is up and only uh what's being then merged in the single one piece uh later and background because some I can as a software engineer I can say what Cassandra is a really piece of programming art that is a real Masterpiece I am so excited with all the optimizations tricks uh um in the Cassandra open source code it's just totally awesome okay next next year my one of my uh yearly goals for next year is going to be to become uh Cassandra contributor so and I definitely recommend to each developer to work with open source at some point develop open source so good we are done with all the main parts and you have seen the Hands-On part now you can go and do it on your own now or later it's fine uh if you want to get this nice page and break on LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever you have to complete the Hands-On part and uh submit your homework following the instructions uh on them uh following the instructions on your page on GitHub you will find it important links for you to know our Discord server is uh you know the link already was published a couple of times on YouTube chat dts6.io Discord then a place

join us on Discord where we can continue the discussion and have helping you or anything see you on on our next Workshop yes uh next week we have no Workshop right it's going to be 28. there is some I

sorry yes we do have one live coding build a simple job application Aaron I think yes that's a great idea so we do have and then next one already on fourth of January of year 2020. it's going to be very cool it's how to build a Netflix clone with Astra DB so with Cassandra behind the scenes and graphql API right plus the class plus the front end so that's and if you want to learn more about proper data modeling for Cassandra because data modeling is absolutely essential for Cassandra as you could have learned today should have learned it today then on 18th of January we will be special uh data modeling session two hours only on how do you model uh data for Apache Cassandra um I mean like there is a free full course you can take at the Academy but maybe you prefer something shorter you don't you are not ready for long-term commitment but still want to invest some time into that that totally makes sense then 18th uh first 18th of January is totally for you yeah thank you so much
