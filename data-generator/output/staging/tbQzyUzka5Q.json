wherever you are you know welcome to this uh actually edition of Workshop which has really three workshops packed into one really right if you want to think about it we're going to talk about the three Frameworks that's getting a lot of traction in the Java World which is spring native quercus and Micronaut I will talk about uh how the Frameworks are relevant in the native world and maybe not in the you know in the not Serenity World which is the regular world so so we'll talk about all that but without further Ado let's make sure that you know all the broadcasting equipment is okay if you want to put a thumbs up and let us know that you hear only two voices and not more that'll be appreciated because sometimes there will be more um so with that said please Cedric do you want to say anything I introduce yourself I mean yeah I'm leading the advocacy team at data Stacks Supreme is super happy to be here uh among everyone for these two hours Workshop full of technical ends on uh full pack agenda as users maybe this this time even more than uh than previous so yeah stay tuned a lot of things absolutely that's great and again if you want to put a thumbs up that you're hearing two voices and no more than two uh um no Echoes and all that uh you know that'll be great uh because we just don't want to be talking and nobody hearing or you know too many voices or whatever with that said let me introduce myself my name is raghav and srinivas I go by Rags because for whatever reason people around the world have a tough time pronouncing my name and not quite sure why um I was a mechanical engineer by education but kind of switched into computer science and I love distributed systems because you know it's really hard to do distributed systems you know I've been doing this for quite some time uh and still struggling with it which is which is kind of nice because you know I'm constantly learning as well one of the things I love to do is teach and communicate uh um and like I say you know kubernetes has solved a lot of problems especially uh in the computer science in the um you know in the computer world but inner loop is still pretty complex uh and the inner loop is what you know you do compile containerize push it to Registries and all that so I I really like to um you know communicate talk about the challenges in Loop and how it can be fixed and I've said about myself we have an entire team that's behind all these workshops that we run pretty regularly um you know every Wednesday um so I have a few questions coming up in a little bit because we do mentee and all that where we want to find out how many of you are first-timers how many are repeat I shouldn't say offenders but repeat attenders right uh and um you know it's it's really about uh you know we we want to thank you for kind of devoting two of us and we want to make it a little bit fun as well um so with that said do we want to move to mentee um and and kind of get some ideas of where things are who's coming and so on yeah yes let's go yeah let's see if I can do this transparently and I did not um let's get get rid of this and minty is right behind me okay let me and tell you okay in the chat right now and let me make us less visible so that you know people can see it and let me see if yeah I don't think we are overlapping music let me know if the music is too loud uh I will kind of tone it down a little bit okay see how many people are joining again the chord is four two zero one let's see no I'm sorry four one eight three yep it's always some screen right now but but you know let me wait for a little bit at least try to hit some reasonable numbers yeah no real competition in the beginning just a few questions maybe people will keep coming so I think you know how much time is it yeah four minutes yeah maybe it's one more minute let me go so to participate too many uh go to mentee.com uh and until the code that was shown on screen also in the YouTube chat and also at the very top 42014183 you know it's easier to do it on your cell phone because there is a lag on the on the web so especially when when you're going to answer the questions for the swag it's it's it's good to be fast uh so so it's it's easier to just look at your points all right should we get started uh should we keep moving all right this is a question but I very you know all of us get really excited because we see a lot of dots popping from around the world so just put a dart from wherever you are it doesn't have to be very accurate some people from the Bay Area actually thanks for coming I know it's a little early at the bay area but but not people from India Morocco Maybe it seems accurate I mean I know somebody from our team with his actor who she is actually in maruko so maybe it is Mary likely if it's Mary thank you for attending if it's not Mary just put in your name that might also be useful [Music] very exciting to see these darts pop up right um you know it'll be nicer if we have 100 dots popping up but but it is yeah no sometimes we get them sometimes you know yeah let's keep pushing so we have a few questions just to kind of get an idea of who we are talking to um you know be he kind of guess you know who you might be but but you know I just want to validate those assumptions and don't want to kind of keep the as they say right you don't know your audience so we're trying to make sure so as you can expect otherwise we thought it would be you know we have a whole lot of beginners we have a nosql guru in our midst and that might be Mary again who knows right so no idea but uh but whoever it is you know all right this is kind of what we expected any comment Cedric no I mean uh you were in good place for beginners everything that we will tell you today is available uh on GitHub you have all the instructions all the materials if sometimes you feel we are we move too fast just to stay in the two hours you can go back anywhere and um do it on your own pass Pace also we are here to answer any question you might have in the chat I never feel you know it happens all the time and and typically what happens is that Indies just go back and again if you put a yes exclamation GitHub or Bank GitHub on the chat you will get you know the GitHub link and it has all the instructions and again for those of you who may be joining late you know the menti code is 4201-418 All Right Moving On uh what is your Java framework experience you know if you just use Java maybe you can just say other uh what if you have no Java experience if you have used strength okay quite a few spring developers that's cool I think we hit the Right audience here wow too caucus yes okay very cool okay so we don't need to talk about Java then right so that's cool yeah there's only one person with no Java experience don't be intimidated by everybody else who's talking about the platforms Frameworks um you know uh like like what Cedric said we will walk you through some of the code and uh should be pretty straightforward to understand uh even though you know you may have absolutely no Java experience all right this is kind of surprising so I think we can move quickly through our material right sorry this is good good news for us because we were wondering how we can fit it in the two hours pretty cool all right welcome again so last question uh I think is this your oh it should be First Data Stacks workshops sorry that sort of very badly put the question is this your first yeah and uh yeah I thought I fixed that so that we are that you do not get the dates maybe you should refresh I don't know that's weird okay pretty sure I fixed that okay no big deal we'll see during the quiz last count of how many workshops have attended but but like we expected most of these most of the attendees are attending for the first time uh welcome welcome and uh we've been here before you know the drill everything happens in kitpart and you'll see that pretty soon so without further Ado let's keep moving we will have the quiz here so so again you know keep it keep it ready to go and if you're joining just now four two zero one four one eight three uh we will do the mentally uh quiz at the very end all right so let me go on to the next [Music] okay we're done with mentee anymore and we are replaced all right yes oh perfect okay moving out all right okay um so we have a whole lot of resources like I call my um you know I basically um you know feel like I'm living in the golden age for developers developers are wanted by just about everybody right and and we have so many resources the the problem is not about you know not having resources the problem is kind of filtering the resources and these resources that you have in front of you that are shown here GitHub gitpart and Astra is all about Hands-On so you know you can learn by trying it out um so you know whole bunch of resources uh we will we will talk about this again towards the end of the talk um and and one of the coolest things I like even though I like to see things move you know because being a mechanical engineer in the in my previous birth um you know I like code to move but there's really nothing to install you know everything is pre-installed for you uh we you know Tinker on the git party ammo file and make it happen and you'll see all that um happening okay so I don't know why this is here again but we'll do the quiz later okay so this is the agenda for today um you know we will do a brief intro of what we're going to do today um talk about Cassandra uh and then talk about the Java drivers because you know eventually uh the drivers is what makes the app happen right um and and one of the cool things you'll appreciate here based on what you know Nicholas worth said it's really about responsive programs and responsive or reactive programs and responsive data which which really you know is your software solution and you'll see that you know the you will will see the three Frameworks which are which are trying to be more reactive more responsive and so on and then Cassandra has always been about serving up your data in real time linearly scalable and all that so we'll talk about all that and all that is happens through the Java drivers uh we will primarily focus on three Frameworks here which is spring spring data spring Boot and so on uh and then quarkus and Micronaut will be very clear that we are not going to make a recommendation of one over the other each of the platform has its own advantages disadvantages and so on right and we will have a you know pointer to resources you will even get a badge actually maybe you should get three patches here right because you're doing really three Frameworks but we have a nice cool badge which kind of encompasses all the three uh Frameworks so with that said citric do you want to add any anything with respect to the agenda no no I think we we have we will uh learning by doing so you know let's dig into it so what you learned today is we're gonna go you're gonna go go back with a complete to-do app on multiple JavaScript Frameworks uh springboard caucus and Micronaut okay uh you may have attended uh my workshop on quarkus um it's it's kind of similar uh but but you know I think the nice thing about today's Workshop is that you can compare and contrast it with respect to the other two popular Frameworks as well uh of course there are other Frameworks that we are not going to talk about here uh you can try the same thing there as well um we will talk about the data drivers we'll spend some time there because after all uh this is a workshop this is a programming Workshop this is a learn by programming Workshop so we'll spend some time talking about data drivers we'll see how we can connect the app to Astra which is our database as a service uh and and you'll see with very minimal configuration changes uh we can make it plug and play with each of these Frameworks so if you want to think about you know like a micro Services approach uh Astra is your database as a service or database is a microservice if you will um there is a lot of attention being paid by the community especially the Java Community because you know a lot of people pronounce Java is dead about I don't know 15 years back but Java is is alive it's robust the community is working on you know several different initiatives if anything um you know there are a lot of initiatives that you have to kind of filter through and hopefully today's Workshop will help you in that as well because we're going to talk about the three Frameworks and how they are gearing to be more responsive than they have already been you will see that you know with if you if you create a native image and perhaps we'll show you a native image in at least one of these Frameworks uh you'll see that it starts up in like milliseconds it's perceivable you can see it yourself just in this Workshop itself but you know some of these native features are still very experimental very early you know there are some constraints um you know article basically put that out saying we may not hit 100 but we will hit the majority of the cases but our goal is to make it you know more and more um you know kind of approached 100 level right so you may see some little bit of oddities in the in the different platforms uh but still you'll get a good idea of how it is to build a native app on each of the framework all of these framework leverage something called as girl VM and since all of you are already Java programmers you probably have heard of this and we'll talk a little bit about the anyway [Music] this is a quick uh slide about kind of how Services have evolved or how software has evolved um you know distributed systems kind of morphs itself roughly every decade you know I mean I started uh doing korba I don't know if you remember sweet Rick right so so that was kind of no so I forgot about Koba a long time ago and I agree with good answer yeah yeah you know somehow I still have that nightmares of korba but I you know IOP and all that but but in any case we are in a world today where it's all about microservices um you know we have kind of evolved but but you can see that you know each of these different um you know paradigms kind of build on top of the other paradigms or maybe sometimes you issue that Paradigm to come up with something new right so um you know maybe kuruba is not the right way let's do microservices and because you know that's really the way to do it um and and in today's Workshop we will have a microservices approach believe it or not and uh the microservices approach uses a very simple app to do app and you will be it's mind-boggling to see how much the community is working on the studio app right there is an entire front end of all kinds of apps you know angular um you know in Python and all kinds of java Scala you name it you know there is front end for uh doing the studio as you can expect it's a very simple to-do app you know you just put in the to-do's and you kind of Mark them off and you can delete them you know kind of play with them but but it kind of illustrates the fact of how you use a service because it's really crud based you know um create read update delete right which is which kind of resonates well with a service with a micro service and so on um so you know you can you can expect some services to create a new task list install task delete a task and so on and so forth so what we're going to do today is we're going to build the the uh the two tiers the back end and the database right of course for database we just leverage the database as a service tier you can also um you know kind of you know do it other ways but but you know we are going to Leverage The Astra service we're going to build the back end which essentially means we're building the rest API and what we're going to do here is you know use the appropriate Frameworks to to be able to um you know do the back end and provide the rest API like I said before there is a front end for each of these you know to do apps or there is a front end in each of the different platforms there's a back end to validate the specs wherever you return it no so so like I said um pretty cool and you will see you know if you finish your homework which we grade actually we are not very hard graders so as long as you complete uh there is really no time um requirement you know typically we expect most people to be done by a week because you know again our next Workshop starts next Wednesday so if you finish your homework you're going to get this cool badge looks cool isn't it um we may need to change the Micronaut uh Cedric it's misspelled a little bit but we'll fix it okay all right okay yeah and going on uh moving on uh Cassandra let's talk about Cassandra and I'll try to keep this as short as possible because we're already 20 minutes into the workshop um you might think it's you know somebody really did a lot of homework a lot of thinking behind this to come up with something but really the idea was let's come up with some catchy hashtag that will be good to kind of talk about this Meetup where we want to talk about all these databases that are that are proliferating uh which are which is really more about horizontal scaling and not you know just going up and up and up and that was really what nosql the um the term noise scale was born it's really about commodity Hardware Distributing your data across you know multiple commodity hardware and not requiring you to vertically scale up it's really about horizontal scaling typically vertical scaling is where you know you'll see in kind of a relational database in a nosql kind of word uh your your data is spread across multiple um you know like I said commodity Hardware because disk is very cheap uh you know used to be very expensive um you know I don't know about you Cedric and again again probably giving up my age here um you know I started with a 20 megabyte hard disk and when I got a 40 megabyte hard disk I was like in heaven uh you know so so those days are gone um you know the discs are pretty um inexpensive um and and you know um you you can you can distribute your data but again nothing comes for free right you need to be able to kind of deal with failure scenarios which typically happens uh in a um in a distributed scenario so that nicely segues into what I was going to talk here about what's called the Brewers conjecture enunciated by Brewer who I think works for Google Now right uh and essentially it's also referred to as the cap theorem and the idea behind this is that distributed systems are great work fine when nothing uh is going wrong right but the moment something goes wrong you have to pick two of these properties which is essential of any software that you write right you want it to be consistent consistent is like every read is the right that I wrote last right you know something like that right that's consistency what is availability you know it needs to be available you know otherwise it's it's down I cannot use it for a certain amount of time or something and about partition tolerance is where you know if the distributed system kind of partitions itself um you will get into scenarios which are referred to as split brain scenarios you will get into very inconsistent issues and so on so most of the nosql platforms actually do not sacrifice partition tolerance so they pick a property either consistency or availability to give up on but they don't give up on partition tolerance okay um so you know maybe it's not available for a little bit which is fine maybe it's not consistent it could be it will become eventually consistent so if I'm not on the leaderboard for 15 seconds probably okay right I mean depending on the application of course right Cassandra typically has been in AP database or an AP nosql database right and and you can see there are other you know whole bunch of databases um which which kind of do the AP or CP mainly right nothing is like is going to sacrifice part intolerance so basically again the cap theorem to summarize you have to pick two of the three when it comes to a failure scenario everything is fine when there is no failure right but you know you know in distributed systems failure does happen uh Cedric let me take a breath and if you want to add something feel free yeah this cap2m um actually you will choose if you want to be available or consistent you cannot be both at the same time but it's it's also not 100 accurate to say that castle is AP uh mostly AP yes but you can set the consistency level request level and ask to be super consistent for that very request so you know just something I would like to write yeah no no no that's a great Point I've I should have mentioned that there is a lot of blurring of the lines between these different databases so sometimes you can pick the consistency and say I want very strong consistency and you you can do that with Cassandra um or strong consistency right uh and what happens in those cases it's it may not be available so typically it was AP but you can make it CP as well great point um we do as a company data Stacks maintain Cassandra and actually as we speak the Apache Summit is happening and there is an entire track in Cassandra so even though Cassandra has been around for a long time um you know it's it's the community you know people like you who is who are making this community uh Stronger as we speak because it's part of the Apache software Foundation um the there are several reasons for for Cassandra to be to be a superior nosql databases uh one is that there is no single point of failure it really scales for rights and reads um and and you know perhaps one of the key distinguishing points of Cassandra is that you know it does linear scalability of course it does sharding um you know sharding is very hard um and and you know the platform takes care of all of that for you because it distributes the data eliminates hot partitions uh keeps multiple copies you know typically there are two more copies of the data that you want so that you know if a particular node is down you can go to the alternate uh you know backup nodes or whatever it's called right and and get the data um but but all of this is uh handled by the platform I have a very very oversimplified view of the nosql database or Cassandra in general uh you can consider it as a distribution good hash table you know especially for the Java programmers uh you know that you know you can you can distribute your data across multiple um keys and make it uh you know responsive right um so order of one will be the access but but the idea is that you know if you have to do all of that yourself you may get into what are called as hot partitions you may get into situations where uh you know if that particular data is not available how do you go to the replicas and all that all of that is done taken care of by the platform um so so good good point here about Cassandra being configuringly uh configurably consistent so you can pick from like eventual consistency to um you know strong consistency um and and all of this um is available on kind of a cloud agnostic manner uh in fact I have I have Cassandra running on Azure on on Google Cloud uh and on AWS as well and of course I have running it on my laptop uh and and in variety of different platforms uh in a variety of different ways um in fact even our Astra DBA as a service is distributed it's hybrid cloud and multi-cloud and so on like I said before one of the cool things about Cassandra is that it scales linearly which is believe it or not a very difficult thing to achieve you know especially at scale right linear scalability uh our scalability in general what happens is you know it may go up quite a bit and then kind of levels off at some point with Cassandra keeps on taking you add two notes it you know you add a note doubles you add two it doubles again you add four it doubles again eight and so on and so forth okay so very linearly scalable um so like I said before you know it takes care of replicas there is no single point of failure um it uses something called as a a gossip protocol uh and what the gossip protocol is is I call it as an optimally chatty protocol uh so it just doesn't exchange health messages but it also exchanges information about neighboring nodes and all that so it optimizes the traffic it optimizes the uh the chattiness between the different nodes uh with the idea that each node has some kind of idea of the entire network topology so if you add nodes then it you know it basically redistributes the data and and and all that happens automatically one of the key things is what is referred to as partitioning uh so you know how you how you optimize your data access is through partitioning your keys and and you know that is how you know data is distributed um and and um you know we are not going to go too much into Data modeling here uh but you know data modeling is all about kind of picking the partition key so we're gonna jump straight into databases as a service with astrodb it's basically a database as a service uh um you know multi-cloud distributed uh in today's exercise we are going to be using Google because um you know that's where the free tier exists uh but if you want to put in your credit card you you can use other clouds uh if you if you decide for whatever reason that uh Google is not something that you want I've talked to several customers um you know and and what they like about Cassandra again is the fact that it keeps on ticking you know some of these uh you know I think it's FedEx I don't know if it's in the logo but but basically you know they haven't rebooted the Cassandra cluster in like eight years you know I think I think they did some live in place update but but and hopefully they did but but you know I think it's really about uh kind of that reliability availability and so on um like I said before we are not going to go into too much of the data modeling um unlike a SQL database where you start from the data okay and end up with um you know kind of fitting it into your application here what you do is you start with the access patterns or your use cases and kind of you know um you model the data based on your access patterns so let's say you know if I'm if I'm you know doing some data where I'm um I'm I'm doing a a Erp application or something then my key would be model based on the Erp use cases as opposed to let's say I'm doing an iot application uh and and I'm doing um you know something entirely different it's not always about kind of the third normal form uh that that you know is how you work in the SQL world uh here what you do is you optimize for the use cases uh and and it it a lot of times you know data is not in the normal form and it's really up to the application to kind of keep the data consistent um our data model kind of looks like this we have we have uh you know essentially what we've done is we've added some twists uh because some of the platforms uh our Frameworks might have a slightly different um you know data model but as you may expect it's really about user ID then we have an item ID and then we have a completed which is either ticked off or it's not right and then of course you have the uh um the to-do item itself right what is the two item like uh it could be um you know do my presentation work on the data model whatever the case may be right and then your primary primary key is based on user ID and then within the user ID it's sorted on Item ID so that you know I can get as you can see here for John you have walk the dog have lunch tomorrow sample task whatever right as the case may be all right we have said enough we have talked enough and and you know I have monopolize the talking so let me end to Monsoon you know uh Cedric London uh who's gonna walk us through the first lab about setting up um yes that's right let's go give me a second so that I can bring up your uh um screen yes and tell me what I'm live and we will start okay just give me a second I forgot how to do this so let me copy the GitHub link right now okay in the YouTube chat it is also in the description below all right I'm gonna get rid of our heads make it small okay if you don't mind okay let's do it nice in my screen now all right you're good okay so let's do this uh everything that we do today including the slides are available for you uh for free on GitHub so you have the link on the description below also the YouTube chat now and what I will do is just follow the instructions step by step moving you through the labs and as we said in the beginning if we are moving too fast for you it's not a big deal you can go back and execute them at your own pace it's free not credit card uh required or anything like that then it's yeah let's let's go for it okay so table of content objective materials let's move quickly let's go with the answer so to render the application we will need the customer database we don't want you to install customer nor download Cassandra in Docker so let's use a DBS service Castle so it's called a star so Asta is the data platform from data Stacks providing you both casanha and pizza as a service so what we need to do here is register and create a token as soon as we uh done that everything else could be done through a command line which is you know easier and faster so what I'm doing here after signing using my Google account I will simply go here to organization organization settings pick token management select Administration organization administrator just to get all the permission in the world so exactly what we need for these Labs do not thinking about do I have the proper permissions so let's do that and I would generate my token when you generate your token three fields are provided client ID client secret you only need the last one which is the token but make sure to save this token because we will never come back uh to this screen for security reason it's the same in Google in Azure in AWS credential action once so here you download token here it is I will download that in workspace for instance or I could copy that on the text file somewhere here see I do have a lot of tokens already uh and you know with that um we we could do everything through command line all right so create account create your token we good to go so uh to create your token here you have this animation as a gif okay and we can close we don't need to go there anymore all right so now um we will create the database uh and we will do some code for both you need an IDE and again instead of you installing uh Eclipse IntelliJ vs code or whatever with all the plugin and all the downloads let's use ID available uh as a service in the cloud it's called gitbod so here you right click on the button and say open link in the new tab uh copy link open link in a new tab here we go so here you will see that gitpod is starting initializing and getting you everything you need so it will take maybe one minute because here we are installing the proper Java version um let me drop everything that we now need so here I'm downloading uh gural VM for GDK 11. and I will set up the environment to use that graph VM to talk about the good part window you know for just those who are not familiar with it like uh um yeah it's really yeah yeah it's really vs code in in the cloud so here you have the Explorer view with all the code here I am in a terminal I can add new terminals by clicking the plus button uh later we might need to create a new terminal because one will be busy running the app but then it's a full-fledged uh foot Fletch ID uh you I mean you have Java install Maven uh you have python JavaScript Docker a lot of the tools are available for you out of the box uh and you know you don't have to understand anything in because we need some extra features when the environment initialized we provide that in gitbot.tml and here you can see that we are installing the the micro node CLI uh Coral VM native image and uh the Astra CLI and a couple of things that will be useful for the for the workshop today uh but yeah these uh guard VM installation take take a bit of time but the idea was to is to take some times in the beginning but just move quickly then over the the answer yeah and once once the ground VM is installed uh you know it's going to come back and ask you for a token uh so that's where you're going to put a token and you know after that that's it you know you're good to use the Astra database as a service uh and there it is right yeah so yeah so yeah once everything has been set up we issue a command Astra CLI setup with a token needed so see here I have my newly created token here that I will paste here so the first time I paste something in gitbot you get this warning but as soon as you allow that okay you good to go and uh right now you can start issuing some command with Astra and you are connected to the database so Astra DB list for instance as of now your database list is empty as of now I have two database already running one easy and I did one is terminating okay let me put it maybe bigger yeah maybe start yes so and I will hide the code for now just of that full screen okay so here uh what I just did actually was setup for he asked me for my token when I did Astra setup I copy paste my token from setup two and now I will create a database so here let's have a look at the command ask hard DB so using the service DB from azra platform creates uh workshops Workshop is the name of the database keyspace and if not exist so I just create a workshop a database called workshop and the first key space called KS underscore Java to run the first lab using the drivers and later on when I need um to start the spring up I will create a spring space I know we have a lot of java programmers here and some smart yeah I mean but do you want to talk a little bit about what a key space is while this is warming up yeah okay space is is for uh is like a schema for rackel that's a logical grouping of tables a single that Castle Heights Station can have multiple key spaces other key spacers level you have multiple metadata default TTL and replication Factor are the most important replication Factor are mostly TTL will be per table so replication Factor as we are using uh Ascot today the replication factor is set for us three so we just need to ask hey let's create a new key space yeah and and just for just for Simplicity uh we have three key spaces for each of the three Frameworks uh you could you could just do with one key space right um you know but but we decided you know that might be easier to go that way um than uh and and after all this is and that's the good practice right yeah yeah uh great question from manesse uh I will answer that question when we dig into the spring data part uh uh yeah but you know so managers the rest of your app not the Dao that's really what you want to do with that okay so Australia I should have my database Workshop ready and running and active Okay so we're good to go and with that uh you know that token that I provided before I will Define it as an environment variables like here with that I can use this value everywhere in my code super easy to retrieve also to work with the drivers and ask how you need some credential bundle it's called the cloud secure bundle having some SSH keys to connect to Astra and here same the CLI will download that for you and I'm just pasting that here you have the cloud secure bundle ready to go because here we are interacting with the cloud-based data Cloud cloud-based Castle raw so to secure the connection because it's a two-way the assistant connection you want to create a channeling SSL and this is the the keys and certificates inside this ZIP would make that for you the drivers know how to use this ZIP so you know don't get confused it just to have everything set up to start lab number one yeah but with that I mean I we are ready to go we have the database running our environment is Set uh token is there in the environment you have the cloud secure bundle we can start we can go back to two slides yeah yeah I think I think on setup six is probably the most critical one just make sure the uh you know the environment variable is set up right um and yes I mean of course the security connect bundle is also required uh so you know if you if you are through six and seven uh I'd appreciate if you can put in a few thumbs up just so that we know that you're you're kind of following along and especially if you're following behind let us know uh so that we can help you for some reason you're not able to get a token uh for some reason gitpart does not come up uh you know it doesn't really happen that often uh and by the way if anybody from gitpart is attending um please put a a uh you know something in the chat message and we'd really like to give you a shout out um get part is taking time okay maybe the good part if anybody from gitpart is there they can help fix it yeah no it should come up um uh it does take a while for uh the girl VM to be installed and all that um but but I think I think it should it should be up and running soon uh just it'd be great to see at least one thumbs up um so should we wait or should we proceed Cedric um a little bit not wait too long yeah exactly um setup are easy to go through but I mean you should not miss a step otherwise you can run into trouble for the test that's that coming exactly yeah yeah so so what we're going to do is we're not going to build the app you know we're almost not built in a day right uh so we're going to start by testing um you know the connection just to make sure it's working and once you are tested the connection then you're good to go you know pretty much right uh of course we're going to add some data and all that but but that that's that's fine ooh okay two people complaining about yeah then it's moving pretty fast I can tell you know okay then it's really a natural moving smoothly and as you as you as you saw I mean it took it took me one minute to forget about two stuff and Instagram VM and now now I'm good exactly yeah yeah um okay um good now okay so let's proceed all right okay so you we we did the setup for uh Astra databases service right um but how do we start using them I I alluded to a number of things one is we're going to test the connection right um we're gonna uh do something that is we're gonna populate the database right you know in this particular Workshop what we're going to do is we're going to populate that and we'll see all that right uh so to be able to do all that we're going to use leverage some of the drivers um you know the Cassandra drivers there is an entire um you know whole um repository of examples of how you can access the Cassandra um database and you'll you'll see that in your you know in your gitpart uh code repository um under uh lab one right um of drivers okay yes so enough said um you can you can currently look at it as you know three different things right how do I uh connect to my database right and and that's where um you know some of these things are very critical which is like you know providing the token providing the secure bundle and all of these are already kind of um uh managed for you in good part of course if you're doing this on your own you may have to do a little bit more work but we have kind of made it easier for you to kind of do it and understand it from a conceptual perspective so from our connectivity perspective we need a couple of things then obviously um you know actually the driver does a whole lot of things it does some load balancing um and and you know retry policies because after all we are working with a distributed system right um to be able to do query you know we'll see today that you know we're going to build some statements prepared statements and especially if you're used to um you know kind of the SQL World um we use uh something similar called cql which is the Cassandra query language uh and and that's what we're going to see quite a bit today I know there was a question about whether to use the reactive or the regular API whatever you want to call it right and and I think uh you know Cedric is going to talk about that uh in a little bit um yeah and then in terms of parsing um you know there is obviously as a Java programmer and all of us are Java programmers we want to deal with data as Java objects right so you want to take the data and this is not anything new this object relational mapping right so you want to you know kind of work with the daos and the dtos uh rather than kind of work with it as data you know it's it's all fine and dandy to just say select star you know you know we don't recommend you doing that in in a typical Cassandra database but you can do select star with a where class where where is the partition key right and then kind of deal with it that way but I would rather deal with it you know as objects um and and we have good object mapping support there are examples of that you know there is pretty much examples of how you do paging how you do compression and so on and so forth okay but to be able to use the driver very simple right um all that I need to do is I use include it in the dependency in Maven right as a Java programmer I'm not even going to talk to you about npm python or you know um C sharp right it's just there okay but to be able to use it in in Java you just put the dependency in the maven file in your palm.xml you can do similar thing with Gradle as well uh and and you're good to go okay um you need to be able to contact only one point but if the node is down then you want to be able to deal with it um and and um you know again it's all about how do you deal with failures in a typical distributed system you contact the neighboring node uh and and be able to do the work and and the driver is going to automatically handle this for you um through what is referred to as a SQL station uh it's a stateful you know Singleton pattern um should be unique to the application as you may expect right and you definitely want to close the um SQL session by maybe either putting a shutdown hook um and and closing it or closing it explicitly or maybe even putting it in you know in your exception Handler or whatever right um there are a number of ways uh you know maybe I should not spend too much time on this but but as you may expect what I do is I provide the the node I want to contact and then I provide the uh the credentials that go with it okay we have examples uh the driver samples which usually a different data model you know it's a video sample but but you know the the concepts are still exactly the same um your username is required you know you will see in in today's Workshop that your username is specified as a token and your password is your you know token and of course you need to provide a single connect bundle because you're really going over the internet right you know you want to be able to make sure you know that that it's secure uh and the secure connect bundle basically like I said you know because the data we don't even know where it is in the cloud right the secure connect bundle actually Associates with where the data is actually stored whether it's in AWS whether it's in Google or whether it's um um you know in Azure it doesn't matter right and essentially what it does is it creates a two-way TLS connection and handles all that um you know as long as you provide the secure connection and you're good to go okay and again you know the driver does a whole lot of other stuff as well including load balancing uh providing the proxies and so on and so forth okay so we saw this again we create a a session and then kind of work with it right so so that's typically how we deal with in Java obviously there are a number of different ways of of creating a session uh and you'll see a lot of examples uh in the code today but this is just one example of where I provide again the secure connect vendor credentials and so on and and you know what I've done is I've configured it in such a way that you know our at least in in today's Workshop you will see that it's all handled in a in a configuration file okay and this is this is kind of how the configuration file looks and you'll you can you can you can take a look at it yourself right you know what is my key space right um what is my secure connect bundle and this secure connect bundle knows exactly where to go and and and and talk to the uh to the uh um Cassandra database um and then I have my token and in this particular case I'm using a environment variable which actually has the value for the token and then how do I build a SQL session I just say SQL session Builder dot Builder and build and and you're good to go okay so I have a SQL session now once I have the SQL session then I can execute whatever I want right I'm gonna start executing queries um uh not a good thing to do select star uh you know maybe it was there uh but but uh you know I don't think we have uh millions of to-do's um at least not in this example today so it's probably gonna be okay but but again keep in mind that if you do a select star then you're going to every partition right and and that may actually be prohibitively expensive uh it will definitely not be in the order of one it'll be more than the order of n which you are trying to avoid number of ways in which you can create a statement right you know we talked about statements uh once you have a session then you create a statement and then you know you execute using that statement uh and then you can get the results and then you're going to manipulate the results and this this is again you know for a Java programmer this is exactly how you will deal with you know most of the data anyway right whether you're doing it in hbase whether you're doing it in um SQL or whether you're doing it  or whatever it it's it's kind of the same concept right so I I create a simple statement um where I say select star from T1 this is a little bit better right from table one where seven is equal to five right um and and basically what I'm doing is I'm setting the partition key to be equal to Phi so it knows exactly which node to go to and get that data right or maybe you know not the uh more than one row or whatever and we'll see all that in a little bit um very similar in in two except that what I'm doing here is uh you know instead of uh using that uh literal right uh literally in the query uh I'm I'm basically using it as an argument so that I can I can do this dynamically right I can say add portion of value six add position value seven whatever as the case may be okay um you can externalize the parameter names again you know added name value and and there are a whole bunch of things you can do uh select star from T1 again not a good idea right but I'm setting the page size to be 10 in this particular case because you want to be able to you know scroll 10 by 10 and so on and as you may expect you know what you're going to get out of the this you know once you execute the statement is you're going to get you know kind of what you're familiar with which is a result set right and we'll we'll look at each of these right in a little bit um so again in this particular case we have a prepared statement uh and and we can bind it in in Dynamic time right so so essentially what we are doing here is uh we are binding um you know Phi to that question mark If you will compile once on each node and paste it each statement only once per application okay um and anything else you want to talk about this Cedric or so foreign twenty percent uh performance Improvement uh yeah validating the syntax grammar and looking at the schematic sometimes yes so yeah think about it even if most of the uh framework will do that for you okay correct yeah yeah so you're going to use the arguments as appropriately right and like I said before basically what is the results that is like you know again as a Java programmer we're completely uh comfortable with this we get back an iterator so we iterate through that um and and um there is also a call which basically says get available without fetching okay so so it it kind of gives you the number of items that are available um so you know if you're if you're um for example you know you set your page size to 10 and you get less than 10 then you you realize that you know you may be at the end so so this is all again nothing nothing different um uh anything you want to add that you know Java programmers should should possibly be aware of for uh uh but but essentially what you do is you execute and then you're gonna iterate through the result Set uh and make sure that you know you go through each of the row or or go through the program go through the rows depending on how your program logic is framed right so um again number of different examples here uh I I get one result uh then is is now is username uh reading values from a row you get username there are a number of ways of doing that you can get the username and say string class you know which is really what you know that that particular username is or that particular field is um or you can just get the string username um and and so on and so forth you can you can do it you know in different tons of different types available uh and and you know you can kind of look look at this if you look at the examples they go through a whole lot of uh all of these okay um again let me take a little bit of a pause and let's Hedrick uh you know talk a little bit more about drivers before we jump into the most important topic which is the object mapper right uh I should say most important it is one of the important topics as well yeah you know I like to show by with the code so I think we could we could move now you know quickly to the to the lab uh lab slide and I will show you the mapping uh in the code I think that would be no absolutely yeah I think I think we will we will give you some time uh to walk through the examples yourself which would be even better than Cedric describing it but but I think Cedric will set the background for you to kind of walk through the samples and so on um yeah but basically again um it's the abstract details of mapping from the Java to SQL okay um yes so that's really what you know object mapper is as you may expect um it's packaged separately from the driver you will see it see that in the Palm um and and um you know essentially you have the driver and you have the object mapper you know these are two separate entities right um exactly and if you go to the next slide you saw the poem exactly so just include the mapper plan so he's it is the dependency at the top so drivers mapper runtime it's an annotation processor so that means at runtime at compile time um The annotation processor will go over your code we'll find everything that is annotated uh for object mapping and will generate what we call steps which are skeletons for you to to to interact with the database so if you want to look what The annotation look like next slide you have a first sample of an entity annotated so it's like what what city is based on there you can see um you know the entity is annotated here um you have partition key annotated and then you have a clustering column as well so all of this are you know like what what um Cedric said you know great hints for doing the object mapping yeah exactly so you annotated your object like that uh what is the table name what is the what is the primary key what are the type of different colon and then you create a a Dao which is an interface on next slide uh and if you look at the code it's really like uh spring data you do not provide any implementation Through The annotation concrete class are generated for you at build time and you can start working with it and we have not yet introduced spring micros the object mapping is already part of the driver yes you may be very you know uh you may decide not to use the object mapper I don't know if there are any instances I mean but you know you may deal with just simple yeah it's important to notice that it's there yes because as of now Quakers and Micronaut decided not to prevent the wheel and just use that so if you are looking for object mapping in Quakers this is exactly how it's done if you look for object mapping in micro node this is exactly how it's done and micro load is even up here because macro mode is easily um implemented using annotation processor so having the mapper as annotation processor itself it just a better uh cream how do you say that in U.S butter and there is no exactly yeah yeah I think Micronaut relies more on annotations than than like quercus and uh okay um it's not enough to just map it right we need to do something with it so that's where you know kind of the day or dtos come into the picture uh and that's what exactly do the inserts the deletes um and and and so on um again all done with annotations okay um so so with that said I think people are ready to kind of play with some of the uh yes right so um okay here make sure your screen comes up I will please yeah so uh thank you yeah thank you for for the remark Edmond uh so here if you are already using Cassandra in in some parts but I would like to to show you and uh the the meat of this Workshop it's you know us talking but you know not really a stocking that's really the content that we provide to you like full-fledged working Java application showing a lot of things regarding the the drivers so um let me clean my screen over here but here if you look the lab one it will be going over the functionality that we just explained to you uh with a couple of slides with Standalone Java code so if I take the first one uh three three common line first place yourself in the proper uh in the proper repo second proper folder so go hey this is the code we execute so let's have a look and the third is executing that uh code it's not a unit test it's a standalone main class the ID is ready for you to copy paste and a bit available and ready for you so here you can see that connectivity is performed the only code that you have here on screen to do the the connectivity is this SQL session that build the auto build and the SQL session Builder actually leveraged on uh file code application.conf where you will retrieve all the configurations so if you if you are using Frameworks on top of the drivers you should have a way to set up all these properties because drivers have Androids or properties and settings available don't let the abstraction mask you all the the capabilities of the drivers so here what we can notice we are using a key space uh called key as Java this is the one we created the cloud secure bundle has been downloaded for you over there okay so we will use that and for the user password we are using token and the environment variables that we decided we created so with that you know where to connect how to connect what is a credential and this is why you can use quite of the empty Builder um but if you want to design and Define your own your own values just look at the Builder and how many uh how many operations are available for you everything can be set up and now I can go to The Bash execute this class I mean this is a great example of kind of keeping the config and the code separate right you know um it makes it a lot easier to tweak it so if I want to use my own version maybe use Kate Sandra version whatever I just tweaked the config and everything else Remains the Same right yeah yeah okay so here uh we have our first success so obviously you can go one after the other copy paste could be based copy paste and uh finger costs you will get success each time because we we tested before so it should be fine so second will be oh let's what if you want to create your schema okay you can create your schema with Java so the drivers will give you some uh query Builder both for the Builder and for schema creation so here I'm executing exactly what you see here in the comment create um create a table create user defined type so here you see system.create I probably prepared those statement to make things okay and when I execute those code I just Implement that say okay stop prepare the create create session session build build yeah no need to here no need to prepare their executed ones and no real no real attributes provided it's just string I know I know this is obvious but I'm Gonna State it anyway because you know people like me who may not maybe a little um you know be I might be wondering is this is not for our Workshop you know for to do um it is a set of samples that come with the SDK right uh but but you're obviously welcome to you know to kind of put in um or make it work it's going to work just exactly yeah yeah it's going to be a little different yeah yeah no shame because I created those all uh I mean those 12 samples so you know if the code is not as clean as you think so we are so accept full requests but it was great because it showed you a large portion of the of the drivers and once you know that you can apply the same features on the different uh Frameworks so here we are created schema you can create a schema with spring data as well spring that I can actually create you the schema at startup uh using here uh in in the configuration of uh spring here there is something called schema action creative not exist so spring data will create you the table even without you having to provide the SQL statement my advice for you do not create the tables with any code your code spring data code no way the I the the good solution is to have a dedicated SQL file there you see exactly if your table match your queries did you provide the proper partition key primary key because the schema is ready based on the queries also if you provide a SQL file or you now you realize that when you create a table the create does have metadata did you specify the compaction strategy did I Define the GC grades again did I Define a the default TTL on my table if you are using features like spring data doing that for you you lose that you don't even realize that you can set up all those and those are very important per table a competition strategy depending on the use case a read EV write EV mix workload time series could be totally different and when it has been changed but it has been defined I don't think you can do alter table change compaction strategy because it would change the file on disk so again split code and schema management do it properly because when you do have this file in front of you ask yourself the good question and provide all the metadata needed yeah um I think I think you know for 90 of the cases this is probably going to be okay but but you know we are really talking about you know the high-end Java programmers that you guys are yeah uh okay so let's execute that's uh create schema uh two so it's it's coming okay it's uh come on come on my friend none of these are gonna work if you haven't set the token and all that so I think it's good practice to do this anyway right so so that um at least uh you know you're you're making sure um that that you've done yeah you know the setup work properly yep so um if you have let your Astra DB screen open you can have a look there but remember we have to ask how a CRI so I can just say astrad DB SQL sh so interact with the database uh uh called workshops okay uh Dash and I I would like to execute uh describe key space is challenges to show you the table have been created foreign so here we go and as you can see we have defined the tables like that but everything else has been providing by default by the system so you know better you ask the question a should the unified compaction strategy makes sense for this one or not is logistic rates are gone 10 days is okay or should I make it smaller Edmond really likes our work in that uh you know he didn't have to copy and paste and all that just for the token and you're good to go and and you know most of workshops we are striving for constant Improvement and this is like uh what I would call as a major Improvement you know uh because believe it or not copying that security uh secure connect bundle from the Astra console to gitpart why have my local laptop was taking a lot of time so you know it was just confusing but but yeah yeah glad you see it that way yeah I think you think you know she may request again I codied the CLI so all these Astra DB download the bundle uh help us for this Workshop okay for the statement uh I can also uh move okay so here you can execute statement like uh SQL session.execute uh but you never want to execute the statement with all the parameters like that because you open yourself to xss or cql and the SQL injections so people can come with some uh with some malicious parameter and doing wrong stuff so what you want to do is actually prepare your statements so you will Define your uh and you do that with a rational database as well so you externalize all the parameters you need with a question mark okay this is called uh free pairing and only when it's prepared you will um you will execute that okay but I think it's going later okay so create read update delete let me open that no need to to execute trust me on that so previous so how do you do this prepare statements so here it's the main so at startup what you want to do is again make sure that your statement has prepared and start working with them on spring data you will do after set properties on percus you will have the init blog on micronauts you will also have the the constrictor block so prepare statement I start and execute them later previously we had a question from manage regarding the batteries okay so when you need to insert the same data on two tables you want to use a batch so your data needs to be used by two different queries okay let's get my to do by to do it by an ID or get me all the to-do's from the current day it's two different queries targeting the same data but in case you need to create two tables you will have to do by ID to do by date and for each table dedicated object dedicated Repository and when you insert a new to do education level you have to insert to doing both table and to do so you use a batches so how to do a batches well you create here a batch statement here you design is the batch is logged or unlocked I think most using log because if you use locked you create a commit log and um then you can re kind of restart your batch or retries and here you add your statement so batch statement is not a batch update you do not want to insert 100 statement there just just how many needs to uh insert the same data single batch uh single partition batch are the best because they are Atomic will access the the database and uh back multi-partition batches and that's the case when you insert some data on multiple table or find if you limit the number of statements but they are not Atomic anymore they will retry each statement for a up to the timeout of the batch and if fail the wall batch will fail but it will unlikely to fail because if you retry your statement if the first failed Cassandra will move the request to another replica and try to do it again okay uh but she's paging every request in Cassandra is page default page size is five thousand okay and so when you execute a statement you could prevent you could provide the page size when you provide when you provide a page stage in the the read the the return the number of free call in the page is bigger than the page size you will get a attribute code uh paging States so here this is what you see here this is your pages Tech kind of you cursor where are you right now and if you go and if you want to go and fetch page two you will re-execute exactly the same statement changing the paging State just marking the cursor that you are on page two and execute it again so what this sample code is doing is inserting 50 itamina table and then execute page queries with page size of 10. and here you see how you retrieve page one and how you retrieve stage two and in between the two pages you get your paging state okay uh keep going um when you need to do one too many queries in Castle there is no join there is no association tables but still you can insert either colon a multi-valued attribute list set or map same as same object as what you expect in Java and so in in this sample what I did is I created a complex object including some table including some set UDT and map and I provide you some example how to insert in uh the three attributes again here that's kind of your toolbox when you need to go back and build your own Cassandra app now you have that sample of the in use of each part and with uh you know reproducible and easy to execute code so that's that's the part but you know here how to use Json you can select into or so you can select into or insert into usage Json if your table contains some nested type like map set UDT custom type you can insert everything in one request user insert into Json let's go and now you know I can see you behind your screen you are saying oh Jesus what the heck well technically you can but you still have the castle has schema under the hood so you will have to actually match the schema of your table it's not schema less validation less like it's uh white colon and a skiba full so sample read an insert with Jesus asynchronous programming so a very nice to um get and not make your user wait for every single call but uh get the call back a competition stage and get a dedicated portion of code to execute when it's complete like then accept um super is you know very cool uh when you need to select in that's also select in should be totally forbidden from the SQL language it's moved the pressure from the coordinator to the to the I mean from the client to the coordinator you want to execute in parallel multiple queries and each time you provide only one item just to get everything executed in parallel and asynchronously and it's so here the trick is instead of uh doing execute with the code you are doing execute async okay so execute async so over here right so here SQL session dot execute async and the same statement and here you go with the asynchronous you will get a callback for each page and paging is quite uh annoying because you need to get back the first result on page to get your page and state and go back with page two so it's not really asynchronous if you need to have page one to be able to fetch page two uh it's not as as evaluated reactive has been introduced so reactive everything is non-blocking now and when you execute a select you will get the Callback not for each page but for each row and if you cannot keep up by reading all those rules that Castle High sending to you you can you will have some back pressure mechanism so uh Castle how we slow down for you to consume what needs to be consumed so pretty cool to be non-blocking to have this back pressure mechanism but now I know that you know we have a lot of java programmers here but uh is this available in other languages too you know maybe you want to comment a little bit you know just in case some of you are polyglot as well yes so in JavaScript everything is asynchronous right with the promise in in uh in python as well you have the asynchronous execution now for the reactive reactive is really uh uh dedicated specification you know pushed by the reactive Manifesto implemented in Java with uh reactor Eric Java vertex uh that's right but I'm not sure for the others if it's there but now in the drivers I I don't know uh but we had a question before minus should we use reactive the constraint with reactive is as as soon as you go that way the full app needs to be not blocking in the first version of spring work flux if for some reason you add the Dao not using reactive but just using select the app will not even start but it will tell you hey somewhere in your code you have a blocking call it's not allowed so it's it's great but it's quite a commitment but you know what we we can make it uh I will keep doing some Shane MC plus a Shameless plug but I implemented the spring pet clinic uh there's a famous spring sample apps using reactive everywhere but it was some reward because now you need to use white flux everywhere and change any data access to the active uh yeah so here we have all the samples don't need to go uh into all the details maybe the object mapping we we talked about just very quickly so here for the object mapping sample here you have the classes okay and this sample is um I like it uh here you have comments okay this is a command with the uh this you can expect comments on the YouTube like video comments on the YouTube live video will be shown in two pages below the video so give me all the comments for video and also on your profile if you want to list all the comments that you uh provided and it will be comments by user saying to us two queries even with the same data who cares two typers okay two tables so two entities right command by user and comment by videos two entities but they do have the same schema I mean the same table names not the same key so how do you do that well you create a first parent class called commence providing the colon type and colon name and then in the subclass you override only what's needed so for comment by user what you need to tell is a user ID is the key so here you just overwrite the getter and say user ID is my partition key and if you need if you look command by video here you see I will override the auto get okay so here you have the Dao the mapper and the query provider so DIY mapper will be what will use 90 of the time sometimes you need that query provider to help you actually uh execute some special queries you want to do where the defaults are not exactly what you expect so here again a sample of a query DL provider and with that I think I'm taking too much time but really really these uh understand how the drivers work with the different type of data is we need a key to unlock the features in the spring Quakers and micro node Frameworks exactly yeah because you can extrapolate most of this information uh to you know the three Frameworks that we are going to talk today and maybe we went to you know some of the Frameworks that you're not going to talk today right you know like haladin and so on right so yeah okay all right let's move on to the presentation um and I think we're good I think we are I mean we have 30 million but uh I mean I think so you are we we already did this right uh test the connection so it's already done Lab One lab two is already kind of done or maybe maybe you know you can you can just kind of um work through that uh but very very briefly we'll talk about kind of the Java Frameworks and how how it's kind of evolving uh I I kind of alluded to this before uh you know people pronounce the the platform is dead but but it is not um and there are a number of reasons for that uh it is adapting to the new era the traditional model was about kind of right ones run anywhere right but right now um you know it's really about responsive programs you know you really wanted to start really quickly uh especially in kind of like a a female container kind of environment um footprint and performance really matter a lot and and we'll see how Java is kind of adapting to that but you know again um you know uh at ease here or perhaps you know I uh I'm gonna give away everything here but the idea is that um you know um Java does some amount in build time and a lot of other things at runtime I mean that's typically how Java framework was based on because you know you have this byte codes uh and then you have this VM which is capable of running byte codes whether these byte codes come from java whether it comes from Scala from all these different languages it it kind of works that way and then it loads the config file it does some class paths scanning it builds a model of all these different objects it starts the thread pool and all that all of this is happening at runtime but can we do something to left shift this right that's the idea right so if we can take the penalty at build time then your runtime obviously is going to be much smoother right granted there may be some situations where this is probably I mean I would say impossible but it's probably going to be not worth um you know the efforts right um but but the idea is that you know if you can shift the penalty take you know do most of this in build time like you know doing the class paths running by reflection kind of figure out what it has to do and all that um then I think it will make it a lot more productive um also you know the platforms are um are kind of adapting to live coding so you know yesterday I was working on Spring native and and essentially I made a adjustment to the data model and immediately you know I didn't even realize that uh you know it basically recompiled and push the um you know the latest image so there is a lot of uh you know I have an entire Workshop devoted to kind of working on quarker us and and doing debugging and all that so if you're interested you know you can follow that uh you can kind of take a look at our video but the guy the goal again is to speed up the inner loop you know the moment you speed up the inner loop you can do things much faster so to be able to do that there is a just-in-time compilation and ahead of time compilation just in time compilation is something that you know Java programmers have already been used to like for example if you use the hotspot compiler uh it does it does the just in time uh so essentially what happens is you will see that you know the first invocation uh when when it starts a startup from cold right it typically takes a little bit longer but after that you know the same the same um you know class uh the same method all of that will be you know uh sped up because what it's going to do is you know the compiler is so smart that it's going to optimize it uh and and kind of inline optimize the whole thing but can we do better can we do something at build time and that's exactly where these Frameworks like the spring native quarkus and Micronaut kind of do this ahead of time compilation so what is the difference between just-in-time compilation and ahead of time compilation um you know there is a whole lot of yeah you know articles written on this uh we can we can kind of geek out on this uh you know this is the area which I really like a lot uh but but I'm not going to spend too much time on this uh just because um you know it it might bore a traditional programmer but if you're into it uh essentially the idea behind this is you wanted to start in milliseconds no jvm resource overhead you know think about this right or very minimal jvm because you don't even have the jvm when you're when you're packaging it up as a native app right it's all about cold starts right because it's already optimized you will see that you know the app comes up like like that in milliseconds it's great for containerization and it also reduces the attack surface okay so um so the idea is you know if you can take most of this penalty in build time then your runtime is going to be much faster um I took this image from info queue and essentially talks a little bit about uh just in time versus uh um you know iot uh but but essentially what you're going to do is you're going to statically analyze this um you're going to statically analyze your image and generate code in such a way that it's it's geared for that particular platform just in time works across the board across different platforms uh aot is really geared for that particular platform you need the gral VM you know in conjunction with some of the other compilation tools uh to make this happen but but you will see all of this in action today in the next 20 minutes but it doesn't require you to shift your paradigms it doesn't require you to come up with some new tools that I have no versatile versatility whatever right and still very comfortable with IntelliJ I'm still very comfortable comfortable with visual code uh no problem you can still use Java and and still use the newer Frameworks um you know all of them are striving to do this uh the relative degree might be a little bit different you know some of them it's a lot easier some of them might be a little bit uh a little bit different okay so with that said let's briefly look at these three Frameworks um okay and and we'll get to the spring boot data and all that I don't know why this came here but but we'll worry about that in a second the idea is that with spring um you know they came up with this cool initializer right so where what you can do is you can you can specify the group The artifact the name uh description and all that and it automatically generate the pump for you okay you can say I want it in in Gradle uh what kind of language do I want groovy or kotlin um and and what kind of framework for spring boot um and then you can specify all the dependencies so here I most likely would add my uh Cassandra extension if it's there right so so you know things like that right and then it will generate the Palm XML and then you tweak that Palm XML to make it happen likewise with quarkus as well you know you kind of do the same thing um okay and quarkus has a little bit more support because we have Cassandra driver support for quarkus um and and you know again it's all reactive uh and and you know essentially like what Cedric was mentioning it leverages some of the other drivers you know especially for object mapping and all that um and with that said the last framework again Micronaut also has an initializer so all of them have initializers very similar you can see the same kind of thread running through right you know you can pick the Java version you can pick the base package you can pick the mic uh which Micronaut version which language um and so on so here's the Java version and so on I think we are leveraging Java 11 in this Workshop correct um so with that said um I know that we are going really really fast but the idea behind the idea you know this is this is like Java fast forwarded in 15 years right you know this is what we have been trying to do for a long time um but but you know we are getting there slowly but surely um especially in terms of ahead of time compilation uh and being able to use the tools that you're comfortable with um and and I'll point you at some resources if you if you really want to geek out on jit versus aot ahead of time compilation but but uh but again I recommend um you know it as a reading because I don't think we have too much time to go over it uh with that said uh what what should we uh do here Cedric should we let them play play with it or you want to show them a little bit and then I mean yeah why don't we pick one or two Frameworks or whatever and then yeah yeah don't take me away my my toy you know yeah yeah I know you're you're waiting yeah but I promise I will stick into uh 10 to 15 minutes just to be on time and have a time to play a game and I know that together and I know that has been putting a lot of plug plug in for himself but I'll put in a plug for him uh he's actually doing the same workshop at devox so if you want to see him in person um you know I recommend you go to Belgium yeah you know if you are lucky enough to get yourself exactly if you're lucky enough to get your ticket right exactly you'll be lucky enough to see Cedric but I think I think it's it's recorded I look at the devops the the previous year and it was it was because okay so let's see what we can show in 10 minutes so uh uh first uh notice you have three footworking app two three four spring Quakers micro note uh they are working normal mode and Native mode a native compilation uh so let's have a look so first spring um let's create a key space so remember best practice having a key space per app um because the the cloud secure bundle is per application and not per uh it's per database and not per key space you could share the cloud secure vendor among multiple application using different key spaces why because the token you are using can be limited to only one uh to be limited so long story short Cloud secure bundle will secure the connectivity uh the the the the pipe and using the token this is how you will get your permission just to only focus on what people can do so so in other words if you if you use a different database for the application then obviously you'll have to use the corresponding secure connect button yeah and you know we've asked how my my gut feeling is playing you should have won one database per app because what's the point two of multiple key space in a single database it's so easy to create new right it's just New Black skills it's not like you have multiple key space to maintain by yourself so and this is the same price it's the same resources because you were charged by data and not how many database are running so yeah I think good practice would be one database per app uh and remember you can have what 80 million requests before getting any uh trouble until then it's all free no trouble but ask to to provide a credit card to have more okay so here I created a new keyspace called ksks Spring to split things and I list my key spaces using the CLI so uh the the data layer in Spring It's called Spring data okay so if you want to see the pump uh I mean he will now that's the config file the problem okay if you want to open the pump uh here we go so here you have our uh spring boot because it's a spring boot app so not reactive here uh we could have used reactive but you know just we did not use it just matter of choice here just to get spring web for the rest API but you know put reactive here put web flux here and uh almost good to go uh okay so if you look at the sample file now application.yaml is what spring boot is using spring data as in on ski so it's expecting some keyspace name user password and creative not exist here I use that in production to not use that and because it's a data Stacks uh Astra thing I added the secure bundle here and with that I should be able to uh get stuff running and this is the difference between the Frameworks right you know like for example there's an application.dml but you know it's an application or properties when it comes to quarkus in a slight slight differences but you know it's not really um something that you know very hard to contend with exactly so here dedicated layer dedicated animation for the mapping okay because spring data has so many implementation for multiple databases and what they try to do is one single interface integration layer and multiple implementation one for each database but it's not as easy you know you cannot really remove all the discrepancies between the table because you end up with a common interface that doing almost nothing because all the juicy features of each database nosql database are part of the database so spring repo are good for a couple of uh create read up they delete basic operation but when it comes to read what you want to do is use inside spring data called something called Spring Castle operation this is your way to access the SQL session this is your way to to get full powered on what you can do with Castle so instead of using interface called repository like Castle repository I advise you to extend simple customer repository it's a complete class not an interface and now you will have access to this powerful secret session and now you can do everything you like and all the sample I've shown before can be able to use here if I want to run that with spring boot here it is and we can access the different API over here integration test and uh oh spring native here we could have ADD just a comment to run that in Spring native it's a maven package P native okay so here the the database running so I can open a new tab and show the preview and here we do have the app running but empty empty because I did not run the integration I mean yeah I mean the integration test should should run that to fill the database okay it's coming what about now okay I've run this guy uh this guy and just to again one um you know people who are attending the workshop uh the uh the pads for the API is a little bit different uh but but you know again it's an exercise to the reader to figure it out oh yeah oh yeah so I'll open a new terminal I need to provide by the token and then I could execute some tests so connectivity I did that uh spring data repo this guy will create me some stuff I think yes so here I go and uh probably this one as well would create me some stuff so oh this failure wants to do yeah that's the point moving too fast but I do wrong oh I know when I execute an integration test I start the app the app is already running so the thought is already in use and uh right right it's a good part yeah right yeah it told me that it's already running of course uh yeah but anyway it's just and and very very similar for caucus and Micronaut as well quarcus has like a Dev plugin that we leverage um you know so so you know but but in in principle it's it's still the same and you can see there aot mode enabled you know so so it kind of gives you if you if you get some time you know kind of walk through that um okay so you want to fix the build failure on as we go or uh you want to show me that the user and password provided while not correct they just just Echo the token again you know just to make sure yeah yeah I think it just matter of talking yeah I equal the token there are not another place it's it's probably a matter yeah I'll just go to the other uh terminal window and try it out there yeah yeah just just a matter of uh you know the token that isn't there same as men as good as an issue so okay so moving um and to be in a spring data is the only I mean spring is the only stock that decided to re-implement uh an abstraction on top of the existing object mapper just to have this common interface across multiple database with the good find all find by ID save delete and The Ugly fight all doing a full scan of your table when you save an object we feel as null it could insert some Tombstone uh by default spring data does not prepare the statement so it's uh it's great power but you still need to understand how the drivers work under the hood otherwise you are eating all the all the pitfalls so what do they say with great power comes great responsibility right so yeah exactly I mean it's a quackery simply use uh Quakers Cassandra client also created by uh by by data Stacks peeps um and because it says we make things uh light and simple just provide the keys uh same Keys as you would use in application.com you can still provide application.conf uh so here what we told you to do was to create a new key space a new key space Quakers was to set up features here and just execute the quarkus code and if you look in the quarkus database interaction it's only C Cassandra it's the mapper exactly what we show you in the slide it's the regular mapper nothing special and in the rest controller the quarries Rex controller so this time you application spoke a scope and not Services path and not requests it's it's not it's a spring inject and not Auto wire here you got your you got your API and you will simply inject session in the controller and use it to access your services now to compile a native with Quakers so here the object mapping in quack uses are the same work is provider dashboard web uh Swagger UI web out of the box with the qdev sessions super cool and to build a native image here you have set up the pump for you so you can generate the pump by just executing the command there clean package uh Native do you want to run that and let it run in the background because I know it takes like a quite some time right I mean I can but now I'm in a code token let me see if I uh my my token okay yes it's there so right yeah yes left three you're correct I also created my uh key space right not sure if it did but just to be sure yeah we need the we need the key space workers we need to token both are okay and now I can start the the native competition and let it go in the background let's see and yeah during during that time it's working we can go to a micro note which is we created a dedicated micro load key space okay and we look at the micronut code and same as is not Reinventing the wheel micro nut does have a data layer called micro not data but here we don't have to use it with Castle Rock if you go there is a plugin called micro node casana so if you look at the dependencies in Microsoft this is what we use Micronaut Castle directly reusing the data Stacks drivers and when it's cool in the so Microsoft Cassandra over here using the drivers as is and with micro load everything is annotation driven so during the compiling time you want to get The mapper annotation processing injection annotation processing validation and Native compilation in the end so let's see yeah 3.7 it's building the native image native image in three spring practice and Micronaut take some time because it's analyzing the different path you need to have in the executable and only put there what's needed so if you have some reflection in your code by this default it will not be in your executable so you have to provide Ins at compile time to make sure that the native computation is working exactly yeah and and okay you can see it's working which is a good sign I mean we still haven't seen any failure or whatever um so with that said maybe we should yeah yeah I've used all my the time you gave to me so I got back to you for the game all right okay so let's move on um let me okay so this is the workshop you've already seen this before but but you know just in case you missed it github.com data Stacks devs there's a whole bunch of workshops that are available uh you know you can kind of play with them um but I also have an intro to quarcus and Cassandra you're welcome to try that as well um with that said moving on hold on okay um inferior queue had a few articles um you know about about all this native compilation aot compilation and so on um so so take a look at that um it's it's pretty it's this the series itself is pretty it's pretty good um you know it has quarkus as you may expect it has spring native uh and so on and so forth okay so so take a look at that um but let's move on to menti here and then I'll have a few more slides to kind of finish up wrap this whole thing up okay so let me go to mentee all right again the code is 4201 -4183 okay okay let me see if I can make it like a presentation all right let's go present see what happens okay so full screen this is good four two zero one four one eight three okay all right let's see how many people are gonna join let's see it's a good chance of winning is good chance of winning swag right I think that's the plus side of it right yes exactly if you stay with us keep coming I'll let people join I know there are more people here so let's give it a couple minutes and of course we should yeah we should know the names because yeah those are the folks let me start some music to warm ourselves up um just give me a second if I can find that music if it's too loud please let me know I will soften it a little bit all right okay I'm gonna start my first question good ready to go again don't look at you know the web or don't look at the slides look look down at your phones and it will give you all the instructions right there okay so I'm gonna start my first question baby [Music] answer fast but more importantly answer correctly what database did we use today its database as a service we may have used all of them but none of them what do you think all right time's up let's see how many people wow nobody got it wrong [Music] I'm not too busy too easy but but again it depends on how quickly you answer to so let's see who answered really quickly all right leaderboard always exciting to see the leaderboard animator he's on top of the game but yes mean or Meow or actually you know any of them can displace the animator so let's see what's going on question two of six answer fast but most importantly correctly I think this is easy too right we discussed a lot of Frameworks but what framework I don't think we discussed a whole lot although we just mentioned it [Music] was a spring was it quartus was it microphone [Music] time's up uh uh I think we got I don't know if I discussed quarkus too much we even built the um native image in Quakers right so so anyway uh let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up here [Music] animator is still a very thin lead uh yes we moved up whip also I think mood up free also kind of Buddha right so it's anybody's game we still have a few more left next question question three of six again [Music] be fast but be right native Generation image generation requires of course you need all of the VMS but which VM you need in particular [Music] all right let's see how this shapes up [Music] wow yes of course Java VM is required but you know actually maybe not even um yeah Java VM is required but the cloud VM is more important you know to to uh generate an native image um so I know that Edmund you had a comment about some explanation of quarcus and crawl for another Workshop um do you want to talk a little bit about the gravel VM or should we just keep going on the on the twist enough of talking uh yeah I mean I can I can say a few words so um the purpose here is to leverage on uh the second population in the gvm called C2 which is the the you know second time compilation the ID is to build uh some native uh our system binaries executable that could run on any platforms really binaries get rid of the gvm requirements and with that because you only shipped what you need reduce the footprint in memory and also reduce the startup time so everything is done for the performance the idea is first to be able to run your delivers anywhere everywhere but also the the ID under the hood is why not having your the developers running as a function and doing some function as a service Java used to be considered as 2av to do this kind of function of your teeth code now with Native compilation we have some you know blazing fast and super small assets that can totally be used as uh as functions so yeah this is totally what's Reddit with Quakers is pushing and this is also the reason why uh spring with spring native going back there uh and you know getting so much energy on the Google thing yeah exactly yeah and I think it's also worth mentioning that you know you can use the ground VM with other languages as well not necessarily Java but you know since we only have Java or mostly have Java programmers here let's see how the leaderboard is shaping out maybe animator is still holding on to the thin lead that's mean is making her move so we'll see what happens with the next few questions question four of six [Music] fast correct what does aot stand for I mean there may be any number of abbreviations but based on the workshop Astra online token always on time ahead of time an avoidance of trouble spots hot spots whatever all right wow you got quite a few ahead of time okay let's see how the leaderboard is shaped out this is close isn't it yes mean makes one more step up or no it's about the same in the top okay okay moving on animator was the fastest again all right two more just bear with us and you will be ready to get some swag which framework considered native image as experimental micronard is a quarkus is it halidon spring or is it doctor general [Music] you only have three people answering this four it's in the pump uh so yeah spoiler it's not cheeky it's not Jacob it's not um I cannot either right um yep uh spring native is really experimental and I can tell you that some spring data castle with Native is not walking as you were very well yet if you want to go native as of now I will advise to go with caucus and microns but I'm sure you know pretty soon it will be uh more ubiquitous right so yeah yeah swim got it right so uh it feels like Sven is gonna take over the leaderboard and not yet oh okay all right Sven was the fastest this one was correct all right we have one more I think this is the last question for all the marbles let's try to finish this up one more yeah which framework leverages The annotation process very heavily this is a tough one like Cedric I know you mentioned this couple of times I tried to I was aware of the I was aware of the questions nobody got it we need to better job at this are you kidding me oh okay okay that's a very tough question so Cedric Wednesday the price let's see you know okay I should have participated then I would get the T-shirt yeah [Music] all right so here's what you're gonna do if you're um you know one of three uh or is it one of four one of three right um just take a screenshot okay this cannot be the screenshot that's shown here uh but take a screenshot on your phone uh it will tell you that you are number one number two number three whatever right um and and we have a process and I will explain that in a second okay so the quiz on mentee is done um thanks everyone for participating um the swag winners who are on first second and third place go to dtxx.io datastacks.io slash Workshop swag okay again send us the screen not from you know the presentation that we showed but really from from your own screen okay so take a screenshot and send it to this particular form uh again you know this has changed a little bit recently um but you know it's been quite a few workshops since this is the process and you should we should be able to ship it to anywhere in the world really right yes all right uh I know that there is a lot of chatting going on um you know or I should say quite a bit of chatting you know sometimes we've had really a lot of chatting but uh but I think we had the right amount of chatting today uh but but again the pointing is if you want a longer term conversation um just jump on discard you know we try to make it a practice not doesn't always work to kind of go in and look for uh uh you know the the questions that are more related to adoption and so on um and and not only us the entire data stacks you know company uh kind of helps out here so feel free to ask more technical questions there uh feel free to again um you know jump and attend some of our workshops on very diverse topics um so you know um intro to nosql is probably our most popular um we have a partner Workshop coming up in like a couple of weeks which is really about long term how can you deal with long-term attacks and why you know you know Cassandra is is good for those kind of use cases you know short-term attacks you can really use any database but for longer term attacks you need something a little different okay we have some really cool badges and and for whatever reason you know these are extremely popular amongst your community uh you can put it on LinkedIn brag about it and and uh um you know as one of my colleagues says uh supposedly you will see a a raise in your salary you know no guarantees here but but you know you can you can try it out and and if you haven't given us a thumbs up on YouTube you know that would be appreciated as well you want to be in person I know Cedric is going to be in Belgium next week but we have yeah yeah cannot wait to be yeah yeah absolutely that's Christmas for me yes and I know the Cedric has been trying for a long time right so so very cool uh don't say that okay okay yeah but but you know it's fun um London Amsterdam I'm going there yeah Santa Clara Seattle Houston hanai Jakarta Singapore we're all over the world and I know that there are people attending so please please please tell your friends and family to you know to make this uh in-person events uh a success um we have the Cassandra Summit also coming back next month I mean next year in person uh it's March 13th 14th and it's already set up for McNairy Convention Center in San Jose uh there's gonna be a training day in person there's also a hybrid portion which is virtual uh and the cfp and registration are coming really really soon uh with that said uh I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart uh for attending this I know that it's not easy to devote two hours but but again feel free to look at the recording if you missed something or jump into other workshops as well um and that's it thanks from my side yep thank you very much and see you next week what are we doing next week next week's October 12th um uh e-commerce it's an e-commerce application yes and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of Cassandra who grew those Powers until she can multiply it will move with Limitless speed and unmasked hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers of all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
