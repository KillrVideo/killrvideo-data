    "text": "uh today um you know uh we're gonna be setting up a few things um but just to give you the right tools uh you're using git pod uh you'll see that in a second and this is going to pull down the code from github and it's going to run everything for you you don't have to bring your own laptop in fact i've done this presentation on a tablet via getpod you can watch this on youtube on twitch and if you have questions you can ask on youtube live twitch as well as discord um some of my team members data sex team members cedric um and a few other folks are there as moderators to help you if you have specific questions absolutely so uh did you want to add anything else cedric before we move on no i feel like okay so we do have the streams both on youtube and twitch as usual to do the exercise today you can go git pod everything will be set up for you the full eclipse running keep asking question and discord and as usual all the materials are available on discord and you can download everything excellent thank you so first thing we'd like you to do is to go ahead and launch getpod and all you need to do is go to the repo link which is also on youtube live and i'll just show you very quickly what that should look like and at the very top after you get here there's a button called open in get pod just click on that and um i had run this uh earlier um but i have a workshop sorry a container that's already running i'm gonna go ahead and delete it and i'm gonna just start a a fresh workshop and this is just to show you that i'm starting fresh i don't have anything here from before i'm in the same exact place that you guys are going to start off on right so let's take some time it's building out our environment let it go and you know pretty soon what you should see is a ide that looks similar to visual studio code but it's not visual studio code it's made by the people that made eclipse thea which is an open source eclipse on the web um and it's actually visual studio code uh extensions compatible um anyways those people have made this service called getpod it's amazing it's really good we've been doing more and more development with it i recommend it for your personal projects maybe even for your work projects um why are we building this app right we're building this you know this app uh with the event driven toolkit uh why right is this just a toy toy project for us no it's not we're actually um building this uh application called leaves um to manage knowledge within our company i know there's a lot of tools out there but this is a way for us to not only build software and learn how to scale it but also to experiment with new technologies right at work we're not always able to with our clients not able to be able to suggest the brand new technologies on our projects we can play with whatever we want our knowledge base um it's just a way to organize links and collections and share them with people um you know how do we use it well beyond us sharing knowledge internally we generate websites with this so cassandra.link is a website that we run uh you can go to it i would say it's the best online knowledge base outside of data stacks uh but it it's a third-party neutral site we uh you know curate content there's blog feeds it's basically the new planet cassandra um and this is that makes it a very important part of our business to be able to to publish this website on a daily basis and to scale this website um now this is just the type of the iceberg we have other knowledge based sites that we're going to be publishing along the way right now we're focused on cassandra we use a combination of open source technologies that run on php and mysql and then we have code that copies data to cassandra to solar yada yada right it's a complicated infrastructure it is all on containers and it's pretty much all serverless but we want to move away from my sequel and we're going over uh up to 100 percent uh astra 100 cassandra we're going to be moving away from rabbit mq uh and redis as a as a simple q to kafka because we want to make this an example application that people can use and and get their hands dirty with event driven architectures you're going to see this picture again because we're going to help you build out this whole application and as you can see uh we're using data sets astra to power apis and um as well as statically generated websites currently we're focused on just cassandra and just rest apis today why do services or why do apis or why do microservices on cassandra um cedric is actually going to go deeper into cassandra fundamentals but for for why we love cassandra for microservices uh and and apis well normally in the microservices architecture which is very popular uh these days normally everybody has a different database for each service whereas in cassandra world we can set up a new key space a new data center and essentially have isolated deployments in one infrastructure in one cluster for the whole platform and have a standardized platform and because it's multi-model even even without data stacks enterprise it's got json support it's got you know tabular data support there's a lot there that we don't have to go to other databases basically that's why we like using designer i'm going to give you a quick overview of what is rest versus what is a microservice and what is event driven architecture they're related but they're not all the same in our transition uh in the last five to ten years as we've seen clients transition and go through digital transformations the technical architecture of their platforms has gone from monolith to microservices and it was first called you know services oriented architecture but still those um you know soa platforms are pretty bulk bulky and heavy the main principles of going from monolith to microservice is that we make things composable we make things smaller more iterable with smaller teams in a monolithic application you have everything spaghetti code on a couple of different databases uh you may have uh you know two or three different layers but eventually as you start to go from monolith to everything distributed what we end up having is more flexibility more scale uh i mean you look at google they'll push out a little feature a beta feature to a certain group of people to validate it and if it works well they push it out to everybody that wouldn't be possible if they weren't using a microservices architecture of course what goes with with microservices architecture is a little bit more work and the you know the work is generally on how you design the the system how you design the messages and how do you connect everything together right if it's one application everything is just being passed through function calls when you start to get distributed then you have to make api calls and so let's talk about rest api so rest uh i'm not gonna read through the whole thing you guys all know what rest is but for our case rest is just representational state transfer it is used to move a state from one database to another database right just at the end of the day you when you call a rest api you're getting the state of that system at that point and there are some verbs that are standardized um built on top of rest are graphql hedios has different mechanisms but for the most part rest is just http based apis rest helps with microservices because you can create a microservice with rest and have another rest api use that microservice well what is a microservice a microservice is a loosely uh well microservices architecture are loosely coupled with other services um they're small they're they could be rest but they could also be in pqp or kafka it's up to the designer the architect of the system to decide do we want microservices with rest do we want microservices with kafka or let's say rabbitmq because in rest we have synchronous communication in uh cues we have asynchronous communication generally as i mentioned earlier they have their own database right they have their own devops and things are brought together using the saga pattern that things go from one microservice to another microservices to another service until things are done yes this is great yes also so today would be mostly rest but now as end point we do have people doing as well graphql or grpc any new way to expose endpoints but that's still http and now if http can go sync async and reactive absolutely absolutely and you know and this is really for the future is that once we have rest um and we have rest microservices we may want to scale this and the best way to scale systems is through asynchronous distributed platforms and to make a rest api more scalable essentially the best thing we can do is to introduce cues uh actually adding event driven or events an event source not only makes the api more scalable it actually makes it easier to integrate sagas into that uh that whole flow of information um and so event driven just means that everything that is happening in a system is broken down into either a command and that's the event-driven part but on the request side uh it is coming directly from a data store and so this architectural pattern command query request segregation is uh one of the the uh the most well-known patterns used in event-driven architecture in microservices architecture um and actually cassandra helps with that uh cassandra helps with that tremendously because it it moves information and can help us materialize certain types of information for us i'm going to go ahead and pass it to cedric now who's going to walk us through some fundamentals of cassandra here you go yes thank you very much so let me take over here all right so back to the fundamentals of cassandra as usual i will make it quick today because this is mostly you roll working so let's move forward apache cassandra is a distributed nosql database every word is very important so it's distributed you can install cassandra on a single node a single node can hold about one terabyte uh you can do more customer won't block you to do more but it will get slower what we want to have is nice little node one terabyte and up to three thousand transaction per second and per core it's distributed so we want you to have multiple nodes okay all these nodes communicate to each other using a protocol called gossiping and in there there is no master nodes are grouped with something called a data center or a ring as you can see here and so what can you do with those rings okay okay let me see something here let me see something here just want to check something too okay for some reason yeah let me go back here all right that's better all right so this is the ring we want to build okay multiple nodes and each node have one terabyte of data what do you want to do with that well if you need more capacity add new nodes and if you need more throughputs add new nodes okay so i don't don't look at the database from other colors what i would like to understand is the more throughput the more capacity you need you can cassandra makes sense because it's scale linearly like that okay data is distributed that mean even if a small data set like that i would say 15 record we will spot one of the columns and we will name that a partition key and data will be distributed based on the value of the partition key okay look at the column here in red data has distributed based on this value and even with this very first slide you can realize that doing a select star from a customer table is not a good idea because you are doing a full scan of your cluster this is not what you want right all right and so you may immediately realize that you should have a where clause and in the where clause you provide the value for the red colon and it's called a partition key okay so now let's say we do have our token range which is part of the value evenly distributed around the cluster okay we don't store the full value you know the red column the full value we store a hashed value of this one which is called a token so each node is in charge of a token range now i'm a client and i want to insert a data in there at the client level the data will be asked okay providing a token 59 the token will be addressed to any i mean this data will be sent to any node there is no master the node becomes the coordinator for this request and only for this this way is not master slave just coordinator for this request it's not in charge of the of 59 it will simply send the data to the proper replica like that and now the proper replica of your data so data is distributed evenly distributed data are balanced among the node just for them to work and with the same you know cpu you don't want to have a single node to have all the data fine but the data is also replicated we defined something called a replication factor how many times does the data is replicated if i put three my data is available in three nodes replicated three times and this is what i marked with the little colors here and there all right now if i need to add a value then the coordinator node will push the data into the three nodes like that nice so there is no master data is replicated what does that mean that means i can lose any of the node it's not a big deal what happened now the data will be sent to the two remaining nodes and it will store locally with something called a hint and when the node goes back online i can put it back the data and the system is self-healing and recover from this okay so i show you some distribution some little ring data center in a cassandra cluster you can have multiple rings so let's you can have some first deployments using geographic distribution having one ring in multiple region you can read and write from everywhere and cassandra will do the replication for you you don't have to worry it's two-way synchronization you don't have to copy data on your own it's done for you also in cassandra there is something called key space which is kind of oracle schema and per key space you define how the data is replicated so you can have key spaces where data is only located in europe you know gdpr or regulation law and you can have also key space distributed all across the world all part of the same customer cluster and noah we show you a little note here but big web giant like apple instagram uber all using cassandra for those reasons and they do have hundreds of thousands of nodes so apple for instance i've come in as communicated that is uh apple we have 175 000 nodes available not part of the same cluster but that's still 12 petabyte available online and if the network is not great bit in between the data center not a big deal cassandra will replicate when the bandwidth is there what you can do with geographic distribution you can also do it with hybrid and multi-cloud what about having one data center in each cloud provider and also one on premise you do have the same data layer available everywhere with everything i told you you can remind the cip terrorim available in distributed system telling that in a distributed system you cannot ensure consistency availability and network partition tolerance at the same times network partition tolerance means if i lose the network betw between the nodes what will happen well if you do have a master slave architectures if you lost the network part of the network won't have the master and then we elect a new master and when the network goes back online now in your cluster you do have two masters and so this is what we call a split brain problem and we need to figure it out which is a proper master now so in cassandra there is no master and remember the data is replicated you can lose any of the nodes so availability the thing and also partition tolerance by default customize ap don't worry bap now by configuration query per query you can set oh i don't i want my query to be less available and more consistent and it's done with something called a consistency level and it's done per request okay i won't go into all the detail about consistency level today it's it's today it's packed off ends on uh but you know you can get that you can also ensure consistency with customer if you provide the proper consistency level and will of that architectures and capabilities this is the slide as an architect you want to know what are the proper use case for customer first you want to use the scalability capability you can scale as much as you want so this is used for high throughput as volume heavy read every whites and use case you know you know event streamings internet of things analytics anything related to time series if you have already heard about customer this is probably in those use case time series event streaming ii volume why because not only customer is very fast to write data but because it scale as much as you need second range of use case is about the availability i told you data is replicated and this is small nodes kind of community hardware right you can lose any of the node and as such the system is still there still available no data loss and always on and you know if you are really really in hostile environment you can even increase the replication factor like you can lose multiple nodes and it's still okay i mean for the node that allows always on i mean all users are correct i put you some caching market data pricing inventory you know what about having the market data in a cassandra cluster in the morning you know you dump all the market data of the day it will replicate all across the world and now everybody needs market data we simply read a node close to him reducing latencies and have the same things everywhere and you don't have to copy cassandra do it for you and by the way there is also ttl on the value so you can say this is that it's for today okay distributed okay i told you you remember geographic distribution uh technical distribution okay gdpr compliant i can have a key space located to one node or one location and okay everything related all the global company would need that okay i told you about uber instagram apple it's mostly because it's all distributed and global companies and it's cloud native you know ap commodity hardware anything modern cloud application would like to use that capability cassandra can be deployed in kubernetes with some operators now and so it's very open to any use case for e-bleed cloud multi-cloud all right so cassandra is nice okay can do a lot of stuff in the cloud what about providing you today cassandra as a service in the cloud you don't have to install anything for the endzone and for that we will use astra astra is cassandra as a service provided by datastax and in there there is a free tier so you can create your instance for free it will stay there you don't have to provide any payroll any credit card so astra is as i told you cassandra in the cloud ready for you and also extra services like data stack studio with notebooks to do exercise to do cassandra query language queries start working on your data model write in astra and don't have to install any tools and because it's as a service you don't have any operation to maintain it's all secured and it's of course simplify the app development and this is what is today for okay so with a star you can use sql there is tools and you can use all the drivers so as you can see multiple drivers and today we will use the drivers the python drivers and the node gs drivers to connect to astra to insert data and retrieve data and you know implement a full waste api on top of astra so why use astra well as you can see nothing to install ready to go you can create your key space you don't have anything to to uh you don't have anything to to operate after that and you know there is a free tier and of course it can scale if you need to all right and now let's go all together and launch your astra instance so in the show notes of the video i provide you step-by-step tutorials to set up your astra instance if you already have your astra instance you simply can reuse it and go to hands-on mode with raul and you know during the time you are starting your lunch astra i will end over to back to raul great thank you cedric appreciate that um you know uh before i go into lunch at astra i uh whenever i interview people uh for their contender knowledge for our team or for our clients i see if they can explain cassandra to me in 30 minutes you just did that in about 10 minutes yeah but that's my job [Laughter] i tell people cassandra's really not that complicated you can you can pretty much explain it you know in 10 to 15 minutes um yes so uh you know as uh cedric mentioned um you know astra makes the development process a lot easier um and you know what it what it does for us is um really just focus it allows us to focus on iterating the product iterating the service and not the infrastructure of the data um we love cassandra we know how to use it we have scripts for data stacks for cassandra for uh for terraform and ansible and docker and nowadays kubernetes is out there that's great for a lot of companies that have the team members to to do this properly but uh if you're starting out something or you want to prototype something even in a large company this is way better it's way faster to get started when we start astra the first thing that i'm going to actually log off and show you if you go to astra.datastax.com um you know essentially you'll see the screen like this to either sign in or register um i have been a astra user from before they added the social sign on uh with google and the uh and github but so i have an old school email account and when we sign in you know really all you have to do is hit new database i already have a free account set up here so i'm not going to make another one um and you know you'll just choose the free tier this will be selected for you and you know give it a database name whatever you want in in our case the database uh is called anat uh if you know i think it's called a not uh no it's called platform and then the key space is called knowledge right um the username it's arbitrary right um you can call it uh whatever you want um the password it it's important that you have a good password but it doesn't have to be super complicated in fact my password i'll just give it to you it's one two three four five six uh why am i so cavalier with it well as you'll see when we have a database on astra the only way to connect to it is via a secure certificate bundle in a zip file and that's what we're going to use to actually connect to astra without that certificate you cannot connect to this cluster end of story right um so that's why it's okay just just pick a good uh you know password but it doesn't have to be 16 characters with you know alphanumeric and caps and numbers um it takes some time for this um cluster to start um sometimes i've gotten a cluster in about a couple of minutes sometimes taking about 10 minutes but essentially you should see one database on one cluster and when you click on view database or when you click on actions you see a couple of different menu items when you click on view database yes sure is that better guys yeah a bit bigger that's better thank you all right um yeah so you should see uh the you know the main view database screen has the connection details uh it actually has some rest apis already generated there's a graphql api already generated and that's very useful um because it just gives you direct access to the data the type of apis we're creating we're being selective in terms of what we're giving back to the api endpoint user there's also something called developer studio where we'll verify a few things there's a cql console where we can log in right so it just it takes some time just you know let this go and you know just as as uh the systems uh are getting created for you i'll go back to this picture that i showed you earlier so you know a little bit about rast microservices of adventure event driven architecture uh cedric has given you a really solid basic understanding of cassandra and the the goal is for us to leverage cassandra as data comes in we're going to continue just relying on cassandra to scale linearly right more data comes in we can scale it more requests come in for data we can scale and we don't have to worry about it because of the way it distributes the load automatically we can have any of those nodes as a coordinator any of those nodes uh can be uh down and other nodes will take that traffic right so we don't have to have any load balancer it is already going to scale as long as we have a good data model it's going to scale right um and the the apis that we're going to create uh today uh are really focused on an individual item we're not really materializing any uh we're not doing a quarry table for example today we're just focused on a object table where if i have the id for an object we're gonna be able to retrieve it you just went through this setup earlier and you know if if you have uh if it does take you a little bit longer um everything that i'm showing you is on the readme for this repository screenshot by screenshot there's also a blog post there's a video from before and then after this session is over this video will replace that video so um rest assured that if you're you know taking a little bit longer you can come back and everything will be here some resources for you these are the same resources that our team used to create this application in fact uh um the people that were contributing to this project in our team are fairly new to cassandra you know they they're they're developers that just started using cassandra recently and so they were learning uh how to do cassandra with espress and how to do cassandra with flask so what you see is a end result of new people learning how to do this and we learned all this stuff online so you go to center.link you'll see a bunch of you know curated links you can search things as well as cassandra.tools um but if you have any questions feel free to you know reach out to us uh later uh or on the chat today uh some of our team members that help build this are on the discord and twitch chat um just ask a question and they'll help you out now i need to jump in come on this cassandra dot link is very something you should go there this is now the go to we just do have planet cassandra.org it's not there anymore that's really cassandra.link you do have i don't know rss to be updated and also awesome cassandra you got you know all the tools out there all the best blog posts you know that's that's really a resource you should love region and add that has tax when we do have something to share we communicate you know we send that to raul to put that on the website as well railroad and his team is actually uh you know administrating all this platform and doing all the stuff to have this ready for you thank you for that thanks for the shout out cedric um yes it's uh it's definitely a passion project and it brings us a lot of uh you know um joy in in making this um it really we love to we love the technology but we love telling people about it too [Laughter] [Music] all right so the hands-on portion of the workshop uh as you had seen earlier um you're gonna end up with two apis one in python one in uh node um you're gonna have actually in addition to that there are some uh tests in a node to validate that the apis are working both the python and the rest apis in node um we're doing everything except for postman we're doing everything in the browser with gitpod with data stacks developer studio and in fact postman um there are some web-based tools as well but postman happens to be the most common tool that people know about you know checking out apis there's a template on the repository which you can download and import into postspin and so that you'll have all that populated just a quick uh tutorial or sorry a quick tour of the github ide um as i mentioned earlier it looks like visual studio um when you open a repository in gitpod uh if it's a open source repository which ours is it will be free for you and you can use it for up to 50 hours um and there's no limitation um in the terminal when you run things like a node program or a python program if uh it exposes a port like port 8080 or port 8000 or port 80 itself um it will run the service and it'll say you want to expose this port and immediately you will have a url that you can use from the whole internet right so this makes development a lot easier uh our team started out the development of this api in docker and then we were able to start doing the rest of it on github in fact gitpod is using our dockerfile a custom docker file to get this up and running so the code base on cassandra.api is organized in four main folders right there is a folder for the importer there's a folder for the credentials where we'll download and we'll add our credentials there is a folder for the api the uh there's also a note api and a python api there the ui is coming don't worry about this but there's also ui that talks to these apis to see and edit this information but today we're just focusing on the on the api to follow along um you know you have already set up the database hopefully um the first thing that we're gonna do is download the credentials and save those to the to our workshop and the way we're going to do that is by going to our astra cluster this is our dashboard and i can either hit connection details here and it brings up this modal dialog like this or in the screenshots uh you can click on the cluster and the connection details are here what we're going to do is we're going to download this secure connect bundle yes so don't you may want to refresh the page before downloading the bundle because the link is available for five minutes just a trick thank you cedric i appreciate that um and i have a folder here i'm just saving it i've had it from before but i'm gonna go ahead and save it and once i have it on my desktop and my folder um the way to get it to my git pod repository is you know fairly straightforward [Music] let me make sure i can looks like if i leave my git pod for a second sometimes it goes on pause but because it's already been pulled out earlier it takes about five seconds for it to come back up one nice thing about getpod is that if i want to put files into my workspace i can just drag my file in there right so here's my zip file that i downloaded i can just drag it into cassandra.com astro.credentials it's uploaded it's right here um you can also right click on this and just upload um let's see upload files right um just you know treat it like you would any other desktop application i'm going to increase my screen size hopefully this is good there we go okay when you're starting off in git pod you have a linux shell um inside that anything you could do on mac os x or linux you can do here right um we're able to edit any of the files in here so the first thing that we're going to edit in the astro credentials is the username password cluster name etc right in the instructions you know we say try not to use hyphens or underscores you can actually use both it's just that the way we're doing the tutorial and relying on a very simple workflow there's some stuff that we have to fix before you can do that so don't worry about that right now so username my username here is just not admin uh my password i told you earlier is very simple i like this password it's almost as good as qw erty um cluster we have platform that's the name of our cluster our key space is the as well we called it knowledge and right now i don't have any tables in my cluster i can just go verify that by going to cql console let me see if i can i don't think i can zoom into this much and i'm using standard cql commands here in the cql console so we see there's a knowledge key space i can use use knowledge semicolon and let's see what tables we have so it's empty there's no yeah raoul i do have a couple of questions on the chat now so one is which framework do you use to create the the micro service so not only the language but also maybe the the the framework names and second question will be is it part of the lambda architectures gotcha that's a really good question the first question we're using for now as a just a reference example python specifically flask on python we thought about using django but django is a little bit heavier we just wanted to focus on the rest api and then on node it's basically javascript you can also use typescript but it's nodejs with the express framework as the middle layer now could we use lambda architecture um so lambda architecture is different from aws lambda lambda architecture is about having a stream of information coming in being processed as well as that all that data being saved but then the batch process is able to reconcile reconcile all of the stream data that's lambda architecture can this be used with lambda architecture uh absolutely um but we haven't gotten to the stream processing yet right the i think what you may be uh asking is can we use aws lambda with this absolutely you can create javascript functions in aws lambda that use basically javascript the cassandra driver for javascript and do the same thing the workflow will be different in that you're just going to focus on what um the request is and what the response is and then aws lambda takes care of the routing and the endpoint for the api uh deploying all the functions we do have that as a future goal after we do the whole workshop to come back and say can we make everything serverless including the um the processing code and the api code but not today hopefully that answers your question i think you did i would just add something so to my knowledge in the london architecture there are three layers speed layers batch layers and restitution layers so speed layers is indeed about ingesting events in real time and you know kafka slash cassandra fit this use case and this is what we are discussing about and on the restitution layer it's most of the time also synchronous call to get back the data once it has been reconciliated by the batch layer so in a sense it can be used in two layers of the lambda architectures absolutely absolutely thank you for that clarification yeah um and it actually gives us a lot of flexibility uh um when using cassandra you can have multiple data centers where you have a speed layer on one coming in and you can have another data center where you're constantly reconciling at the same time right yeah um so absolutely all right so uh going back to this you know just taking a look at my database i don't have any databases another thing i want to do is log in to the developer studio and i can go to the developer studio by going to platform and clicking on developer studio and developer studio is is a trim down version of the a cd studio it's a notebook style a web interface that essentially allows us to interactively query and visualize some information so i'm going to delete this old notebook and i'm going to make a new one so you can see how we're doing this i'm just going to call this knowledge i have an existing connection from before if for the first time you're logging in it's going to ask you for credentials just the user and password and it will set up a connection profile for you once i'm connected i can select cql um in this particular key space knowledge um and i don't have any tables in here but what i can do is see my schema over here right i've got my key space knowledge i've got my table i don't have any tables in there right now okay all right so after we have our credentials saved okay next thing we're going to do is we're going to import data into our cluster and that importer is actually going to create our schema in there as well so the importer is in this astro.import directory uh the table that it's creating uh let's take a quick look at it quick peek at this this how about that is that better sure so our table is um you know probably roughly 20 columns um and there are some collections in here um some time stamps some boolean um but essentially it's a mirror of the api that we already have running on mysql okay and earlier what we were doing is we were indexing that data into solar and then the solar was also providing some of that api well the code rest to astra initially was using that rest api um downloading it and one by one importing it into cassandra what we did uh in order to not to bring down our um uh cluster our search stack solar cluster we we just downloaded about a thousand records just the standard api call um and saved it now this code uh if you were to um you know replace this with get uh you know data from a url rest api it would it would work exactly the same okay and in our case uh we're gonna send in a thousand documents uh a thousand rows uh excuse me a thousand partitions um and this this is a fairly simple uh importer it just goes through does some validation of each of the fields um we're doing basic data engineering saying if there's no you know value here for the preview picture let's use a dummy image for example um and to run this script we need to have some prerequisites right so the prerequisites for us if you click on the data migrator are the cassandra driver and the request driver so we're going to copy this command here and i'm just going to paste it and looks like it's installed then other command i'm going to run is pip3 install requests okay and that's done so to run my importer i'm gonna type in python three that's the version python we're using although we could probably just type python astra.import rest to astral uh let's see it gave us a an issue oh i did not finish um what i was doing earlier i needed to give a url so i'm just going to i need to give it a name for this table i'm going to call this urls and i'm going to go back and make sure that when i refresh this i don't have any old tables in here yep good all right sorry about that um let's go ahead and run the import order again all right connected um it verified that we're running essentially cassandra 4-0 inside astra and it just iterated over in bunches of 100 records and inserted them into a cassandra the code to inserting the cassandra it seems very familiar to those that are familiar with sql but this is not sql and the other really useful thing that's happening here is we were able to insert into our table direct json right we download json from a rest api saved it to disk in our case but we could just as well have taken it from an api and verified it and then send it directly into cassandra and to verify that we have this data inside astra if we go back to datastack studio we'll see that the urls table got created uh all of these columns got created and i'm gonna do a select i'm not gonna get well you know what fine i'll just do select star from where else yeah this is the data stack studio nice and there's right now um let's see nine pages of results with about you know 10 rows each it's about 100 rows in here if we look at the the data some of it is in tabular form others are in this form right here which is a collection and we've verified that our data is in cassandra and if you're skeptical about this dse studio and you just like the the cql console which i can't seem to zoom in so just bear with me i'm just proving to you that in the cql if i use the same key space which is called knowledge not key spaces and i do select star from urls there's a lot of data in there so i'm gonna just do ctrl c and say limit one and that's one partition one row that is stored in here right so we're done with the import process and i'm going to go back and move on to the next so now that we have data in there let's talk a little bit about the the node api right what does it look like uh before we go ahead and start it so the node api is just like you know any other node api that you would write um with express except that we're using a the cassandra driver and we're passing it a secure connect bundle um in our credentials the rest of the the work in node it should not be that much different from  or mysql or postgres it should be almost exactly the same um and when we look at the layers of the code where we're retrieving information or we're deleting information um it looks just like sql so in this case we know earlier we had a key space called killer video and we're using leaves as a table name we can say give me everything from the table uh and since node.js is javascript uh it was able to take that result set and directly send it back via api all right um you'll see in the python example actually we use the json keyword to get data from cassandra as json and send it out let's run the python sorry the node api real quick in order to run um the node api we're gonna have to change the directory to go into astra.api and if you look in here there are three directories leaves.api.node and um all node applications we have to run a tool called npm install so i'm going to go ahead and run npm install and let it do its thing what it's doing is it's downloading all the dependencies for this application um if you remember i mentioned that this git pod is based on a docker file actually we could add all of these dependencies well ahead of time um but this is not a production application this is a development application and we want everybody that's learning how to make apis to follow the steps and okay this is how i make an api node with with consignor this is how i make an api with python and cassandra so you would have to do this on your development environment anyways um okay npm is installed and uh in our npm. sorry our node documentation next thing we're going to do is we're going to run the actual api so here we're just going to say npm run dev all right it brought up a service it says a service is now available on port 8000 we're going to go ahead and make that public and we're going to hit open browser that's going to open up a new tab now you're seeing this and you're like saying it's not working it actually is working we just don't have a handler for that root endpoint um if we take let's see this right here slash api leaves and append it then we get a lot of data back right and i don't have a pretty uh json viewer but what i do have is postman what we're going to do is download the postman templates which are available here it's a json file uh just save it save as i'm just saving it in my directory here okay and sometimes when you click on a postman collection link it'll just open postman i for some reason it didn't do that right now for me and then what i'm going to do is open up postman i don't think it matters which version of postman you're using but don't worry about setting it up if you don't have it right now it's you can do your testing of the api all inside the browser nice so i'm going to import and i have a folder sorry file and i'm just dragging the file that i saved up here collection go ahead and import it and there we go uh you'll see that it added several tests and a couple of different templates i'm gonna go to this one you'll notice that it has port 8000 um and it has localhost well we have a api endpoint now that does not have a port right so you're going to copy either from the browser window or you know you can always come back to this git pod click on the ports icon here right i'll sorry the portals button here and get the url by just clicking on open browser so i'm just copying this url and mind you this api is exposed so we have not put you know off uh authentication and authorization on this rest api that's gonna be on you um so if you take this code and just put it out there um you have you have to do some work to secure the the code yeah but that's better for amazon i mean that's okay and i love how exactly you simply import the post file postman template and you have the full test suite ready i love that yeah so i'm gonna do a quick test of this and as we can see um it it works right it was able to get a bunch of data um and you know uh you'll notice that the structure of this uh information is it's it's a content application right we're dealing with urls and we're dealing with html content so it may look a little ugly but that's okay don't worry about the json output so much as the each of the api endpoints are working so this one is giving me everything that it can but i can also do a specific request for one of the ids so let's say one 14013 i'm going to copy this one id and then i can [Music] let me first do this i'm going to copy this url again and paste it here oops wrong copy and then this is going to be one four zero one three and we get back only one result right so we we know that this is working as expected um and you know if if you look at the uh ui code later on in your time you can connect this api endpoint to that and be able to browse this information in a gui tool right now let's try something let's delete something on the rest api and see if it actually deleted it in cassandra so to do a positive test we're going to first verify that this 144013 is actually coming from the data stacks astra so on my devs studio i'm going to change my i'm going to add another little cql command here select star from urls where id equal to one four zero one three oops i think it's a text so so we do have this data all right another neat thing is if i say view results as json i can see that data right as it exists inside cassandra with ttls um everything that i i would be able to see here i can also just get this data back as json yeah this feature is not known enough especially from web developer you can read and write from cassandra as a json format pretty neat but there is a schema you can do whatever you like but you can read and write as json pretty neat yep exactly and we are using that feature in the python actually um it's insert as json and retrieve as json so we know this is here let's delete it so i copy this and by the way the if you pay for um post man it has these features like environments and variables where you can just say here's my url environment variable and then here's my you know this other variable and it basically populates this stuff for you but since we're we want you to be able to do this without paying anything um that's why we're doing it the way we're doing it right now all right so the the delete it's just the same end point as the get right but it's just the the verb is different they should be verb is different that's the only thing that's different and it tells us hey i deleted it you didn't like this website i went ahead and deleted it for you okay so we deleted it let's verify and we're gonna run the same cql command and we don't have the data anymore so our node api seems to be working okay just a quick preview um of the of the um the python code before we go to the python code but um can pause for a second wait for people to catch up a little bit maybe i feel that people struggling a bit yeah we can slow down a bit we do have time yeah and if you have any questions feel free to ask yeah i will read and ask to roll on spots um the other thing that uh we're not going to cover today um and people will often ask is when you make a cassandra table we we have to design the primary key in a way that if you don't have the the partition key you cannot get that data unless you do allow filtering although this is not a tutorial on data modeling um there are ways after you add data to create indices to retrieve that data without having the primary key and in astra we have three types that we can use um one is well there are really four um there's the native indexing right your primary key your partition key that's an indexing engine built for the partitioner we have secondary indices and secondary indices are good for data that are low cardinality so in our case we have um a column um let's say websites well right now it's low cardinality it may grow up to be more um or is published right that's a low cardinality we we wouldn't want to do that unless we uh knew um the primary key or some other criteria um but that's available the other is materialized views materialized views would be great for uh things that have high cardinality so actually the the domain name or the source url would be potentially a good one the source domain excuse me and the other one which recently people have seen as experimental which is sassy storage attached ss table attached secondary index it has some really neat search features it has like partial card type features so um it's that and that's something that we're going to actually start using in this api because even though we have a solar index and this is not replacing it it um it will be useful to see how fast it is let's say if we're going to filter by tag or filter by domain how quickly can we get that information right the python code actually isn't that much different um it's very similar the flask python framework is is uh very succinct and brief if you want it to be just like express um we're doing the same thing we're connecting to cassandra we're taking a particular route like at sorry at uh slash or slash api slash leaves and we're responding to it with a response um the difference in the python version to show you um is that we're not just doing a select star from our table we're doing a select json right when we're doing node.js we're in javascript world so whatever data the driver gives back to us is already javascript we can just turn that around and send it over but if we're using python we're getting the data as as basically a tabular uh um you know result set from uh from the driver but if we say we want it as json we'll get it as json and then we can manipulate it as json inside python before we send it out the delete statement is going to look exactly the same right it's not going to change no delete yeah we are not so python let's go and go into our terminal here um we can actually keep this running and open up another terminal to run python but because the python api also runs on the same port we're going to have to shut it down right so i'm just going to go back to my terminal window and do control c we're going to leave our node.js directory and i just want to be in my my workspace home directory which is cassandra.api all right the python uh documentation um says that okay we need to have cassandra driver well we installed that earlier we need to have requests well so we installed that earlier as well so the only thing we need to install is flask uh you can either install using the pip command um or i'm just going to type in sorry the pip with the minus r command where you give it a file um or we can do it just you know pip3 install flask so to show you what the pip requirements file looks like it's just this well actually we do a couple of other things but that's for another time um here we go hit three install minus r and it's installing a couple other things that we're using for processing um down the line but the the important uh prerequisites right now we're worried about are just these three all right so the only thing we needed in python to get it up and running this is why i like python so much it's not like i don't like node but look at this the whole code base for python is this one python file and this requirements file that's it we go to node and we're dealing with the package.json which is like requirements then we have an app a config a processor and a server i mean you could go on and on no shape no i like python because it's quick and dirty i like java and i probably also download ton of stuff yeah that's a different that's a different java can solve different challenges which which i think python is meant for different things as well but for getting stuff up and running python is really uh really amazing i agree but no taking the world taking over the world so yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah um so in our in our app uh just to show you um the code that is responsible for connecting right it's on line 70. it connects it verifies the version it tells us if something happened there um and you know as you saw in the preview it's just when we say slash api slash leaves it's just getting this from cassandra and getting it as json um and we append as as json and send it back out uh when we get uh a specific amount of rows right same thing but we say limit let's say five okay and the way we do that is just by adding an ampersand rows equal to let's say 10. and we're going to try that out when we run this okay so python again the code is not too much different when we run it all we are doing is saying python3 app.py and gitpod will run it and what happened is the code connected to cassandra it verified that we have connected to a cassandra 4.0 cluster it's astra but it's under the hood at least the versioning system says it's 4.0 and it's here it's on this uh port um because we had earlier already exposed the port 8000 and didn't ask us again we can always make this port private if we want and all that does is that it creates access between our computer and that rest api via a session that's all it's doing when we say make private when you make public everybody can can see it now we get it not found that's okay remember earlier we have to put in slash api slash leaves and we get the data back cool and let's see we'll say slash leafs and rows equal to three and it is a lot smaller if i say row is equal to one yeah so this is working from the from the browser let's do postman test your url shouldn't change because the server that gitpod created for you that host name isn't changing the endpoint isn't changing right um so we're just going to hit send and and we get the data back yes so gitbuddy gitbod is very new but it's very very powerful so not only you do have python and node ready to go the full eclipse thea but yeah also you can expose sport execute stuff i'm yeah i'm impressed yeah this this part of git pod where you just said okay it has python it has uh node you can even develop c plus games with visual like opengl and watch it in git pod cool like that like that's how advanced it is so it is it is any type of development i think it's it's great for that um so you know going back to uh what we were doing earl earlier um we did not change anything in our postman test right uh and we were able to see that this is working and our assumption is that every single one of these um endpoints will behave exactly exactly the same as in node and as in python and what you should see from this is it doesn't matter who the developer is on your team if they're good at node or if the team is good at node use node if you're using cassandra you can be rest assured that at least the cassandra part is going to be scalable you just have to make sure your node code is okay as well uh if you have people that have python you can have people that use python to get data in you can use python flask to get data out from an api perspective so it doesn't really matter right in the world of microservices it doesn't really matter what you program in as long as it's succinctly contained and in our case we've done two equivalent microservices why would we do that well we may find that python has better machine learning you know libraries readily available to evaluate some models that were created right we can use flask to talk to python to talk to scikit-learn or tensorflow and be able to take a creative model and respond whereas on node.js we would not necessarily be able to do any machine learning right so you can use these as starting points we verified that the leaves api is working let's see if we go back and look for that same one four one zero three if it's there it's not there because that that resource has been deleted right of course it's not there if let me see what what is there though so 14012 is there and i will ask for that and that is a single result that we have we have some other endpoints which is to get the tags and so in this case this particular link is tagged as sales and marketing or sales um if i want i can also delete these tags this will not work i don't think yep okay so oh that's because we need the unique id for this one and i can get that too much text too much text yeah this is a big article that was saved uh let me go back here i'll go do i'll go look at in my data stack studio really quickly but you know hopefully it's not a varsha it's a text as long as you need so i deleted my tags now this shows that this no longer has any tags set right back to postman so postman is a it's been a useful tool for us to verify if an api is running but actually what we can do is also do a unit test around our apis okay and we have some unit tests written in javascript and we can take a look at those as well so in the leaves api tests the app spec i'm going to just go to a little bit there we go our specs basically are to verify if i insert data in cql can i retrieve it right using the endpoint and do i get it as expected and i mentioned earlier that it doesn't really matter which api is running it should it should run the same in this case we create a set of rows and we retrieve it and then we want to see is everything available in that particular partition we insert it we delete it we want to make sure that it's not there unit testing is a big part of creating microservices that's because when you release a microservice when you release the rest api you want to make sure that everything in that service works 100 as designed right if you say to somebody else in a big team where there's let's say 10 other microservices teams um if somebody makes a change in your code in your team and it gets shipped and it's not working as expected that it really could screw up operations for all those other apis that are relying on it right so being test driven is super important when creating microservices if for the only fact that no matter what you do whether you change your code from node to python or you decide to use a different database uh let's say you're using datastax astra one day and you decide to use uh dsc enterprise the next day on premise you still have to make sure that all of your code is working right and the best way to test code is to have a unit test that creates random data oh not really random data it creates data and checks to make sure that it's working properly there isn't other complex business logic in this microservice and there really shouldn't be but if there was we could verify that too yeah so we speak the same language i did one workshop about java last week you know links on youtube as well and same i started with the with the test tdd and each time i change the thing i run the unit test suite just to see if i'm okay of course absolutely absolutely so to to run the tests um we're gonna have to go into the the test directory and looking at this uh we also have to run npm install because this is a node uh based test and we're gonna say run test okay so uh the only thing that we may have to change is to change the api in which we're testing from all right so we have our api running and going to go into i'm going to quit my actually you know what i'm going to open the non-new terminal i'm going to leave my api running i'm going to open a new terminal and then go into [Music] these api leaves dot test okay i'm gonna run npm install gonna install a few more things okay and then in our app spec we want to change from localhost to the endpoint that we have from gitpod so make sure it's still right it's still running right we didn't change anything and we're gonna go back to gitpod and paste and we're going to run npm run install oh sorry we already ran and saw tests okay what did it say oh there is no such thing npm run test yeah i cannot criticize node.js anymore sorry i was caught by the chat uh okay so um looks like it's hanging for a second i'm gonna come back and i'm gonna print it again okay all right so something's got um let me come back here and let's see see what's happening we got our end point i'm going to verify something real quick so we we did as part of the test uh you know truncate some data in here because the testing process has to be starting from the same right we need to make sure that everything um in the test is as we inserted it not necessarily as we want um from an existing that's a different type of test by the way so go here and um star i love that about dsu studio it tells you if your cql is wrong okay yeah it does so okay so we create we empty the data and go back and [Music] see yeah and in the meantime so if you like the content please subscribe to the youtube channel it helped us give us a thumb up uh it will also help us to be retrieved in the search we are we are here every week same date same hour but we have an announcement to make at the end of today i what i'm doing um by the way is just to uh ensure that we're starting with the right url i just ended my python api and i just restarted it again um and see ah i know what i was doing wrong uh i was putting a slash at the end of my url and that was causing a redirect because it was the wrong path but as long as i don't put the slash uh it it worked okay so we were able to create a record via cql retrieve it done create a set of rows in one partition retrieve it done insert via cql delete verify gone done insert via post make sure it was added insert via patch or update via patch which is the rest verb get the tags for a particular item insert tags uh verify and delete tags and verify right so our tests worked on python now let's make sure they work on node uh the node api right even though the tests are a node right now the python version of the new uh of the api is running so i'm gonna click this for a second i'm gonna equip my python on my node my python endpoint i'm going to go back into npm excuse me the node version i've already run npm installed so i'm just going to say npm run dev so it's running it is already exposed astra is connected uh i'll just do a quick sanity check there's nothing in here that's expected that's because we have not imported any data we have truncated it because of the last test and when we run the test again the expectation is that it should work exactly as the python and as the french say voila is that yes this is what we did el polla okay um so what is it it's doing something different uh okay so two things fail um which which which you know what it's okay the point it's not a verb it's a feature we have to what what's different right why did it fail um so it kind of makes things exciting but you know i'm not going to debug you right now the you know the code that you have here as i demonstrated is is the same code that you have access to all you have to do is get on to the github if you haven't already open up via gitpod go to astra make a connection a make a database get the connection and every single thing that i've done you should be able to do so um you know i think the the value of astra just to kind of you know bring it back is really in not worrying about cassandra and the value of git pod for us is not really worrying about a dev environment so you can just focus on creating your your application um with that you know i presented to you today what we came out to do and to verify that i'm going to open my agenda um do we have cloud accounts on astronaut yes did we understand some best practices and a patterns for cassandra through the code you should because we didn't get to do the data modeling aspect of it do you understand the basics of cql and cred yes now you know that you can do you know select insert update delete just like in sql except you can also do with json you can do inserts and updates and you can do uh select this from json and we have a simple api in both python and node that connect to a cassette cluster and work and with that open it up to any questions any comments",
