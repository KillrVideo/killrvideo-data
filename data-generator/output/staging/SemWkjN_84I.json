  "title": "Distributed Data Show 73: Talking Retail Systems with Travis Mattera",
  "description": "In this episode Adron talks with Travis about starting and working site reliability in a large retail enterprise. They tackle topics ranging around outages, database sizing, monitoring and observability, disparate workloads and migrations between cloud providers. Then Travis and Adron head into discussion about distributed cache and some of the questions we would need to ask to determine the functionality needed. The episode then wraps up with a few outtakes at the end.\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hi I'm Adrienne and this is Travis mutt here they're good and what we're gonna talk about today is a little bit about what Travis is working on right now and what I want to learn and yeah and what you want to learn so a bit of give and take here so you've recently started working on an environment that could be termed multi-cloud yes with a whole bunch of stuff in it its databases applications all sorts of things about these we are striding clouds yes present class yeah so and you also go beyond just multi-cloud into the hybrid cloud realm - we have some on print yes it's a very complex model yeah there's some really antiquated a point-of-sale based stuff that's on Prem interesting you know there's probably some COBOL in there at some point and then there's also one of the main players in town AWS and we are migrating or at least diversifying with GCP yeah one of the other main players big players yeah that's all around town and yeah yeah we're just feeling that out right now we're not trying to literally have our applications sitting in both and make some of it but some of it is in both so how are you dealing with applications that are kind of in both or like summer in prod and one environment and some are in prod in the other environment right well so for what I've seen all our applications sit in one or the other cloud okay so there's not there's not a distributed nature between them there is not yet Frank app is here and Sally's app is over here right yeah we have regional distribution for our apps in a particular cloud provider yeah and we're looking at migrating potentially to one well being that there's usages of Cassandra and such in the backend that can make that aspect of things much easier to straddle between those even if your application isn't aware of said database being over and whatever cloud as long as it knows it's in one you can still have that across both and you have your data here and there and distribute it yeah so easy easier to migrate if you want to migrate that way you just get another cluster running over here and boom well one of the things we're dealing with now is a culture shift which is that not everything has to be hidden in between behind walls of obscurity you know where you have private endpoints the for all your apps we're trying to push towards a different paradigm which is have everything publicly available but then I'm cured with authentication so once you make everything public then it doesn't really matter where it is because it's all publicly routable that's interesting so or does when you when you start to make these migrations and you bring this off tier into play where it can be wherever and you kind of put a facade out which is the authentication and the security of whatever that involves whether it's rolls or something else right right and you you bring your data back into the back there and you start to shift it around and move it around sometimes you might have other tiers maybe like a caching tier between that all right do you have some of those situations where the cache is like behind auth or maybe even outside of the auth like if something doesn't really need to be secured and you've just put it out in a CDN well but there's attacks you can run on caching servers if you just exposed and that's true I don't know I I'm still learning I'm like five months in yeah and a lot of what I do right now is look and reactively respond to issues that see it through our modern suite and and then try to go back and reactively figure out what that happened how can we monitor for the monitor for that better and then tell me tell me some of that how what are you using for monitoring like what's that stack look like right now so right now what we have is data dog that's kind of our one-stop shopping for monitoring we haven't stepped into the tracing level of things we a lot of us are pushing for we're just costs more money and we need to really make sure it's what we want to do yeah we want to make sure that when we spend that money it's gonna be because we have gotten everything else tightened down we've got our monitors built our service checks built and so now we can get a lot of value for that right tracing step because if you don't really understand your applications you're not ready to understand the data you get out of it yeah you might trace down into something but then not know how to relate it back to correct application right or what code you need to go fix when and that's the thing around the whole notion of observability right when you're trying to run analytics around that type of thing you need that high cardinality and you need the tracing to be brought up from the app so that you can look down into it versus just a bunch of data somewhere that doesn't particularly trace back to any particular thing like the various nodes or the various whatever that's being observed needs to know something about itself right to Brighton formula instrumentation right that's where you industry many raps you have to actually do something to your app you can come make it traceable you know that's the other side to observability is that you need to actually act like something that can be seen you know in this site reliability engineering role mm-hmm part of our job is to go out and and and Priscilla ties best practices for for being observable nice very nice yeah so we're gonna have some cool stuff coming up to secret so far but now you know we got some meetups other things coming up that are gonna follow Prometheus open tracing etc and kubernetes down through with Cassandra etc and kind of we're gonna have somebody come in and talk about how to set up your system so that you really get good insight into all of your nodes etc so I think you'll like that one a lot mm-hmm so keep an eye out on the schedule and we'll have a video produced that everyone out there in the internet land will be able to see Twitterverse the Twitterverse and whatever other verse it is all multi-tiered so also we were we were kind of talking before we jumped on the call the show here about distribute caching well yeah there's kind of a weird thing the well the reason I don't I don't know I'm new to this I come from an engineering more of a mechanical Aero background you know one of the problems we had last year with our with our sail was we had a bunch of cache servers go down so standing them back up there to rebuild the cache whether your sail like a sail a cool thing like a like selling time to make money okay so something went down and yes we had a problem there was a big problem this was before I was there so wasn't my foe good job but I asked I asked when I was told the story about how it all went they they said yeah cache servers went down we stood them back up we increased their the counter than the nodes the worker nodes the instances and then they just thrash the database says they were all trying to rebuild their caches hmm and I said well why couldn't you just stand those nodes back up and have them reach out to a pre-established cache right they distributed in storage I mean I was hot off doing Ceph projects so I was thinking that's a that's a good question I have that storage decoupled with them yeah you well that's it's an interesting idea and one of the things I was saying earlier is that it's it's often the most difficult thing is how to manage the the state or the information in between your actual system of record and then the customer seeing it and of course I came up with the crazy analogy of that's like building bridges to islands with two people and you don't always want to do that but sometimes you do need a bridge to the island when there's now five thousand people right it makes sense then in certain contexts so the answer is always it depends with your cache layer and especially when you want to get to the point where do you deal with a distribute cache and what do you use for that like do you pull Cassandra into the picture and then have a distributed cluster that's gonna be just for your cache and then something else still for your system of record like a larger you know Cassandra cluster or do you use a little bit of Redis in between since it's known well for being extremely fast point of node things like that so there's a lot of ways to tackle that problem but not any clear-cut solutions like you know it's a little bit easier at the system of record when somebody comes to you says I have 19 petabytes of data or whatever the next iterative number is there and I want to make sure it's super resilient and accessible to all these points throughout the world you're going to use a distributed database something like Cassandra because that's your option at that point but with the caching tier you never end up with that clear-cut thing until you drill down to the specific need of what you have like in the case of Netflix they do some distribute caching where they have the movies out there at CD and endpoints emit copies of their entire library at every CD end point so that of course is not of right that's not a viable option for everybody like a retail outlet might want to have all their products and merchandise stored in the distributed sense out across various points throughout the world where where they can get faster access to look at those things but then like once you get your cart going you need your mid level cache that's going to keep track of that as you go and if anything goes down like say a region goes down and you have to shift your load over to another region that's up you want to have a distributed database back there copying that frequently enough where it's not too much load right but still there so like this region goes down you lose a little bit of your state it reconnects to this new one and says okay I lost the I was trying to buy five shovels and two rakes and I lost the red bag right there in my bag but at least you have managed some of it so like in that situation that's another way to manage that distributed state where you still have the stuff in the system of record going going there every once in a while but in the in the cache it's a little higher up the faster cache where the like the products are you know you might lose some of that but then it's easy to go to the system of record and pick up kind of where you left off yeah I mean hearing that I'm starting to think that maybe that particular problem that situation was not really caused by the cache servers needing to get stood back up and they're actually the enemies it was that the database itself was maybe under underprepared yeah well that it could have been right I mean if you have because it's just X number two cache server to still be fine right exactly um and you know if the fail back was everything goes to the database now in the databases it's hurting only X finite amount of capacity you know you blow it away especially like if that's the relational database management problem right you have sequel server oracle and you've purchased X amount you don't just whimsically scale up so if you go over that spec your database is gone it's basically gonna thrash you're gonna get way behind you're gonna start losing data or have some type of issue that's just gonna knock you out of the water all right right yeah it's a cool knowledge so that's that's the beginning of many things that hopefully maybe we can have you back to talk about and also more application development cash layer etc specific topics so we're going to talk about in upcoming shows so hope you enjoyed our conversation until next time I'm Adrian and I'm Travis Cheers we could do ok ready for now trunk you ready I'm ready ready yep get your dance on and I clap are we still saying ok [Laughter] yeah this is perfect outro stuff you're welcome sorry one Oh God so I'm Adrian this is Travis ok I'm going to count to three again yeah thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think
