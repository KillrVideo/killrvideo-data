  "description": "Welcome to the Intro to Cassandra Crash Course! In this video series, we'll go over the basics of how Apache Cassandra works and get hands on with implementing a basic Cassandra Database in the cloud!\n\n💻 Create your Cassandra Database:\nhttps://astra.dev/cassandra-course\n\n📥 Workshop Materials:\nhttps://github.com/DataStax-Academy/Intro-to-Cassandra-for-Developers\n\nLearn more about Cassandra at Apache (https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/)  and DataStax (https://docs.datastax.com/en/landing_page/doc/landing_page/cassandra.html) documentation websites.\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\n\nAbout DataStax:\nDataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandra™.
