    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems so we were at this meetup last night we were and Netflix was talking and hey everybody this is Adrian hall he's new detective Angeles here at data stacks we're pretty excited to have you I am extremely stoked to be here so I think it's great like one of your first days on the job we go and hang out with a bunch of heavyweights in the cassandra community it's a perfect way to get started it's a great way to get started and what's funny is they all knew you yeah they're like what are you doing here and it's great sometimes people expect me to just show up though so and you did it worked out it worked out flawless well we're super excited you're here but to the point great I think it was great content because obviously with uber and Netflix and Facebook all talking about the stuff that they're doing the Netflix thing was really interesting and it brought up a lot of really interesting conversation Netflix just in general and there you talk about the use case indeed so like what are some of the really interesting topics there honestly so people keep talking about this hmm and I keep thinking hmm it's getting a little bit there's building momentum right but they they brought up a few mentions of multi cloud deployments of things yeah so Netflix is pretty out there I mean this is a very public story that they have is like they're in multiple regions in Amazon but that story or that that challenge is not just multi regions it's multi in a data center right when you're especially you're deploying any application this is an application problem - mm-hmm and there they talk about it in that way but I don't think that they really they have never really outlined like what are some other real challenges there yeah so a lot of things that Netflix seem to just work you know I watched my movie I'm good they are really good with magic yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of complexity there especially even with just the multi region where they have they are in AWS and they have their multi region set up but even at just that level in one cloud mmm you're dealing with multiple levels of cache database sources CD ends things like that so take that and then multiply it by well I want to have my presence in AWS and Asher and GCP and maybe somewhere else yeah it's all of a sudden you you're kind of maybe not exponentially but getting close to increasing the complexity there so it gets real interesting fast the problem right and it's like is anything else in this field is it's gonna be complex because that's why we all get paid to do right and we were laughing about this being multi-cloud doesn't mean I have access to two consoles for two different clouds right that's a good start you get those but yeah then then you're sitting there looking at like two web screens going now what do I do and applications aren't just deploying infrastructure right there's a lot more architecture planning that goes in and that's that kind of hand wavy magic that they don't talk about so let's why don't we break down some of those challenges and just really did it here here's what the lists are if you're building a multi cloud application here are some things you should think about yeah what one of the first things that immediately comes to mind is the first thing that comes into play which is how do you manage traffic between two cloud providers like if you're in mm-hmm a cloud provider like AWS or GCP you have one of their load balancers to manage between regions or whatnot so that's one if you step out yeah what happens where do you go who do you talk to about that well global load balancing is really that's it used to be a dark art and I think now there's a lot of service providers out there to do it if you're only an Amazon you can use route 53 right okay but what if you want to be in Amazon and Google or edger and or your local or your local data center if you're relying on route 53 and it goes down all right then you kind of are where you're stuck even if you have GCP opportunities or whatever it's nothing's going there nothing's going there right and so it this is the first I think the first challenge of a lot of I think a lot of teams need to get through is if I have a an endpoint IP in various places and I want to send my clients to it how do I manage that interaction right so there are some service providers that do it like dying is a good example yeah we're not endorsing one particular one but that's a good example comes to mind comes to mind f5 load balancing company they sell a global load balancer but it's really thinking like from the client level how am I gonna what point am I going to connect to and when and how right and then also how do you insure that fell over even true though so once once you've gotten to that point I think there's and there's lots of answers in that it's a mobile app it's a web app but once you've got that answered you may have to have the point right so what if you've given yourself to choice now you may be in to like an Amazon and part of your application and Ezer in another and what if Amazon goes down right now you now let's take another layer down yeah and let's let's say in Amazon and Google you both have in both these environments live environments right with a whole cache tier of session state or some other type of information that's pertinent to what is occurring right now and one disappears and that's a huge thing to think about is what happens when I have been building up state or I have a cache tier and all these things are happening in one place and then it goes offline when I mean another one or all your clients just boom they lose all their state all of a sudden yeah I have four million people lined up on this site and two million are here and two million are there and you just toss two million people's credentials or whatever yeah that's that's a huge problem you don't want that to happen well I wouldn't expect like if I was on Netflix watching a show and it just stopped working and then all sudden went back to the login screen yeah that would that be frustrating I would use Hulu probably yeah I would just jump yeah but that doesn't happen no it doesn't because they have it sorted right and worst case scenario get the little screen where it says continue in a minute then you continue hopefully you cross your fingers but me let's let's face it that's not the experience not always you're gonna have to do that okay and sometimes you just don't watch your movie and you go outside or something but that's a more practical concern but let's face it if we're talking about my kids they're not they're gonna get upset so it doesn't happen the world stops the world stops so let's just keep the world moving and make it seamless all right so now you consider about the state of your application you're thinking about cash you're thinking about locally assigned variables all the things that happen that you if you were running an old-school monolithic three-tier app you're totally fine with but now you have one of those tiers is now in two different places yep so I don't you have to write it to a source you have to ready to a source I wouldn't replicate my application yeah that usually doesn't fly so well no the application has to remain static in two places mm-hmm so I think there's state management I think is what we're talking about yeah so where what do you do a state the array of choices and opportunities you have plenty of opportunities so there's there's a lot of things that you can do but one of the immediate solutions is well I'll write my state somewhere on some type of frequent basis mm-hm where it won't go away mm-hm if things go poof right so if you lose the caching tier most of the state should be able to be retrieved from some source right like a database but therein lies another point of complexity right of your database still needs to be in both clouds right if you're really gonna get the benefit of being multi-cloud your stack needs to be effectively replicated in some way between these two environments because if for some reason you don't have access to AWS for whatever cause zombie apocalypse it goes down whatever you want that other database to still have enough of the state to be able to resume process with those two million customers you have interacting with your site so pushing data a state down to the data layer and making sure that the data later add a layer is properly replicated it's a good move you could push some of the state into the client layer of course it puts a larger burden if you're running an app tier then you can do some of that there yes some but it still needs to connect to something on the backend right but maintaining state in the application tier the total loser at this point you're gonna write feel that one and also if you have the state some mm-hmm out there in the client in the browser or whatever it may be some application of some sort and you're managing some immediate security between your connection right if something goes down that tokens gonna be newt right as you still for security reasons don't want to just immediately pass all that encrypted or maybe not encrypted data over to this new Ryan session so you still have a little bit of breakage that needs to be taken care of so I think another consideration once you get down to the data layer is that state may when we're managing state at the database layer of course maintaining good replication between the database is important of course working with the standard MD nurse taxes that's that's the one of the killer features is it does that really well yeah but there's I think there's some other let's just say okay that's a salt problem one big one that I think is now pretty prevalent security and in compliance and where my data is I mean we just don't have an open Internet yes that according to the EU right I heard that there's even a new acronym out for us to think about so just rolls right out the time it does that along with the wide selection of things that we need to think about sarbanes-oxley gdpr by Patriot Act all these things really bring into focus well okay I'm multi-cloud but now where are my data centers what do I still replicate between where am I allowed to physically have my data for instance you may be allowed to have some data in Germany for German customers but you may not be able to replicate that specific data over to a US location right even though you may be providing the same so and you may even want to be able to connect those customers in some way right but you still need geo-located source data in Germany for certain things so that really adds another ramification to the whole multi-cloud scenario where where are my data centers can i replicate that data center across two clouds right I is do I have a data center option in Germany for AWS and GCP I'd you know maybe you do maybe don't yeah of course you do but I in that that's probably where you're gonna get bit at the end is yeah when my GDP our moment comes and I'm so I think this has been a really I mean obviously we're not offering solutions right now right but this is a pretty concise list but also one that probably would I think is useful to someone who's actually thinking about doing this it's not just hey you know we should do this let's get serious yeah and that's what we're trying to do is to talk about here's a list of things you should consider and it's not just getting two or two consoles going at the same time right you just don't creating the accounts is only yeah step zero zero zero yeah point zero one yeah right and yeah you know you get down to it all and it we've stated the problem space here yeah and that's that's merely the starting point yeah then you get the accounts and then you do the other fifty thousand things you need to take care of well I think it's something that we should probably talk a lot more about in the future and I definitely well I totally agree so and I think we will - that's why everyone should subscribe right now right now because this is good if I something for you very good advice yeah and if your boss comes to you and says you need to be multi-cloud you're gonna cop this yep right on all right well thanks a lot I'll see you in the multi clouds for sure all right thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think you can also find
