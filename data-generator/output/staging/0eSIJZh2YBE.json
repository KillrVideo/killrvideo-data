    "text": "so the thing I love about New York is there's a lot of great use cases the thing I hate about New York is none of them can talk about it because they have like oh we would love to use your product here's our NDA okay but let's just say if we went south of here like where there's a bull somewhere and you just swung a laptop around you probably hit a bunch of our customers like that yeah you would probably it might happen I don't know so Caroline and I have been working together for a long time you're a very seasoned engineer at this project and you've been doing this for a long time so tell us about yourself okay so like fatrick said my name is caroline george i'm a solutions engineer data stacks I bet that I've been at the company all over for years I actually have a funny story about when I started when I joined data stacks it's funny / embarrassing but my first day of data stacks was boot camp right so if your client facing technical you start with four weeks of training which is really well done it's amazing so flew from New York to California walk in the room and wow I actually know somebody and I go hey Patrick how are you yes me five seconds too late I realized that Patrick actually didn't know me and I actually don't know Patrick but when I joined datasize there was no data size Academy there was no developer days there was no distributed data show and so the way I learned Cassandra was watching videos on YouTube of Patrick we were best friends yeah yeah yeah I wish I could say hi to everyone that watches my videos on YouTube yeah oh yeah a lot of them there was a really popular one from 2014 has like 250,000 views on it I don't know if you don't have enough material yeah you saw that one right yeah yeah I see my friend let's hang out come on so that's great that's that's really embarrassing thanks Caroline well it's embarrassing for me was I got a split second and I was like oh you can if you want to be my friend that's fine I'm totally cool with that and if you want to say I know you I want to know you too so we've gotten to know each other for a long time down so we could say we're really friends now yes yeah I have to say I mean before making an amazing first impression at this company my background I started as a developer I did Java web iOS development traditional relational databases a lot of sequel server or Oracle my sequel so I kind of went through exactly what Jeff was describing you know I downloaded DSC on my laptop I had a OneNote cluster Kritika space created a table loaded a bunch of data and then try to do a select statement right and so I kind of went through what I think everybody here is gonna go through where you have to learn about data modeling first so alright that's a great way to start you're gonna save lives today so and the reason I say that is everybody you think you're unique you're not remember we're all just moist robots we all do the same thing over and over again we see this we see things all the time with you know we're in the business of being Cassandra experts so whenever you have problems you come to us that's a good thing or maybe before but let's talk about like what are the common problems that you see all the time let's educate everyone so they don't have to have it yeah so I'm actually gonna go through you know some of the evolution of conversation and topic I've seen so I doing data size it was mid 2014 a lot of the conversations were having with either customers or prospects who are about existing systems a lot of traditional relational databases I mean I hate to point out Oracle specifically but it was a lot of Oracle that just could not handle the workload and so you know either either had to be taken down or it just couldn't keep up so you know what do you do when your database can't keep up right first you're gonna throw Hardware out the problem you're gonna max out your CPU your RAM your storage and then at some point you're gonna think well maybe I should be splitting my data across small servers and then you're thinking well maybe I actually don't want to do that because it's complicated to set up paint to maintain and then if you're the master goes down before replicates the data to the replicas you could actually lose data and so this is where this actually is slide from a presentation Netflix did at strata in 2016 when they were in the you know mailing out DVDs it didn't matter that the site was offline right but when they switched to a streaming video business model well you can't have that anymore and I know if Netflix is down it's not the end of the world you know my kids are like to call the president yeah I know Turner blows up I mean it's it is security gets involved just bad yeah yeah but I mean so this is you know Netflix not as critical but you're supporting a treating desk and your treaters don't have their position or their cash balance your retailer people can't check out like think about the impact it has on your customers so people were looking for a solution that provided a hundred percent of time and really the only way to do that is to do multiple copies of your data in multiple geographical location and this is what's great about Chris and ERISA comes in with built-in replication so in my example you know two datacenters are f3 per data center that way you can do active active him one day to Sun Goes Down you still have copy of your data so it's yeah it makes your life a lot easier friends don't let friends shard I know and then you know and in the conversation kind of switched over to micro services so who here has moved to micro service architecture is implementing it heard the key word buzzword oh no ok so it's actually it's not new right like that concept has been around forever but a lot of companies had this huge monolithic db2 mainframe kind of backends and everybody's moving to agile development everybody needs to iterate constantly you know production releases every two weeks and it's really hard to do when you have these huge systems and so now you're looking for something that's actually scalable and then this is where patchy Cassandra comes in because you know like Jeff mentioned you double the size of the nodes you double the throughput you double the data volume we can handle so as you're rolling out new services new features your database can scale with you and then this actually brings back to that the previous slide with the presentation that Netflix did at strata they also talked about how you know they had hardware failure they needed something that scaled and they realized that moving to the cloud was actually a great fit because so as NSE the in my first conversation with you I'm always gonna ask you know oh yeah where are you going to deploy this it's gonna be on premise or in a cloud and the reason I asked is because a lot of people when they deploy on premise they're gonna be like well we have this internal cloud it's amazing it's you know for hyper-threaded CPU eight gig of ram on a shared storage and it's just not the hardware profile you need for Cassandra and so then the next question is like oh okay what about getting you know this kind of hardware I'm like oh yeah no problem we'll have it in like three to six months it just I mean it's just not practical right and then same thing where we talked about scalability as you need more throughput you know if you see any latency issues you need to add more nodes well something that's really easy to do that's Ain AWS deploy another ec2 instance and what I'll you have a new node so cloud is probably the best thing the best for is as an SE I want to hear from customers because of scaling scaling not waiting yeah the worst the worst moment is when you know oh we can get that let me call the IT department how many people want to call the IT department when you need to Harper hardware let zero hands still getting zero ends yeah that's the way it goes yeah and so you know the evolution has been from you know need something 100 percent of time need something that scales and not lately it's been a lot of well I have a ton of data now what like don't just show me my credit card transaction and show me that hey I spend way too much money at Starbucks maybe I should be enrolling in the program and then hey I can get double the points so that way I get some benefit out of it so it's did anybody go to strata this year like every top all they talked about machine learning in AI I mean are like 90 percent of them right I do something with all this data you have now which is a great way to queue up for this video oh yeah so we have a great example don't we and this is this is Raj a Rai from Macquarie Bank we find my mouse there it is let me tell you right now I almost moved to Australia just so I could use this bank they have an awesome app watch what he talks about my name is Roger I work in banking and financial services which is part of the Macquarie Group our vision is to create digital customer experiences that are highly personalized and intuitive for our users we want to take the complex data and the complex processes and make the data highly consumable and interactive we have already been demonstrating that by being the first releasing a couple of features that are first of its kind we focused on three key themes the first one was of course insights where you could see where you've spent your money you could see the categories of expenditure that you had and then you had oversights where you could set up your budgets and Foresight's is when you can set up a budget and get an alert based on how you're tracking against a budget also in terms of insights we focused on natural language search which allows people to interact with the applications in a conversational mode so it's really easy to use we attempt to reduce the friction by providing contextual information to our users you need to have a general database for the digital age which means your database needs to be able to address concerns such as in-memory machine learning analytics streaming proximity based searches facet searches full-text searches you have to pick the right technology for this in our case we just picked one window which was data stacks it was all about ensuring that we could get enterprise rate solutions for our mission-critical applications in spite of all our upgrades and all the hardware upgrades that we have our applications have been formed we don't have to think about downtime our platforms are always on and always highly available data is available at real time and it's replicated across the entire cluster and it's available for search and analytics at the same time so this less cost in terms of ETLs so that's fundamentally reduced our total cost of ownership and it also provides us the ability to be agile and be quick to market with the features we've been working with data stacks for most a year and a half now and what we have seen is that there is tax continues to invest in platform innovation and that is extremely important to us because we can focus on building out the assets that help us differentiate ourselves in the marketplace deal Stax demonstrates that they are constantly innovating and they are thinking about the future they provide us with that leverage and while we get to focus on building our capacity so it's I think a match made in heaven alright that was a great little commercial really cool app but this was developer day we get to talk about the real story right so there was a lot more behind that was I mean Raja is a great architect he really knows what he's doing there but let's get into the nuts and bolts like what really happened there like what was some of the challenges there yeah I mean and this is something we see I guess with everybody who a lot of people when they start with data statics do you see Apache Cassandra I'll kind of use them interchangeably but so one is you know hardware right I mentioned it before a lot of times I'll say hey you need you know 16 core CPU 32 gig of ram SSDs and then people like oh I have spinning disk no oh my gosh I storage like no you know that's a real problem isn't it it's like they think I say they I used to think this too there is no magic yeah yeah I mean I'm not saying SSD squeeze I make money every time I said it says DS right like I'm I'm saying it because we've tested it out and if you really want that kind of performance I kind of - but you need us as these and it's I think it's important to realize that it's durable data your data is sitting on the disk so you want your data fast make your disks fast it's not an in-memory database those are very volatile yeah something with you know I'll say rf3 per data center multiple data centers if you want high availability we had a customer that did two data centers which is good but then RF 2 RF 1 and then they were keeping track of all the exceptions which kind of like worked honestly I don't know how but it somehow worked for about a year and then little by though it just kind of caught up with them and just not manageable a consistency level like we talked about you know quorum but what you really want is local quorum especially if you have data centers that are geographically distributed if you have a say us amia asia-pac you don't want to pay the you know the latency price of going across the world so use local quorum so little things like that you should you know pay attention I'll make a difference in your performance and I think that's pretty I mean do you think that's the most fundamental challenge what is it operations but then no I mean to be fair a all goes down to your data model data model yeah I got Steve here there he is yeah if you get your data model right it will save you a whole lot of pain yeah I mean we saw it at a customer sebastien know so work with a client did everything from we view the data model reviewed even the application they were using execute we changed it to execute async they actually had a center of excellence that was providing and deploying DSC for them so they didn't have to worry about configuration and tuning everything looked great but then they kept having performance issues and then notes kept flapping and we couldn't figure out what you know what was going on and we realized that the data they were using was not real production data which is you know it's fair but the test data was actually not a it didn't actually match what they were expecting in production so instead of having well their party had composite partition key and it was actually blowing through that partition which was causing compaction issues I'll be around all day all right yeah you probably will just say got this right yeah yeah honestly totally happy to review your data model talk to it it's something that you know from a if you're coming from a relational database background you you don't really care about what the data means right what you care is about normalizing your data to death and then you can do conquest joins with DSC and Cassandra you you know it's one table per query you have to think about how you actually be treating the data because this is distributed so you want to make sure you're looking you're doing partition lookups so the other I think the other factor that you could talk to pretty well is the use case because they're getting the use case right it's also important you don't want to you don't want to use a baseball bat to play football you know there's that old analogy like this is the wrong tool like a hammer no I need a screwdriver so we have a very specific technology for use cases what are some of those use cases out there yeah so I'm gonna talk about two kind of larger use cases but to be fair I mean we've seen a lot of use cases and it really varies I mean sometimes ok agree if he picks on your laptop probably not a great fit for DSC but sometimes you don't have that much data but you need a 100% uptime one of them is for the like authentication into a website if people can't log in then they can't use they can't check their account they can't make purchases so if you need 100% uptime and you need something that's fast then that could be a good fit for for DSC another one that we see a lot is that single view of the customer and the customer in customer journey they're slightly different but they're kind of all they revolve around the customer was challenging is that you have multiple data sources usually different types of data coming at different speeds you need something that they can scale as you add more data sources then you can use something like our spark integration because a lot of times you'll end up having a message queue like let's say Kafka and then you use smart streaming and then you can enrich your data before you even save it into DSC or you can do let's say you know aggregation we work with a customer a telecom company that I was doing didn't care about minute usage they wanted to do 15-minute in intervals so they were actually aggregating it using spark streaming before saving into DSC then the other challenge with with this kind of system where you have multiple data sources that don't always have the same data set is then how do you do entity resolution how do you know that hey I just used this ATM transaction is me and I went into a retail bank and I spoke to a you know financial services person or I went online I'll call customer service so now you have multiple channels they all have different type of data of a different amount of data how do you connect them all to you know one entity and this is actually great fit for graph if you think about it from a relational you know data model standpoint as you add more data as you add more channels as you start doing more logic because you have a different type of data it's a little complex versus graph well as a user you know I'm a I'm a vertex and then I have this ATM I have this credit card and then as you bring in new data sources and you can use you know we've our spark integration to do some of the logic then you can start building models so you can do unsupervised machine learning so a little by little you have more efficient and more accurate joining of your data sources I'm gonna stop just really do we recommend when people come to us with use cases are we quick to say no I mean I think if it's not I'll be like the first person to say no because how many times do you say no this is not the right use case yeah honestly I actually said no a couple times went on Dido over coffee no no we're not if you're doing completely ad-hoc queries this is probably not a great fit if you're doing batches like if 90% of your load is batch loading batch reporting if you don't need anything in real time this is probably not the right fit right we're not gonna this is not like one size fits all and we're not gonna push this for wrong use case because then it's gonna make my life miserable yeah yeah we want you definitely to I enjoy my life do it correctly there's a question in the back you should know all the answers could you have a blue lanyard it's very embarrassing I just told everyone that the blue lanyards know everything go ahead how many customers related yeah what does anybody else working on all right line up we want to hear everybody's use case single file right here no I'm kidding come it just shows you the diversity of everybody's got a problem they're trying to solve every company is a software company now yeah yeah yeah cuz you know Jeff gets up here it's fraud and I know fraud is a quad is like a really really wide topic right it could be everything from your time credit card transaction fraud like I'm using my credit card here but somebody used the same credit card number in Brazil five minutes ago right something's not quite right and you need to be able to detect that with in real time it needs to be single digit millisecond response time I mean it needs to be pretty much instantaneous or it could be you know incident resolution right you signed up for a service there's a new pay-per-view you want to see ex fight you know but somehow like the service isn't working because hey maybe your credit card or your account got flagged so you call customer service or it could be you know pattern matching hey you've noticed this kind of behavior and now you're trying to avoid this behavior again so you know the first use case real-time credit card fraud identification you need something that's really fast and I have to say Cassandra if you're doing partition we'd partition right it's probably one of the fastest databases that they are if you're doing incident resolution well you need to be able to search through your data so if anybody's try CQL you know you know you can't do partial text you can't do goodbye you can't do joins and this is where our solar integration comes in so with solar you can do partial tags so like type-ahead or suggestions you can do misspellings you can do you know even facet queries which is basically like a group I in in SQL you can do geospatial searches and then for pattern matching it's a mix of analytics and graph depending on what your yeah you know and it's interesting I think fraud do you have fraud that use case you could probably that exact thing that you're doing with Frey like fast data could probably be replaced I mean you could replace a lot of use cases with and I need access to my data really quickly yeah yeah I mean that the quote Jeff had on before you know you need you need your website your web page to respond within one or two seconds now before people get frustrated and move on to your competitors so you need that your database piece to be less than 500 milliseconds max right IOT you use cases this thing did something that it shouldn't do respond yeah actually that's one a yeah I have a Roomba I'm very used to this but yeah well this is slightly different working with a customer and it's a telecom company and yeah they do network monitoring right and hey you know the banner failed and NSE this kind of behavior that happened before and so now they want to see when they are seeing this type of behavior do something before cascades into a router failure right so it's learning and its identification all right final parting thought imparting your wisdom on what what do people need to know as they move into the use case give us some last-minute thoughts on some stuff here ok so one of them is did it work yes yes it goes back to your cheetah modeling right data modeling is gonna basically make or break your system know your data make sure that you know hey whether you're a retailer or a bank or even you know telecom you have customers they do transactions you do a composite partition key with a time bucket but sometimes you have like professional shoppers right that will blow through your partition like the we call it a Justin Bieber effect but you know basically you might have you know a bank where you have an account that's the merchant that will end up having more transaction than others so not having the right data model not having the right partition key will impact compaction ill impact performance will impact the state of your environment that's kind of a big one and then the other one is so and it this is a fair question right when up usually in the first conversation people are like well how many nose am I gonna need and am I you know I I don't know like honestly it I can't tell we zillion and then we start going down yeah yeah yeah so the easiest way of doing it is our documentation says about two terabytes of data per node I say one because if I say one you're here too and you won't scale until you get to me right so it's like kind of like the middle point Thanks but then there's another part to sizing it's your latency the number of times I ask people what are your SLA s what's your to put you know this is iPhone launch we work with a lot of the telecom companies and when it's an iPhone launch there's double the amount of volume but you need the same response time so you need to plan for that so you know what do you do well you need to set up an environment I would say start with five nodes in two data centers do your data model because you're three million records in your relational database is not gonna be the same size you know in Cassandra and then also test do performance testing test for Peaks Peaks right speak reads and then monitor your system we have a tool call up Center monitor your read write lean see your Fupa make sure you don't have hints paddling up make sure compaction your JVM everything's healthy you",
