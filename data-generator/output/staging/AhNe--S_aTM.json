    "text": "[Music] in this session we'll look at how you can supercharge your feast features store with astrodb hi i'm greg staknik and i'm a product manager at datastax before we get into the actual plugin let's figure out what is feast feast is an open source feature store for machine learning feast provides a python sdk that makes it easy to get started quickly without having to learn a domain specific language this makes integration with other ml tools pretty seamless loading new libraries configuration and feature creation is all done through python feature stores act as a central hub for feature data and metadata across an ml project's lifecycle there are five main components of a modern feature store transformation storage serving monitoring and feature registry today we will focus on the storage component feature stores typically contain both an online and offline storage layer to support the requirements of different feature serving systems offline storage layers are typically used to store months or years worth of feature data for training purposes online storage typically on the other hand only stores the latest feature values for each entity essentially modeling the current state of the world online stores are usually eventually consistent and are usually implemented with key value stores like apache cassandra datastax astra is our database as a service offering built on open source apache cassandra and available for multiple deployment options including aws azure or gcp astra eliminates the overhead of installing operating and scaling cassandra for developers astra provides a completely compatible experience with open source cassandra tools and provides an in-browser cql shell and multiple endpoints including rest graphql document and grpc which enable more developers to create and interact with data as a service layers developers can try astra for free so what is this plugin so there is a new feast cassandra plugin which enables the usage of astrodb or any cassandra cluster really as the online feature store for feast when using astrodb in particular feast users can run a model in production that relies on astrodb's resilient architecture for providing the data on which predictions are evaluated this plug-in at its core implements the online store abstraction which means we've added crud operations such as update teardown online right batch online read and others so without further ado let's check out a demo to see how we can integrate feast with astrodb so to get started i'm going to log in to astra.datastax.com with my credentials once i sign in i should be dropped into a dashboard that shows my databases any streams that i've set up sample apps and other things so to get started we're going to create a database so need to provide a couple of pieces of information in order to get started with this database uh one we need to provide a name so i'll give it a name called feast demo i need to provide a key space name so i'll call it feast key space and then i need to decide where this thing is going so maybe we'll put it in us east ohio and then we'll just hit create database so while we wait for this database to provision i'm actually going to use a different database that i've already set up also called fees demo before we can start to work on um our local development and actually install the plug-in we need to actually we need to set up our tokens and get a secure connect bundle the way we do that is from our organization settings so here i'll go to token management i'll select a role database administrator and then generate the token the key pieces of information that i need for the plugin are my client id and my secret also need to set up a secure connect bundle which will take care of credentials certificates and things like that so i'll go into my feast dashboard click connect and then select a driver in this case because face is based on python we're going to download the python bundle and here we can download secure connect bundle so we'll need to have that locally when we're configuring the plugin so now locally let's install feast so we're going to use our package installer to install both feast and the feast cassandra plug-in you can see i've already got it installed but even if you're installing it for the first time it goes very quickly the next step is to set up our project with feast you have some project templates that can get you started quickly with some of the basic boilerplate configuration files so to do that just say feast init and give the project a name so i'll call it astra feature repo now i've already created this i've already configured it so i'm not going to overwrite this directory but setting up this directory will then let's take a look at the contents what we get is a feature store this is our configuration file um and then we get a couple of um starter application files uh an example script to create some types uh a generate script to do um some loading of data and then a query which is fetching let's take a look at the code in detail so we start with the feature store so the feature store as part of the boilerplate includes the project name the registry and the provider we'll need to override the online store to provide the type which in this case is going to be our feast cassandra online store and we give it a name our secure bundle pass that's the thing that we downloaded from the astra ui and then our username and password which we generated from the organization token settings and lastly we specify the the key space in this case feast ks also included in this starter project is an example example file that will set up a driver type with some hourly stats some activity things like that once we have those types created then we'll generate some load on the model we'll synchronize it and then we'll run a query to make to validate that the data actually persisted let's try this so the first thing we're going to do is apply our settings so what this should do is it will communicate based on our configuration settings with our astra database at our feast key key space and we can see here it did successfully perform the handshake so we are configured locally with astrodb as our store next up we're going to um generate some training data and we'll do that with the generate python file okay so we see here that um we were able to create um some data from this generation script and that has gone into our our local feature store so now that we have our local feature store populated we need to materialize that information and synchronize it over to the cloud so we'll do that with a materialize incremental command and we'll use the current timestamp okay so it looks like we were able to successfully materialize one of these feature views into the driver hourly stats now lastly let's just run a quick query so we'll run a query locally using that fetch online script and see if we actually have data great so it looks like we were able to successfully query based on the script that we defined in fetchonline.py and so yeah it looks like we were able to very quickly install feast install the fees plugin configure it to connect to our astra database we did uh created some training data we synchronized it and then we did a query but just to make sure everything is actually working let's go check also on the cloud and confirm that that data is really in there so back in astra i'm going to go into my feast demo table or feast demo database i should say and select the cql console so the cql console provides an integrated environment to run cql commands directly from within the astra ui okay so first let's just take a look at what tables are available in this database so we'll say describe tables and this shows us all of the tables and the one we're really interested in is this key space that we created feast key space and we see that the astro feature repo driver is already in there so at least we know that something synchronized but now let's check to make sure the data is there as well so we'll say select star from our key space dot or table name and look at that we have data what do we do in this demo well we started off by creating an astro serverless database we then installed feast and the fiscal standard plugin we configured feast to use astrodb keystore as our feature repository that generated some training data synchronized the local data with the online store which in this case is astra and then did a couple of queries to verify that the data actually was propagated to the cloud to learn more about astra integrations check out awesome astra awesome astra is our developer portal which provides tips and tutorials to get up and running quickly as well as plugins and sample code for integrations with languages tools and frameworks like feast check out awesomeastra.github.io for more
