[Music] will help me win this fight [Music] okay so welcome everyone hello welcome to our workshop of today built a multiplayer real time game with astro streaming uh i'm stefano and this is drugs high rocks how are you doing hi i'm very pumped up to be on a workshop where we're not going to talk about databases right you know it's just changed for us today it's a strange thing it's always data so anyway okay so before we start i would like you to give us a thumbs up if you can hear us uh clearly if you can hear me if you can hear rugs when they when we speak so we are we know we are good to go okay get some feedback sound seems to be good okay great so so let's yeah let us know if you can't hear us no i think it's good i see a lot of thumbs up so i think we can start very good right okay so uh i'll share my screen immediately and there we go okay so welcome everyone this is a this is today's workshop by data stacks developers and in particular you are seeing me and rux i'm stefano i'm a developer advocate i like apache cassandra but today it's not about patch cassandra and yeah i like data and whatever you can do with data so here we are uh rux what about you yeah raghav and srinivas uh but but you know people have a tough time pronouncing my name so i just go by rags rag's not the richest easiest way to remember me uh i i really i'm a big fan of distributed systems and this is where you know the pub sub mechanism that uh we're going to talk about today uh comes into the picture because it's really about decoupling uh you know kind of um it's the decoupling pattern in general right and and and you'll see that you know with the decoupling you can scale independently uh and and and that's kind of the excitement uh about the workshop today uh and you'll see that you know it's a it's a effective pattern to be using in distributed systems which i'm always a big fan of uh and to be able to do it easily and uh kind of seamlessly yeah so thanks for coming yeah thank you rux and uh you say it easily and indeed easily will be one of the keywords and wait for it um by the way here we you can see our our uh social handles so feel free to connect with us that would be a pleasure and we will give you more ways to connect with us and with the the the topics you will be seeing today later so um today you see both of us on screen but the that our team is way bigger you see it's growing and growing and here are is our team so you see it's distributed as we like the data to be uh and yeah they are usually they can be found around in the chat so there's someone in the youtube chat i've seen alex hello alex and somebody else can be reached on discord and you will see later how to get in touch with us we are always happy to you know help you and discuss and answer your questions what not okay so uh let's see what's going to happen today uh by the way before i've already seen someone asking that and today's workshop is record so is live but it will be recorded and it will remain available on youtube at this link so if you feel like watching it again uh later studying it dissecting it whatever go ahead that's absolutely feasible and back to back to what you see on screen now today we are going to stream on youtube in case there are some problems with youtube we will fall back to twitch links in the description if you have questions or want to discuss or hang out uh reach us on the discord channel mostly and we will tell you something new on our discord channel later during the day during these two hours of workshop we will be having um well a game even though wait two days is today is about building a game and running an interactive real-time game but games aside there is also a quiz again and if you participate you will be able to win some swag kindly offered to you by data stocks so it's two different games today yay games okay so this is all we have to offer live interactive and everything now what are we doing today uh we will be starting from a github repository that contains everything for you to start and do what we are doing so we will be doing together all of the practice with some theory some explanation and guide you through the whole architecture of the application we will be running today but in case you prefer to do it on your own no worry because there is a github repository and i might already ask our kind uh nightbot to drop the link to it so there is a github repository containing all instructions to do on your own contains also the slides and contains indications to uh do homework and exercises and there is a source code of of course um we will be using gitpod as an id in the cloud your link isn't working oh come on let me try and oh wait wait let's let uh nightbot take its time to answer or maybe i can paste the link somehow somehow nightbot seems i seem to have done something wrong so let me paste the link manually somebody is asking if this will be available later yes the video will be stored and available later on youtube manieris okay you go uh okay no this is me so uh okay that's strange because i've seen nightbot uh working so okay no problem keep going okay i'll try that so we will be using gitpod as an ide because uh it's uh very handy it's an id that works in your browser so you have to install you can you don't have to install anything we just work in the browser you will see it later it will work as a visual studio code in your browser and as far as technology so backing technology will be basically a messaging system which is built on pulsar a patch pulsar and it will be offered by astro streaming more on that later ah see now i see nightbot has answered so yes it works okay it doesn't it doesn't like you it likes me yeah somehow i don't know why but no problem okay so this is uh maybe i will okay this is okay no problem so uh we will speak extensively about messaging system and apache pulsar and after streaming later so let me go on um an important thing is that uh this is an interactive workshop you will be doing all of the hands-on if you want but there's more because you might there are some homework to do for you and if you do them and if you submit your homework you will be able to be awarded a nice badge there are some collectible badges one for each of our workshops and we've seen recently someone who has as much as many as 10 or more badges so congratulations you can start your collection and these are very nice to you know show around to prove you've been attending and did your homework so today's batch is about event streaming okay so there is a a very another very important piece of information for you there is a lottery going on it's called stax giving uh it's managed by datastax developers and you see the link here so maybe i can try and ask nightbot to drop the link basically how does it work well first what can you win you can win uh gift cards amazon gift cards for from 500 dollars 250 dollars and how do you how do you enter this lottery well you do some activities uh that range from posting a tweet about that to building a tiny application novel application and something submitting that to us and oh wait um i am in the way so let me disappear for one second and uh depending on what kind of submissions you you you do you will get more or more chances to win prizes so deadline is thanksgiving so the 25th and we will run we will extract the winners live on the 8th of december so please i know that most of you you come to the workshop for knowledge but in the process you know if i can win something as a developer you know why not right you know so so try to try to maximize your chances by attending as many workshops as you can or whatever absolutely yes so okay so um we mentioned mentee or better we mentioned live quiz um we are now about to warm you up with this live uh with this platform we use for the live quiz and we would ask you uh do we need to be present to win no i think you don't need to as long as you submit and then you will be contacted because in the submission form you should give your email to be contacted in case you win but please try to attend because it's more fun right yeah but i think the drawing is going to be live so yeah yeah if you're present so much exciting right yeah absolutely so although i i i never win even when there are only two people uh yeah you know but still you know you can you can see so yeah there will be a workshop i guess on the 8th on the 12th and during that we will be drawing the winners so but now we ask you to join us on mendy.com and enter the code you see in the youtube chat okay i had some glitch on on youtube but i think everything is still is working again okay so please go to mendy.com and enter the code you see in the chat maybe i can switch to your screen rugs if it's okay so you can share your menu there you go so uh okay you can also uh scan the qr code sorry yes so i moved you a bit so we can see the people joining so we will start with a few questions to get to know better to get to to know our audience and to have an idea you know who are you because we've been presenting or so introducing ourselves so far and there will be questions these are not part of the quiz they are just to to warm you up with the platform and but later there will be a quiz on this platform so please keep your phone connected to mendy.com or your laptop keep the page open because later you will be using that to answer the quiz and there so uh these questions are just to know you uh but the questions at the end of this workshop will be timed so the faster the more points you get the faster you answer so first we want to know uh where are you from just you know to have an idea if you don't don't you don't need to be so accurate just you know because we know uh we are a distributed team that speaks about distributed data and we like to have a distributed audience and drugs what do you think it seems we do very cool yeah we do have somebody from hawaii maybe that looks like okay so i see some answers on the youtube chat as well that's okay but remember that during the quiz if you answer on the youtube chat that doesn't count so please for the answers on for the quiz go to mendy.com and enter the code you see on screen we will be giving that to you later again because otherwise it doesn't count so somebody blackmagic.x is from milan hello we are very close hi elton elton you you are from brazil if you can go in and put in a dot on your map oh that'll be great yeah buenos dias yes so alex is right what he says in the chat is when it comes to the quiz you will not be able to answer in youtube i mean you you could answer there but it will not be counted as an answer for the quiz so go to main team it looks like america is winning this time right we have a lot of people from it's cool i'm from boston so i'm like i'd like to win but maybe europe is winning now oh geez look at europe yeah europe okay so india but also brazil okay okay second question uh did you know messaging platforms so do you know messaging platforms before starting this workshop not at all just a bit or i'm very experienced a lot of very experienced folks nice oh giuliano hi we are very close giuliano uh this is now there's a nice surprise because giuliano we we met in real life many many years ago because we studied physics together hi juliano nice to see you okay he's a theoretical physicist like you as well sorry he's a theoretical physicist like you as well i remember yes should be if i'm not mistaken so juliano where are you studying in theoretical physics right okay but let's go let's go ahead okay so we have somebody who is very experienced with a messaging platform kind of okay uh just a bit not at all very good so even if you answer if your answer not at all then you are in the right place but also if you answer just a bit or very experienced because there's always something to learn yeah and and i think this is kind of what we expected right you know um not at all quite a few but uh you know some experience a few uh and hopefully like like i said you know even the very experienced will pick up a few tips here and there yeah absolutely so are you comfortable with uh makes the stock with node.js and python all new to me so i can read code i can write code 10x developer wow congratulations to all of you so all new to me okay so this full disclosure today we will be running a mixed stack that involves some node code and some python code but no worry because the code is there already in the repo you can later dissect it and learn from it whatever your level or maybe improve it we accept we we are happily accepting pull requests to make our code better right you never stop learning so yeah exactly even even when we're delivering workshops we we pick up a thing or two from from the attendees so yeah so feel free you know to put in you know if you if you think we can do something better uh you know in the chat uh you know whether it's some code or you know doing things a little differently you know feel free to uh put it in because this is really about leveling up our skills you know whether we are a speaker whether you are experienced 10x dev whatever yes and by the way um don't forget that we are still in the lottery time window until thanksgiving so if you do some improvement maybe you can turn it into your submission and get some more chances to win the juicy gift cards okay so have you ever used apache pulsar or astra streaming before no yes there's a yes there are many no's and i can i can imagine the reason because perhaps yeah so perhaps you never know um okay so apache pulsar is a rather newish kind of messaging platform and astro streaming is very new it's still in in beta basically so no wonder and you're here to see how they work so welcome okay so i think that was it this time so we don't close your mente screen your mentee phone whatever and let's jump back to the slides because there are some slides for you before we start doing the hands-on part so there we go okay so let's start let's start with some gamers because today as you know uh we are about to blackmagic.exe we will try to give answers to your question what is the purpose of messaging platforms by the way when we say messaging platforms uh we are not particularly speaking of you know whatsapp telegram or stuff like that we are speaking of uh back-end infrastructure basically so we you will see more later okay so let's start if you are here you want to build a multiplayer real-time game right multiplayer real time i guess i guess the picture that comes to your mind is something like you see here so there are uh players connected to different machines different computers and they exchange information they change information in most cases through a server right so there are some there is some information going from the player from the clients to the server and vice versa and this structure is there to ensure the players share the same word they have they get the same updates and they are able to actually interact in the same in a single game field right okay so far so good but let's have a closer look at what happens because uh clients and server have to communicate now let's say the the player on the left is doing something like i don't know uh they are jumping in in the game probably this information has to go from the client to the server this big straight purple arrow to the right but once this information reaches the server what happens well uh probably the server will keep this information will keep this information stored somewhere or anywhere but then this has to reach every other client because they have to be aligned they have to share this uh representation of the game world and how do they do that you know historically when when it came to communications between clients and server historically the situation has been for a long time very simple clients were asking data to the server the server was responding with the result that was it so this is how databases work usually this is how web uh development has worked for a long time so client makes a request and waits for a response but that's probably not satisfactory if we want to start thinking of a real time game because it's really not efficient if any client if all clients have to constantly ask the server are there updates are there updates are there updates so this is what is known as polling and actually most for a long time web development has worked like that and for a long time connecting to a database say has worked like that and basically it's a loop of asking the server and waiting for an answer then sleeping a bit maybe and asking again and so on this is unsatisfactory because it's not really real time in most cases you have to handle the retry and the looping logic in your application code there is a waste of resources because every request probably comes with a set of headers a new connection has to be established all the time every time and then think about that the more frequent you want your request to be the highly the higher is the likelihood that you are wasting your request because you will get it's less and less likely that you will get some actual update if you ask every millisecond so it's really a hard limit that you are bumping into so these are the problems with developing a modern real-time application if you rely on the good old polling indeed more modern alternatives have emerged and we will come to that so i hope you are now convinced that request and response philosophy is not ideal for what we are what we have in mind now what would be better well i would like my server to be able to push data to the clients as they arrive maybe on a connection that is kept open for a long time so maybe the server would be the actor initiating the data push and you know what that's exactly what a messaging platform is there for so messaging platforms will basically be the piece of infrastructure dealing with receiving messages from one side and sending them actively to other parties that are waiting for those updates for those messages now this is really still abstract what's the message how does the communication work and everything but that's the basic idea of a messaging platform yes c-sharp guy yes while loops with who hasn't done that so everybody has been guilty of polling you know by the way in web development there have been several improvements based on polling so there has been the long polling so-called the http streaming solution there are server sent events so they are all sort of solutions partial solutions to this problem but in a sense they all feel like very adult things they lack uh say general they were not generally enough and not strong enough so actually when it comes to web development uh the modern way is the websockets or http 2 also offers some native things but let's stick with websockets indeed today we are going to use websockets but uh i want to stress that this fact this this problem and its solution is not specific to web development because even if you have an enterprise application back-end application that has to speak to a database to get data you might have the same problem you might have the same need and asking the database actively might not be the right way to go about it okay so communication what we want is that every message coming from a client is directly routed actively to other clients and this is what we want so messaging platforms or messaging systems there are actually various reasons why messaging system with systems were invented were developed one is this push not pull philosophy so the server wants to be able to push data instead of waiting for the clients to uh pull them then something that drugs has mentioned the coupling so we want to be able to decouple uh the agents that produce data from the agents that wants to retrieve those data so we we want to do something more sophisticated than a direct communication so we need a third party in the middle a middleman or a message broker we might call it that receives messages from one side and then with maybe with some complex logic also delivers them to the other side or sites [Music] uh in general this also comes with the advantage of non-blocking communication because in the old days of say rpc uh communica rpc exchange between applications over a network it was a blocking call so you would have your game frozen until the server and the other clients acknowledge having received the update and that's really not a very smooth gameplay right so if we want non-blocking communication we have to we have to consider different phases one is when the client sends the data and in a completely asynchronous way another phase where the client receive pieces of data and this this is exactly an unblocking kind of operation so the game proceeds while we are still waiting for the data to come to us okay in other applications say in analytics workloads or in [Music] i don't know if you have to analyze new information about user clicks on your site messaging systems might also help in having a faster response to new data so instead of having say every five minutes your crown job that wakes up and checks for new things and does the missing parts of the analysis you might have with the messaging system you might have your analysis that starts as soon as new data comes there so and so these reasons are also a good match with the with the modern uh microservice based architecture so as soon as you start breaking down your monolids in very small pieces that are as loosely coupled as possible having a message system that mediates communication between the parts is going to be very important and very helpful right okay so what does a messaging system do we say that in a few ways and i hope some of the answers uh to your question i've seen in the chat are starting to be clear we want to decouple sending a receiving which by the way also makes it possible to have parts of your application parts of your architecture written in different languages so as long as they follow specifications you can break your application in parts that might speak different languages a message system also has plays the role of a buffer because as soon as you have a synchronous way of communicating when the producer when when some agent sends a message to the to the system it's not necessarily delivered immediately all the way to the final recipient it might stay there in the message system waiting for the moment when someone needs it maybe the maybe the final destination is offline for a second or whatever so a message system also plays the role of a buffer which opens a lot of discussion on how to effectively store the data and makes it make it fast to retrieve and whatnot a message system usually supports various ways to deliver messages various patterns of usage so there are we will see them quickly the two main the two main choices are between a shared queue and a pub sub or fanout approach and then these messages what are these messages well um they can be one at the lowest level they are usually binary strings or strings of characters whatever but they might have a schema imposed on them such as uh other schema with intrinsic validation by the message system or they can be i don't know json encoded so this really differs on depending on which messaging platform and which configuration you're looking at but okay now there is there is something to be said on on messaging systems because we are in a sort of golden age for them because you remember when there was the time of uh database nosql revolution so about 10 or 15 years ago there was so big data was a novel concept and the the web the web scale of data was a new thing and basically there was a revolution in in an explosion a cambrian explosion of databases in particular in in the nosql sector and we are sort of witnessing the same in this in the real of messaging platforms so you see the three most relevant maybe platforms are rabbit mq apache kafka and apache pulsar and they all came out in a in a handful of years apache pulsar in particular is pretty recent uh but let me say that kafka is probably the one you have been heard about the most i don't know rux what do you think everybody knows kafka at least everybody who deals with messaging knows kafka in my opinion yeah i think i think kafka has been around for a little bit longer right but yeah but we'd like to think that you know pulsar has some advantages as well so so we can we can kind of go through that but but you're right you know i mean the the um you know the pattern is the same right yes absolutely you know the philosophy is the same the paradigm is the same yeah uh but but you know there are definitely you know there are certain things like for example um you know you can do jms you know i know there are people talking about java here so i just wanted to drop it in you know easily with pulsar whereas it's not easy to do that with cop yeah that's a good point yeah yeah so we will we will look at pulsar in more detail but let me say that there are uh there are new novel so there are modern messaging systems and they sort of build on on the shortcomings of the previous ones so we are learning a lot but the point is that every with every year there are more and more uh usages out there that call for messaging systems so in a sense even even 10 years ago there was no not so the need for messaging systems was not so ubiquitous let me say so uh a messaging system that is very modern such as pulsar has already been built keeping in mind today's challenges so we will see some of them uh very briefly because we are not focused on on the internals of pulsar today but so what are the mess what are the use cases for messaging in general you might have a data set that is never complete in any meaningful sense so think about having a batch project processing chrome job that every night crunches the last day's data and and find some insights okay so every night you have your analytics running but this is really an arbitrary uh choice of slicing in one day parts you might as well think of having an hourly cron job that does works very much more frequently and crunches up a smaller amount of data because say you have your website and you will get data forever basically so any kind of of slicing of your data set will be arbitrary so in this sense the data set will be never complete by the way if you think about making the the slice thinner and thinner and thinner you're basically moving from batch processing to real time messaging based analytics which is what messaging is there for so if you have a data set that comes keeps pouring in new data points in a continuous way you probably need a messaging platform at some point or you might have the need for uh sharing a queue of to do items so let's say you have i don't know the typical example is the meme generation website there might be a queue of images to process it would be great great to have a messaging system just to store a queue of items that have to be processed and maybe one or more agents polling to do items processing them and marking them as done that is deleting them from the queue [Music] okay so this is very general but if you look around in practice there are iot with a lot of sensor data coming in all the time there are social media updates you know notification i post you post you mentioned me and what not there are i don't know self-driving cars and similar automation issues financial data online gaming so there is actually a lot of situations where messaging so real real-time event streaming is more suited than a database sort of because there is a continuous trickle of new data points basically okay so uh this is this picture uh would wants to sketch something that by now you should already have somehow glimpsed so a messaging system is at the center of exchange of messages whatever they are so binary strings whatever so there are producers and this is a bit of terminology there are producers that creates these messages and send them to the system and there are on the other side consumers and the consumers what they do they just take the messages from the system so this is the uh basic idea now we already mentioned that this is a synchronous operation because yeah we might have a consumer that is offline and then it comes up later back to life and wants to get the messages that have been piling up in the meantime or similar situations so we want full asynchronicity and this involves the question of probably in a messaging system you you might want to have a look at what is the retention policy for messages so are they deleted as they are after a given time or uh will they be deleted when a consumer has used them and marked them as done or whatever um which brings me to that another point so in a messaging system you might support different uh guarantees of delivery so we probably want a messaging system to ensure that all messages are delivered to some consumer now uh this is something that we usually require something that we might require is is exactly one's delivery that is we want to guarantee that no message is delivered more than once well this is a bit harder because of you know network and intricacies of possible types of failure that can occur over a network and you know what in most cases there is not that's not even so important so you might so having an exactly once the livery guarantee is really in most cases is too much and it's expensive so in most applications you might just be happy with at least once delivery and then your application code might have to do some tricks to handle possible duplicates okay so we mentioned that there are different ways of consuming messages and the shared queue is one of them uh look at the picture so we have producers that creates message and they are the messages are stored in a topic by the way you will hear the word topic a lot because topic is in a sense the smallest unit of so the let's think of a topic as a pipe that routes messages sorry for the very hard approximate analogy but a topic is a logical uh grouping of messages that usually are to be thought in an ordered manner and they are filled on one end and they are consumed on the other end so so to speak so messages in a topic in the shared queue pattern are shared by the various consumers that are taking them so we might have several consumers and they are all drawing messages from a given topic and we have an exactly once delivery system so every message will be used by a single consumer we mentioned the idea of a to-do item list and this is how i would describe it so let's say there are some expensive processing to do on each message probably what we want is every single message has to be processed only once we might have more than one consumer so they will share the queue and every message will go to exactly once consumer um well a topic is more or less of a first-in-first-out queue yes conceptually but not exactly because and i was about to mention that with this consumption pattern you might have out of order messages arriving that's because one of the consumers might get a message then something might fail it will not acknowledge having processed it and this message has to go maybe to some other consumer which in the meantime has processed many other messages so if you need ordered delivery that's not for you an example is you know rux and i will maybe go through the homework submissions later so i will do some i will grade some of your homework and drugs will grade some other of your homework so the submissions will be in a longer list of to do items think of that as a as the queue in the picture and we will we would like to have a messaging system to tell us which homework i should grade and which homeworks racks should grade you know to avoid doing the same work twice and that's exactly a shared queue situation okay a good thing of this passage and sometimes and sometimes it may actually be a workflow where you know you may want to look at it you know like let's say i i say okay but you have the final authority to say well it's good or bad or whatever right so so so there are a number of different workflows we can set up you know and i think messaging gives us that kind of flexibility to be able to do that yes exactly because the other big idea the other alternative idea is pub sub or better fan out so we might have producers putting messages in a topic and then many consumers will just you know tune into this topic and every one of them will get all messages so that's a very different thing because it's more like i don't know we all have our uh you know analog radio and we tuned to the same frequency we are hearing the same music all of us or we maybe rux and i will follow the same twitter handles and we will get the same list of posts similar thing things so a pub sub or better fan out pattern is the one where every message goes to the topic and then it is delivered to everyone that is subscribed to this topic so that's cool because it allows for uh it is a low resource way to broadcast messages and it's also cool because any new consumer can tune in at some point and they will just start getting new messages or they can tune out so they can cancel their subscription and will stop you know stop getting the new tweets by the handle that they don't follow anymore but now think about that this is exactly what we need for our game architecture because any move by any single player will have to be routed to all clients connected to my game because i want so if if my if my player does something i want every other player to see my to see me on their screen doing that thing so this is exactly the kind of pattern we need indeed each player has to receive all updates to the game world coming from all players all other players so this is the pattern we are going to use in our game at least conceptually now before before going on i would like to stress one point messaging are not databases there are huge differences the most important difference is that in a database data is there at rest so there are tables or collection whatever you name them and data so records are sitting there quiet waiting for me to query in a messaging system data is in transit by assumption so they are built around the idea of making transit of data efficient fast and instead of tables you speak about topics usually so for example all the complex indexing and joins that are usually possible in databases is are probably not at the center of attention in a messaging platform so data thresh database data and transit messaging that being said there are in reality there are many similarities and actually the boundaries are a bit blurred between the two because messaging system modern messaging systems at least so the log based ones offer some kind of persistence of their data and conversely databases some of them at least are equipped with a change data capture which is basically a service offered by a database that makes it possible to tune in to all changes that occur in the database and just here update after update everything every change that is occurring to the database so actually um by the way apache cassandra has been given the gift of cdc these days so it has been released really a few days ago and i encourage you to play with it because it's pretty cool it makes it possible to do wonderful things but the point is that if i were able to to listen to the cdc stream from my database from the beginning of time i would be able to reconstruct the full state of the database now no problem so that's the point and the another way of mixing these two ideas that there are let's say a modern data a modern data stack today a modern data infrastructure will probably use both messaging systems and databases coupled in various ways so gate basher today is two hours so we are not even midway okay so i think i'm running a bit late so i will skip some more internal details let me just tell you one thing i just mentioned that modern application architectures probably usually have both messaging and database storage today we will not have a database at all so this is a first i guess for us we will just not create any database not use any database and we will just focus on messages so i will show you that it isn't it possible to have a simple game that has no persistent storage obviously if we want to make our game a bit richer there will be at some point the need for persistent storage okay gate basher i'm sorry to hear that duly noted we will make sure this will be corrected for the next workshops thank you okay so just one thing messaging systems are complex they are huge pieces of software and they require pretty some experienced expertise to be created the right way so they have to be high performance they have to guarantee the correct delivery of messages probably we want them to be fault tolerant they have to support some failover policy maybe data have to be replicated in the right way to avoid you know crash to have the crash tolerance they need to support some sort of scaling and so on so it's really a difficult thing not only that but even just operations might sometimes be not trivial i think everyone who tried to repartition a kafka topic knows what i'm speaking about and guess what that's why today we will have a managed solution to take all of these problems away and concentrate on the important bits today we are going to use astra streaming astro streaming is embeds apache pulsar or is built on patch pulsars so first let me tell you quickly what apache pulsar is it is a messaging system that was one of the most recent ones born at yahoo and then moved to be a top project in the apache foundation it is a messaging system supporting the two main delivery patterns so pub sub and queue shared queue pattern one of the key ideas behind pulsar is that to split compute and storage so there are you have an apache pulsar cluster there is a sub-cluster handling storage of data so just the the messages are stored there in a particularly replicated and distributed way and another independent set of nodes in the cluster will just handle connection to producer and consumers and this second part is stateless so it's intrinsically able to withstand crashes and restarts no problem other very cool features of pulsar are multi-tenancy i will show that in a second it's rather easy to scale it horizontally which is a must in today's world because you know cloud cloud native architectures and so on indeed pulsar has a rich support for kubernetes deployments pulsar has high performance high throughput and low latency is designed around a few technical ideas that allow for a very astonishing performance and it is supports jio replication so you can configure a pulsar cluster to be a pulsar instance to be replicated across geographically faraway clusters then there is something else but let me gloss over it astro streaming takes pulsar and makes it into a managed service in the cloud so basically with a few clicks you will have your own pulsar cluster up and running you will create your streaming topics and then you will be using that to run the game on okay um multi-tenancy and logical structure of pulsar uh topic so if you think of a single pulsar instance let's say a pulsar cluster whatever if you think of a pulsar cluster as a big house there are apartments and that's cool because apartments are occupied by several tenants and they do not know of each other the everything so anything a tenant does will not affect any other and this is the principle of multi-tenancy so a single pulsar instance will support logically and strongly separated and independent tenants so you see in this house there are a few other people and then there is you with your tenant called game server or whatever you will call it and then uh how is how are the topics logically grouped within your tenant the topics will be grouped in namespaces and by the way we will be using the namespace called default and within a namespace there will be topics so you see there is a tenant code game server which contains a namespace called default and then there is a topic called word updates so you see in in the balloon here the fully qualified name for your topic will be tenant namespace slash topic name and this is something you have to remember because you always have to start with a tenant okay let me skip the architecture bits and then finally we can move on to the first practice part so i will give you again the link to the github repo just for you to better follow but i will don't worry because i will jump myself on the repo here okay so you see the repository here and this is by the way this is designed to be a self-service so anytime you can just go here and follow the instructions in this readme i will do them basically i will do the same and the first point we have to start with so okay by the way if you scroll down you see there is a part to there is a section telling you how to do the homework and how to submit it i will show that later but let's start with step one creating your astro streaming instance so we okay we said what astro streaming is so please just locate this orange button create astro here uh and click on it maybe in a new maybe right click to open in a new tab that so maybe ah okay so let's see if nightbot gives me the link i will drop it in the in the chat anyway so if you click on this link you will be able uh here there we go thank you nightbot so if you click on this link you will come to a page similar to this one that makes it possible for you to register to astra name work email password whatever then you create your account and you will you can also sign in with your github or google account so this is completely free let me stress that creating an astra account is free and obviously i already do have my own so let me log in while you are signing up this will be required for you to create your own free streaming topic in a second there we go so ah sorry i have to okay sorry this should work okay so if you register you should be able to enter astra and this is the interface you are you should be seeing um okay so let me stress this is free because astra is actually a single product containing a database offered at the service which is famously astrodb built on apache cassandra and in currently in open beta there is also the streaming which is what we are going to use um okay so i will assume i will give you one minute or so to just make sure everyone is able to register here and they came to this point and in the meantime we go ahead okay so maybe i can just go on at this point it's okay let's assume you all have your own astra account today we are not creating a database and we will just directly jump to the create streaming button here you see next to streaming there is a nice create streaming button if you click on this you will be able to create your own streaming tenant with a namespace and a topic in it and the topic will be used to run the game so let's start by creating the streaming now there's a trick streaming names have to be unique across accounts so if i will call my streaming topic game server dash 223.221 you will be not able to use the same name so please what i suggest is you call it game server dash something whatever abc xy whatever but then maybe you want to keep this name i will store it in my text file text editor buffer here and i will go ahead and create a tenant with this name so please choose a different name just a random different name and remember it so we are creating just use you just use your name or something yeah exactly it's easier so create your tenant you remember the tenant is the name on on your apartment right okay so you have to select a provider in a region i'll go for aws why not but that's any choice is okay no okay i'll go for google cloud that i think offers europe if i remember well yes i'll go to europe and that's it so tenant name anything game server something so maybe i will right in the chat any name that is not taken is good for you then you choose a provider and a region and then you hit this button you see create tenant or maybe you can't see it very well now sorry okay so there you go if you click ah somebody beat me into this game so i have to change the name gameserver211 create tenant okay there we go so you see someone stole the name and i had to change it so uh let me update he's here you've been you be you beat me to it okay so you see it's very fast and the tenant is there ready for me to create topics on that so i would ask i would like to ask you to give me a thumbs up if you happen if you get to this point and you have your tenant up and running please give me a thumbs up if you manage to get this point and you have your tenant ready yes blackmagic.exe yes this technology can be self-hosted i mean pulsar is a apache project so it's open source and it absolutely it can be deployed in any conceivable way let me say so you can run it on your own laptop or probably in your own data center or in the cloud with or without kubernetes you can just you can just uh let pulsar run in any way if you want and manage solution that's obviously within astro streaming because that's managed you know but the underlying pulsar is a completely open source project that you can run any way you want i'm very happy to see a lot of thumbs up so let's continue because we created the tenant and we will be using the namespace called default you remember this block containing topics but let's create a topic and to do that you see i'm now exploring my dashboard for my own tenant i if you see there is a tab here called topics if i click on topics i will be watching i will be having a list of the existing topics well there are none yet that's why i want to click on add topic i click on a topic and guess what i can create a new topic so uh as opposed to tenants they they can do not have to be unique across the whole universe so you can and we i suggest you to use the very same topic name as everybody else topic name use word updates let me check because i should be word updates it's all written here word updates very good okay so make sure persistent is yes and partition is no and you can hit save so topic name word updates save by the way yes so in one or two seconds you will see the word updates topic appearing and that's there ready for me to use so we have our topic we have our topic in the default namespace in our tenants so all of the infrastructure as far as pulsar is concerned is there ready for me to use and before moving to the next part i just want to show you that if you go to the quick start or sorry if you go to connect here now i made my interface a bit bigger to increase the font size to make it easier for you to read but anyway if you go to the connect tab here you're able to see all details of your topic in particular i want to point you to this broker service url which is something that i want to copy and store in my own text editor buffer here for later usage and so broker service so okay once you create your topic you go to connect and you can have a overview of the connection details the secrets so to speak and the connection strings important bits for us are broker service url here and token now token you do not need you do not even need to show it because it's a very long string of gibberish blah blah blah but if you click on this button you are able to copy it and maybe out of convenience i will store it here you see it's a rather long random looking thing okay so simone asks what does persistent mean yes you remember when we said databases are not streaming so uh in streaming platforms but there are some similarities so a layer of persistence is there also in a messaging platform think about uh crash tolerance so i have to store on disks so if if there is a reboot a crash i will not lose my data right so that is the level of persistence this persistent me refers to pulsar also supports non-persistent topics which might have some cases and they actually offer a higher throughput you can imagine because it's all in memory but uh yeah you lose the ability to recover after a crash or reboot so depends on your use case if you have really volatile data maybe there might be even better okay so we have created a topic and we have here gotten the token and the service url ready for later so with that i will i would like to stop the practice for a second and come back to a bit of slides so stefano unlike our db astra token which goes away when you navigate away i don't think there is a problem here no problem exactly so yeah yeah so don't worry if you yes don't worry you can navigate away you can navigate away from this tab you can come back to connect and your details will still be here yeah exactly thank you for pointing out okay so make sure you're able to reach this information because that's needed later and with that i want to jump back to the slides for a second and very quickly uh tell you something more on how is the game structured so we have a client sending messages to the server and the server is basically an api it will be a process running on the server actually on the same machine the client runs but on the same machine the client is served from but that's a coincidence so to speak so client sends messages to the api the api will be in charge of speaking to the topic to the astro streaming topic so you see the messages go from the client to the api on the server then from there they go to the streaming topic and from the streaming topic they will be received by the api which also serves as a consumer from the topic and the api will be delivering messages that is game world updates to all clients out there now to make everything easier to think about and to reason about we will not have any case where a message comes from a client and goes straight to other clients every message that goes that reaches the api will be routed to the topic the astro streaming topic first and then it will go back to the api and from there it will be broadcast to all clients that's a choice it makes for a simpler architecture to reason about and it also opens the way to having you know several api instances running and serving different blocks of clients and everything would work because every communication would happen through the astra streaming basically that's one point uh another point is we will need some kind of validation of client input and that will happen as soon as messages come from the client it will happen on the server side on the api but from that point on we will trust a message to be valid so when a message comes from the topic is consumed from the topic by the api it will then be routed no questions asked to all clients that's another choice i would say reasonable one but okay let's go ahead what technologies are involved today well some of them we already mentioned so i will start from the far right astro streaming as a messaging platform we will have a python to run the api in particular we will use a framework of a modern python called fast api i hope there will be time to go much in detail on that so fast api will run the the python code that makes for the api the server side and it will communicate to astra so to pulsar through the ordinary pulsar python drivers the communication between client and the server will be yes fast api is cool unless you i agree the communication between client and api will be done through websockets so websockets are a very useful and well-performing way to have a full duplex communication between web servers and web clients and they allow for servers also to initiate data [Music] move data push over a connection that is kept open for a long time so this is all cool and this is exactly what we need so we will have web sockets between client and api and python drivers between api and the the streaming topic and just a remark there are other so many of our other workshops will actually be are actually serverless so they have no server proper to speak of but in this case especially thinking of a future extension of the game where there is some state to be kept and probably it's it makes sense to have a server keeping you know keeping tabs on what's happening in the game world that's not necessary but still is how many of the online games are structured so what technology are we using in the client well that's going to be react which is a node.js a very well-known framework for building reactive applications uh we will not go we're this is not a tutorial about react but if you're interested in the github repository you will find a link to um to a starting react starter tutorial that is very useful for you to start getting uh an idea of how react works okay so so stefano i know you know i've i'm i'm cheating a little bit here i know i've seen the mental mental questions okay so the previous slide might you might want to pay some attention because i know there are some questions around yes right okay yes that's why i repeated everything so client is in real perfect web sockets between client and api api runs python code so it's server side and it runs python code and that that is where validation of messages takes place api uh fast api is the framework python framework used for that api is the only actor writing directly to the astra streaming and reading from it so it is both a producer and a consumer of messages on astro streaming and there the communication is managed by is done through the python drivers yes thank you for pointing that out might be useful okay so uh very quickly what is the kind of communication so what are the messages flowing around in this game well basically the most important thing that the clients have to publish to to send to the api is i am player with this particular name and i am at position x y in my game area because this game will be just you know players moving in a rectangular [Music] game field so the the most important update the client will will be sending to the server is i am now at position x y and this is the shape the message this is the shape of the message so that this is this is the message of type player and it will just have a payload saying player name is mark x y are this and this so this message is sent to the api by a particular client because that's me that's my own uh i marks let's say the api will then perform some validation and will enrich the data with a player id and the server knows that player id and from that point on this message will be just doing the full round trip all the way to all other clients that's the basic of the messaging there are actually other kind of messages used in in this communication protocol for this game um there is a trick so if if a client is leaving the game it will just send a message with chord null coordinates just to notify everyone else that they left the game so every other client will be able to you know stop drawing a given player in the field then there is an in-game chat and the so you see the message will be of type chat and it will contain basically the text to show in the in-game chat by every every client and then there is a special message that will be sent only once directly by the api no streaming involved a message of type geometry because when a client first connects to the game the api will tell it wait you are playing on a field with this size so the word you're playing the word you are playing in will have these in these features this is something that the api directly sends to the client no streaming involved and it is a message of type geometry but anyway you will maybe see them in the game so uh very quickly i want to stress that we for simplicity reasons we will have all messages going through the same one topic so they are different kind of messages you know chat geometry player positions they will just be serialized as jsons and flow through a single topic that's probably not something you would do in production where you would carefully design all of your topic and maybe impose a schema on top of them but now we want to we don't want to get mad at creating a lot of topics so we will be working in a simplified setup for the same reason to keep things easy and and simple and easy to to inspect we will have two separate websockets even though that's bi-directional actually but there will be a player websocket used only for client-to-server communication and a word websocket used by the api to send word updates to all clients that's just to make everything easier to do to see when it happens and now let's start having some code running so if you go back to the repository and i will drop the link again or better i will ask nightbot to give me the link i will switch to the repo again we are at step 2a so we want to uh we want to take this repository in particular the code and i want you to to start your own ide browser tab where you will be running the code and looking at the code so if you click on this open in git pod maybe i suggest you to right click and open in your tab what happens something very cool happens because git pod oh sorry open link in your tab open link a new tab there we go so something cool happens because i will go to gitpod i will log in with my github credentials and probably i'm asked to authorized blah blah blah so i'm i'm actually just doing a single sign-on thing so i'm back to the gitpod interface and what hap what's happening now gitpod is creating an instance of an ide in the cloud for me and there we go so you see we have let me make this a bit easier to navigate if you open in git pod you will be having a local clone of the repository with old code ready for you to inspect and it is something that looks like visual studio code basically and it is in the cloud so everything in the browser so maybe i can ask you to give me a thumbs up if you manage to locate this opening gitpod button and if you manage to open the repository here in your ide in the cloud so please give me a thumbs up if you get to this point and as you see okay thank you it's working for a lot of you that's very great to to see uh what's happening behind the scenes here well we equipped this git pod initialization with a few cool dark theme it should be hamburger menu uh don't remember maybe files something i think it's slash settings and then you know something like that i don't set up references here maybe it's here settings oh it's really yeah theme i will i will send it okay so yeah i will go back to so okay we we set up this this git pod initialization in a way that does already some secret uh dependency installation for us so we can just go oh right the cog and the color palette okay so here manage settings no comment palette color palette color theme here i think it's this one yes so okay for the dark mode you click on this cog icon and then there is a color theme menu that pops up thank you i the phrase thank you okay so gitpod you now have an ide where you can inspect modify and run the code as if you were developing locally on your machine so you have a file browser on the left a file explorer here on the left a text editor here on the top which incidentally is also opening the readme but that's just uh that's basically where you edit code let me show you this is where you edit code you see and then on the bottom panel you have consoles you see those are just simple consoles if you see client ready you're probably good to go no you do not need to fork the git pod repo so today we're not we do not fork we do not copy you just basically what you did is you went to a environment a development environment and you get cloned my repo our repository that's it so no problem okay um the pip install is done already for you so we already secretly configured this gitpod setup to da to do something for you already so we should be ready good to go let me tell you one thing we will have client and api running here on the same gitpod instance in development mode for these reasons i want to point out that here on the bottom right you have uh navigation you can navigate between two different consoles there is one called setup api which is where you see api ready to start and this is where we will run the api and another one is the setup client which says client ready to start so if you were developing in your own local machine i would maybe open just two consoles but that's the same so you have two consoles and that's important because we have to start to have two things running at the same time right client and server okay all right i'm done i think the documentation also mentions it as api consoles so if you're yes if you're wondering what it is i think um stefano did a great job of explaining yeah it should be self-explanatory also for for those of you who likes to like to do that later by your own that should be not a problem otherwise it reaches on on discord whatever and pingas okay so uh first thing let's set up the api so pay attention i'm going to the uh api console here the one that says api ready to start and to answer veronica you see actually yes there was a pip installed but we did it before we did it for you so it's ready to go except one thing so this is the console we will be running the api in but we need to tell so each one of you need to tell your api running application to create the m file price so there is there is a hint by gonzalo uh control plus k plus t maybe it's to navigate between the uh i don't know so so maybe i can i can try that and see what what that leads okay i hope it opened me a new tab because it's ctrl t but i okay it's up to you to find out and i'm now yeah exactly okay so um we need to give some um some credentials to the api in order for it to be able to connect to our to your astro streaming ah it's for changing the theme very good okay so there is one important thing to do and it is you see there is a dot so if you open the api directory here there is a dot env sample that is a example env file environment file and you see there are three rows here that define the streaming tenant the service url and the astra token and guess what they are exactly the three connection strings and secrets i asked you to pay attention to and to copy so you should you should first make a copy of this file which i do by command line so cp.emv.sample and i copy it as dot env so maybe i can write this also here so i am in the api console i do this to create a new file called env which will be the real thing and i can edit it so i open this.emv and you should have to replace the tenant the url and the token with the values you used before so i create you remember i had the tenant called gameserver2211 and i will put it here and please leave the quotes i will keep i will take the full service url string and i will put it here as service url and then the very long string that is the connection token which basically provides for secure authorization i will paste it in place of this placeholder where it says astro token so if you now save your dot env and make sure it contains these three lines can you read what you see on my screen because it's a bit small maybe i can try making it a bit bigger maybe like this might be better so i copied dot emv sample into dot env here and i just edited these three settings at the at the top of the file to reflect my own settings okay so once i'll give you a little how do i save the dot env well it depends uh what i did is i just copied it with the cp command i think you can do that also with the save as somewhere there should be a file yeah you can just open the sample file i'm answering to sqlmaster123 you can open the sample file and then there is the samburger menu file save as you see file save as and you save it as dot enb for example this is one of the ways okay so let me close it because i'm focused on the dot emv that's important one because these variables will be picked up as soon as i start the api the cd api command is not in the readme because if you work in gitbot as far as i remember you start already in the api directory that's why there is no cd api to use veronica but if you work locally you will have to make sure you you can delete m sample if you want but that's not a problem it's part of the repo anyway so if you delete it it will just you will just have to commit anyway okay so we have our env and uh it's time to start the api so what you start the api with i see that's strange veronica but i think you you look like you know what you're doing so please see the api in that case and pip install that's very strange i think your git pod might have run into some weird problem so you might have to you might encounter some more strange things along the way but hang on and try otherwise in the worst case you can maybe do it later okay okay wow so everything worked very good okay okay so veronica no problem okay so uh you how do you start the api uv current minus no sorry your uv current api column up that's how you start because you see uv corn is a aesgi uh um gateway able to run fast api python code but we don't have time to go much into that so if you type uvicorn api column up i put it here ah come on okay an apple can appear so if you type ubicon api up you should see something like this that is telling us okay the api is up and running and he's waiting for connections very good okay so that's it for the api now let me go to a very important point we are almost no okay sorry we do another thing sorry let me go back to gitpod there is a so the api is basically ready to go there we do not have to change anything more so let me turn to the client the client even though we did everything already for you let's yes environment variables not detected probably there is a dot emv file missing or it doesn't define yeah so apparently ubiquinone command not found probably there is a pip install that did not happen on your git pod which is very weird so but that's very strange is someone able to run the api so is someone please if if you manage to have the api running please give me a thumbs up okay yes okay okay so uh those of you who are meeting problem i suggest you to go through the readme again and then maybe reach to us if there is something strange going on maybe you might be just in the wrong directory in the wrong uh console of the two okay so i i see a lot of api up and running so let me go to the client api the client console now i mean just what one suggestion is you know you can go and delete the workspace and start new websites and get part yes yeah sometimes we have had we have issues have some hiccups yes yeah okay so just as upper functory thing i will run an npm install in the client console actually we did that already for you so it's just to to go through the motions otherwise it will take a bit more but npm install basically installs all required dependencies for the client application and we stop one second here and i go to the client the the slides so very quickly what happens when the client starts well as soon as the web socket connection is initiated by the client to the api as i already said the server will send a geometry message telling the client my word is so large and so tall at which point the client will uh invent an initial position for the player it will send the message player position to the server there will be a validation by the server and then as we already so it will this validated message will go to the topic and from there it will be picked up by the api in various instances so every websocket connection will be so every running function in the api uh responsible for any web socket connection will pick up these updates messages and send them broadcast them to the client which will then update the word and redraw so that's the basic uh you see time flows to the right in this image times flows to the right also in this image and it is the basic item of gameplay so you see on the client side what happens is that say you click a button and your player moves around okay that means that the position changes and through thanks to the magic of react a position change triggers sending a message through websocket to the server the server validates as we saw before validates the value of a coordinate basically xy the message goes to the topic the topic pushes the data to other parts of the api the ones responsible for the word websockets of all connected clients and then this update go to every client for them to update the word and redraw the screen something more that happens is that this validation is then used by the client itself in this way if i am the client and i'm getting back an update on a position and it is about my own player i will use this value to change my own value of x y there's a reason so we will come to that later but see a validated message when it bounces back to the client is also used to update my own knowledge of my position in the game then there is how the in-game chat works but we will skip that and then it's time to play so if you have your api running on the api console that's good and we will just leave it there what we need to do on the client api is a simple npm start so with this command and m start the client project will start in development mode and it will be available here in this very tiny hard to use browser window so let me take this url you see this url sorry and paste it so i want to play yeah exactly so okay well later later so you will take this url here and let me open a new browser tab a real browser tab i paste my url here and there you see so maybe i make it a bit bigger you see this is the game running uh let me change my name because there are random names drawn for you but let me change my name to stefano and everything should be ready to use so if you click enter game there i am in the game so you see now i made it a bit too big maybe i am in the game and if you see as you click on the arrows you're sorry my player is moving i want you yeah i want you to put that url in the chat so that i can later later let's go to the no not now so no okay we have to see important things still so you see this game is working and i can also by the way you should also be moving around in your own world if you click on the game field you can use also the arrow keys on your keyboard so you see i'm moving around everything works and every move every movement of my player here is a message that goes all does all the round trip from client to server from server to a pulsar streaming topic from streaming topic to the api again and then back to my server to my client which is running in my local browser so everything is yeah vic your spider isn't in the game but your spider isn't in my game because we have different servers i guess your spider is in your game at the moment every game is separate um that's a good point but before before uh trying to do a multiplayer proper thing i would like you to try and go to negative coordinates so you see i'm trying to hit the left key a lot i'm trying to get to get to negative coordinates that just doesn't work but look if i keep the arrow if i keep the arrow click uh pressed for a brief moment i can see negative values in my position you see but then i leave or somebody managed to get here hello hello nice to see you okay so it seems to work you spoiled my game hello somebody else is coming okay now if you if you try to go to the left you see for a sec for a split second you see a negative value here uh how come so this negative value very quickly disappears and we are back to zero in the coordinates so how why does this happen and how well uh in one second i will tell you but first let me show you here that you for if you later want to dissect the if you want to dissect the code or anyway see this messaging protocol network you might want to have a look at this status bar below where you can see the last sent and last received message so you can see what happens so if i move you see when i move when somebody moves you will see the messages changing and you will be able to check if the protocol is how the one we we described earlier okay so how come you so what why why are you going are you able to see for a very short time you see negative values but then you come back to you go back to zero in this case well the reasons the reason is in the slides because you see we have client-side validation and we we cannot have so it doesn't make sense to to let the clients do validation of coordinates or whatever might be in a more complex game because clients are cheaters you know as soon as there is an online game there are cheaters so it is absolutely a responsibility of the server to be making validation of input of coordinates or whatever and you see it here so what happened is that my coordinate is zero and then the message with zero goes to the client to the server the client the server puts a zero in astro streaming and then i get a zero back all nice or good then i click my arrow key and my coordinate becomes one same thing one goes to the server the server is okay one is a good coordinate yes viknash kumar exactly so client you see the third case client sends a minus one because this is its local internal value it has to hold it is holding it sends a message with a minus one the api changes back to zero and the zero is what i get back what the client gets back is a zero indeed as i as i told you the client is taking game updates from back from the from the server and using them if they if they refer to itself uses them to update its most recent knowledge of the played player position so it is asynchronous and we give some we give the players a very good feeling of you know responsiveness of the application but still we rely on on server as having the last word but then there is a trick because something weird can happen if you don't pay attention when you write such a game you might have you might end up in an infinite loop of conflicting updates so look at this look at this sketch time flows to the right suppose we have two very closely spaced user inputs so we go from three to four and from four to five very very quickly both triggers sending a message this message bounces all the way down to the pulsar topic to the streaming topic and then they bounce back to my client so i might end up receiving the 4 after i sent the 5 which means oh wait i am at four not at five but then i change i'm actually changing my local knowledge from five to four which means i'm sending out another message with a four but maybe in the meantime my five is coming back and so on so i am stuck in an infinite loop of fake non-violent updates just because asynchronous so if you having a synchronous messaging and having server side validation is all good and nice and this is the way it should work but still there are tricks to pay attention to because i might have such unpleasant side effects and this is a typical implementation problem when you think about asynchronous systems and in this case how do we solve this and this is exactly the solution is implemented in the code if you care to have a look and try to track it basically we want to avoid the four we want to ignore these four because it's not the most recent update anyway right and we do that by introducing a generation counter so every client has a ever increasing integer number that counts just the numbers the updates the changes in coordinates every time we send a message with to the server with a new position we attach the number of the generation number that was sent at i will give the url in a second don't worry so every time a message is sent there will be this generation number attached to it and whether the value is validated or not that value the the generation number will do all the round trip and come back to my client and i will just ignore updates that are not from the latest generation so any updates that bears a generation number too low so they are deemed as stale values old values and i will just ignore them so i break the loop as it before it starts i break this vicious loop of conflicting updates before it starts because i've now i have a way to track obsolete updates from the server so it's not perfect but you know in a distribute in a synchronous system this is the best you can do if you want to save the face in front of the player and give give them an impression of fluid gaming okay so we are now ready to do multiplayer for real and for that i will finally try to give you the link to my own game i see someone okay so let's let's try this please try to connect to this game let's see if this works so you see okay my screen is too small but yeah a lot of people seems to work i you know this is a very first in the history of this game with so many players so i have to take a screenshot oh i think i did something different i don't know what i did it's strangely satisfying you know what i don't know what i did ah okay sorry i closed all the windows okay there we go yes because i always think i'm on on linux but i'm not so i took a screenshot if you want okay great thank you okay so as you move your spiders around by the way uh the reason why this game features spiders is because i really like spiders in my it's one of my hobbies to spider biology so that's the reason and i see some of you also found a way to do the secret trick of the hearts cool okay so atlanta to get to the game you actually if you want to you just you can just open the link i pasted to get to my game so apparently actually actually you may want you know somebody who's already finished this to give out a link yes and we can join that too yeah that'll be even nicer yeah by the way this is important every one of you will have a link that will work and you can share the link so the link to your own game can be shared with your friends and it will work as long as git pod is not as long as you don't close git pod secret trick is press h i i want originally i wanted you to have a look at the code to find out but yeah okay anyway it's nice to see that it works uh okay so before before we go on yeah i think this is i i urge you to stop a bit so yeah you have a heart you know that spider hearts okay so before you you all get crazy about spiders there is still something i would like to show you now obviously uh here i've been logged out and i will log in again i will refer you to the readme to find more information because there is not much time more so in the readme you will find a lot uh of additional information on special parts of the game how is in how some things are implemented i will briefly mention them for the curious out there let me just show you one thing that is important if you ever find yourself in need of debugging or experimenting with your streaming application so i'm back in the to the astra console here let me go to streaming to my own uh tenant here to my own topic i will show you that you can actually eavesdrop on what's working on what's happening in your topic so you see this try me tab this is something you might want to do on your own astra if you have your application running on that one you can tune in to your topic from the browser from the astra ui and just have a peek at what's happening in your game so you can basically use this interface to have a look at the messages that are flowing around and if i click connect okay i should i see some websocket timeout that's unfortunate that's really unfortunate maybe we have too many messages flowing around yes i think that might be yeah that's too bad yeah okay so this is probably something that needs a bit of checking so in principle you should be able from here to and i i would ask you to do that when you do the homework to also go through this interface to to check how easy it would be in a development or debugging situation to you know interact with your topic directly from the ui so you can also inject messages yeah so this doesn't seem to work today and that's too bad but then that means we have to move out to move on and stop here on that by the way it's almost time to stop so uh if if anybody has a link you know they can they can try it out and give us a thumbs up that it's working for them it may be working for them right because um you know they may not have so many messages going through yeah vignesh kumar yes you could also move your own spider only according to what happens in the pulsar topic that would solve the concurrency but that means you're back to uh you're back to blocking calls basically because you know i click the arrow key then nothing happens on my screen until the message goes around and that might be just maybe milliseconds but still that would be that would uh give uh not affluent not a real-time appearance to the game so that's why we anticipate the client anticipates moving the player because of thanks to local knowledge of what the spider is going to move but then if the server has something to say such as this is not a good position then that will happen [Music] okay so yeah okay the streaming websocket might have some problem now so we will just skip no problem let me just show you that once you get this uh part working if you want to do the whole the full uh experience after playing the game maybe with your friends your family you know nice uh spider gathering you might try to cheat in different ways so if you if you manage to get this interface working you might also try to inject messages you craft fake messages and inject them here and you would see the consequences on your spider game directly you will see fake messages in the chat yeah okay i see in the in-game chat i wish this workshop had some coding involved well there is there is no time in a workshop to write code interactively but both in the readme and in the slides there would be more detail on some of the most interesting tricks that are employed in the code and yes as veronica points out the homework requires you to know what's going on in the code bot on client and server side because you have to do some very tiny coding to have something more working in in the in the in your application in your game so um there is a there is a instructions there are instructions in the readme that makes it makes it uh so force you to try to inject fake messages and see the consequences on on the interface then there are homework instructions which will we will see very shortly in a second and then you see uh for those of you who ask about coding there are some selected topics here described more in detail in the readme about how do you do websockets with react how do how is fast api structured and also some tiny trick some neat trick with svg because the graphics of this game is based on svg so let me go back to the slides now and we did the hands-on multiplayer so yeah so you see if we had if we had more time i would point out how the client app react up is so the main structure of it so you will have a look at the code because there's there is some explanation there so this is the trick of react and web sockets but yeah something about fast api by the way the slides are all there in the repo for you to read so please have a look and come back to us with questions whatever we would be happy to you know go in more detail something about python pulsar and web sockets how do you do react graphics at least how what is the trick we employed with react graphics so there might be some possible directions for improving this game the most ambitious one is to in introduce player player interactions and player world interactions which are not there and that's because there is no db no persistent storage other than the topics other than the streaming platform okay so i think we are now rux in the position to do the quiz so we've been playing with spiders and uh luck it was very good to see a lot of spiders jumping on my game and moving around because as you know as you all know i like spiders so but now it's time for you to take a quiz and maybe win some swag so rugs if you're okay i will switch to your screen for the quiz and i will try to put on some music so quiz time this is the fun part that everybody is waiting for right yeah and and and again you know i mean i know you'll get these instructions but but don't look at uh you know the screen but look at where you have mentee because there is definitely a time lag and yeah you know you may not be able to be the on top of the leaderboard yes so please uh yes i will send the code again but you can see it on screen as well so maybe you already you're still you're still connected from the beginning of the workshop otherwise please jump to mendy.com and enter this code or scan the qr code and you will be able to uh give us your answer now for what is coming you have to answer with the correct answer but also you have to be fast to get more points and to jump on top of the leaderboard because the first three will win a prize okay so uh maybe i can move you a bit on the left to have a look so yeah many many of you joined already we can wait another minute or so for all of you to jump on board perfect so look at your phone please because otherwise you will be suffering from a undeserved lag if you look at youtube yeah okay so 80 can you hear the music is it too loud maybe i don't hear music oh maybe not sorry i have the volume low so no okay it's it's there is there it's there but it's maybe i can increase the volume yeah let's see okay all right derek say i suggest you to take it easy and to go through the readme instructions on your own with your timing because any we any any maybe small uh issue that occurred now might involve some troubleshooting and i suggest you to go through the readme and do the practice by yourself because the rhythm is pretty self-explanatory but in any case please reach us on the discord channel and there we will be happy to help you if you if you can tell me where you get stuck but not now so we it's now quiz time you know okay yes so get ready to answer fast and get more points ready okay [Music] so maybe i can i might have had some trouble with my git pod maybe [Music] okay drugs did we skip question one i did not it's it's going back in the same loop which is surprising okay so maybe let me try something different okay the countdown is working and then like it seems to go back in the same loop okay that's we haven't seen this before right [Music] um i yeah put the generation id on the questions so i'm not sure what's happening yes oh it's bad all right let me try this let me get out of this more and see if i can try a different way okay so let's see this is this working yeah but i think so yeah now we are seeing it but i think many many of the attendees already so so they jumped to several questions ahead so let's see where we are so this is question number i cannot say i remember by heart so it's probably okay so what's what's happening in this streaming in this okay drugs you might want to do a hard reload of 90 and we start all over maybe that could be best thing to do so do a hard reload and we will play the game again i mean we still have time to so it should not be a problem [Music] i can do that okay sorry guys we will try again maybe yeah maybe the quiz might have had some glitches yeah so you want me to log out and log it yeah but you probably have to you you have to oh wait click on result reset results on the left on the blue panel on the left reset no no no below yeah reset everything so we start fresh otherwise all slides all the slides no no no no no no no no no i'm not doing it yeah okay i'll slide slides so we reset every input that we got and we start fresh perfect yeah on live things it happens thank you for understanding yeah exactly yes okay um so i'm going to present okay so you should now it should work you can if you're already logged in you will have to join again sorry guys we will give you the link again and we will do it all over no problem with the you know added advantage that you know already the questions so you know that's good because our goal is not other none other than to have you know to to go home with some more knowledge about what's going on with messaging systems so if you learn the questions by heart then that means we did our job yes and and one more thing is you know even though you know the answer like i i know the answer for some of these mentee it still takes you know you need to be nimble to be able to do that right yeah and i can't do that so so it's still a question of your dexterity and how fast you're gonna be so so but don't take anything for granted okay okay so let's give so leave the code again yeah yeah i i okay so if you want to show the qr code yes it's the i key very good yeah david sorry about that uh i know it's been a bit of a problem today with mendy we start with try again and then we'll see what's how it works okay thank you nightbot okay you're back to multimeter okay so i think we can start and we try to you know a word or you can just press forward arrow here yeah i don't think that hey we need to do that right or did you know messaging platforms we can skip it you now know so the answer now is you are all experts you are all very super mega experts so no problem no no no no point in asking you right yes oh still people are saying no no oh come on all right okay so quiz time now uh you should just have to click to hit enter and forward arrow when instructed that should be so uh unless mandy has really some problems today who knows okay so that is good fingers crossed okay so try just to press enter hopefully yes okay so first question the database we created today is called astradb is in the cloud is called workshops or database what database let's see there is a bit think about what we did what you did and time's up so we did not create any database today and this was a tricky question because those of you who attended previous workshops know that we always use a database but today we just use messaging yeah okay just i mean i i think the the message here is that you know i think databases are equally as important as streaming you know they are really at the infrastructure level right um yeah although we didn't create a database it's very unlikely that you can write an application without a database um this was just a workshop so um you know just just for fun yeah okay so next question let's see the leaderboard right yeah so just off on top chase and kaneki but still everything can happen so let's move to second question should be yeah question number two if you press enter okay so remember you have to be correct and fast today we use the messaging pattern called pub sub third queue failover or exclusive i think this we mentioned a few times so let's see think about that and be fast nice oh ho that's very good so yes basically it's a fan out every message is going to every client that subscribed and that's rightly so because it's a game and every client has to display the same word coming from all updates that every other client sends out so yes very good well done guys it's failover and exclusive messaging pattern i don't think so well they are they are specific to pulsars they are variations of a messaging pattern of a basic message so there are different kinds of subscriptions actually that you can have within pulsar those of you who are interested there is a the pulsar documentation is very complete and it's a fun read actually because it is very well done so and there a lot of cool features of pulsar are described so if you are interested in messaging platforms please have a look okay so let's move on moving on let's see the leaderboard and who was the fastest i think mario maker justified past us again congratulations he you now start to have a position to defend he or she is like a bunny yeah yeah so yeah next question let's see next question question three get ready so this is your platform messaging platforms they cannot be in the cloud they decouple sender and receiver they are always schemeless or they are for data in motion now think a bit a bit we covered pretty extensively the general features of messaging platforms at the beginning and both answers were good and congratulations yeah very good very good nice let's see the leaderboard i think we did a pretty good job today at conveying the right uh information the correct important bits of information let's see i think the fastest was tas who also carbs jumps to first position oh x equal with ben x okay third position wiley but justin is right here yeah and everything can still happen so don't lose your concentration and let's move to the next question next question four or seven we still got like almost half left right yeah more than half yes and data reaches the clients directly through astro streaming or through websockets or with client initiated requests or is it maybe that the client only sends data and does not receive let's see let's see did you pay attention let's see through websockets very good yes so there is an api between the client and the astro streaming topics so yes let's have a look at the leaderboard let's have a look at the leaderboard i think it would be changed maybe not yeah well we have a fastest one while he jumps to top yes yeah but it's really a close call so it's it's really close everything like between one c yeah between one and four it's less than 50 points so so it could happen so let me remind you that the first three will get some prizes no pressure okay so all right what comes next yes 507 number five we introduced the generation in messages to know which client writes them or to have a unique id for storing them or just for better debugging or to ignore old updates so there was a precise reason that let me let us to discuss the generation number in the messages and that was time's up oh this card spread all over okay so yeah the correct one is the last one we need to introduce a generation number in messages to be able to clearly tell apart the all the messages bouncing back from the server from the disk from the topic and the server and ignore them to avoid you know this nasty spurious loop of updates okay yeah that was tricky one it's good to know which client breaks them you would probably use a client id or something right yeah there is there is a client id so the client does not explicitly put a client id in the messages but this is added by the api because every websocket connection implies having a different client id so yeah let's see let's see how the leaderboard is shaping up it's getting oh oh oh oh big changes yeah big changes indeed and carbs jumps on top uh yeah chase do the reno so the leaderboard is changed a lot oh yeah this is a significant upheaval oh yeah yeah all right who knows what happens in the next questions exactly there's still hope yeah six or seven two more two more answer fast chat data and player position data use different streaming topics oh there's a typo my fault or they use the same streaming topic or maybe it depends i always want to have type of free material but yeah sometimes let's see chat data and player position data yes they use the same streaming topic very good one thing that we said is that in a say production grade kind of application we probably want to use different topics which might have also different retention policies or whatever yeah yeah greg no swag for you okay so let's see what happened in the leaderboard let's check the leaderboard now let's see let's see yeah okay most of the answers were correct here and okay no big changes at the top so i don't think there's much change right you know let's see the last question for all the marbles yes let's see right i'm enough fast and correct in this game some messages never go through astra streaming true or false and the time is up let's see and the answer is it's true you managed to get yeah you remember we mentioned this geometry updates so when the new establish when a new connection a new websocket step is established from a new client the the server the api just tells the client oh the game work is going to be this and this and this does not need to go through astra streaming because it's it is never broadcast yeah that was hard indeed it was the last one i'm sorry giuliano next time better luck next time um let's have a look at the final leaderboard then final leaderboard i'm sure there are going to be a lot of changes here right yeah probably okay congratulations carbs bennex and chase and please so rugs you should not touch your mint at all because yeah i'm keeping it leave it like that leave it like that like this and uh let me do this because the first three should take a screenshot of their winning screen and send that by email to the address you see so let me retrieve oh my i don't know where it is so cannot see it but send let me write it and send your mandy winning screenshot to jack.fryer at datastax.com okay so and do you want to show them at the screen again so like you know uh people well they should be seeing them in their phone so okay so on the phone anyway anyway the winner are carbs bennex and chase so the first three okay so we can leave mentee on so you have all plenty of time to take so swag is i'm actually not sure it's probably there is a t-shirt and but i don't know because we changed from from time to time so i'm not sure exactly what is this work today uh if you are among the winners you will find out and then maybe you will tell us but yeah and the nice thing is we are able to mail it to anywhere in the world right you know except yeah yeah i don't know exactly how is now the logistics working but i think jack fryer can be will be the right place person to ask now very quickly the homework yeah you've been playing that sorry nikki has a good question yeah well for 13th place come on for the 13th place you got a lot of knowledge for free isn't that a cool thing okay anyway homework homework uh as veronica remarked will require you to do some coding so to inspect the code see how it works and tweak it because we want you to change the the client so that the color of the name of the spiders reflects the spider color as you see here and not only that but we also want you to change the api so that when a new uh client connects they will get a nice welcome customize a nice welcome message in the chat so you will find out sorry we want to remind our attendees that our homework submission processes yes yes so homework submission process changed in the last weeks and everything is there in the readme for you to to look at and to do but basically uh there will be a google form you will have to insert well your data to your name and email because we want to award you a badge then there are some questions to answer there are there is some upload to do of your screenshot of your application after the homework then don't forget to click submit and then if everything works you will get your nice badge so last almost last thing we run workshops every week so be sure to connect with us on datasets.com workshops because we always run cool workshops on several topics ranging from databases to application development and whatnot so that's important and maybe don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel and there is the lottery so you have time until until thanksgiving to submit your uh and so enter the lottery with your material and get chances to win uh you remember the amazon gift cards then okay next monday and next wednesday there will be other events so in particular there is one about a java spring application the next one will be a build a vast digital library and that is based on the jump stack with the node and the netlife serverless functions that's very cool la marsh it's good it's very heartwarming to to see what you're reading and to read what you're writing sorry and it would be a pleasure to have you next time so please join us and uh another point is that we have a discord channel that is going to be so those of you who know us already be aware that we are going to restyle so there is a restyling of our discord channel in progress and probably as far as i know the new server would be will be launched tomorrow with a new name a slide so a massive reorganization with the same purpose but even bigger mission there will be more channels specific to several topics and there will be prices for newcomers and more and more and more so if you already are on discord you just wait sit back and enjoy the changes uh if you're new then you can reach us on dtsx.io slash discord so maybe i can ask the nightbot to tell us to tell us this link so please join us on discord and i think that's more or less all so we thank you so much for attending until now sorry for running a bit late we had this uh mandy glitch don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel and for me that's all it was nice to you to do this with you i hope it's been fun for you as well spiders spiders everyone let me just show you one thing i have a stone here with a spider painted on it just to be to to say um when i say i like spiders i mean that and that's it for me so see you next time thanks everyone and goodbye and as always don't forget to click that subscribe
