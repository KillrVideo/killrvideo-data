    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hi it's Jeff carpenter and I am live here in the studio for another episode of the distributed data show but I'm actually not the host of today's episode the host of today's episode is David Gilardi who is remote from sunny Orlando Florida welcome David why thank you Jeff though though though so since I'm going to host today's show I guess I should introduce our other two evangelists we have three higuaín hello and Luke Tillman the illustrious I like that where's my title man no yes sorry I didn't give one to do we I just so you know we had some we have we're having some internal discussions and another discussion with you know a DSC user about the topic of micro services right and some best practices and discussion on best practices and micro services and the intersection and the data tier and that kind of deal so kind of you know spawn this particular conversations I'm just gonna get right into it and ask so what is a micro service so um man so that's a fun question lots of people have different have different takes on what is a micro service and instead of like maybe defining what a micro service is a micro service is let's talk about what a micro services architecture looks like maybe in kind of a good way to maybe think about it is to contrast it to how we've built applications for many many years so sort of the traditional you know many years ago model that we would use is sort of this monolithic architecture where we would build an application as one sort of big running process maybe we had libraries and modules and stuff in our code depending on a programming language we're using the difference with micro services is we tend to take that Apple II on something that might be a big or the monolithic thing and break it up into lots of smaller processes lots of smaller services and they tend to be organized around something like business capabilities and they tend to interact this time now we've kind of put the network in the middle right so a lot of times there's network communication and HTTP is a really super popular thing in micro services architectures with the idea being that we've got these small autonomous units that can kind of be independently worked on and evolved and deployed a lot of times there's automated deployment kind of involved in this sort of thing and they sort of can involve independence of one another instead of having to do these big monolithic releases that we were doing for many many years does that make sense yeah I would like to also to add something to complement new point of view I want to say also that when you when you switch to micro services there's also a shift in the paradigm shift in the way you you you do programming right it's more like an even oriented programming the idea is now before we used to do our PC you know a stye programming so I I have a song I have inside my big monolith I have a service dissipations calling another service and it's waiting for an answer and because every services are living inside a single runtime you don't see this entire it's intense it's very fast right and now because we are splitting all those services and we are just connecting them with a network so basically we have a disability system here right and in now the paradigm is changing and instead of thinking about okay I make a request and I'm waiting for response the new idea is I'm sending an event and the event should be processed by some services which are responsible for Seva you know I think that's a really interesting point too so you know people will say a you know to me well I'm not using Cassandra or I'm not using DSC yet when I talk to you know maybe when I'm talking to a new user or something like that so you know distributed systems you know whatever you know like I you know and two eyes point you know a lot of people that are doing these micro services architectures which is pretty much everybody these days or a lot of people these days you know you're you're actually you know you're building a distributed system like you know your your database may not be a distributed system in and of itself yet but you know a lot of people are building distributed systems and dealing with the challenges that come along with that ya know very true is that you know would you agree then then for um I'm gonna throw an opinion here and see if you think of it think of this but like for me my take on micro services a lot of times if they're a black box right they have a contained set of functionality do we I was kind of touching on this a little bit and that each one of the services is essentially just going to provide whatever that particular services is that something that you generally agree with I think yeah I mean so I think part of the idea behind micro services is for them to be autonomous reach one to be autonomous and so you know it's got whatever it's sort of API is that it exposes to the world and and you know the other parts of the system the other services and whatever in the system but how it actually works yeah like you know it if you're organizing them around business capabilities it provides some certain business capability or some certain functionality in the site and like how it accomplishes that yes to a degree a black box you know take the idea further I mean the implementation of the black box can be any programming language because usually we assume that the same team is using the same programming language to build the whole system it's no longer true I mean you have one service you can use not Jas you can you Python Java C shop whatever as long as the contract is the respected right and that's all yep yeah yeah it's a very good point so we we've kind of started to touch on this a little bit but you know what do you guys think as far as like why do we need micro services like what kind of issues our class of issues do you think the pay dress well so I think we have touched on this a bit already but some of this idea of having a monolithic program that is so hard to build and maintain and keep track of because you know whether or not you have a monolith it could be well designed and it could be well partitioned internally so that there is some separation and isolation of different aspects of it but we all know the temptations when you're working with a very large code base and it's in a single process and you can easily go over and make that function call access that out of the module it's really hard to maintain that architectural discipline over time so the microservices in a way is helping you enforce that discipline of know you have to cross a process boundary you have to make a remote call an RPC call or you have to omit an event that's gonna trigger some downstream processing and that really helps to enforce the discipline but that's that's not really the number one motivating factor why we do micro services we don't do it just because we can't control ourselves right if we do it for reasons of scale like that's one of the major driving factors is the ability to have hopefully these stateless services that we can if I need more copies of my user service running than my video service I can independently scale and provision as many copies as I need of any any given state full service so that's just one one aspect of the scalability that micro services helps support so two points I want to make so you know first of all to to Jeff's first point about you know about the monoliths and how we may have them organized and stuff like that you know I actually gave a talk at last at last year's Cassandra summit where I kind of talked about how what you know with our killer video reference app we had a modular monolith but I that's what I like to refer to those architectures as is sort of the modular monolith architecture where you've got sort of services in your code you know and maybe you're like maybe you've got some really disciplines you know engineers that are that are good and they're not going to create that big ball of mud but man that temptation is there when you've got everything running and in process and but to the point of the modular monolith for anybody out there listening and you know you haven't jumped on like the micro services band again the microservices type train yet modular mine monolith is a totally legit architecture that can get you very very far for a very long time so like you know I know the micro-services are like the new and shiny thing and whatever but like you know be practical about it you know a lot of times a lot of times especially you know in early startups you end up you know kind of starting with the modular monolith of some kind and maybe evolving as time goes on to to some of these other might like a microservices architecture and then the other point to make is around the around Jeff's point about scale and so scale not just in the technical sense one of the advantages of microservices architectures is that we can scale out you know a service based on demand or you know that sort of thing but also you hear a lot of people talk about being able to scale out people as well right so this is like this goes back to like the mythical man-month and you know like if i throw 10 times as you know sometimes the developers at it they're gonna finish it 10 times faster which is never true right whereas it's sometimes in these in these microservices architectures it's easier to scale out individual teams that have responsibilities for you know for various parts various services in the system and so it can be easier to scale and grow an organization and the people side of things as well something that we don't always talk about I guess as as engineers so that's a really good point actually I mean if you're listening to a podcast you can't see me the whole time Luke is saying this I'm shaking my head yes and for all you project managers out there let's take what you just said with the mythical man-month it's so true so on alright so we we actually just started to touch on this I know this next one is gonna be like totally opinionated right so I'm very curious to see what you guys are gonna say in this but how would you go about designing a microservice you know is it gonna be say based on functional unit tests or you know technical unit tests or how do you identify microservices like that's a big ball right there I'm just thrown at you so I guess I'll jump in first so so I am like I said like I've kind of touched on earlier and sort of my definition I guess microservices a lot of a lot of people tend to talk about organizing your services around business capabilities and so you know it's what I like sometimes I like to think of an analogy like a of an analogy of what how did the business used to function before computers were involved right so like back in the day when there weren't computers or maybe like there were very early computers with me and frames and stuff like that there was probably a lot that was done with like pen and pencil or you know there was some sort of workflow that the business had that that kind of made it work right and so I kind of like to go back to this analogy of you know how things maybe worked with pen and pencil and so you know what is you know things might go to a billing department and then things might you know and then there was another department that was responsible for pricing and there was you know a department that was responsible for the catalog and you know and so you try to try to think of it in terms of you know what business capability is is this you know doing for you know the product that I'm building but then also there's some technical considerations as well and a lot of times I like to think of those as to try and decide if something should be in say the same service boundary as something else is does it need to change together like do I need to be able to sort of transactionally or in you know maybe as near transactionally sort of make changes to these things so if are these two things related so closely that if one changes the other needs to change at the exact same time and a lot of times that can be sort of a technical indication that maybe you know this responsibility should be inside the same service boundary as another service I totally agree with what blue side that I used to call them the hidden dependencies when you try to to to split your morality into micro services you need to pay attention about the hidden dependencies because when everything is living in the same runtime you don't care right but then you start to say okay down this service for example user registration right when do you want to register a new user you want to first save it to the database and then send him an invitation email and so on notification service so think about also all the functional dependencies like does it make sense to create a new server without sending him an email invitation email because from the business perspective the user creation is only completely finished when the guy received this email so if you you fell in the middle functionally they something brought MC so yeah I tend to also reason about the functional unit how can we make one functional unit to be as complete as possible Wow okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna push back against some of this so it's not that I don't agree with the idea that you know if there's some kind of transactional behavior that you wrap a service around it but that isn't work in all cases there are some business transactions that are too big that just span multiple areas that you're not going to be able to put that in one within one service so that's where some of the challenges I think arise first of all let's say that your data tier is implemented using Cassandra it's not as if you can write a transaction that puts a new user entry into the user table and then as part of the same transaction writes a record into another table that says that you know adds to a log of customer emails that I've sent and maybe that's a poor example but you get the idea like we we don't even have the capability in Cassandra anyway to do a transaction that spans multiple tables especially not of two different data types so at some point we're gonna have to not rely on our database anymore if we're doing a highly scalable system and we need a highly scalable database that like the like Cassandra and what it supports we're gonna have to come up with some other mechanisms for achieving that transactional behavior across those boundaries so I have some ideas about what to do there but I'm gonna pause and let you guys share like your opinions on this so maybe I should have been clear like as far as transactions probably a poor choice of words because transactions carry a lot of baggage especially to anybody who's who's from database background yeah but that's the point business transaction doesn't necessarily mean database transaction yeah what I meant as far as the technical limitation of you know like whether like the technical consideration on whether or not something should be inside of the the same service boundary was more around consistency so basically the idea that when when this changes this has to change at the same time kind of thing and to your point about about you know transactions and and sort of we're gonna have these business transactions which span sort of you know you could never build you'd end up having to build some uber service that sort of sort of did this that's absolutely true and and so there's some other patterns of which I also have some thoughts and ideas on how you handle stuff that crosses service boundaries and and so basically my point was more towards like when data inside of you know basically around consistency like it's something if things need sort of immediate consistency a lot of time which I would tell people most of the time you don't right so like we all were so trained because we're so used to building things on relational databases and being able to like kind of reach into different tables and you know wrap it all in a transaction and have it all changed together you know we're so so used to this idea that we need consistency you know people always talk about banks like you know man I'd hate it if they didn't use transactions for for banks you know when they take my money out and stuff like that when that's actually one of the most like eventually consistent sort of system around forever right so a lot of times you're thinking you you need consistency and I would tell you well first of all if you do think that you need that you probably should like check your assumptions and start thinking well you know again go back to that mental model of pencil and paper you know like had how did that work before like did somebody have to walk a change order down the hall to the billing department or something and hand them a piece of paper and they you know and then there was some period of time where some other process had to happen like I mean we vote we've been dealing with eventual consistency in our you know in our business processes forever and so I don't know what I think it's just relational databases may be trained to think we need everything to change together so ya know and we I I thought maybe you had a comment there or am I just now Konya yeah so in fact yeah it's it's amazing that you introduced the idea so if we listen back you say the world's consistency okay transaction a very loaded world changing together so in my mind it resonates us distributed systems right ideas in a distributed system how do you ensure that you have consistency atomicity also because you know when you all your services are running in the same runtime and this runtime is shut down for whatever reason well everything is down right that are alive now if you split them across different services which are linked by a network you can have some services up the other services down so the most common answer to this kind of okay how can I ensure everything is up so the comment is to scale out horizontally it's me that now to to a solution to high availability is okay instead of having one single instance of your service you have multiple instances so in even in a case of failure of one service you still have other service to take you know the the business on ok so now we are talking about high availability horizontal scanning so what I want to say is in fact when you you told you to stop doing micro services you are de facto designing a distributed system right and when you design distributed system you should be aware of all those notions right as we said earlier we need to challenge our way of thinking now we need to adapt to this eventual consistency well yeah so let's take an example of that so I want to go back to that example that the Luke brought up earlier of kind of adding a new user to the system and gonna add a new user and create that record in the database and then we're gonna make sure that we send them a welcome email to our platform or or whatever action it is that we're trying to take so I'm gonna propose a design here and then you could tell me if you think it's acceptable or what the flaws are not but we don't necessarily have to try to tie in a very strong way the the storage of the new user in the database in a single kind of transaction I know loaded term with sending that recognition email one of the things that we can do is take advantage of some asynchronous processing so I would argue that as long as I can ensure that that new user has been written to the database and that I fire off an event that could be captured in some kind of event queue or streaming data store as long as I have that record then I can have another process that is going and picking up those messages and sending the user confirmation emails agree disagree is that a good decoupling of concerns totally agree but that you you are missing an important point is because now you are reasoning about even based architecture you are I'm sending an event some services will capture this event to send out the email or whatever now say that in a distributed world failure exists right it does exist so you you can you have to cope with it so let's say you lost this even are you lost of this message somehow you need to be able to replay this right okay in case of this sending out this message to the email service fail I need to be able to reply this even multiple times and now we are coming back to the idea of idempotency I asked for exactly once I want exactly once delivery to be high so that that's the challenge now now you need to have some circle because it doesn't make sense to a phone user to receive choice or tweet on the same invitation messages especially when he clicks on a link it's not a word works right so now we are talking about how can I make design my system so that the triggering of the email message is executed only once even if I know that I may have to resend the same even again and again so there yeah that's that all the challenges of exactly once delivery semantics and so on and they exist some system to cope with that course yeah I love it and I'm a big fan of event-driven systems so I'm like you know but put some pub/sub messaging at the edges of your services for service collaboration I'm a big fan a lot of times though you do depending on you know sort of sort of depending on your message infrastructure right so like you know the example you gave a user signs up and some event gets published somewhere to maybe a streaming queue or something like that you know depending on what you're using if you're using something with persistent messaging right where you get some at least some guarantee of a time window where you know that that message is going to be persisted the message infrastructure that can be helpful if you have sort of more ephemeral messaging infrastructure so like you know it gets published and what happens like do we I just said what happens if you know that other service that's supposed to send emails is down you know and misses the message kind of thing then I found that a lot of times if you're dealing with sort of these more ephemeral you know kind of messaging of structures that that you have to have some sort of service or you have to have something built into the service to go back and look for the stuff that you missed basically so a lot of times you have these batch sort of in the background cleanup processes this is something that I'm dealing with actually right now in a dative Stax Academy project I'm working on where you know we kind of have that I've got this background process that goes back and looks for things that we might have missed so that's another really super common feature I've found in architectures like this compensating processes right yeah yeah yeah and and a good pattern like if if anyone's listening and wants to go look into patterns for dealing with this sort of any multiple services involved in this business transaction thing there's a pattern out there called the saga pattern that is like awesome for dealing with for dealing with this kind of cross cross service sort of orchestration and you can do retries and and all kinds of cool stuff so definitely check that out okay so so we've talked about like some of your general opinions on microservices and design implementations things like that you know ideas there so what do you guys what is what do you think the takeaway for developers and folks listening to the show is regarding this conversation well you know micro services are hard first of all we didn't even make away it's hard we could we could probably do multiple shows on this cuz we didn't even talk about specific technologies and how to share data between services and we didn't really talk about event-driven are there's so many things we could talk about but you know like once you put the network in the middle you know you get all kinds of failures that you didn't that you didn't get before you know yeah well I mean you know you get some advantages we kind of talked about some of the advantages but also as far as it impacts the data tier just to talk specifically about you know maybe for a second about how it impacts the data tier you know one thing that people really struggle with when they start with something like Cassandra or DSC is you know like the whole idea of like having to normalize your data and when you get to a micro services architecture like it actually can help with some of these problems that people have when they build on on DSM Cassandra so you have a smaller surface area a lot of times of operations that can possibly impact you know your kind of denormalized data the other advantages is one you know one thing that's really hard with DSC and Cassandra is it's really hard to tune clusters and if you're doing sort of the microservices way of maybe having say independent clusters backing some of your larger micro services it's gonna be a lot easier for you to tune for one specific workload as opposed to trying to tune for you know your one cluster that services 25 micro services each of which has completely different characteristics you know about how Reed heavy it is or write heavy it is or whatever so you actually like you this this architectural pattern in your software can actually help some of these problems that people kind of have or pain points they have when they work with DES Kassandra yeah and I just want to mention that I really love how you put that with having a smaller surface area right when you're dealing with micro-services and essentially the way I took that way it is less to think about as far as your data tier for each one of the services it really helps them to find the problem that's exactly what I mean yeah yeah there's less to think about man I think we should we should definitely do another episode on this topic because we need to talk about what David did in killer video how he got a graph to access the data that was owned by multiple different services which could be viewed as a violation of that separation of concerns we have a whole conversation to have about that yeah there's the whole conversation about about services that are sort of reporting type services that need data from lots of places that's a that's an interesting problem and it would be interesting to get some people's takes on how they're solving you know that problem yeah yeah it sounds like another show Jeff we got to set it up okay let's do and then we know into how I violated all of the patterns all right so you guys first like take away for developers anything we hire your Jeff you guys have anything else you want follow up with her yeah I have my final works of Felicity's yeah Michael services is cool but it is not for every project right you shouldn't use it as a good'n hammer so some project is well-suited for micro services some are not because they are so small that it doesn't make sense to split them into different services so no you don't abuse just wisely that's my final work you know is it wrong that when you said golden hammer I immediately thought of Super Mario Brothers and now I can't remember if that's the right game um it's Donkey Kong I totally I think I just totally messed that up anyway that was a visual that I got Jeff do you anything new uh to wrap up with you know all right totally put me on the spot we're gonna end with no no I so everybody thanks again for
