    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems now Adrian you had touched on earlier I mean it's not what we're doing but you had touched on earlier about some other some other potential pads like whether you're talking VPNs or some other things there right right so there there are companies and other providers of connectivity between clouds where you basically get a dedicated pipe where it's it's point-to-point between the clouds versus bouncing out to the public Internet and then back in and doing all that kind of stuff and also like sometimes they can assist with for instance bandwidth cost and a good example just like if you're used to AWS and they're Direct Connect technology whenever you connect that and you're going from data center to the data center or whatever it drops your costs a little bit on your data moving back across the pipe it gives you a little bit lower price cut there just because it's making it more streamlined versus anything going out and then back in um so as far as securing all of that though at the cloud level or the cloud provider level I think that the the first things that you want to look at is just like what what certifications does the cloud provider offer what is the transparency level around how they secure like everything from their data centers to you know the data between the data centers and things like that so the the certifications come into play a lot there and then as you start to look at well those are replicas need sarbanes-oxley or two certifications you know there's such of things see where the providers line up there may be some of them support exactly what you need right and maybe some don't and that might disqualify them yeah it's because I mean it's a what's the term I'm gonna mess it up but like Louis lowest common denominator is your highest level of security right so like if somebody has you know sock 2 or whatever and then another provider does not that means you don't have it right yeah yeah that's um you don't know where exactly your data may be if it's a true honest-to-goodness distributed set up with good you know reliability and everything so that that's a that's a big big big concern when you're looking at all that stuff it's like make sure they have the certifications that you that you need for whatever your application is doing and then also just from I mean my own nerdy perspective is I want to know exactly what are the hops that are gonna happen between any clouds like I want to know exactly where my traffic is going so and it's for the fact of I want to be able to secure it but I also want to know like why is my throughput spiked in this situation but not in a situation like is it is my traffic on my West one location going to like New Zealand and then back over to New York for the East location I mean what kind of nonsense could be happening you don't know sometimes until you really dig into it so you kind of got to dig in and do some you know some lookups and figure out where your traffic is actually heading you know make sure that you you fix any issues that might be coming up to and into that you know that it's a really great point into that like I almost wonder you know if you think about it especially in our particular case since we are deploying a data center in each one of the cloud providers right people with Cassander today right deploy huge clusters that are spanned over all sorts of regions with DC's all right place right right and I'd be curious I'd be really curious I mean no mind you you'd make an I think you could make an assumption that if I'm talking a single provider then hopefully with the example that Adrian just gave a second ago that wouldn't be a case if I'm going from us East us West or something where it's jumping over to New Zealand or something right I wonder how many what is the latency that different is the latency really that different if I actually have let's take that case if I let's say I had a cluster one provider and I have regions and I'm gonna say in this case two disease and one datacenter over in the East and one day to center over the West what does that latency look like how many times were there right and that kind of deal how different is that really yeah then if I'm on a WS GCP and as you but I'm all in the same general area or same thing if I am is it that is it that much different right right so I like a great experiment to go along with our research yeah I think that's that's really something interesting to consider I'm always curious about the geographically oriented solutions for stuff too because I know like between I believe it's a belay yes and as you both have a data center in Frankfort so that's the same city so like if I had to you know multi-cloud options there and I needed to you know implement something across that I would want to make sure that you know why am I not using City fibre to connect those two points I know it's there that's what I want I want the the most awesome if abilities I can get so you know I would I would want to look into that and see how I could connect the providers in that geographic location just like way out on the northwest there's the dowels base centers which AWS has when Azure as one Facebook has one you know that there's a whole bunch I'm down there because of the hydropower resources that make it very efficient and all of it is sitting on fiber so you know if you're going multi-cloud figure that out and see how you can actually connect those providers you there's usually some very very powerful options there I just read an article actually just this morning and it said essentially exactly what aide in this is saying which is when you're thinking about multi-cloud it was saying talking about some considerations that you need to make and it said always know what your everything is doing which I mean there's a little bit you know it's a little high level a little tongue-in-cheek but it's exactly what you're saying and right you have to really research it and really follow how this is going through and right if if there's fiber there but is it actually going to the fiber and if if it's not you know right if it's not then you need to know that you can't just make assumptions just based on what we you know I think this is that you gotta test it out you got to try it you got to see you got to time it right yeah yes that goes back to other conversations we routinely have to which is test test test test test and then test some more and so another another thing that it's come to mind here with the deployment I'm actually totally switching tears yeah anyway sorry yeah totally switching gears though unless there's something else on the on this on this particular part of it I know you're you're increasing the suspense here so now I'm very curious you like this oh no now do I have to say some wipe or phone Yeah right do I have to like have you gone off on what's switch do change tracks on here that's funny well you know I was just thinking about things from a standpoint of looking at the deployment of things and I'm going back to like the the killer video standpoint and some of the some of the other things that we had to take into consideration and I was actually surprised from once we got the SSL part taken care of and we started talking to the cluster that part was actually like that wasn't that hard right but I was actually surprised I guess we should say for our applicants our application yeah yeah yeah yeah and again that's a good point that that's that's very true we already had the framework in place to make that part easy right right that's thank you for saying ya know very true very true no it just goes back to the the cluster standpoint of it and the operations of that one of the things that that I thought was really neat I mentioned this earlier about when we actually deployed the cluster initially and we could provision it with LCM right that this to me is just cool is that with with OP Center I can I can look at my cluster regardless of the cloud provider and where those DC's are in a totally homogeneous way so the the nose if you were to look at what's going on if you were to look at the DC's I have you would not other than the labels right the IPS that they have and stuff like that I know that they were deployed in different clouds unless you're really looking to find it yeah I mean exactly unless you're really looking to go for that so from that sample from the operation standpoint that was something I thought that was really neat I'm like because I when I first when I first saw when I first all went up and everything like that like that's totally cool because like I I am now it almost seems I feel like I'm I feel like I'm gonna oversell myself on this but I get really in fatik about these things it it almost seemed like I was like that's it it was like so easy or so obvious that I almost forgot that I had this cluster deployed on three different cloud providers really brings up something yes this is the best practice there should be a best practice make sure you label and identify where these things at you so that way when those notes go down if they hopefully they won't but if they do you can pinpoint to that to what's going on with different cloud providers and it's a quick and easier fix than just not knowing anything yeah yeah so anyway so that part of it was just really neat because from the operations standpoint when using the tools provided it didn't look any different seamless yes yeah so that part was neat it was the same thing now this actually gets into a whole nother Avenue because we really haven't talked about why would someone do this why would you really do this right we haven't really talked about those use cases now in our particular case right we are essentially allowing the application to connect to any one of the nodes right that is distributed over these multiple DC's but oh and all reality would I really do that right what I really do that and in a matter of fact I mean one of the things we've talked about is to make this even more real like right now okay I got a single web app right single web app in and some provider somewhere it doesn't matter and then that's going to connect to this cluster and well okay if I want to make this truly seamless right do I need to maybe put a global load balancer in between the app and the actual cluster if I want to do this if there's a reason if I have a use case to actually have multiple cloud providers all providing essentially the same data right my replication factor is such I'm just replicating it across all my DC's so if there was some reason that I wanted to do that I need to ensure my web app can get to any one of those because if one of my providers let's just go any extreme yeah right yeah BAM I know I'm not trying to pick on any provider there you go thank you thank you that was the way to do it yeah provider a just goes down right right that could be I mean if you want to go for like this ultra resiliency thing but we could argue whether or not that that makes sense but at some point my application there needs to be something there that it that it can correctly route to where it needs to go because if I just connect it directly to one of those and it doesn't have any way to route to the other ones it goes you know right away goes away then the app is not gonna database right you're you're in a similar boat right yeah I mean it's better because you have now the replication across but you're gonna have to write you have downtime yes yeah exactly which is the whole point right you don't know yeah I don't want that right you know so so I'll go ahead why this is a prime example and some people may remember this but it was quite comical the let's just say provider a doesn't renew their SSL certification so then you can't get into it so if you have the load balancer there then you can't get to the other ones so you have to be cognizant of where you're gonna put your load balancers and your load balancers also need their respective redundancy and the name servers also need their respective redundancy it's just like an incident about a year ago um you know if you have just your list of primary name servers and then that name server is unreachable for whatever reason and you don't have the appropriate failover then the name server system doesn't work for you and your stuff can't communicate on the internet so have your redundant name servers have your respective load balancers that can failover or act both at the same time and then you know serve as they're available so when one goes down the other one continues to work but the redundancy has to be matched by respective redundancy yeah and then I mean so one of the things that we're from from our application standpoint right now going back to the whole use case thing one of the things we're kind of exploring with all this are what are those particular use cases okay now I'm thinking back to something that I've done at previous companies right that would not apply to this this particular need with killer video but let's say for example you have clients or you have some type of existence in Canada you know and maybe there are laws that prevent the Canadian data from being in US servers or something like that right but but let's say provider a does not provide you know let's say not you know like but the writer B does right that might be a reason why you need to do that now someone could argue but wait a minute you just talked about replicating your data across all of these but if you need to cordon off this data here then why would you do it yeah so so really what it comes down to is again for what we were doing and what we're exploring that makes sense from that standpoint but there are all sorts of other use cases that come into play right so in that case you might actually have another cluster on a different provider or something like that you know you might have data and in different places and in the cool thing though is then from the multi cloud standpoint you can support that right and it's it's actually pretty easy to be flexible and move from one to the other and as Adrienne kind of you know he's he was alluding to as well I mean we've seen it the news like we have seen cases where all of a sudden a particular provider is getting into the space of one of their clients and that client doesn't want anything to do with it they're like nope and you know they need they need to be able to move I mean I came from a previous organization now mind you this was moving from on-prem into the cloud but like my experience especially when you have an entrenched application with years of data and you know depending on how big it is and such it doesn't it doesn't take a week to move this stuff right like I mean in you know maybe this stuff takes months or years now from the technology standpoint right when you were talking Cassandra we know from a replication standpoint that stuff can be managed but I'm not talking from the from the text and time I'm talking politically from bureaucracy from all of the things that have to happen to get people in line to move that kind of stuff that stuff takes time right the other apps that rely on those that may have to make changes that right absolutely beyond the bureaucracy to of just the company there's the bureaucracy of the the laws that one has to meet such as gdpr is one that's probably familiar and everyone in mind right now but uh like IP you can't track that stuff in analytics data like web analytics data in Europe because it's considered in the u.s. though you can track people in all sorts of weird creepy ways but in and then there's the like if you if you do in some way find a reason and you get a permission from the user etcetera etcetera and you have that information it still has to be geographically located in that that country or whatever and then just like the the Patriot Act introduces some interesting complexities to because if we have data in a distributed system that's multi-cloud let's say an EU and the US what access Germany has versus the u.s. to that data in regulations can completely be very troublesome at very high levels so some additional thoughts on well where are we putting our data you know if we go multi-cloud where do those data centers exist what implications does that have for our data in our database like what happens if you know you know Romania decides that they don't want to have their data anywhere else in the world they go in and they take the servers out of the data center right yeah like all of a sudden so does that mean one of your part of your data center just disappeared from the overall cluster so there's a lot of interesting aspects to be concerned about outside of just you know technologically like you were saying and all those those types of things do I yeah yeah it really does I did also notice too that there are certain things going on I got a look into the law or whatever it was exactly with stuff's being stored in Canada versus the US I think it has to do with some of the same things Gidi part PR type of privacy stuff or whatever but uh one of the big providers I'll say provider a just released new data center access and the ability to like subnet out and break out stuff within their Canadian offerings so like there's there's a big push to really make sure that access and data centers are located in all the places that you need them when you go multi-cloud so yeah and one thing I was I wanted to add into that was as I mentioned a moment ago like this is what everything the agents talking about right now right these are things that regardless if you're talking Cassandra database if you're talking Oracle if you're doing my sequel if you're talking any not just the database port from application these things have to be handled right for anybody who has the need to be in these different geographic relations right right now the thing from the cassandra standpoint because I'm totally biased when it comes to Cassandra obviously but from the Cassandra standpoint I think one of the things that is really powerful and awesome right is at least from the database standpoint the the ability to replicate data out into you know other data centers within my cluster that or or even create other clusters but the ability the inherent ability to do that is a huge difference because I mean I'm thinking about cases in the past where you know using not using Cassandra right we're trying to replicate all of the stuff into other regions on other clouds it's very daunting I'm not saying that it's all perfect and shiny have shadows but it's much much much easier this is all by design that exactly yeah this was this was crate juice and R was created with all of these things are already considered it was really ahead of its time and now and now Herod the time is here the time is now the time is come yeah it's just there we talked about I I think it's very interesting how our conversation has kind of gone we kind of talked about the easy in the beginning right the deploying of the instances well that's it you know it has its own challenges don't get me wrong but we talked about deploying the instances on the different providers that's more or less pretty easy one you kind of get the hang of it you're good to go deploying DSE it sounds ridiculously easy seamless that part was easy easy parts but then after that it's a whole new world it's exactly exactly so I think yeah and our conversation kind of went to the more difficult things that aren't necessarily tech straight tech related but there's a lot of challenges and a lot of things that need to be thought through for a larger sense and then the smaller sense you know just you there with your code your application you got to really think about all these little things so I really like how we kind of went easy too difficult yeah and you know if you go I'm not suggesting to do it this way but you know as we were getting built up and we started with a rudimentary system you know once you once you solve some of the stuff you know figuring out how you're gonna provision your various instances and that can ideal when it came to deploying the node with a single seed certification and and hooking up SSL and making that work so taking what we had all right looking real reference Apple I can't work like that that part that part really wasn't all that hard now that again is room entering we've talked about that right yeah it's basic security it's basic stuff but it's cool because you can you can literally and we've done it many times I mean we just as we're testing this thing we deploy a whole new cluster to those three providers once you have the basic stuff in place in like 10 minutes you know so that's yeah there's parts in there that that are really nice but you need that initial set up everyone slow though I do like to talk to some of the members of the community that have been around and remember acquisition attainment of hardware installation of hardware and placing off this out there because its own interest here those of what minutes that used to take months maybe years yeah and then we talked about the bureaucracy we have now even even that is easy that's a really great yeah I think this is a really exciting time it's a really exciting for this team and I think it's just a really exciting time for all all lovers of technology it's a really cool time yeah great yeah exciting yeah well I think that takes us uh that gets us wrapped up so thank you for joining us we enjoyed talking about this together and we hope to continue the conversation so comment and let's keep talking about it thank you bye bye thank you
