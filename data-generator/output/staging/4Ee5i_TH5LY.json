building large-scale distributed systems welcome everyone to the distributed data show today we're gonna wrap up 2017 in the studio today with me jeff carpenter hello and remotely we have David Gilardi Oh with the ugliest sweater I've ever seen what is going on with that can you please justify yourself oh snap good okay I feel a little underdressed yeah for those of you on the podcast you be thankful hey it's this green sweater with two gingerbread men on it oh don't explain it if you have to explain it don't don't do that yeah that I think that's the problem is if I look at it I'm like this is a violent sweater which I'm actually kind of cool with and I hate that about myself okay so about 27 yeah that's Maddie so we're gonna do a wrap-up on 2017 topics trends and of just like any other year and I t it's been full of changes I mean come on let's this the tech industry is all about Delta's right how much Delta we can reuse so why don't you kick us off Jeff tell us all about what you think was a big trend this way we had big trends of the year got to do my hot takes I've been saving him up so he gets a little face this was the year of containers kind of making that jump to everyone is jumping on the Container bandwagon now like I feel like 2015 2016 everyone was kind of playing around with it dabbling this year it became more and more real so not just you know people running docker on their desktops and playing around but actual production systems using container technology but also orchestration so guys I think kubernetes may have won yeah I think so too I mean yeah it could be having now Amazo supports kubernetes kubernetes in every single cloud EK and first class citizen in Azure yeah Google totally kubernetes yeah so I might be the technology laggard here I still have a little bit of hesitation about going all-in on allowing an orchestration framework to auto scale my cluster specifically if we're talking about Apache Cassandra or data sacks Enterprise you know managing my data tier I'm okay I've always been okay with auto scaling of the service tier because you know we're designing stateful micros stateless oops stateless micro services okay yeah and allowing them to be scaled automatically but I've always had a little bit of hesitation about scaling the data tier automatically so verdict is still out maybe 2018 will give us some more clarity on that one what do you think I like how you artfully avoided commentary on you know auto scaling the the data tier I will I will give well played so on the topic man on that topic I will tell you do never ever auto scale your data tier and I can't think of a good reason to because that right that's just too heavy of a thing to let just arbitrarily happen and as you'll see pretty soon some cloud providers do that for you and it's not okay and it just it doesn't fit into that world very well I think you're right application to your auto scale all the way with buckets you know you put boundaries around if you do that on your data tier it's just a lot it's too much to try to just let have an auto magic at this point at least in 2018 2017 right nice okay well do you have some opinions to share with us David what was big this year oh well I mean there are multiple items but I think the one that is most in my mind these days would be BRAF databases but not not just graph databases cuz grath database has been around for for some time but in particular distributed graph databases and just like picked up a ton esteem you know especially in the cases of my recommendation engines and fraud detection and that committee uh it just they're there they're taking off right and it's becoming more and more interesting I've been seeing a lot of talks on various pieces of some of these new graphic capabilities at a lot of conferences and everything like that so it's uh yeah that's definitely one that's on online for me so what why was this the year cuz like you said they've been around for a while people have been using graph databases forever well not forever but for a long time like why 2017 well let's see to me I think part of it is the distributed nature right I think now we've had some technology fit with a merge that I have now essentially given us the capability to take a graph database off of like a single instance and you know strip that amongst multiple instances and just essentially upping the capability right how much we can process and that kind of deal so I think from that alone it's actually enabled us to be able to answer some more difficult questions and there's another part of the to I think some of the technology vendors out there have now made this stuff available very easily available right for developers and for me to just get into so I think it's kind of a combination of these things and now the fact that you know some of the capabilities some of the things you can do with graph databases are just you know far superior than the same way you try to accomplishes things with relational databases well I you know I think part of it is also gremlin is now the winning way to work with frança I wasn't gonna use that all right yeah lingua franca it makes me sound so cosmopolitan but the that is the language we work with graph because it works in a distributed nature really well yeah if you look at all the graph implementations that have been released in the past year from the cloud vendors everyone's saying oh we and we support gremlin and that just nails it right there is it's okay we've started to land on something it's like SQL once every database vendor in the world started using SQL then and that became the standard then then it just relational databases blew out because you know and we didn't have to relearn everything every time we touch the database oh interesting okay so that's a real enabler that's that's Patrick's why mm-hmm it blew up in 2017 that makes sense okay we I feel like we tease a little bit some thoughts coming from you Patrick so why don't you just go ahead and lay it on us what do you got what's my tag or the trend in 2017 this year has definitely been a hallmark for the cloud all the cloud providers settling into their database story and how we want to how they say we should use their database story it's like hey developers you want a database you come to us you don't go anywhere else this is kind of it's getting into this kind of mafioso thing you don't need another database just come to us but every every large cloud vendor Google Asher Amazon they all have what they think is the is the end-all be-all for database and you need nothing else the problem as I see it is that they're always going to be trade-offs with those and so I talked to we you know you and I were just to reinvent right and talking to folks they're like I don't like the trade-offs or one of the things that I think is also becoming a really big trend is the multi cloud story absolutely yeah yeah we talked to a lot of folks that were like yeah we're kind of hedging our bet we're a little bit nazzer a little bit in Amazon or Google and it's just these mix and matching it's it's really the I think gonna be that that's going to be the next year's transfer sure when you do the trends but it's already starting to happen now so when you do that okay so when you say I'm gonna be multi cloud that keeps you from being locked into a single database in that cloud so for instance you cannot run dynamodb and Azure I know I didn't know if you knew that I haven't tried yeah you can't do that that doesn't exist in cosmos TV never will rent in Google I don't care how much kubernetes you throw at it okay right okay so that's the then that that's the question then is our people also using a little bit of I don't even know how that would work are they using data stores when they're doing multi cloud are they using the data solutions that are being offered by those different cloud vendors or are they just using something else like I don't know well in the it's easy to get lured into that yeah and that's the trend it's like oh it's easy just to click a button and I have a database right and then you drop into it without even thinking and then before you know it you just racked up a huge high interest debt credit card you know the tech debt credit card is there and you're paying on it every month because anytime you want to you're like if you're in a situation a really large retailer for instance I won't mention names but they're pretty much like we will never be in Amazon because they they are our competitor they made their entire team move all of their stuff from AWS into Google because and then there's others where they move everything into Azure because now we're in this you're dealing with all these competitive things that developers I don't care but no the boss says you have to care now so then you you have to pay down that debt once you go in there it's really this is where it's getting really tricky and this happened this year I think this is really the big year where it happened now I honestly I'm totally brings have you're just kind of set it all there I know I know from my personal standpoint right working with many cloud vendors over the years I know looking at the multi cloud thing I think it makes a lot of sense honestly because I've seen time and time again where individual businesses will essentially get locked into a particular vendor right and if in the past it's been difficult sometimes to ensure that whatever solution you have is distributed amongst multiple vendors so you really don't get that and what happens you know if something catastrophic happens to particular one you need to flip over to another one you don't like the pricing model something like that um so I think it just kind of fits that we're finally now getting into the cloud world I'm just happy to see you honestly do you have any takes on this you were at Amazon to you you get to hear from a lot of users developers right yeah one of the things that was interesting about the conversations that we were hearing and people having sort of these vaguely worded concerns or or I don't know how to not fully articulated concerns about lock-in and what is this concept of lock-in and you always want to when you hear people start talking like that you want to push a little bit deeper and say what is it that you're afraid of locking into because I've heard fears in the past from you know some of our customers or potential customers of data stacks like oh I don't know if I want to lock in to your platform and we're also hearing about well I don't know if I want to lock into one of these cloud vendors in terms of using their data storage here my feeling is you know you have to commit to something well in a man data is where this is like the earlier prediction or the earlier trend kubernetes and containers are yet another trend that that proves the point which is if I'm an containers and I'm using kubernetes then I have a portable solution at this point I can run that in any cloud and I see that as is that's the subtext here is that if I have built an application stack that I've deployed on a per-unit my personal laptop or in a cloud provider or on Prem and it's running in containers all you know the full stack is in containers and kubernetes is doing the orchestration then I've just avoided a locking strategy there for sure now I'm not I'm not having to rebuild everything for an azure instance versus an easy-to instance it's now it's just a container right and I could take it around with me well so that I mean to that's that I think that's kind of my point here is that though you're always dealing with lock-in you you know you're you're writing a service you choose a programming language well that's a form of lock-in right so you're making some commitment to something at some point and what you know we've always advised or at least good architects have advised you know to developers and and to teams is to you use appropriate abstraction I don't mean get out of control with abstraction layers but do things to protect yourself so you know the containerization technology that's a perfect example now I have that portability and I've done something to abstract myself from underlying hardware and I've protected myself so make those kind of choices where you have an appropriate level of isolation from your technology choices and you'll be fine then you can commit to something something yeah and the data layers is the critical part and the the funny part to me is that no one has ever come out with a database that has the same semantics as Cassandra it just does multi-master an active-active like no other database like no one else has done that and so what about some of these features that we here are our cloud friends providing like global tables and AWS and these sorts of things all of it has fine print and you know that it's just good enough you know so the Global tables is a copy-on-write there's no consistency guarantees and if you ran multi-master on that you're gonna fail miserably there is no there's no other way around it I guarantee you no one in Amazon don't know that solution architects are gonna advocate an active-active situation with that feature it just is it doesn't work and you'll fail most of the even spanner has a lot of fine print that you will fail at it there's no free lunch and as we used to hear from three high all the time there is no matter it's no magic there is no magic and they they're gonna try to sell you on the hype and it always goes down to the computer science always and Cassandra was built originally to replicate it that's that was its core is replication and then data model on top of that replication scheme that's what you want to use that technology nice well I mean I like that as a final word yeah but I mean it still plays out I mean you you see what they what they all say is well you know Cassandra you know they'll say that word because they know that that's is that that's a that's a real competitor to any cloud database because it's the only database that will let you run in another cloud that's kind of cool that's cool freedom yeah right on remember they played that ok well I think that's plenty I've labeled myself plenty at this point so I think this will wrap up our wrap-up of the wrap-up are you wrapped up all wrapped up for 2017 out right all right thanks guys we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for
