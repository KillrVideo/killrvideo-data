[Music] but everybody welcome to the newest of the c-sharp hours maybe getting some coding going on here I was just practicing my Quinny pig face expression I don't know if you know who Quinny Pig is but we should definitely talk about that for a second because I have a few things to talk about before we actually get into the code today they're important things so let's get into that the first thing is Quinny pig himself so I just want to share this with everybody because Quinny pig is just so on point and Quinny Pig is of course Corey Quinn now he is a cloud economist I'm not entirely sure what that means but I bet you he would tell you over at duckbill group he he's just super entertaining and knows his stuff and is always going on you know he's always at like the AWS events and things like that so if you're into cloud tech and you want to kind of get the lowdown on what's being announced and things like that follow Quinny Pig he's he's just yeah he's he's a great character I have unfortunately not met him in real life in person hopefully that'll change one day and I hope to actually interview him sometime and and talk to him in pick his brain about where he gets all the insights and and great quips that he always has about things so that's the first bit of things going on and I do actually follow him I'm just not logged in at the moment as you can see the second thing I want to talk about is if you're in the Seattle area I am now doing a live stream interview show that I'm gonna add to my my personal thrashing code twitch segments about coding and programming and infrastructure and especially about like databases multi-model databases like data stacks Enterprise Apache Cassandra and things like that it's going to be great so if you're in the Seattle area if you're ever visit or you live here even even easier right if you live here come and join me and let's talk text sometimes just check out this this blog entry here I have all the links right down here at the bottom that you need to get a timeslot and we will get chit-chatting about technology so the main topic of this stream though the session is of course coding c-sharp today we're gonna work some more on the casma cassie schema migrator this is the schema migration tool that I have been building to do schema migrations a multi model schema migrations eventually not not entirely all there yet against Apache Cassandra data stacks Enterprise and data stacks distribution of Apache Cassandra so all of those things with that said let's get into where we were last session you can check out on YouTube or twitch check out the last sessions and stuff hello Lilly welcome to the other two it's channel and let's see we we are here in JetBrains writer about to write some c-sharp always fun I love c-sharp I bet I love Java too maybe writing some of that but I don't know maybe maybe not I'm not allowed to say that anyway this is about c-sharp we're gonna be writing some c-sharp and where are we let's let's just run all the tests and see where we are because that's usually the the best thing to do when I've been following a sort of test-driven development approach all right what just what just happened looks like we we built and we basically got nothing so it's your all tests yeah run run all tests not just the one there we go okay some um pass execute up migration is running and it broke probably what it was supposed to do alright there's nyan cat getting it done verified destination database key spaces and execute up migration interesting by the way Lily as you probably noticed I saw that you got the view vixen cards for others I still have a few sets left but not giving them out just yet they're so cool and I hope gin looper will decide to create a set number two I know a lot of distributed database people and other other women that would make a great group to make a version 2 set of so fun so fun alright so failure and failure I love it first act trees I think let's go directly to this I think Oh an invalid IP was specified that's I recall what I was doing now I'm starting to recall that docker was involved and that always makes tests fun when you're trying to spin up an entire environment and to Mitch to do the integration test yeah no not that mmm here we go so just for some quick context I created this library called docker for tests and I added this class called docker cruft and added various functionality to it to spin up get IPS of and shut down and remove container instances so and this is this is working I have a little harness here docker examples which starts it up and shuts it down so I know that works but we're having a few issues here getting the core Lib to use it via the core Lib tests so let's see we're in this and then maybe if we just let's do a debug and we should get to this breakpoint that'll help refresh where we are with some of these things when I probably need to get a sitrep of what what docker containers are actually doing here yeah so docker error response here it's a conflict so let's let's get in there and see what docker containers I have dock not D Coker docker PS okay so there's one running tests up migration pick this up a little bit what we got up for three minutes and test oops there we go and test keyspace all right that should help us out there there we go okay so we got to assert we have IP 1 7 2 . 17.0 to verify connection should come back as true because it's it should be at that IP we can check real quick docker PS there is the container it is running and if we do docker inspect oops test key space 1 7 to 17 0.217 2.17 dot 0.2 it's the address so if we go ahead and run through that ah there is a no viable alternative at input if not exists oh let me let me check that because what I'm doing at verify is an actual query right so they're not query but I'm trying to create a key space to verify that the database basically I want to verify that the database is on executable against so it can create a key space or not and that the execution permissions include create key space that's pretty important for a development database you need to be able to create the key space in addition to whatever tables or other parameters and criteria that you need for your development so alright this it doesn't like this let's just run this query by itself real quick of course that one is not there let's see here dr. PS docker okay so the key space there so 1/7 2.2 added data stores pachi Cassandra 1/7 2.17 dot 0 dot to check the connection should be good there it is oh oh I think I see what I've failed to do is equal this JSON bit right here this is where we would add multiple replication values to this so we just need to add to equal to the code here and that theoretically should work so let's go ahead and shut this one down docker stop stop o test key space docker remove test all right let's go back to that test and let's just let's just run it we're just gonna straight run the test because seriously actually what else do I have in there I might be breaking it I might be asking for it to break again build execute return true return false return false so this is based on an error not occurring there could almost be another effort here well we'll talk about that in a minute right now it's failed again so let's let's debug yep and it got left there so test key space doctor remove test key space there we go all right so I'm gonna run it again and see what we run into here seven - that's correct this is looking good so far socket exception that means at least not in this context oh goodness did we just get so it should still be up right docker PS it's still up so let's test out that let's add attach to that key space so we'll go into the IP one seven - its dot 17.0 - and then the key space is wits I think it's what I had named it um I don't know that's gonna be not correct I guess we'll just we'll go in and look remove that move Oh casma verification is what we're looking for Cassandra at key space is this this is one set of two dots 17.0 that to test connection oh oh no there's no L and an IP Hey look at that we've got it it is there casma verification all right so it made some serious progress here and get out of that and then go back over to the test and then we just need to remove the docker container which is last step should do um sear debug run hit processing tusky space and then stock container remove test key space processing I don't know why my console is all crazy like that let's go look at my other little library and fix this real quick but it looks like success so we've fixed that test and it it now has a green light so that's good next is to do a migration have it actually executed migration there's a few things that I want to get to first though so let's see here so with that I almost need to run a query to test that this is there and put like a table in there or something they will do command yeah I want to be able to put a table in there and a piece of data and then verify that the piece of data is there so that we we prove out there they have all the permissions and then we can roll it back wipe it out maybe even actually will make casma verification we'll change that name to since we need it we're gonna need a table anyway so let's call it yeah if not exists casma let's just call it history actually that sounds like a good descriptive name hello custom n' working on some c-sharp put together this schema migration tool just got it to work creating a key space and a test to verify that the key space well basically that an error isn't thrown when the key space is created and I am doing most excellent I hope you yourself are doing most excellent also alright and we're gonna have to start writing some migrations in this actual goo here which should be fun alright so core test excu and are only yep that's it so we're gonna do it up migration first then we'll do yeah of course do it up migration that will do a diol migration alright let's get back into destination database well actually we're gonna take this and put it in a function and the reason is um extract method you have extract method casma inception we'll do it this way appropriate casing haha there we go okay so casma inception runs under verify so it's basically doing the inception and then under the constructor ah there we go so construct IP address struck there we go IP address here we want to run nuke asthma inception also there we go and the reason is is because we want that table to be there period right so maybe we should put in a database address yeah so we put it in there so casma inceptions let's actually take this alright construct oh actually let's do let's do this we're gonna do this and then we're gonna put this in casma inception and this is actually going to be our address here IP address there we go database address here we're gonna do yeah so it sets it there and here we'll just need to do our address equals like so yeah yes won't go with IP that'll work all right so now what we have is we can call it pass in a string of the IP address or the actual like an object C sharp object of the IP address that'll pass it into casma inception and ensure that our key space is available once we've created its object the specific key space of course casma vert history so that we can put the history of the schema migration in there to know where to roll up to and roll back from perversions and such so let's see here we got destination destination IP address address I've been down here we need to take this out and we need to actually do address well now it can be database address because it's set right there so that would work and the inferred logic is in place accordingly yeah so let's run those tests or this test again just make sure it works all right what happened now so we broke something let's figure out what we broke we'll probably need to do figure out what the doctor is Tucker stop where's my debug point well there it is all right let's do that we'll run should get the session okay cluster is built seven to time that with a thousand milliseconds does that mean this doesn't it's there that doesn't need to be there let me stop there we go and we're gonna run that again all right let's hear come on but pipette error response from Damon conflict painter oh shoot there we go killed it fixed it yeah okay so back to the test run the test again there we go let's let's get through that connection refused okay try this again it's not here right yeah so we just have these bits all right let's go to this and look at the code again just to make sure we're not like trying to do something insane right okay so calling the casma which we've constructed this correctly right yeah new there's addresses passed in so the object is created and based on it being created it should have already actually verified this Oh what we could do we could just verify that the key space is there I'm thinking maybe what we do is we make this run for just the inception but for verify we have a different one and we add a table creation to this yeah what'd you think I think that at work I think that's a good idea seems like it would work so what did that do they said destination dB scope ID error every different day what get scope ID system so like there's an address his family oh let's I see what it's fuss about okay so then docker so all that stuff is Creed there's key space destination DB should I guess that is the only property right hmmm I feel like the constructor should do more and then for the verify we can just verify that the history is there or that the history table is there in place I think that's I think that's the key to this I think that's what we want to do yeah definitely not getting a migration done today but we'll get that done let's do that because that'll be important for the migrations that we do all right let's go to here we had dr. PS you get it that no well let's actually look at it and that key space is not their server seems to be there all that's in place all right so we've to see if that's there now no still not there okay so the doctor address are you gonna go ahead and run that and then move this sorted in a second yet fitting them with something real quick ago I had to fix up that screen so that the stuff is over there right all right roof removed container really did it did it remove the container it did okay okay so the test is literally just not passing but the other stuff it's not like breaking so bad that it can't finish Oh what it said it passed so let's run it again let's see what happens yeah I was gonna say I don't think it's yeah it's not it is not running the thing correctly to declaration so we're gonna go right here but it's saying says there's already in name-o cuz I'm trying to double because I'm trying to double create it I shouldn't be trying to double create it though yeah no no that's not it it's so I'm trying to do the verification which is should be only the second time this runs and it should already have the key space oh yeah this is a of course this is not gonna work because I renamed that how phooey all right there we go 172 dot 17.0 tattoo in the key space casma history yeah there we go okay so let's so that is that is working verifies not but we're changing verify so let's let's just roll with it we've got inception work in a system history history system so we call it casma history and this key space should be autonomous of the other ones so it can be casma history then with you casma or the tables let's just call it history yes and then we'll add this we'll call it stamp hey do sock are you just making progress with the with the thing here whoa what did I do oh okay stamp actually there's a time stamp one that's what we want yeah time stamp we call that Stamper for now so we can delete Stamper stamped there we go so we got a time stamp and then what else do we need we're gonna need version or maybe call it step I'll call it step I'm gonna make this text then our detail let's call it details right details their success oops boolean there we go step should be unique I'm trying to think if we should write something else for schema migration what do you think dis suck ever written something of such goofiness we'll go with step is the key so history primary key I had a column no don't add a column that's not what I wanted to do it's not what I wanted to do at all yes table key there we go sure history what did I call it step yes a primary key to your that get rid of that I don't even know if I need to really make it a well that didn't work out boolean there we go there's the create table it's go ahead and execute that and there we go so there's history so want to do this hey there we go okay so verified we're gonna take this out of there this doesn't even need that anymore just gonna do a void right right yes I wonder if I can do this equals new and then just pass in the IP and then we yeah there we go that's what I was wanting to do earlier so that gets all that started and we can verify connection this false bold false why is it fussing oh yeah yeah yeah okay you don't like that oh no I'm gonna avoid that's right there we go yeah much much better go beans okay now let's get the oh maybe this is not how it's done oh how do you do that Cassandra is fun how do you create a this your recursive c-sharp constructor that's what I'm trying to do you're c-sharp constructor falls overloaded constructor yeah immediately after sing all right right right right right but right so you got ad in float ad string in all right so this is chaining it but then well maybe I can do it this way alright class object object there's one without it I don't like it without it it's just that so then so can I do this oh forget it okay wasting time I'm gonna actually get rid of that one yeah whatever if you have an IP you can just use the IP and it's gonna give you this string anyway so not a big deal kind of just silliness return false okay for the moment all right so if i refresh this all that should be there yep okay so then let's let the test finish stopping test key space all right so that should be gone and it looks like it is yep no nothing there that's what we want so if I did this and then refresh it'll give me we know it's not there yeah okay don't give me that that's what I expected thank you okay is this so this should fail now and yes failed okay as expected now we're gonna go get a verification so we have history oh yeah and let's let's split this up how can I make that well for the moment I'm just gonna go ahead and do you know we're just gonna I know what's double clear you get a console oh that's right it's not creative so let's test we're going to run to here and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually create an insert and just check it real quick I don't want to view the query I want the query we've broken something alright stop running again it's gone okay all right come on do it right this time right in container something blew up all right what was what was all that then check that the IP is correct yes it's correct it did not create this though maybe you can't do two commands in line let's do that what is it tripping about there alright I'm gonna do this comment it back in here and let's do create table history yeah yeah yeah create my right this is not this is you're just there you go weird maybe that's messing it up okay let's do that then so history then stand timestamp step text primary key details text and then success and let's let's put them together let's do command equals command plus man table what oh yeah yeah I can do plus equal I'm used to doing my go and stuff does this fuss about now to assignment all right let's get to here and go back run that test yeah classic tuned with extra chasm [Music] I'll put this what oh yeah that's right okay all right let's see if it'll slice right we have a break there yeah okay wait to complete tasks still looks like a bunch of I don't know it's Cassie anyway run to the next bit and it blew up she at least fail the test what what how did I why am i why am I even in here oh that's for that other thing I'm freaking me out here we're not looking at that right now alright debug all right let's thank you where am I okay clear dr. PS doctor stop test keyspace remove test key space data okay so I did that but let's see what this one does I just want to see if it if it errors out because really it should narrow out and we should be able to get to this next line here yeah okay so that's let's do this [Music] okay so it got there all this stuff should exist if if it created it with that IP let's go see what we got here docker PS dock Oh heywhat verify connection because there isn't a database created in that one so the course that passes let's do one where there is a database so that one's true too but let's do this we're right into a tank trap my chair alright so we want to create this then get the docker address it's that ok then we'll remove it at the end and this will get rid of another wait that's basically what I'm doing damn it yeah verify connection so this is correct but verify connection should still be false even with the database there and this is that true so this should this should still pass [Music] failing destination I guess this is still what we're working with them debug I was trying to think of like a smaller piece of stuff to test with instead of trying to test the whole process where it instantiates and runs the thing [Music] build failed [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah okay it was just on crack about that right I mean the build should not be failing how great hey no content thanks for the follow welcome to the data stacks is Apache Cassandra and DSC Dave snacks Enterprise c-sharp our here almost every Wednesday at 2 p.m. to write some c-sharp code for various range of things related to large-scale distributed databases and c-sharp usage of those and right now I'm debugging an integration test is it still debugging what should just it should just restart though well let's let's go to here we'll get that far okay I'm think I'm gonna ignore that one what's this doing over here Oh missing AOF all right we're going back to just the key space just the key space worked I'll leave that variable there though just for when we added in a minute oops leave it in it there for just a minute okay database address and actually let's do this let's do yeah I want to refactor extract method run it's this a read only create sequel scripts that's what call it yeah and then I'm gonna take command we're gonna steal that do this and put command in here there we go well actually let's do let's do this it's kind of the point anyway and then we'll do run create scripts run create scripts I could do this too static void right it's an I could just call it by itself oh no I need the database address and then this one it's this stuff there we go I do not know what's going on with strings c-sharp these days okay let's see if we get to that I would would you say hold on a second he has changed nothing and run again it happened so much so often all right keep your fingers crossed we can get at least this one done and running before the end of this one let's hear that build is flipping out so stop building over there then we go back to unit tests and we have all we're over time we're gonna keep going a little bit try to get this sucker to run so this should run and then stop in here actually we'll just stop it on the first one okay I mean I remember remove that one again that seems to be okay connection if I got Chuck docker all right it's there yeah there's test key space docker inspect test key space one step to 1702 so let's just add a new connection that I guess so we'll do one seven two dot 17.2 and then hopefully what is it casma history right No so the create didn't run oh yeah I definitely air it out to check the IP is connection reset socket exception why is my alright what is the deal with sit this bit interpolation who's that messing it up why are my lines all over the place get stopped container style and going back to that ever since I did this stuff well no that ain't that ain't really gonna cut it I'm gonna have to fix all the interpolations and I'm gonna do that right now this seemed to at least be working hello I am NOT myself trying to write C sharp man I I just don't know actually the C sharp is going okay I don't know about this connection problem on that because my database not creating accordingly or my key space in my database check sure that the IP o it's getting to that error it checked the IP mmm at docker websocket on streams so I need to watch someone else for a while yeah I hear that I hear that big-time alright well you caught me just in time because I'm actually gonna call it a day on this one and start working on my next bit so let's hear where where we at what did we get done I feel like I mostly spun my wheels on this one why I can't give me my dialogue No okay don't give me the dialogue I'll use the terminal then minor tweaks test still broken out oops what whoa I've done a lot of work since then so did stuff it status get push all right I wonder if I could raid myself no because then my video wouldn't work my admirers this video wouldn't work all right on that note though I hate to do it but I'm gonna call it a day I'm at time for this particular data stacks dev stream I hope you catch me next time on data Stax devs give us a follow and I'll be working more on the c-sharp schema migrator or casma as i call it in the coming days next time on this particular one it'll be next Wednesday at 2 p.m. so like I said hope see then and join me in a few minutes on my thrashing code stream I'll be working on some go and some other stuff in just a few minutes so cheerio everybody [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]",
