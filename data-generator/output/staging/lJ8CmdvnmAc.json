    "text": "from data stats this is the distributed data show podcast hello everyone and thank you for joining us for a new episode of this distributed data show today my guest is Mac buhdeuce from the spring team Thank You Mac for being with us today could you please introduce yourself sure thanks for having me Cedric um I'm mark and I'm working on the spring data team and I'm doing it that's probably the question that requires a bit more of laborat so I'm spring data Project Lead but I'm also leading the RTD PC project which sends for reactive relational database connectivity I'm also maintaining a Redis driver the lettuce driver and because all this is not really exhausting enough I'm also running a spring vault project which integrates with hash record and probably you might find me in other areas as well so I'm doing a lot of stuff because it's it's fun for me to work in the open-source space to help users to get them started to help them with their productivity issues to help develop application development to become even more fun so that you can achieve your job and this is my passion to to work in in that area Wow so I heared a lot of spring project I know spring is a galaxy but with tons of component but can you give us an overview about what is the Spring Framework and what you try to achieve to do with it sure sure so spring is umbrella form a multitude of projects so there is a Spring Framework let's bring down their spring badge spring cloud spring good and all the things spring right and it all started in the early 2000s were Java Enterprise developers had a certain issue with how Java Enterprise was supposed to be used and rod Johnson back then wrote a book about how he thought Java Enterprise should be used and based on that idea the spring framework itself emerged and Spring Framework is an open source library that helps developers with their productivity when they are following Java Enterprise patterns this is integrating with sequel databases integrating with Java messaging services nowadays are building web applications and all these these nitty grits that you use in your application you can use them without spring entirely but you will have to invest a bit more of time into error handling resource handling and all this auxilary things that every developer and every every application heft has to deal with and spring takes all this and encapsulate all this boilerplate things and the only spoiler plate tasks so that you as developer can still use and interact with Java and Java Enterprise apos but without really worrying about that boilerplate and common common stuff see you wouldn't go ahead and write your own connection pool just because you need pooling but rather you would pick a and something that provides a connection pooling and this is basically spring for the Java ecosystem right now spring was built in early 2000s and has grown over time and nowadays we probably do not talk as much on Java Enterprise api's as we did the 15 or 20 years ago now today we talk about Kotlin we talk about reactive programming and all the new patterns that have a more and this is something what spring can help you with and as soon as spring gets in your way you can get basically directly to the core of what you are supposed to do yeah so I can testify I'm a Java developer myself I uncut a spring let's say maybe more than ten years ago and he had the minute you touch spring there is so much nice features around what you want to do that's is really is development and speed up and you know even you know not only the code is very elegant but also the way to unlink a halt and our message are pretty pretty pretty well done so congrats and so in the galaxy you are lead of the spring data path so probably how to interact with all kind of database so what if you're doing so the spring data story started like 10 years ago were we figured JDBC is not the only technology how you would like to interact with database but rather all the no sequel stores suddenly started to pop out with their own ideas and their own persistence approaches and we figured that using a driver is probably ok if you are into the very details of of a particular data store but still you have to deal with all these resource issues so to allocate connections to deal with vendor specific exceptions and then finally you have to map your persistence strategy on to a particular store and so we figured let's see whether we can do something about that and out of that investigation spring data emerged the first module in spring data itself was spring data JPA which build on top of JPA to make it a bit easier to work with JPA and the most significant thing that spring data brings to you is a consistent set of api's and concepts that you can find across the board of every single spring data module and if you have worked with a spring data JPA already then you might be already familiar with the repository pattern repositories are a concept borrowed from domain driven design DDD where you store objects and retrieve object and then repository does exactly that for you you define an entity class or an entity model you define a repository interface and out-of-the-box you get already all your crud methods implemented which are for create read update and delete and in addition to that you can declare theories theorem methods that are either implemented by deriving from what the method name is so if you have a method named like find all by first name then the furia that would be generated is using the name parameter to create a filter on that and we started with JPA and from quickly that this makes a lot of sense and not only for JPA but also for a wider number of stores like Cassandra MongoDB red is Couchbase there's even a module for l-dub if you want to interact with with directory data right so this is what spring data brings in a nutshell because of that there are abstractions to deal with resources with exception translations that you get a consistent set of exceptions and you do not have to distinguish whether this is a monument applicate key exception or whether that's a Cassandra duplicate key exception but rather you get the same type of exception with all the details attached and you can find also a command pattern like the template API across all the modules because that's the ultimate in entry point for how you would unlike to interact with data if you want to issue a string theory or insert data delete or even use store specific functionality like aggregations what with MongoDB so out of the box was print data you get the most convenient person of your data store out of the box by just dropping that library in onto your path and following the spring data programming Wow that's very neat and when you speak about repository it's really just an interface you don't have to provide any implementations bring that that does that for you exactly and and this is this is probably something where folks think well this is magic how can this be and if you work already with spring a bit you will see that spring leverages a lot of JVM features to do its jobs so for instance on Java proxies to provide you with a transaction control transaction management if you provide an interface and say this is a transactional then Spring Framework will create a proxy around that and do the transaction orchestration for you and that's a similar idea that is used in spring data as well so you declare that you have a repository interface and spring data finds that interface and provides a bean implementation for you out of the box without you being required to write all that code for insert update delete and this for every sting a single permutation of data and data store but the nice thing here also is if that's not enough you can provide in custom implementation and expose that through a repository interface and you can customize all those repositories at various levels if that's not sufficient what's behavior provides to yeah very nice and also you know under the hood to initialize the connection and connection pooling there are multiple ways you can go full convention with only properties and keys for settings or you can define your own bins what is a connection and make that injected in the repositories that's very neat um so we discussed about spring data and now we'd like to dig more into spring data Cassandra because there is a new version there 3.0 also what's new what changed and why people should try the new version sure so let me give you brief history of the control module because it wasn't always in that state how it is today spring day the Cassandra was contributed initially here by two folks I think one is from London while the other one from somewhere from New York in any case it was a community contribution and a project driven by the community and at some point um we figured it makes sense to promote that module from a community module to a core module so that we from the spring data team invest more time on that module help with features that aren't how they should be and now since I think two or three years spring data Cassandra is a core module which basically means that team members from the spring data team are actively looking on issues on feature requests helping the community with their questions and that's that's basically the distinction between committee uncommon now you mentioned the release three data oh so it's available since no April I think and the big change in comparison to the version 2.2 is that we have switched to data sticks new Cassandra Drive so the generation 2 directs was based on the kernel driver 3 dot X and the spring data Cassandra 3 dot X line is based on the for that excellent of the Cassandra driver it's probably a bit yeah numbers well if you have too many of them then you're confused by bed by those but you can always add +1 2 to the major version and then you hit always have the right driver probably that's easier to put it know the migration to the new driver was basically a rewrite of the spring data Cassandra module at least from from the resource exercise since the Cassandra driver has changed entirely in terms of package structure there were a lot of concepts that were merged or change so one for instance is I'm making all the statements and furious mutable which are by the driver and this is this is great thing but if your code doesn't expect that and this is a constant source of bugs and what we try to do is to design our API in a way that we help users to avoid those bugs since users are able to specify fury in the same way they were able to do that before and all the heavy lifting is part of spring dedication right itself and besides that the coding change that required basically you configuration infrastructure for the session configuration new implementations for the asynchronous part and for the reactive part there are a lot of benefits that this driver really provides you with first is you have a clear separation between statements and queries that are built you can always create a statement from a from a URI object and you have this pretty neat fury builder that helps you with a domain-specific language to create concentric views and while this was also available in the previous version there was no clear separation between what's going to be executed and what parts I can can reuse now with the current version everything's thread safe and mutable and that really helps a lot but on our site on spring genocide there are a few things where we have to dig deeper in that code that is provided by by the driver so spring data writing a spring data project or spring data code is different very different from our using the driver itself in your application because in your application you know okay I have this many statements and you then directly work with the driver when you write a framework you have to be sometimes creative about apart and this creativity isn't isn't unnecessary always just complexity but it also allows to cater for you tell plans and future enhancements so one things one thing we hear quite a lot is when does spring data Cassandra's support prepared statements and with the previous version how it was was written this was next to impossible because there was was no clear separation between the statements and reusable staff and and all those internals now with the rewrite to the next version and by making things more immutable and thinking more in terms of statement factories we could already consider that fact so that we can provide in a future version prepared statement so that those statements are executed in a more efficient way when when working with Cassandra yeah it's it's not not always always bad if you have to rewrite things because you can then revisit some concepts yeah yeah we've prepared statement you evaluate the statement once check all the grammar once anyway it will speed up your your cronies and your so you mentioned quickly briefly reacted if you are implementing f to DBC you probably also loved the new driver yes it's great to see that you folks I have picked up also on the reactive story since basically reactive is today what we have seen like ten years ago with no sequel source like everybody is jumping on that same trend to avoid whether reactive make sense for them or not and it's great to see that the driver has reacted api's we had already in earlier versions adapter layer that was sitting on top of the asynchronous driver API and exposed the query functionality through a directive API and nowadays we are looking with your driver team how we can bring things even more closer together and that's that's an ongoing effort yeah from computation future to flex you know there are a lot of Java folks listening us yeah that's very promising I use it I play with it and I love it I love the new version and inside of the strawberry right we had also a few other changes that are not worth it so first if you want to upgrade from the previous version to 2 dot something to 3 that's something there's a migration guide in the reference documentation that talks about the changes in spring data Cassandra itself and there you can also find links to the migration guide that tells you how to migrate from the driver version to the new one if you are a configuring infrastructure computer components yourself and with this change we also figured that we want to deprecate the XML configurations so if you're a long time spring user you probably started with XML convict until you found out that a java config makes actually much more fun and we found that as well so we started deprecating the examiner configuration and if you are using XML convict it's always a good time to consider migrating to to Java convict yeah I would +1 ban so I'm a very old spring user I used XML a lot you know to tell you I even implemented namespaces you know your own XML stuff and yeah it's really time to move to Java coffee yes it is it is well well well it has still its advantage just because you can pre-process that exam in a build step but I think if you want a more robust system and less surprises then the Java based configuration is the way to go yes then there's another neat feature so we were asked I think six years ago when a spring director Sandra was initially built to provide support for naming strategies and now finally we have support for it I think this is the oldest ticket that we ever fixed and now you can plug in your own naming strategy and this is useful if you want to derive Cassandra column names and table names from your entity model without you having to annotate every single property with the name just provide your naming strategy like you would like to see it and and how do you want to generate a column and table names and then you then you would shakhter the name of the method as well probably yeah that's pretty neat and what we can also provide now with the migration to the new driver is profile resolution on that view impact fury basis so sometimes there is a need to run queries with with a certain configurations maybe time out consistency levels probably to my point of view you should make that explicit each time but just to be sure you know you want to write very fast cl1 you want to have consistency alcohol but yeah you know and yeah and and in the past you had to set every single value yourself in fewer options and then pass on the fewer options and I think that can be tedious to repeat yourself so what the new driver provides you is that you can associate a statement with a so called profile and a profile is just a reference to configuration configuration set that configures time-outs consistency level logging and and a lot of really a lot of configuration parameters that you can can set and if you have queries that have to run with a certain profile you can reference that profile in the keyword options and then just run it without worrying in the code which of the actual configuration value should should be this is also a pretty neat outcome of that rewrite so that we can can leverage additional features it has been externalized as a file yeah why that's quite a lot of new features to test still a lot of going on I think thank you very much for all the details we will provide the link and migration we will release a blog post altogether of all these new release pretty soon and ok again thank you very much for being with us mark and hope to see you next time everyone founders IP that upset these fifty that that show thanks for having me bye-bye thanks for listening to the distributed
