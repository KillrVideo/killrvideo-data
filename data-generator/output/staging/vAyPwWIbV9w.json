    "text": "[Music] hello welcome to the latest edition of the data stack C sharp hour today we are going to be getting into our back into the Cassie schema Migrator for pachi Cassandra data stacks Enterprise and also as always feel free to ask questions stop me if do anything confusing use this as a learning experience as well as anything else I am building an application that I'll use in production but this is all about the learning experience so be sure to jump in accordingly whenever you have questions and such and also just have fun you know that's that's another important aspect of this all right so without further adieu we'll get rolling here just booting my machine up here flip around the image so you can see what I'm doing there's Cassie schema migrator will get that open all right there we go slowly loading man when this project gets big it's gonna be kind of nuts cuz nyan cats really gonna have to work hard oh my buddy Travis is back got some Co hackers in the space today now everyone has met Travis what's your still just waiting for one thing to boot up here on the back end dig in here also let me know if the music is too loud cuz you know that can be detrimental to educational purposes looky there I got my self-hosted ok getting into the code now to do where's my little penguin there we go ok I've got 2 app open here and JetBrains Rider last session let's hear what did we do so I've been building it out where the tests basically the set up is a bunch of actual schema migration files here get put into a directory during the build up and breakdown of each test now notice some degree that doesn't make it a unit test anymore that makes it an integration test but that's exactly what I need at this point so each of these files is built out in the directory and then torn down at the end of each test so and right now I just have it literally in each test like this and it builds it up starts the migration path process and we get to look the files loaded in and then we select either up or down based on the method call now if I run all these tests I've also per last session set it up so that the test will break for whatever it is that is next up so we're doing red-green test-driven development style approach here of integration tests so don't scream at me for diverting a little bit from the unit test paradigm here but it's a good way to also keep a task list of where we are what works what doesn't work and what we need to do next I believe if I'm not mistaken the next step in this process is to actually start executing the actual migration so we'll have to write some cql and get that injected into the files this session as currently I believe I still just have the files and the content of the files is just like select Asterix table which is not really acceptable in this situation as a migration there we go so from the test perspective here we have four failing tests verify tasks are ready for migration execution verify tasks are ordered for down migration execute up migration execute down migration so these two thought these were done so I just popped in to that one okay so we do have this here so we create the test helper which builds out the sample setup that we're testing against for the integration purposes then we have the migration path which is actually using our class and methods off that class to set up for the migration then we pass the returned migration path into file selection to get the files and then we have the files to process returned which gives us the migrations to execute so I'm gonna actually put a breakpoint in here so I can refresh my memory with this test of where exactly we're at here so I'm just gonna debug this one test and I'm also going to bounce us into full sized view here bang says it has zero calories and a lot of other crazy stuff for me so I'm gonna be able to program really good today alright so we get into this test here and right here with for our assert okay so we have a confirmation method that I want to implement I don't know how or what the confirmation method would be used in the future and from an anti-pattern perspective this is a method that would effectively effectively be gold-plating so I don't really need it but I'm gonna implement it anyway just because I want to have like a check point to verify and write a test for and in the future we'll come back and refactor some things around this but it'll be key for future pieces and future CLI triggers for when you're actually doing infrastructure as code or things like that and you want to roll out the schema migration but right now it is definitely gold plating so if you look up that anti-pattern you realize that this isn't the best thing to do but again like I said today in a pattern but we're gonna do it anyway because we're rebels alright so at this point we have migrations to execute and let's it's null and files to process the files to process is 9 we got 9 files to process right I just want to take a look at some of them here and it should have yeah there's the down one's up one's etc okay so that looks good let's go to the next one here hope I hit the right key I forget which next is yeah okay so now migrations to execute should be populated and we should have all nine of those migrations in here ready should be set to true and all that's good so it looks like I actually implemented this last go-round so I'm gonna take off that breakpoint go ahead and comment out this test and remove this thing remove too much of the semicolon there all right so now I can get in there and just execute that one and it should turn true but I want to go in too and just just reconfirm visually the actual function sorry method and right too much go call everything a function now even though it's a method versus a function pedantic detail really so return ready ready is set to true here based on the rest of this stuff succeeding so actually looks good this should throw an error and bubble up accordingly if anything happens so we should get it ready and ready should be true at that point so now we're getting into this realm pretty quickly alright so now let's execute this and get a green out of it cool alright so our test passed now we'll get on to the next one here what would be our next one stop stop running in the one okay so verify tasks are ordered for down migration let's take a look at that verify TAS order for down migrations so I'll pass in down here migrations to execute path so path of migrations right migration downs so the path we're executing is the down path okay right it is never used currently okay so cert actually will probably need to let's look through it all right will do for each vibration and migrate patient's need to do bar right yeah there we go oh no way let's oh yeah migration we should type what I need to do other white equals I need to do an equals right that looks good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm so what is up with this one some verified tasks are ready for migration execution well that's what I just did why is this not it passed last time maybe just maybe wasn't actually set up right for it oh no it passed then let's execute all of them alright run current session and run on unit test run all the unit tests let's see what we get here make sure we're not messing with shared state during the test each test should create and destroy everything by itself without any problems actually oh I didn't run the debugger on it so it just runs faster set what just happened oh it didn't run all the tests that's the problem there we go [Music] that's pretty quick cool so Wow looks like we're getting to that point where we are about to do an actual migration which brings me to okay let's get in here before we just go executing this haphazardly let's get in here and see what we got going on right all this did not open the project right oh yeah it is okay so there's the test here's the test helpers this is where I need to add actual sequel code in here so definitely make this where it works very specifically in one direction right so we want to ordered bits to go in the correct way based on the dates here right so the first one here I should probably number these accordingly so they make more sense when we read through them so the first one here is 1902 to 2003 good now Cheers it's beer time for Travis I don't know if I supposed to tell the world but he says farewell everybody have a good one sends all his love peace etc don't worry though I'm still here so no worries seriously 2001 is before 2003 oh and here's mm I think that so that's a no-go so there's no goes aren't worth messing with so here let's do this we got one two three so this should be 1 this should be 2 this should be 3 this should be 4 this should be 5 right 1 2 3 4 5 yeah [Music] I'm wondered if I am I just setting it up though to add this content in the order so I'm not actually testing the order by then so let's hear on what's this fuss about yeah sure use VAR her if okay we'll do that that sounds good so now we don't have excessive nesting so that's cool migration well we're gonna go with that so we're doing we're gonna test out the up first so now we know this is gonna be an order here so let's get over here into database I'm gonna write out some cql attached to we need to so now the question okay I'm going to assume that the database is there we're going to go over here and look in an image clatter I don't know so what is let's here so I need to have at least a node which I haven't done any setup for for this project so in that sense let's let's get that figured out right we need to figure out and have at least a node C's console I'm wondering I'm curious what well I wonder if a test can run a script like a thing that runs before everything or we spin up the docker image for every one of them just like we're doing these tests so make sure every test is isolated / a docker container that's another thing we can do oh let's let's check that out and see actually oh yeah see c-sharp docker container I don't want to do that I just want to run execute docker from yeah I want to do that so execute dr. CLI from C sharp that's what I want to do yeah done at c-sharp client library for docker API docker dotnet looks pretty cool yeah using docker docker client a new URI this thing local docker for Windows I don't want to connect a docker for Windows I just want to connect I just wanna call a connection to docker well we'll see if that will see if that works let's actually what we're gonna add a whole project to do a test around this so let's see go over here back in the writer let's add a project new project and we'll call this very console console application yeah I think that might be I don't want to so I don't wanna do down that I want to do down that Koro there I just was looking at it wrong okay so this one is going to be called our docker examples project hit create on that here we go okay so we got the hello world and then let's get in here get into our dependencies will manage new get packages docker docker net x.509 basic Hoth cool okay so this allows you to interact with a docker remote API program programmatically fully synchronous non-blocking object or any code and your dotnet applications cool story let's do that oh no no no no wait it's oh that's yeah that's the name of my project so yes let's install that in there cool all right and then we want to do here yeah let's just do this all right okay that's looking good don't need that down there what is this fussing about though constructor has three parameters but is invoked with zero arguments not what I wanted to do what is it okay for a custom employee you can also pass a named pipe sample list containers let's let's do this containers in with docker examples here and will create us it selves a little CLI so far these examples are not very nice oh yeah okay so let's just wrap it around and what about a wait here do I need to have a wait there let's remove it and oh no that's incorrect so make method method main async let's try that I don't really remember how to write that code so we're gonna figure it out and this still needs to what are my bits in here just a new URI anonymous credentials is fine right and then time span is the time span in strings just do 10 set work and then a dot create client here we go doing random stuff again this is gonna be a whole host right what says here do this or connect to your local docker for Windows daemon using name pipes of this stuff okay okay I'm taking all that stuff out it says that it doesn't need it but maybe the documentation is just bad so what happens if I do this give me some bad advice here writer okay I'm not enjoying that code very much let's look back at this okay list containers default docker engine all windows for custom endpoint you can also use an image by pulling from the things start a container [Music] yes this is actually what I wanted we got here so this is gone I don't need that okay hello world we know that works we don't need it though so process start info docker run it RM blah blah blah ok so let's get out here docker saundra this is what I need to do I need to pull that one okay let's hear file name docker arguments run duh ok so if I wanted to run this stuff process info equals new process which process start info docker dalla run aim this kasi at work let's to default Steve I'm 3.14 all right how far is that gonna get us create new no window I'll probably need to create the thing here that parameter in containing methane okay we'll do that I don't like that there public void print I put they - received era day to receive alright let's do this let's run that see what we get 26 me so what is this one exactly like yeah Trask it lets a Trask it okay let's not do anything right now let's just do that yeah weird so now my curiosity is okay so what about docker on that list PS Tanner ID cuz I'm 2 3 104 13 seconds ago so that looks like yeah this Cassie that's it so docker stop this Cassie cool so that's let's see about I don't need that don't need that alright that's that's pretty cool I don't even really need I don't even need to do that maybe we could simplify this process I just noticed so I got to give a call-out twitchcon is officially gonna have its twitch developer meetup thing during twitchcon 2019 so twitchcon 2019 it has officially become a developer event also that's pretty awesome so anyway back to what I'm doing here though wait for some milliseconds that's like two minutes begin output redline but again error redline create a redirect standard output it true true process info process that start info a process that start so I wonder is okay so that's the process info wonder what happens if I get rid of this just gonna kind of narrow down some of this code and see what I really need and what I don't so it's your docker do that again okay nothing running just try to run it and see what we get oh yeah so that's have to do a little docker work here and get rid of that docker image so docker [Music] forget what this is docker move this kasi okay it looks like it did it so then let's run this again all right that we Oh Tucker stop this Cassie so created it but then it nuked itself on something right okay back to the starting point here okay oh I get it okay so we need standard output standard air stuff see if that gets us where we want to be okay so then yep okay that worked so I wonder though is there like a cleaner way to do this again alpha treeline let's hear c-sharp execute man line oh there's that let's see if that actually works because that's unbelievably cleaner really you're docker run name this kasi network default HD saundra 3.14 and that should do it really let's get rid of that oh and we'll clean this up so it's not got all that down there and then we can clean this up and you bash I could do docker and then this right okay that's cool and then let's do a string move tanner 2x equals she will make a we'll make a method for that we factor this extract method strap method create so this run runs docker run Cassie yeah so that's what we wanted alright it's cool so then docker stop Cassie private static Lloyd Cassie moves then I want to do private static void exact docker so man all right boom okay and then this one would be except talker [Music] what am i doing oh yeah stop let's do this let's get some names in here so bar Cassie Nick let's name equals this Cassie oh yeah let's do that boom okay and bar string let's go then string se version 3.1 one four and then private ok string network default so let's do that exact docker I will do this way we'll actually do it builder string command equals run name named Cassie name oh yeah d then cassie version there we go so then that um yes I know it's funny to do it that way but it's just it works better for my head to pull it out that way there we go so that that now runs Cassie this will now I'll stop Cassie and this will remove Cassie boom okay docker stop Cassie and I see removed right so here though we can do things okay let's see what we ended up with now dr. PS so nothing's running so if we do a docker that's it dr. not images docker yes all so this this Cassie wasn't oh did it break because it already ran that could be the problem so let's comment this and see if that happens what oh it is going ok clear let's try from start here all the way through for testing and then let's do new gooood got new GUI can we do that that's it right okay let's see I want to actually well I want to put that in here and do for testing and get rid of this bit like so let's just comment that out for now let's run that why can't it find that image there's three 1:04 right there but is it trying to do I have the commands in there well let's let's do this what is it print oops right I'll concentrate print oh right right line figure it out a minute Oh whoops that would be the problem this needs to be here we go let's try that all right yeah okay docker stop socket remove Oh - let's do doctor removes gas trucks didn't realize I still had all this stuff on here all right cool so then docker PS - PS - a so that should break yeah okay so now if I run it it should break because the container is in there oh no it's gonna just create a new container every time now cool okay and the VM crashed whoo-hoo yeah so booting that that puppy right back up but so we did get that figured out so we just figured out how to issue commands from c-sharp using things to print out to the console and to execute the dock command docker of course needs to be installed on the system to execute an executable of docker needs to be installed so it's the docker daemon itself it's executing the commands just like we would normally and that that will give us a container basis to spin up for each one of the tests so now let's actually do that and I think that will wrap up our session for today we'll go a little bit over I am currently in the process of booting that virtual machine back up so just bear with me a moment here [Music] almost there police starts in the wrong resolution I really wish I could get that fixing though I always pick 1680 by 1050 instead of 1920 by 1080p I didn't take too long so you get writers started in the background in the meanwhile let's see what's up here dr. PS dr. PS all there goes get down to our three here you all right so I want to steal steal this command put this over in our test set up migrations for tests so we get that going on all that stuff and rate these and then teardown okay so there's tear down and there's set up let's do this let's do a little refactor real quick here refactor extract whoops refactor extract method yeah we'll just call this create migration files so we're doing Oh create migration file paths or no names names file file names how did I make a weird mess out of that one oh goodness I sure did okay no let's not do that all right there there we go oh I can do this first so let's do this right refactor extract method strike method right file contents and contents right yeah and then this weight that can be yeah it's gonna leave it that way for now then we got these helpful bits down here shrink those for the moment and then what I want to do is actually all right what I need to do is so after all that setup and return migration path Oh return migration path hmm so what I need to do is create the docker container on the set up like that so let's put this down here that these okay they're in there why is just write it here then these files and create the exact docker man like that that's what I need so then create this string command equals the stuff now let's see if we can create this creep method exact docker yeah there we go what did I Oh I was out in the wrong scope that's what it was okay so there we go let's do system Diagnostics diet process dot start let's say docker come in there we go and we're gonna get rid of this stuff okay there we go there we go and then you I will do like files and contents when lots do you expect docker strain command equals this let's do run name you let's get these in there you okay here we go so that should start that up I know what I wanna do I want to do everything here refactor extract a method extract method create files and contents for integration test what a weird mess okay so that's down here and all these things so that function that function exec docker is down here and that thing within the class okay okay so that it kind of works I need to move this stuff though into let's refactor and move it into just helpers two fully qualified class name but that's where I want to move it to and limited there this stuff that need to be here let's take this I put it down here in this static class so we need to remove this one this one I want to knock it out all right now the point of all that was we got all this cruft code to build this stuff down kinda out of the way what is this saying oh that's not unused it's just not called yet right there we go so test oops test station and start this is public for one and that's called for that so that could stay private get the call made all right okay okay now we can get a little bit cleaner here this is deep the Elector delet delay but I delete directories and then exec docker we want to do so we got these up here yeah okay so let's do stop okay I see name and let's do exact dollar remove the same thing right we don't really need oh this is gonna be let's do this like so and then we'll do all right migration for Cassie there we go okay I'm gonna get this renamed better now each test should be able to run and have a container for all of these passing and they should still execute nothing should really change but let's see what the execution time does on these this should be kind of off the walls nuts there we go I wonder what look like you looks like processing it's on a wall maybe this isn't about you you you you Oh lost the VM again looks like that's what it looks like mm-hmm all right well this is gonna be continued in the next episode of data sack c-sharp our so we got a lot of things figured out this session one that testing with docker will nuke a virtual machine quite rapidly so I'm gonna set up for next session to do this locally without a vm one two we're gonna set up some perf to figure out basically how we can test this because we need to test this in some way form or manner and it needs to be testable in a way that someone can pull down wherever and be able to test it right I think that the the ideal way might actually be to create a Cassandra docker instance just one and then run with it from there instead of trying to keep it to a broken out integration unit piece of development and work from there we need to actually get where the Cassandra node or the Cassandra cluster is running somewhere itself we'll go with the local host option and then work from there but we'll tackle that on the next session this one some of the things we've learned have been getting getting docker commands issued from c-sharp itself so that's pretty cool we also knocked out two unit tests on existing functionality that we wanted to have verified or the integration test and then we figured out a bunch of other calls and other things related to executing docker creating a particular Cassandra node and then tearing that back down so all in all good session hope everybody enjoyed it and enjoys the rewatch ah's and finds it useful if there other ideas thoughts etc as always ping me shoot me a whisper via the data stacks devs or my Adrian Hall twitch account and uh you know well we'll get things going get more coding going in the meantime everybody have an absolutely spectacular Wednesday and I'll catch you next time [Music]",
