    "text": "hello everyone I'm Aaron PL from data Stacks I'm going to show you how to build a simple airite cloud data pipeline tie it to datax astb and then build a geni python application to pull data from it let's go so the first thing I'm going to do is create a new database I'm going to go to Astra dos. I'm just going to click sign in with Google I will go ahead and click create a database and for this example I'm going to need a serverless vector database so I can just say like erand DB that should be fine um I'm going to pick Google cloud and I'm going to say us east1 and then I'm going to say create okay once that process is completed and your database comes up you'll be taken to this screen um which gives you your a API endpoint that is the first thing I'm going to want to grab so I'm going to click this little copy button here and I'm going to make sure that that's noted and then I'm going to come back and I'm going to say generate token let me just copy that and paste that over there all right we're done for now next I'm going to go to airbit.com so I'm going to click on try it free and I'll create a new account with Google all right so then I am taken to my airite dashboard um the first thing I'm going to do here is create a new source and what I'm going to do here um I've always been a bit of a fan of the xkcd comics and wouldn't you know it airb has an XKCD data source so really you just have to have a name for it XKCD will do fine um and then you can just say setup Source there we go all right so we have our source um now we could go ahead and create a connection but for a connection you need to have both a source and a destination although I'm pretty sure that air bite allows you to create a source on the fly so you know what we actually will click this create a connection button um now for a destination I'm going to click on this astb community destination this is the one that's from data Stacks um you can see we have our destination name of ASB um so for a chunk size we should probably have 512 we're going to want to put a little bit of thought into the uh the fields that we store as metadata um so in particular I'm going to say title and I'm going to say IMG for image and I'm going to say alt uh those are the three fields that we're going to store now text fields to embed um basically this is what we're going to use to create our Vector embedding so in this case I'm just going to say we want the title for that and that should be good so for our embedding provider uh we have a couple of options here but uh I'm going to pick open AI so I'm going to paste my open AI key right there um for my ASB application token I'm going to grab the one that I created with uh database administrator permissions and copied that off and then I'm also going to grab the endpoint from the new database that I created um our asdb key space um also known as a as a name space um is going to be default keyspace that's what we're going to use for that and then for an asdb collection we'll just say air bite that should be that should be fine so now I'll click setup destination okay now that we have our source and our destination all set up and a part of our uh connection we can go ahead and set up how we want our data pipeline to behave and then if I scroll all the way down I have this button for setup connection so so I'll click that okay and you can see with the connection set up it is now automatically doing the first data sync okay so as you can see it looks like our stream is fully synchronized um so if this worked I should be able to look at um my airite collection inside of astb and see that there are records in there and if you see that I I click on the data Explorer here it goes to default keyspace um my airbike collection and oh look at that I have a thousand plus records um you'll also notice that it has um created the vector embeddings with 1536 Dimensions yeah look at this so we have we have data in here check that out so I can scroll over and you can see the um you know the titles of some of the comics you can see the uh the URLs of some of the comics so I think I think we're okay here so the next thing we have here um we have a little um collab notebook that that we've cooked up so let's just uh let's just walk through this so if I click on run here it'll go ahead and do a pip install of rag stack Ai and Matt plot live okay so you can see that completed um let's go ahead and run our Imports here yep there we go all good and run this little code snippet we'll paste our token in and be all good there there I will run this block of code and paste in my endpoint and that should be all okay I'm going to want to grab my open AI API key so let me go ahead and run that code paste that in that's all good okay the next thing we're doing is um we're instantiating our um open AI embedding model so let's go ahead and do that and again this is going to default to text embedding at2 model um connecting to astb now that we've Set uh the token the endpoint and the keyspace name and the collection name this should connect up just fine and it does here I'm going to run this code snippet it's going to say enter your query Kepler is the default um there actually is an XKCD comic named Kepler um so I'm going to say orbital mechanics just like that all right so the first thing that our code is going to do is it's going to take our query of orbital mechanics and it's going to create a vector just for that and you can see it prints out our query and this is the 1536 dimensional Vector that was generated by the Tex string of orbital mechanics all right so if I run that that runs out to asdb goes ahead pulls back a similarity search Returns the most similar result which is this comic titled orbital mechanics all right so the last thing to do is we can use the mat plot live to go ahead and display that down here so if I run that block bam there is our orbital mechanics comic all right for next steps go ahead and check out our GitHub repository for this project of course if you want to have a closer look at datax astb and our Vector database offering head out to astra.com and if you want to learn more about airite and building you know top-notch cloud-based data pipelines have a look at www.b.com thank you all for watching and have a great day",
