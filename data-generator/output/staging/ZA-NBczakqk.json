excellent connection my studio says excellent connection so looks like we are good yeah we can now hi sabri hey fabrics when are you going to vacation shouldn't you be off already good so well well well welcome to cassandra certification workshop or i would better say cassandra certification training [Laughter] yeah looks like today's youtube chat is going to be fun and that's amazing so maybe you know already maybe you don't know but data starts an amazing company i work at uh sponsors your nosql education and certification so you can get your nosql training and then become a certified developer or administrator on your choice completely for free you know what there is no free fruits you still have to pay a lot of efforts because it's a serious investments it's not just you go get your certification no you have to pass the exam and this exam is serious it's proctored it's controlled if you are ready to work hard you have nothing to worry about you will make it and today i will help you so a few uh few steps beforehand i am uh alex volchniv developer advocate lead data stocks and i work a lot in the field of distributed systems distributed databases i'm a fan and developer of different open source solutions i'm a cloud certified architect but most of all i am an i.t exorcist and i.t exercise that someone who makes different bad things in i.t and software development disappear and one of the worst thing i see in the software development all the time then people are using uh wrong tools in the wrong place or even they are maybe using right tools but in the wrong way i'm here to make that not happen i'm here to make you uh to be efficient and successful using the right tools in the right moment to do the right job so focus on uh all the materials we have today all the materials we talked today is published at data stacks academy workshop cassandra certification on github in case you will need them later first few steps uh what is apache cassandra because obviously if you going to become certified in one of the most powerful nosql technologies obviously you need to know what is it apache cassandra is one of the most powerful nosql there any kind of databases in the world doesn't matter if we talk about relational or nosql databases it's still i believe one of the most uh they one of the most powerful and efficient databases what can work at incredibly high scale it's ready for big data so you can handle hundreds petabytes with cassandra and it will be totally fine at some point normal relational databases will start to get a problem they can't handle too much data they start to choke and it doesn't happen with cassandra if you do things right and our training will make you do the things right it delivers highest availability we use it to say high availability but i believe you can reach the highest possible availability with apache cassandra it provides great geographical distribution which is very important for the companies who run international businesses companies like apple netflix instagram facebook many others basically all the companies what have clients worldwide they need to have these geographical distributions which is very hard with most of the traditional databases solutions also read write performance do you like to wait for a web application you are using to answer for a few seconds i believe you don't neither do i no we want our data to be very fast doesn't matter if your application is fast or slow if your database is slow your clients will get your answers slowly and then they get slow answers they do what they go to your competitor so we don't want it happen so uh cassandra is incredible not only work with big data many databases can work with big data that's not in use but cassandra can do it in a very very fast performant way so even with petabytes of data you still get your answer within milliseconds now obviously zero downtime for all the operations like adding a node removing a node scaling out scaling in updating your database maybe bringing on some security patches there is zero downtime on all the iterations because of the distributed decentralized nature of this database and finally what really matters for a lot of account for a lot of companies it's vendor independent it well data stocks does a lot to develop cassandra of course to grow the community but we don't own apache cassandra because it belongs to apache software foundation maybe you know them already maybe you don't but for sure you use their products if you ever heard about kafka maven groovy many other projects they all deliver it by apache cassandra hadoop is also apache project as well as many hundreds actually of open source community projects so cassandra is vendor independent it doesn't belong to any commercial company but only to open source non-commercial non-profit uh open source foundation so that matters for many many many companies uh this session will take somehow 90 to 120 minutes but you can drop earlier if you won't have time because the most important things will happen in the first hour and second part of this training will be a demo of an exam i'm asking questions you are giving answers in the end i tell you how much points did you score it and if it would be a real exam if you would pass or not so uh cassandra scales horizontally and linearly one of the best features of a cassandra is what it it's able to scale nearly till the uh without any borders if you need more volume or if you need higher performance you just have to add more servers simple as that and then cassandra digests that there are nearly no manual operations uh or at least very small amount of manual operations in comparison with other databases cassandra is distributed everywhere it's kinda a trademark of cassandra already can you have multi-data center deployments geographically distributed deployments with other databases yes it's possible but usually this kind of deployments is one master data center one secondary data center and you can write data only to primary data center only to master data center you cannot write data to the second one it's only for reads right with cassandra it's not the thing because cassandra is decentralized and boom before of this distributed decentralized nature you can have your databases data centers everywhere building up a single cluster working together also cassandra's platform agnostic so it doesn't matter if you want to use microsoft azure amazon web services or google cloud or all of them at once together in a single cluster it's totally possible that doesn't matter for us you will get it running now why should i care let's take a look at the thing uh big biggest companies use cassandra for example apple at our conference in year 2019 so two years ago reported what they have dedicated running only for cassandra 150 000 servers that sounds even a bit scary you know and they do tens of millions of queries per second so that's really a lot it's not a tens millions of operations to the application it will be actually much much much more but tens of millions of queries per second to the database and that's very different thing at your application layer you might have some caching you may have some different workloads but the database don't forget big data working very fast that's a very cool use case and that's a very cool business to participate not only in apple uh one of the biggest cassandra developers is netflix and netflix uses cassandra for 98 percent of all the data they stream at all and they have many clusters they have hundreds of clusters and most active of them handles 30 million operations per second so as you see cassandra makes successful business able to achieve what we want scaling worldwide globally and of course many others you use instagram you already use cassandra activision blizzard and many many other companies are running using cassandra by the way if you are interested in netflix use case recovery for recording publish it you can get at the datastarts.your cassandra netflix but you know what that's not only the thing amount of digital data in the world will only grow and it will grow exponentially so beforehand if you run a small to medium business you usually go with my sql i usually go with postgresql and so on then you go with a bigger business you usually go with oracle or companies like that but now you need a real scale what cassandra can deliver uh real scale not bound to any particular um [Music] commercial company what will what can try to monetize it at some moment but just something what you can trust like cassandra so currently by the estimations of idc and if they did a great research uh ordered by seagate maybe you know seagate they produce uh great disk drives so amount of data digital data in the world now is estimated to be somewhere around 80 to 100 silica uh zettabytes uh zettabytes but you know what it will double over next few years basically every year we create more and more digital data and some of them of course are videos and pictures but some of them also a digital data you store into a database this amount will only grow and moral world will need more and more and more qualified developers and you can easily become one of them soon hey gentlemen do we have any good questions there should i answer something no looks like we are good let's move on then which certification i should get the answer is there are two primary certifications administrator certification and developer certification so one is going to be apache cassandra certified developer and second one certified administrator difference is very simple if you're a programmer then you mostly probably have to go with a developer certification if you are more on the maintaining and running things and operations teams then obviously administrator certification can be better fit for you but you know what with us you can make two of them to stay more on the devops side of things um what resources do i have well you have plenty of resources to get ready all the rules all the important things uh the flow of a certification and preparation for the certification is published on our website datastax.com notifications it's a very good place to start uh this training before the resources links preparation questions and many hours is published at github on datastax academy workshop cassandra certification and finally the place number one to get ready is uh our massive online free er on course at the academy.datastax.com again it's free so you will have to put a lot of time into that to get ready but definitely worth it now uh to chat i suggest using our discord server available at dot io slash discord and then for asking more formal questions is very good place to ask is a community.datastax.com also great book by our colleague jeff carpenter cassandra the definitive guide a recently revised third edition accordingly to the updates of cassandra version 4 which which was published earlier this year then this one is important we get data modeling is very important if you do your data model wrong you may have a lot of problems in production and we don't want it to happen so what you need to know we have published typical data models explaining how do you develop it right at datastax.com learn slash data modeling by example and this is a great place to get ready for the exam because some of those examples will be used on the exam you see i open you some secrets of the exam because you are the best you are attending our trainings how do i get ready first step go to academy.datastyx.com and sign up it's free follow the learning path either the administrator certification or developer certification uh they have the same foundation of course ds101 the s201 both but then it's a little bit different second part of the developer learning path will have data modeling course and second part of administration learning learning path will have administrators tools frankly speaking if you have time i recommend you to take both of them it will add some time but it really makes you understand better how it works and then you understand better in your team on your project what you really work on and then you are the one who are going to be promote the next one if you know more than all your colleagues so it's worth that get your exam voucher maybe you have it already from our previous workshops if you don't don't worry the idea is very simple after completing a learning path you write an email to the academy at datastax.com and you will get your voucher for free this with this voucher first prepare for the exam read the rules at datastax.com um i will speak about the rules a little bit uh afterwards pass uh certification training it will be a short one like showing how exactly the training look how exactly the exam looks like and then take your exam and enjoy you are the winner if you put enough efforts into your preparation you will make it i promise you now regarding the rules exam is serious exams proctored we don't want you see we want your certificate to be really valuable so companies hiring you see what yeah they know we certificate matters a lot what people are really know what they're doing therefore we have very solid protection from people who want to get certificates for free without spend spending any real effort to learn to get their knowledge no we don't want teachers to get her certificate so it's a proctored exam first it's a closed book exam no reference materials no power no paper no electronic nothing is allowed live proctor will watch you through the exam so obviously you will need a webcam exam array should be clear any no papers no devices no materials if you have multiple screens like i do you will have to switch off all of them except one of course no programs no browser windows is open no screenshots no photography any other means of copying or recording any part of the exam it's totally forbidden you will need a small mirror uh available so proctor so you can show with this mirror what's behind your webcam but actually uh in my case when i took this exam it was easier uh they just asked me to turn the webcam and show the room to them so if you have a detachable webcam you can remove it and show your room or also you may if you have a laptop you can just turn your laptop not a big deal very important thing uh if you um i totally forget about that and i forgot to clean up my room so it was a little bit messy i it was a bad feeling for me when proctor told me to show the room to him and it was not really cleaned up so don't be like me if you care about that now computer must have only one screen with no additional monitors let's say it already proctor will report any incidents uh make sure you follow the guidelines but do not worry i mean we are not your enemies right we are your friends and proctor is your friend he is just securing the value of a certificate so for example during the exam you are not allowed to drink or eat i completely forget about that so i took water i started to drink and proctor made an incident uh but it's not a big deal because uh a single incident is not a problem it's a problem when you are trying to um sneak some information from a book or something single incident is not a problem i got two incidents during my exam one was i started to drink you are not allowed and second was i started to read um when i think a lot i start to talk sometimes with myself and you are not allowed to talk because you can use it you can use your voice to read the questions to someone who will give you some hints it's obviously not allowed as well so incidence is not a problem by itself if you're not trying to cheat you will be good don't worry then uh confirm your identity prepare to display a valid government issued photo id uh expiration date is viewable preferably its password travel passport maybe driver's license fed and now no food or water is allowed during the exam exam it's uh it's available is 90 minutes and that's not really a lot of time because you will have a lot of questions my personal recommendation if you stuck on some question just switch to next one yeah sometimes when you are nervous because of the exam you can totally stuck on a single question uh and it may take i don't know 15 minutes maybe to answer that instead of it just skip it go fix then the go answer the next one and get back to it if you will have time in the end this is important now what's next yeah timer is displayed so you see how much time left now if you experience power outage or any kind of a network disruption you will have 20 minutes to access the exam back no report or feedback or correct incorrect answer details will be provided we have to keep it secret so others won't be able to cheat again uh sassy asks how do we get certificate voucher i just stole it uh if you pass learning path when you pass learning path at an academy the datastax.com you get your voucher just write an e-message to it academy at datastax.com uh okay i'm done with the right and that means what we can start uh the most interesting part of this workshop a demo exam on ds there will be three parts first one uh is done first third is done on base it on the course ds201 which is the same for both developers and administrators second part will be done on the content of ds2 210 210 which is for administrators and the last part based on ds220 which is again developers data modeling but date modeling is highly important i recommend even administrators to take this course it's totally worth it so how do we do that how do we run the test exam so you can uh measure your knowledge and if you're ready or not ready very easy please go to where is my yeah please go to menchie.com uh vladislav asks how many attempts in the voucher in the voucher are two attempts um hey one two three something with my network okay okay looks like i'm back sarim don't know what's going on but no okay okay so i should be online back i'm back online live stream looks like yeah the problem is my network works well works well so looks like it's something with youtube which is weird sizing hmm okay looks like it's all green now i don't know what was bad but we are back online thank you for staying i see nearly no one quit that's amazing so now we can start so how do we do this training exam i don't know how much of my words did you miss in the end you go to mendy.com you don't have to sign up it's completely anonymous you enter the code 1496-4806 or just scan the qr code next to me i will ask questions and you will answer them using main team and we will see in the end how many of you give the right answers and uh oops that's a wrong side so let me see how many people join it already hey i see a lot of people join it and by the way before we are starting countdown because we will have some countdown i ask you how much experience do you have with apache cassandra uh make yourself familiar with uh maintain i see there is a person who never uses the two persons never use that that's totally fine with our trainings you will make a good associate level specialist working it and you will feel comfortable and by the way even with adjustment trainings you will already know much more than many people what are using cassandra without passing the trainings because they're just trying to use that in a traditional relational database way without knowing the difference and they very often run into troubles so you will be better than that okay let's uh fedex i see stream is perfectly green on my side so if you still have something maybe it's on yours let me see [Music] now next question have you been to any of our workshops before yes okay no uh foreign newcomers if you've never been at our workshops before we have great series of workshops done weekly on the very different interesting topics so don't forget to hit like and subscribe button on the youtube it's going to be very useful for you and thank you so we can start now i will read the questions and you will try to answer them and that's going to be question number one you know what guys i will read you the first question give you time to think and meanwhile restart my rotor internet connection router so maybe it will help if a problem is on my side i'm not a totally sure problem is on my side but let's start and i will restart in between question number four question from the course 201 for both developers and administrators consider the following sql statements create table roller cluster name text park text rating in primary key name as a primary key you are executing okay i will restart router don't worry let's first focus on the question focus on the question you can read it we are executing four insert statements insert into roller clusters name park rating millennium force center point eight formula rose ferrari world 9 field dragon nagashima 10 millennium force 0.7 question how many rows will the roller coaster stable have after executing all the sql statements i start mentioning you answer please answer using mentium and meanwhile i will restart my router so i will be back in a moment hey hey looks like i'm back online give me a moment sorry guys i don't know what's happening with my internet today but it's okay looks like it was router because now it's much better so answer right answer was c but why let's take a look next slide give us uh the answer yeah now it should be good um take a look in this case our primary key consists only of one part which will be obviously the partition key right and partition is everything so notice the duplication millennium force and millennium force here and there as the primary key is defined only based on the name every next insert will replace information of the previous insert it's so-called absurd behavior so first and forth inserts uh sorry first and third inserts i use the same primary count first first and four right first and four inserts use the same primary key so we cause and absurd uh don't worry you will see the upcoming questions yes i was reloading that's why you didn't see the previous question so now let's see question number two and i will keep this one during the your answer time uh question is consider the following sql statement create hey guys that's not a real exam you won't get certified after this one so if you lost your points it's not a big deal don't worry so great table songs artist title length and seconds and primary key artist title and now we execute following statements insert into songs artist title rank songs beatles yesterday blah blah blah beatles that would be blah blah blah abba fernando blah blah blah from sinatra yesterday blah blah blah uh what is the result of executing all of those cql statements table with a single partition table with two partitions table with three partitions table with four partitions i'm launching next question question 2 of 20 let's go and here your question looks like connection is good again which makes me happy [Music] so table with one partition two partitions three partitions four partitions what do you think what will be the right answer oh by the way i want to open mendy as well so give me a moment i want to see the code oops ah it's here one four nine six one four nine six four eight zero six okay shiny i want to see then the time is over uh by the way if all of you are giving the answers a question will be answered uh earlier so we don't don't all have to wait till the very end so important thing here is to see how the partition is built and what forms partition key i see v naught kumar answers of uh a v one partition and that's a little bit doubt doubtful to me because here we have three different artists with overall four different songs and partition key doesn't look like something single with a single partition what it will be we are almost out of time for this question uh by the way answer time makes you uh feel like watch them ah very possible maybe maybe the king is right maybe maybe not yeah so right answer answer d that's the right answer and let's take a look why take a look in this case partition key is decided its partition key is defined by the first argument of a primary key and here because of the parenthesis that both artist and title will be part of a partition key therefore uh we will have two parts defining artist and title right beatles yesterday beatles let it be it makes desire despite the artist is the same but still two different partitions because song name is different now abba and frank sinatra obviously give different partitions so answer the table before partitions let's take a look at the next question and i will start countdown i'll read him question number three it started developer and administrator exams consider the following sql statement create table cars again no network looks good so network is good on my site sorry i don't know what's going on streaming software reports what we are good but anyway time is ticking so let's take a look following sql statement uh table cars primary key make model years color each of the following is a valid query for the cars table there are valid queries and not well no non-invalid queries which one is valid you need to know limitations of sql we have 30 seconds left oops 10 seconds left most of you gave the answer already and five last seconds think fast which on switch statement is correct and time is over and the correct answer is c not d but take a look most of you made it right avoiding wrong answers a and b and this is good now let's take a look uh what's wrong with them take a look when we executing a sql query we always must specify our full all parts of a partition key in this case make and model and therefore make forward just made for is not valid because we don't specify model color here and color invalid because we don't specify make and model at all c specifies ford mustang and here so ford mustang and here therefore c is a valid uh answer if we can't skip color it's not a problem but take a look here ford mustang red alpha a nice car right but take a look it's going to be fourth mustang and color and that is the problem already why because this color is a second clustering column and if you specify a second clustering column you must specify the previous one so a statement d would be correct if you say it like select all from cars we make four model mustang and here 1969 and color red then it's valid but without here just by color it's invalid and uh answer to viking yes totally those questions are same level as the certification exam my only question is if you think it's too hard or too uh soft let's say good next question i okay i explained it all already next question and i'm starting down time i'm starting ah okay before starting countdown let's see who is the best and we have three persons who made it all right maverick croc and ribbit those are nicknames maybe you will replace them with your real names if you want if you don't want it's totally fine as well so now we start countdown and i give you the question consider the sql statement employees id name department and primary key of a single id and create table employees by department id name department via department and id of a primary key begin batch insert into employees something insert into employees by department same values apply batch question what is a valid statement about this batch a it's a single partition batch what can be applied b it's a single partition batch what can not be applied c it is a multi-partition batch what can be applied d it's a multi-partition batch what can not be applied so i'm speaking so what do you think uh what do you uh right now there is no menti is not set for this one but i will copy a link for you so hey ellison jump in try to answer questions we have 10 seconds left for this question so oh yeah it's already started it started actually 55 minutes ago oh no worries you you're good it's just the question number four so you will join the next question so let's take a look at the answer right answer is c multipartition batch what can't be applied now let me see the answers distribution a b c okay that went not really smooth uh let's take a look what's wrong and why c is the right answer so take a look it's a single partition but can be applied it's a single partition budget that cannot be applied what's wrong with those statements take a look ladies and gentlemen we insert values into two different tables by no means partition can be shared across multiple tables of course it's of course it's for two different partitions because it's two to two different tables there is no way to handle one partition uh closer to multiple tables so it's two two partitions batch and it's totally valid so it can be applied if you are give answers a or b it's the wrong one okay so um looks like there's something with schedule if you join at us just right now then don't worry in the beginning i told you how do you get ready for the certification exam because data starts sponsors your education and certification for uh nosql for apache cassandra database one of the most powerful databases in the world so you definitely may want to get this certification and in the beginning i just told you uh how do you get ready and now we run training exam i see some people are late so it's recorded now jump in answer questions and afterwards just watch the beginning of the talk like first 30 minutes there were some quite important information good so i start question number five all answers give maximum points and it started and let's see the question number five consider the table definition with a primary key amid create table reviews by restaurant name ct review rating comments review date primary key it's known what restaurant review are uniquely identified by a combination of name city and review restaurant reviews are retrieved from table using combination of name and city and the table has multi-row partitions what primary key does this table have so how it goes what primary key does this table have you know what i think some music won't hurt so it will be funnier together if music is too loud let me know and i will switch it down a bit or maybe it's a quiz music for the exam music we may need something maybe for them test exam we need to have something stronger tragic maybe many people are scared of exams but you don't have to be we are good yeah looks like something uh wrong was wrong with the time zone conversion so first of all you guys thank you for coming second of all we are in the middle of the process but don't worry jump in on mentee i will send a link again by the way we are done so join mendy answer questions and watch the beginning of this training in the and right answer was b and looks like this time it was easy for you so you guys did great let's take a look at the answer consider the following definition we see what restaurant reviews are uniquely identified by a combination of name city and reviewer that give us a hint what the primary key is going to be name city and review but which part going to be a partition part and which part is going to be clustering for we know what restaurant reviews are retrieved from table using combination of name and city that means what mostly probably name city is going to be the partition key because we always get them but it still can be just named for justin uh but now we know what table has multirow partitions that give us the information what reviewer will be different for the different roles first answer is b primary key partition kinemacity clustering kin review review now let's move on [Music] i'm going to give you a next question launching countdown [Music] question number six so consider the table definition and secure query pre-table teams name text primary key means integer losses integer ties integer so basically score of the teams how teams play select all from teams by wins where wins equals four you know what you cannot run this case statement over this table right because first of all names doesn't match and second of all as name text is a primary key you cannot query data by wins now we have to create a materialized view and which materialized view definition can be used to support the query option a claimed laser to use if not exist themes by means as a circle from team's primary key named vince second is the same but bean's name third is a little bit different and fourth is also a little bit different i will give you some time to think [Music] we have 10 seconds left five few seconds for you to make a decision and now you can see how it goes um let me check love to be beef let me check no it's green on my side so this time looks like it's on your story my site it's green rotary start helped sorry for position now time is over so let's see right answer is d not a not b not c but d it's quite a distribution of the answers today so let's take a look first thing primary key field cannot be null in the verb clause where clause must include a null check then creating materialized views it's very important but your life is used as kind a table so you cannot in table have a partition key clustering column viewer null so that's how it goes since we're clause and the select is based on bins vince must be the partition key first that's clear and second you need to check everything from no so b and c are technically correct from the point of view is not now is not now is not now it's all good but wins must be the partition key good so let me check one it looks green on my side people really like i can try to reconnect if everyone reports network issues but streaming software reports what we have very good connection with youtube so i doubt it will help [Music] started after the music was on okay let me switch off the music i doubt if it has anyhow ah if it anyhow stops us but okay i will switch off the music good so i hope now it's clear it has to be both is not now and twins must be the partition key because with very data using only wins now i'm starting countdown for the next question ah leaderboard okay let's see how it goes and looks like maverick is doing the best was it not a single mistake good job and zap is very close and i see some people who will make uh some use of our courses luckily they are free i see some real names already or at least youtube names already there it's good now i'm going to launch the next question question number seven and let's take a look at this question consider the table definition and the secure query great table restaurants by city name city cuisine price primary key will be of city and name select all from restaurants by city where city sydney and cuisine sushi now first thing you need to notice what we cannot execute this query on this table despite the name is correct and cte partition key specified cuisine is not a part of a primary key therefore we cannot query on that good so it means what we may create a secondary index what can be used to support the query uh so let's take a look which secondary index can be used to support this query and i see you are asking for many quiz so let me copy a link for you my nightbot is not configured for this session and i will switch i will switch back to question okay now looks like i am the nightbot now i am answering i am bringing the link when you ask so well let's move on i guess time is over and there are quite some options but not so many good answers only 6 out of 20 that's quite interesting let's take a look what was wrong first thing very simple b c d all are wrong because you can create indexes only on single column at once so you can have multiple different indexes it's okay but single index include only one column simple as that for those who just join it explain that yes you can totally go over again at a later time it won't be live of course but you can do it yes okay so next question i am launching countdown and let's switch question number eight which statement describes where clause in a query where clause must reference all the fields of a partition key b where clause must reference all the fields of the clustering key c where clause must reference all the fields of a primary key d where clause must reference all the fields of a partition key and clustering key so what do you think ph answer is right so which statement is correct only one is correct by the way if it's not obvious i will help you which statement describes the verb clause in a query correctly so let's see how you did we have few more seconds time is over and we see what most of you decided what the right answer is a and most of you were totally right let's take a look why where clause must reference all the fields of the partition key you don't ma you not must reference all the fields of the clustering key and you're not uh must under reference all the fields of the wall primary key that's not necessary what's really required is to reference all the fields of the partition key that's right okay so 16 people made the right answer that's a good job question number nine we are getting to the middle consider the following statements create type name first text last text create table people id name email primary key of id and email which insert statement can be used to insert a row in the people table this is the question on on udt knowledge uh udt as a user defined type and user defined type is something what you can create like we do here create type name of some values and you can insert it somehow into the database so how do you insert it into the database exactly half time is over let me see how are you doing how many answers nine answers already given ten answers already given that's good uh that's good uh i want to see now uh the results i want those results to be good and i'm all curious how you will make it so how it goes for us time is over five plus seconds and now we will see who is right and who is wrong so it's split nine on a nine on d and five and three answers on b and c let's take a look at the right answer right answer is a insert into people uuid then json then your email the story is fields of udt opposite using json it's very simple i believe most of you are more or less into web development at least that's uh very often happens at our workshops and you see how we assign the name name is fubar using json very simple last answer oh sorry uh just jason uh the answer is wrong because it's not jason and obviously this way is wrong because you will have three arguments expected but forgiven that's obviously an exception okay so how it goes on this side maverick sub skits very good job yeah this gets higher maverick keeps the first place with no mistakes i believe or maybe one um so skids familiar name i believe you attended to our workshops before and that's going to be question 10 so i'm launching the countdown and showing you the question consider the following sql statements grade table emails by user for username email description nickname with primary key of username and email notice the parentheses and when we insert some data emails by user doing two insert statements one update statement and then we select data so question is what is the result of executing those secure statements a b c or d not first we create table when we do two inserts when we do one update and when we do one select we select what it will show to us you have not so much time left maybe 10 seconds left on the exam it's not like that by the way you can choose the question now because we are using main tv stick to one question but on the real exam you can just switch the next one and then get back to this one uh later so it's done let's take a look at the right answer oops just a second right so take a look username is a partition key and email as a clustering column because humail is a clustering column the table has one partition with two rows nickname field is static so it will set to davey for the entire partition you must be uh i want to see the results actually by the way yeah only five people made it right it's quite hard question because you need to know how static field works and take a look how static field works here we set nickname as dave here we set nickname is dave when we do update check nickname davey for particular row username and email and you may think obviously what davey will be updated for one and only row but it's not like that static is uh means what uh all of the rows of this partition share the value of this uh column therefore when we do this update we get it daily for all of them so first it will have two rows because email is a clustering column that's obvious and second both of them will have nicknamed davey because nickname is a static column that's important to understand so i'm really curious about what not so many people made it but okay we explain it all well on our courses so you will be good now i'm launching the next question and let's see that it's architecture exams and the question is consider two data centers in this diagram tokyo dc has six nodes and two of them available and four of them are active and replication factor of three paris dc has four nodes one failed pre-active and replication factor of three what is a valid statement about a read request made at consistency level of local quorum which was received by coordinator node z in paris dc so our query at a consistency level of local quorum goes to coordinator node z in paris dc the replication factor free and one node is on fire maybe it was stolen by aliens maybe it's under because of shark attack well no things like that usually happen in the united states and paris must be quite more quiet place so request will be handled in data center paris dc and will fail requests will be handed in data center perisdc and will succeed requests will be retried in datacenter tokyodc and will fail request will be retried in datacenter tokyodc and will succeed that's a great question i just laid i just love it time is over so let's take a look on what's going on with answer right answer is b request will be handled in local data center in data center parentheses and it will succeed first let's decide why it will be executed at perisdc level because consistency of a local quorum and if a cardinator node primary if coordinator node for this query if query coordinator for which query is set in paris dc it means what paris dc is local to this query very simple so as a result it will be executed here now local quorum with consistency level 3 requires two nodes to be available out of three and one note is down but free are available that means what for every piece of data our data center is highly available and we can retrieve data in any moment of the time simple as that what's going on with the tokyo dc doesn't matter for us because tokyo dc is just [Music] ignore it in this case uh because it's going to be a local quorum for read right so we don't care if there are all servers a down or tokyo dc not available at one at all uh this query will be executed if a notice very important thing if two nodes will be down like x and w if two nodes are down will the answer be right or wrong 50 50 there is a chance it depends on which servers are replica servers for this piece of data we are requesting for example if x y and z are replica servers for the data we are requesting and x and w are down when we can get our data because we have two nodes out of three available replication factors free remember but if for example uh server y and w are down and data is replicated on y z and w that means what two servers out of three are not available and quorum will require two and we will have only one therefore we will get an exception desired consistency level cannot be reached in theory you can try to decrease consistency level to one and repeat with query but it may be a dangerous scenario because in this case you sacrifice your consistency for your high availability and for some kind of data it can be a perfectly valid scenario but for some kind of data you don't want to happen so in general uh rollback uh to get down is a bad idea now let's see how many of you made the right answer oh nearly everyone and i see xyz is asking code and code is on the screen one four nine six four eight zero six boom and i just pasted the link actually i did it last time when i was asked but doesn't matter so most of you made it looks like it was simple question good then let's start the next question maybe it will be harder for you question number 12. so here we go consider those secure traces at what elapsed time is the data persisted so what it will survive an unexpected note shut down 690 microseconds 1834 microseconds 2193 microseconds or 2966 microseconds those are cassandra looks on the uh node what received these requests and executing that and there is a time elapsed and there are some changes happening and the question is at what moment of a time the debt of data will be persisted so it will survive an unexpected note shutdown there are two okay i don't want to distract you i will shut up i will tell it to you uh in few moments when we will when you will answer this question already casey better answer in mentee don't give them uh suggestions maybe there are some people in doubt so don't give pins it's a test exam you won't help anyone anyway time is almost over time is almost over okay looks like time is over so let's take a look at what's going on mention not working for you oh i'm sorry usually it works okay happens so let's take a look right answer is c 2 1 9 3 microseconds because data is persisted on disk at the moment when it's appended to commit lock after that it can survive unexpected node shutdown so that's very important to understand it's not on time when request complete it's not on time and adding to mem table it's on moment appending to commit log data is persisted if your table is created with default settings because in theory you can create a table with persistent writes false and in this case correct answer would be d well actually not even d but on the flash time but it's going obviously uh to be a very bad idea uh if link link doesn't work okay just use the code when what i can say such a day nothing works it's monday no it's not monday and tuesday i thought it's monday like the rough day but tuesday it should be fine already okay now two very important things what will help you on the exam first notice that um you may need to scroll to see the entire trace that means what in some cases logs are so wide you have to scroll to the left or to the right not top top down to i mean people usually guess what you have to stroll talk down but also left right and top down as well that's the first thing you may need to scroll logs to find second one take a look in this case those locks are all from the same server in some cases you will see the logs from multiple servers those will have different ip addresses it's very easy to get lost on that because you may have for example queries getting to three different servers therefore you will have three different ip addresses so it's very easy to get lost so focus on at which time at which note something happens that's important it's a distributed system after all and you may be like okay distributed systems make things so hard that's right but you know what it's uh not for nothing it's for the power really powerful things always require some dedication when you learn things but when you will master it you will realize totally worth it good so how it goes most of you made it developer and administrator exam answer c most of you made it very good job and i'm launching the next question question number thirteen is replication factor configured in cassandra per cluster per key space per operation per node this question must be totally easy for you um i hope we let's all give a vote so we don't have to wait for 90 seconds if all participants vote when we don't have to wait till the very end of the time so if you know what's the right answer then give it if you don't know when just click a random button and so we will get our answer right now 30 seconds left if you didn't answer by now just click the random button seriously don't try to guess it's a test exam it's not your real exam you know you won't get certified if you give the right answers right now if you give the wrong answers also no consequences so it's a great time to practice 10 seconds left so time is up right answer is obviously b a replication factor is specified for key space of course of course so oops wrong button [Music] yep not for cluster because in cluster you may have multiple key spaces with the data of different importance for example same application can store some temporary data what you can afford losing but meanwhile some financial data you cannot afford losing of course you want to treat this data differently this data is of different priority so of course you want to be able to configure different replication factors for it so you configure replication factor picture key space and all the tables in this key space will share the um same setting but if we think cluster you can have key spaces of different replication factor from one to whatever you may want to have but usually we don't recommend to go higher than three or five in the worst case so what's on the leaderboard take a look looks like maverick did a mistake that's a surprise now maverick and sap are sharing the same score 11 right answers ah and bran the broken again share the uh third fourth place with 9 000 points and not a maverick has 8 000 points together with this good one right answer give you 1 000 points so well well well well well well let me start next questions next questions five questions going to be administrator questions i'm starting countdown and showing you the question what are two options for internet encryption in cassandra chose to please notice what that's an administrator exam so you won't get this answer or you won't get this question sorry if you are taking a developer exam but still better to know what are two options for internet encryption in cassandra client node rec enabled dc you have to pick two again if you all will give answers uh and uh in uh on our exam platform you can pick two answers but on main t you can pick only one so both right answers are marked as right and three uh not right a market is wrong of course so you will get you will get like voted already immediately after picking one don't worry if you made the right choice when you will be good you will be green you will get your points we have quite a competition here already quite a lot of people join it that's cool so what are two options for inter node encryption in cassandra client node rec let me see time is up and right answers will c and e and they gather it most of voice so looks like you did well let's take a look c is rec and e is dc because you can specify and set up inter node encryption at a rank level at data center level because it's inter node client never communicates in inter node mode because client is not a node inter node is communication only between multiple nodes not a client and obviously there is no um sense in the answer b because uh uh note accommodating communicating between each other not a note if itself kind of right so good very well done that's question number 15 let's see what's there which configuration file is used to set garbage collection properties for cassandra cassandra yama gvm options cassandra and sage gc dot options now notice this question is above this exam based on and these all story belongs to cassandra version 3.4 it may make difference in some scenarios but now we speak about cassandra version 3. which configuration file is used to set garbage collection properties for cassandra there are some options half of the time is done time flies so 10 seconds left i will show you the answers one more time but again don't try to guess if you don't know that's not your real exam just click any button it will save us some time time is up and right answer is b garbage collection setting belongs to java virtual machine so therefore it's configured in java virtual machine options uh it's not a feature or cassandra percent but gvm specific properties well well well we are getting close to the end next question still administrator exam consider the table definition and how a single row is stored on in one map table and two ss tables on a cassandra node create table test id test score mem table some data ss table some data and what's the current value for this row what are the current values for this rule looks like time is almost over here we have 10 seconds left 25 people voted already that's quite interesting what's the current value for this row that's actually great question how understanding of a right answer so what's the right answer right answer is b take a look first important thing to understand mem table and ss table ss table are persistent files on disk mem table is something in memory usually mem table holds the most up-to-date values and values on ss tables can be outdated and we have two ss tables one is older one is uh more new so in this case data for the row is different we see what in mem table we have id 11 timestamp score uh this one and different values then we query for both test and score so for the all data it's not a problem so cassandra will merge data from different things and it will go and compile we are looking for id id is 11 in all cases test and score and we have a score 75 in mem table usually that means what search is over we get score from the memo table we don't have to read anything from disk because them table is newer so we are good but for the test it may be different because a test may be indeed different and test will be vc test is not stored in mem table at all it's totally fine it means what it wasn't updated recently but when we have to read it from different ss tables and we see what there is a test english but here is the test math that means what at some moment test value was uh something maybe english maybe map and at some moment it changed so two different assess tables whole different values for this row how do we decide which one is uh right very simple based on the timestamp type stamp for test english and score 84 88 48 sorry is 1183 608 357 right and when we have test mark with timestamp one two blah blah blah i may not read any further because it's already clear what this timestamp is bigger than this one that means what this record is more young and as a result class right means visa sustainable is uh most up to date as a result id 11 test math score 75 right answer is b and now let me see most of you made it you are great like yes that's that's very good i'm launching next question car leaderboard okay i want to sleep with the leaderboard indeed okay uh very maverick and subholding the first sharing the first and second place with the same result 13 right answers brand with a very good result of 12 right answers ah and nothing baberic with 11 right answers and this with 10 right answers so now you see that knowing the basics the foundation foundations of all cassandra is not enough this exam requires you to really know some things but still this is an associate level exam so you don't have to be a professional expert you can see by the questions there is no really tricky questions really so i'm launching question number 17. what is a valid statement about a coordinator node handling a query at consistency level 3 a coordinator node sends direct direct read requests to all replicas coordinator node sends direct read requests to three replicas coordinator node sends a background read repair request to free replicas coordinator node sends a direct read request to one replica and the digest request to two replicas that's also a great question that requires understanding of how cassandra works and how well it's optimized yeah it's a good question i like it now i'm all curious about who will make it how many people will make it right what about the time left okay time is up and the right answer is d most of you uh decided between b and d let's take a look b coordinator note sends a direct request to a free replicas and the cardonator node sends a directory request to one replica and digest request to replicas take a look that's important cassandra is designed to handle huge data at a very very very very fast pace and it's not easy it requires a lot of internal optimizations one of my favorite is exactly this one by itself every row usually is not so big especially if you limit it right like select v-swiss and that and not trying to select everything asterisk but anyway when you are moving all those pieces of data all the time in a cluster it will consume a lot of network for output it will consume a lot of cpu a lot of other actuations so it's overall will be a huge pressure on the cluster and we want our cluster to be efficient then you make a read request so select something from something where blah blah blah and this request reaches uh one of the notes the note perfect very coordinator will send a direct read request to a single replica only single one and digest requests to two replicas digest is just like a hash and it's very small in comparison with data which sometimes can be quite huge and when you make a direct read request it gets values and digest and from to other replicas it gets only digests then it compares those digests if all three digests are free it means what all three nodes store the same value and we can safely return this value to a client right that's easy so that saves us a lot of effort not so a lot not so much for one single request but again don't forget netflix executes 30 millions queries per second in a single cluster and they have hundreds of clusters so 30 millions per second the result this minor optimization looks not so minor anymore right don't move data you don't have to move by the way what happens if digests don't watch we will initiate uh read read repair based on the fader digest comparison because some digest looks like don't match others so data is invalid and it may lead to a reading the wall values from the data from the node which has the most newest very newest value okay so a lot but really most of you made it and yeah uh thank you vinod yes rajiv you will get the recording same link just when the uh right is over so it's going to be question number 18 and we are very close to the end what is the valid statement about the write made at consistency level local quorum against the key space with replication factor of three coordinator node will send the right to one node coordinator node will send the right to two nodes coordinator node will send rights to three nodes coordinator node will send rights to all nodes we have key space table of key space with replication factor 3 and we made a write request at consistency level local quorum how many nodes will get a write request that's amazing question i think some of you will get into the trap because there is a trap time is almost over just few seconds left sorry yeah right so [Laughter] how interesting now you guys who gave answer b will love really hard so three persons gave the answer a 12 persons gave the answer b 12 persons gave answer c and one person gave the answer d let's take a look d coordinator node will send rights to all nodes come on people all nodes can be literally thousands of servers no server keeps not all the data of a cluster but only the range of this data otherwise your servers will soon explode when you handle petabytes of data within a cluster so no answer d is totally wrong now answer a is also totally wrong if we have replication factor of free that means what data needs to reach uh the all three servers all three replica servers responsible for your data answer c is right because write request will be sent to all three nodes now what's wrong with the answer b what nearly half of the audience voted for they were distracted by local quorum consistency level but notice what's the consistency level is really responsible for is it responsible for defining how many people store how many nodes store your data no no consistency level responsible to define responsible on the amount of acknowledge and acknowledges confirmations we get when we get the answer when data is stored so uh it does don't mean if you have replication factor or free and brighten the consistency level one it doesn't mean what your data will reach one and only one server of course not data will be stored to all replica servers to free servers but when a local quorum uh in this case means what we will wait for the confirmation for acknowledgments of the majority of a replica servers we have error free so replica servers free quorum will be two it mean way it made means we will wait for confirmations of two servers out of three but data will be stored on all of them and that was a pretty question right yes right acknowledgement we do for the acknowledgements not to uh define how many of the servers will store your data because replication factor defines how many servers will store your data not a local forum not a consistency level consistency level defines only acknowledgements okay i just love this question it's an amazing one good okay i explain it at all to you and that's going to be a leaderboard okay oh bran didn't make it okay soup has a clear soup is a clear leader now with 15 right answers maverick has 14 right answers a h and brown share the third place with 12 right answers not a maverick is on the fifth place with 11 ah okay not a maverick invest on the chair where fifth and sixth place good well we have two questions left and both of them are dedicated to data modeling but actually on the exam distribution is a little bit different so you will have more data modeling questions take it seriously you have to get ready it's not even about the exam it's about your real work because if you fail on the exam you just lost an attempt of your voucher and your voucher gives too but mistake with data mode link in production in the real world may be much more costly so focus on data modeling it's important question number 19 consider the chibotka diagram what captures physical data model for investment portfolio data given on the left side what is the primary key and clustering order of a table trades by sd trade is by a asg that matters in the end choose one of four those diagrams may look intimidating but but don't let them fool you they're actually very friendly and they have all the required information and to be successful with cassandra of course you need to know about connotation i will give you a hint on how do you handle this kind of questions what will really help you you don't need 90 seconds even 15 seconds should be enough if you know chiba connotation okay so what about time okay we are done hey right answer is d and most of you made a mistake let's take a look why mm-hmm i think now i know why so take a look first thing you need to know about those uh data modeling questions and what includes chibatko diagram uh first thing they are totally based on our learn data modeling by example i gave you a link in the beginning and these learn data modeling by example let me give you the link again because it's really um essential to get ready data modeling by example i will send you a link a lot of the questions are based on this so you better read through them to get ready for the exam when you will feel familiar because those um use cases like investment portfolio uh reuse it from where so it will heavily help you second so first get ready at data modeling by example second chibago diagrams for these uh use cases usually pretty big sometimes very big but question always as far as i remember uh features only one table out of maybe a dozen of tables so as a result we see here what we talked about table trades by a sd and we see no nope nope nope nope yes then you can simply drop all those uh tables ignore them and focus only on this one and now you don't try to handle a dozen of tables at once within 90 seconds but you need to handle only one it's not so big now it's much easier right uh second thing now why do we why do answer d is right let's take a look uh we see here what we have partition k c arrow c down arrow and that's for account symbol trade id uh these uh some of you know chabad connotations some of you don't uh you will learn it during getting ready uh for the exam but you see p means partition key c means clustering column c means clustering column obviously so partition key will be account symbol and trade id will be clustering columns that's clear now we have this account symbol trade account simple trade account trade symbol account trade symbol those three reverse two of wrong wrong order order matters now we have c and d with account symbol trade id account symbol trade id where account is a partition key and those two are clustering columns now why d is right and c is wrong the point is this arrow it describes uh the direction the sorting order ascending or descending and you see uh symbol is going to be ascending and trade id is going to be descending according to the row according to the arrow so we see what in c clustering order by define it in only by trait id descending but we need to define it for symbol as well because it's descending by default and we need to define uh define ascending explicit that's why answer d is right and looks like it was a hard question so many mistakes like those five people who gave the right answers you can be proud of yourself and people is going to be the last question so soon you will be able to relax consider the application workflow diagram for an investment portfolio application so same use case uh application workflow diagram data access patterns as described here which access patterns are evaluated before an application can evaluate a q32 only q1 q1 and q2 q1 and q3 q1 q3 and q3 q31 i believe most of you didn't attend data modeling by example before and therefore you don't know application workflow diagram it's fine we teach it to them but what really matters if you want to get your certificate if you want to become a certified nosql engineer if you want to be successful with cassandra you must get you must attend data modeling methodology the data modeling course on the academy.datas.com it's free it's called ds220 data modeling for apache cassandra and that's an absolute must for a developer who is going to work with cassandra v not cuckoo uh expects it's to be a i'm not totally sure okay time is out and what's going to be the right answer right answer is a v naught is totally right c is wrong but a lot of people vote for it and b d are also wrong first let's see what's wrong with b and d not sorry and c yes what's wrong with b and d take a look applique one of the important features of application workflow diagram are dependencies of their actions dependencies of the queries in this case we are going to execute query 3.2 query 3.2 means find all trades for an account and date range order by trade date descending and we need to identify the dependencies which queries must be executed beforehand so we will be able to execute query uh afterwards to execute query 32 we have to find all trades for an account and date range order by 28 we already need to know an account id that means what we need to know the account number and to know account number we must show investment accounts of a user but do we have to show uh all positions in an account no of course not so answer b is wrong we do not have to execute q2 in order to execute q3 you see they are in parallel we don't they are not a dependency of each other they both depend on q1 then answer d is wrong because free one is not a prerequisite for free too they are kind of sub requests they uh q31 is not a dependency for free to it's fine d is wrong now a and c a lot of people say c but actually answer is a q1 or q1 and q3 the point is to execute any query of the q3 range three one three two three three three four five five we need to know what all trades for an account all trades for an account and date range but we know date range uh from the customer using the web interface or user interface of the application so it's not a query to a database account date range and transaction type okay account date range blah blah blah blah blah in general the crucial thing for free too is just an account and date range and date range is given by the application as a result we need to know online account and we learn account in q1 so for q32 the only dependency is a query q1 if we didn't execute q1 we cannot execute 32 but first q1 when q32 that's what makes the right answer a final leaderboard who is the winner today oh oh okay there are some changes so sap made it to be number one over today's training exam with 16 right answers very well maverick has 15 ah invests by 13 braun and nothing maverick 12 aveking 10 right answers and arturo samitha and camille 9 write answers now what does that mean each correct answer was 1 000 points the rap made 20 questions on the exam uh passing rate is 70 percent if it were a real test you would need 40 000 points to pass so people who made it to 14 000 basically uh maverick and sup uh there wait a second oh okay yes maverick and sub are close to make it on the exam close but still i have something to learn okay uh well can you share please exact course for data mode link you have referred before the only thing you need to be referent is the academy datastax.com and then you have to pick proper learning path developer or administrator and develop data mode link is a part of a developer path you will find it there a quick survey to help us we would love your feedback to make it better next time what did you like the most uh what should we improve for the future workshops i will keep it open uh so other negative marking in real exam no thank you westcom uh thank you again thank you for coming it is for winners not today because this is a training and you will win your certificate which will make your better job position better salary and that's a real swag when you can use forum we are done for today i will be happy to answer your questions on discord chat also i will be happy to find you and feel free to contact me on linkedin i'm pasting the link to myself right now a question from rajib is updating few columns versus inserting all columns better considering cassandra's column oriented in general from the performance point of view there should be no real difference because first it goes uh to mem table and for ss for uh okay first it goes to commit lock for commit lock there should be no principal difference as long as you don't use old hard disk drives there should be no difference for mem table there also should be not so big difference in general if you're updating particular columns you of course have to specify particular columns so from the top stones point of view um you see um tops inserts do not produce stomp stones the leads produce stomp stones so if you update part of the data it doesn't create top stones it's partially relates to the thing to a question we've seen today with reading from two essays tables and one table there will be no tom stones because inserts create no top stones thumbstones are created only by the leads any more questions we are a little bit overtime thank you everyone for coming you did a great job i'm very proud of you and sorry so much for the issues with the network or whatever was it how will we get vouchers for the exam very easy you go to the academy.datastarts.com link is above and you take your learning path as soon as it's over you write an email to the academy and you will get your let me scroll them that's a good question so i want to repeat how do you get your voucher we are almost there yes so when you get to the academy the datastax.com you choose a learning path for administrator and developer if you can decide i recommend first to take developer mostly because of the data modeling is included developer learning path includes ds 101 to 1 to 20 and 220 is data modeling you can do and i actually recommend you to do both learning paths uh one voucher will be enough because one voucher gives you two attempts so mostly probably it will be enough for you if you learn hard you will be able to get two certificates from one voucher and that's quite cool xyz asks great question is cassandra similar to bigtable on gcp google cloud answer is yes they share the same idea so the same principles bigtable is very similar to cassandra because cassandra was created earlier what's the difference between cassandra and bigtable bigtable is proprietary and bigtable is available only on google cloud if you run your project on bigtable and at the moment you are not happy with support or vic prices you can not migrate anywhere migrating will require you to completely rework your database and rework the application what works with this database why because it's so called vendor locked in bigtable exists as a proprietary system only on google cloud take it or leave it apache cassandra is platform agnostic open source that means what is developed by a community you have full access to a source code of the cassandra you can compile it yourself if you want to you can run it everywhere you can use it on a google cloud platform as you could use big table too but take a look if at some point you are not happy with the prices what you can do just create let's say amazon web services or microsoft editor give you better price uh significantly better price so you can save a lot of money uh for example uh then samsung moved their user services from oracle to another database they decrease it their prior their expenses on the database uh basically around 40 persons 40 persons that was huge stockpile of money so let's say you are not satisfied with the prices on gcp and you have your database running on gcp but not in bigtable uh but in cassandra what do you do next you get the prices for azure from aws from ali cloud whatever fits your needs the most you decide what microsoft azure gives you the best price so you spawn data center there link it to the data center on gcp build a single cluster out of that cassandra automatically migrates the data you need there and after that you just take down the commission your data from the gcp you decommission the servers data is migrated now you are on azure and it may take just a few days to migrate so with cassandra there is no vendor logged in it's an open source project what is platform a platform agnostic cloud agnostic that's what i really like like you have the control over your data not some cloud provider before my respect to google cloud by the way i'm a certified google cloud architect and i actually like working with google cloud but what i like the more much more is freedom freedom to decide which platform to use cassandra gives you this freedom is the voucher for the exam free for this workshop attendees voucher for exam are not for the workshop attendees but you get your voucher then you complete a learning path on the academy it is free uh thank you pankaj uh thank you thank you raja ram yeah i did my best to make it interesting can we do both learning paths yes you can thank you very much kumar thank you for coming uh voucher is uh not for the workshop attendees but for those who will complete the learning path but seriously there is no difference if you don't complete learning path you don't you cannot pass the exam and therefore that makes no sense for you to get voucher now you will get your voucher on time when you complete learning stuff and if anything happens i just pasted the link to my own account alex so if anything goes wrong reach me in person on linkedin and i will make that happen so don't worry how long the voucher is valid voucher is valid for three months if i'm not wrong but there is a secret again you are the best you attended this session and stay till the end so i will tell you the secret voucher per se is valid only three months but using this voucher you can schedule exam afterwards voucher is used it's credited to your account and now you can schedule exam nearly on any moment in the future so there is no expiration date as far as i remember as long as the exam is available but i do not recommend you to wait for too long we i'm not sure how long it all will stay free because well data stocks is happy to spawn service but both creation of the courses uh supporting of exam it's all not cheap actually so don't take it as a free exam and free education it's not free it's sponsored by data stacks by us and you better use it sooner than later i would say hey love to be weave yeah sorry for streaming issues i'm very sorry it's not a real exam so not a disaster i'm happy what you made it with a very good score so looks like no more questions that means what we had done for today thank you so much for coming and the last slide i wanted to show is you are the winner go learn go past this exam and that's going to be a my amazing time working together on the same project have a great day have a great week and see you later now a little bit of music for you to relax after this hard work [Music] on the same page [Music] [Music] hey [Music] you",
