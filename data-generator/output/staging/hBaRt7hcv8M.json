day uh i love all of our cassandra days yeah and so this is the beginning of cassandra day australia new zealand welcome everyone it's going to be a long day a fun day we already have a lot of visitors that's amazing thank you okay very good yes so let me check a couple of things before we start uh if you can see us if you can hear us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so we will know we can start and technical checks yes some technical checks uh sound looks good streaming looks good looks like we are connected well yes hi david thanks for the thank you david yeah that's great so we are going to cover a lot of interesting things today so let's not wait and start welcome to cassandra day australia in new zealand cassandra days a series of events we run worldwide to help community of apache cassandra and related technologies grow and to help you be better in your skills as developers software engineers administrators devops engineers whatever you are doing whatever you are doing mostly probably you need to have some databases running behind and today we want to introduce you or upgrade your skills with one of the most powerful databases in the world and as you could guess that's going to be apache cassandra so cassandra is a very great database cassandra is used by famous companies all across the world originally developed on facebook to solve facebook size problems now it's the top level of apache foundation apache software foundation non-profit non-commercial open source software foundation it's a distributed decentralized nosql database that's a very special database which can give you a lot of power but with a lot of power comes great responsibility okay so why do companies over world choose cassandra cassandra is big data already cassandra is ready to handle any amounts of information you want to give it and to be a data driven company you need to have a lot of data and cassandra delivers highest level of availability because of this distributed decentralized nature linear scalability geographical distribution high a very high read write performance well read performance is not a surprise for many of the databases but how cassandra scales for right it's one of the best features and it's vendor independent as said it's guided its development guided by apache software foundation uh who uses apache cassandra there is a long list of the names and you definitely know some of them netflix apple instagram alibaba huawei tencent and so on and so forth there are many users for apache cassandra and mostly probably you already using it as a customer so far or maybe already as an experienced developer we will see why cassandra first of all because of the ability to scale out and handle problems of any size of any performance requirements of any volume requirements so speaking of volume and velocity it's like one of the databases what is very hard to beat apple apple reported it's already at data stocks accelerate conference what it has over 160 000 dedicated apache cassandra instances with hundreds of petabytes stored handling multiple million operations per second and for netflix those numbers are also very interesting because we run dozens thousands of servers having only on a single one of the clusters where you have multiple clusters over 30 million operations per second and that's a single cluster that's an incredible number so like those are going to be very hard to beat for today we will have two rooms first room is more focused for the beginners those who only start working with apache cassandra or desire to start and second room with talks for a little bit more advanced people who already have cassandra experience so we can suggest what to do next this is the workshop room so if you are watching me right now when you are in the workshop room and that's what's going to happen today first let's welcome an introduction going on right now next will be a very interesting keynote by aaron morton field cto at datastax and how it's about how data is eating the world and moving to the clouds it's a very interesting one i'm not going to miss it in no way and i suggest you take a look at it because well there are many interesting things happening with dayton right now next one will be workshop cassandra fundamentals step by step we walk through the principal uh cassandra features and we get into um how do you use it why do you use it this way not that way and how to work with cassandra in the right way also it's a hands-on workshop so you are going to stretch your fingers and click some buttons and that is great because everything without practice is just that knowledge you have to push the buttons when after short break we will play the game not like the squid game but still with some prizes but no depths so our game is much better no penalties yeah yeah yeah um so we ask questions you answer if you do it uh fast enough and if you give right answers you don't get punished no i'm kidding you get the prizes so then after that a very special workshop which has a very special place in my heart data modeling with cassandra led by stefano latini the cassandra power is incredible but if you make a mistake with the data model you are going to misuse it and you cannot get all the beauty of this database on your production clusters so it's very important to have data model done right and stephanie will teach you how do you do that and then we have asked me anything session with cassandra experts so very much recommended to ask your questions by the way we are collecting your questions uh during the sessions and please ask questions not only on youtube chat but also following the link stefano could you please done ah thank you so much ask questions uh using this link because for the top rated questions or best questions speak by our experts you will get price again and then finally application development with cassandra uh done i believe by stephanie right yes okay that's right so you're going to be a busy guy today you too good uh and then in the end closing words and goodbye but that's not it because we have second room so talk room uh we will have what's new in apache cassandra version four cassandra community recently did a huge job delivering cassandra version for the tremendous numbers of improvements fixes new features and so on and so forth yoshikimoto will uh show what's new in apache cassandra version 4 what are the most interesting and promising features why you should consider switching to cassandra version 4 right now already then paul bremner from instacluster goes for massively scalable real-time spatial anomaly detection with apache cassandra paul is a great expert and that is very interesting use case you want to take a look at then after break there will be kate sandra or apache cassandra on kubernetes with some steroids by jonathan then later stargate dot io open source api layer for your apache cassandra how to get more of your cassandra installation with a couple of clicks very interesting and finally apache cassandra certification program by datastax if you don't know mostly probably you don't apache cassandra certification is a sponsored program by data stacks so it's not free it's not free but we sponsor your education 100 with free online courses and this event of course and in the end with a voucher for the exam and normal exam price is like 150 dollars united states dollars but with data stocks uh sponsorship you can get this exam for free and you can join the community already as a skillet engineer so i will explain that how do you get ready for cassandra certification what do you need what you need to learn where do you need to learn it and then how do you pass the certification special place we will have a demo exam not the real one sorry but we will have a demo exam right during the um this talk so you will see if you are ready already or if you do if you aren't ready and you have to learn more uh and that's it for talkroom yeah alex may i interrupt you for one thing um we express all times here in this time zone in in this table in this agenda for today we express all times in in the you see in the aest time zone which might be maybe not the best choice but uh which means that so they pay attention to the time uh you see on on on the table here because that's maybe you have to do some conversion yep uh you see as cassandra and this series of events was organized by people in europe far far away so i'm afraid it was our mistake to use this aes team uh but we have what we have so we proceed with this schedule i hope yep let's move on then uh so highlights for the prizes let's play a game cassandra quiz but you don't have to be an expert just attend our first session that will be enough if you're a quick learner and then ask me anything sessions don't forget to submit your questions at datastax.iocdnzqa like link is here and link is in the chat i believe already and for certification voucher or astro credit if you are already certified then you can go to cdanz voucher then this event is organized and sponsored by datastax developers and our goal is to connect every developer in the world to a power of apache cassandra but actually i think our goal is a little bit wider because that's not enough to connect every developer in the world to a power of apache cassandra it's not as too light um so you have to invest some time into your own education and we help you to be skilled enough not to fail but to succeed so alex evolution of stefano latini developer advocates at data stacks and a huge work also done by our apac da team jeremy hanna new rash naidu yoshikomoto and many other people supporting and baking this event and many thanks to all of them but first of all to you for joining practical remarks today content will remain available on youtube channel it's recorded and you can refer to it later there are some links you will need and you can always ask for them on youtube chat don't forget especially asking questions don't forget your name because we otherwise won't be able to connect with you for them prizes if you ask the best questions from our point of view and reach out us on discord youtube chat will be gone forever as stream is over but discord server will stay and you can communicate with us there at datastax.ioslash discord so if you are using this course we will be happy to connect with you there see you at quiz session and 1 13 you get a page if you complete the exercises and get the cassandra fundamentals introduction to cassandra workshop page and bragging rights of course it's not the certification like a certification certification but it's already something you need to attend more than one workshop to get the certification okay uh vouchers for the certification exam already mentioned don't forget to grab your following listing and enjoy your day now we are switching for a moment to bring aaron morton on the screen with his talk about the data how is it hitting the world and why it's going to the cloud that's going to be a lot of interesting hi see you in a moment [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay thank you hey um good morning everyone good afternoon i am just make sure i'm in the right training there i'm coming to you from sunny wellington today and i'm going to talk about why i think data is eating the world and it's moving to the clouds and what that means for developers and engineers and your career before we do that a little bit about myself i'm from country victoria i grew up there went to uni in melbourne um in my mid-20s packed a bag and went to london lived there for nine years packed bag and moved to wellington and i've been here for 12 years now i started using apache cassandra at version in my committer on cassandra i'm on the project management committee and i work data stacks as field cto looking at how our customers can be successful with our technology so for today's story we are going to go all the way back to 2011. and this is coincidentally when i started being full-time on cassandra so way back in 2011 the top movies of the day where we saw uh captain america the first avenger hangover and you know and uh harry potter it was a long time ago but also in that year there was a influential blog post from mark andrews entitled why software is eating the world now there was a really good blog post that made the case that software-based companies would take over the economy that being software companies they would be better able to scale delight their customers create new competitive advantages and all of this would lead to high growth and high valuations i think it's been pretty obviously proved over the last 10 years that this was true this was something that has happened we're going to look through this blog post but with a little bit of a different slant on it we're going to look at the valuations and the growth of some of the companies that he mentions and understand their data use because this sentence really stuck out at me so we're in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large sways of the economy well we're here because we care about data that's our thing so in 10 years time will this statement also be true we're in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which data driven companies are poised to take over large sways of the economy so let's go through the post some of the examples that were in there and understand what's happening today with these companies so why is this happening now why can i now say that data is taking over the world well mark had a few reasons 10 years ago number one and this one actually made me laugh which was he said that software finally works which kind of started to do back in 2011 and can be widely delivered at scale well i'd say now this is true for data and for the data tools that we have and they're ubiquitous back in the in 2010 we had the summer of nosql where projects like cassandra react all started to burst out on the scene in the open source world and we moved away from the legacy data incumbent providers who slowed us down we now have 4.6 billion people using the internet that's up from 2 billion in 2011 that's 60 percent of the world's population but of that 4.32 billion access the internet on mobile 90 something percent now weirdly enough as i was going through this post uh back in 2011 mark predicted that five billion people would have mobile access to the internet and we're at four point three uh by in 10 years so we're at 4.3 now so i think that was a pretty good prediction and lastly the cloud is now here for data the cloud drove down the cost of running stateless works loads workloads and made it more agile you could just run your workload without having to go through provisioning well we're doing that now for stateful workloads the separation of compute and storage in analytical projects like snowflake databricks and in that transactional projects like datastax astra dynamodb and some and microsoft products makes consumption-based pricing more attractive that makes it easy to get started on a small scale which is what cloud computing did for startups and it makes it possible for large enterprises to collect lots of data without having to pay for the compute services if they're not using so let's look at some of the examples that we had netflix pretty easy one originally you know they they crushed blockbuster and then they went after the traditional enterprise the traditional entertainment such as comcast etc so in the last 10 years the netflix capitalization has grown from 160 uh sorry 11 billion to 276 billion 2 000 and something percent growth the type of data they collect is not just what you watch the time in the show but the device you're on how much you're pausing do you come back and resume and how much later how long does it take you to finish watching a show do you repeat particular scenes and watch them again and again and all of this viewer data is used to make recommendations and over 75 of the viewer activity on netflix is based off personalized recommendations more than that this is understanding users is core to what they do in their published long-term view for investors they say by personalizing promotion of the right content to the right member we have a large proportion we have a large opportunity to promote our original content one that is one that's effective and unlimited in duration i think there's two things to unpack here they know what to make and they know who will like it for a house of cards for example they made 10 different trailers and then would show people the one that they thought would resonate the most with them where you like you know certain types of characters certain ways that films were made on the spotify and the company that i know very well netflix and spotify coincidentally were early and continued users of apache cassandra they used it to power their growth over the last 10 years so netflix grew over those 10 years from 1 million paid subscribers to 158 million it's 356 million total users now and the data they collect is a lot like netflix skips and listens and play accounts and things like that and then there's a lot of technology with that data that goes into creating their discover playlist they build a taste profile for every user they look at the songs and the taste that they have and they look at songs that appear in other users playlists and there's billions of those now use those bring those together and generate these discover playlists that you get on a monday and then the first year that they were created they generated five billion streams so we looked at two major parts of two of the biggest most ubiquitous companies that we have at the moment netflix and spotify they're all driven by the data they collect and their ability to process that and then use that let's try to understand the pattern that they're following this is my pathway to to a data-driven enterprise number one instrumented every customer interaction and business process how long do they go back and play that scene again and again they'll know that and they'll know that there are scenes that people react to next let's look at zynga um well not really let's look at fortnight because zinger's still around that fortnight's a bit more interesting uh and there's zinger and rovio were in the original article they're still around but fortnight's more interesting so they have 350 million registered users they've hit a peak in december last year of 15.3 million concurrent users and at a recent aws event they said they collect up to 125 million events per minute on the way that pit players are playing in the game so this is how you play how you interact with things which other players you interact with you just run around in circles and jump up and down i've played fortnite a few times with my kids but not a whole lot and i just run around in circles and jump up up and down that's my thing they take all this and use that to drive the player matching for the battle royale teams but they also use it to understand how to make changes in the gameplay the game updates quite a lot the features and the interactions and the gameplay is driven by the way the players interact with it by collecting this huge amount of data and the natural extension of this was how they built ai bots in the game so in the same way that tesla collected a lot of data about driving and use that to build ai for driving fortnite have collected a lot of data about how players play and built ai bots and then they released them last year i think it was and players started to think that they were surprised that they were doing so much better because they thought they were playing against humans but they're really just bad ai and they kept on winning they're building a metaverse and using the data about how they interact but how we interact with the game to drive that forward another use case here linkedin growth again 131 million users up to 740 million users and 555 million companies have their data in linkedin they collect an enormous amount of data if you don't know linkedin is where kafka came from so they rely on kafka a lot at seven trillion messages a day running through kafka and this is things like the impressions clicks reactions and comments and shares and follows and all of the type of stuff that you do on linkedin now that it's become a lot more of a social network and that data drives for large areas it has the people you may know your news feed skills and recommendations and the jobs you may be interested in and linkedin have said that 50 of engagement comes from jobs you may be interested in and then they give us some clues that say hey this is how you want to actually have a better experience they say that you should write a good bio get more skills endorsements order them appropriately make quality endorsements to other people get lots of connections to utilize network effects so what they're saying is you have to if you want a better experience we need data this is a data driven experience so what both of these companies are doing is collecting data on what happens and how that's an order of magnitude more once they've instrumented every process and they're not just looking at the outcome of watching the tv show they're looking or playing the game they're looking at how i went about doing it on the instagram i'm going to use instagram as a stand-in for flickr flickr's still around but instagram was uh but instagram again a bit more interesting a bit more data-driven so they have a billion monthly users and half a billion daily users and they collect all the information in the patent that we've just discussed how long do they spend on something how do they engage with it by follows and likes and comments and saves around different media that they have photos videos stories and live and they collect this huge amount of data and from that they drive an ai platform that makes 90 million model predictions every second for their explore section this is actually taken from the instagram engineering blog about how they power the explore section and half of their monthly users visit the explore section now they're using weak ai so this is not terminator ai this is weak ai that's just making next best recommendations it's saying if you like this you like that sort of thing but in a lot more complexity if you go to the instagram engineering blog you'll see the level of complexity they use there to drive that through so what are these guys they're analyzing all that data and unlocking behaviors to drive next best actions using weak ai lastly starbucks so in the article it talks around oh i'm buying a coffee doesn't mention starbucks in particular but starbucks is a data driven company i think it's important to understand this so the market cap again has grown like everyone else's they have 90 million sales a week worldwide they have 13 million active app users and so they know what people are buying when and how and where what's going on at the point that they're buying that so then that drives recommendations if you walk into the store and it's a new store you've never been in they might be something specific and that'll pop up on the app and tell you this store has something new that you've not seen or if you're going into your regular store the order the order might be placed and they know that the baristas there know you and they'll get it ready for you so their data is driving their customer experiences for 13 million active app users and then they're making recommendations based on the time uh whether the location is there a holiday in your city what was your past buying experience particularly the weather one they talk about well when it gets hot they'll promote the right type of drink for that area they don't just use it for the customer experience they use it for the business experiences decisions about store locations and menu items and where to actually place their stores and when how to do real-time discounts everything at starbucks is data-driven experience the whole experience there so that we can complete our pattern here step one we've seen that companies are instrumenting every customer interaction and business process step two they're collecting data on what happens and how it happens step three they're analyzing their data to unlock behaviors and drive next best actions and step four they're using the next best actions to create fast relevant and personalized experiences and processes i may just go into there's only one starbucks in wellington by the way so it doesn't this story doesn't work too well for me um but i may go into a starbucks and most of the time i'm just the type of guy who gets the same thing all the time but if i go in and i've got the app there and i'm uh keen to look around they'll have the promotions there for me that they think i could be best suited to to get so we've seen here is data is crucial to every company that's been successful at these large scales and it's growing faster than most other areas of i.t we're going to look at some evidence for that and what it means for developers and that it's moving into the cloud idz predict uh you know not predicted sorry idc estimated that in 2020 we generated six point uh 64.2 zettabytes that's 64.2 billion terabytes of data that was created or replicated nice that they put that in there because you want to replicate it around the world and that's growing at 23 compound annually through to 2025. there is huge data growth because companies need data to be successful why do they need data to be successful what is it that they're doing here well data beats logic uh this is pretty clear these companies that are hugely successful their experiences are driven by understanding the data data driven experiences drive engagement and they capture users and where is this data going where does it belong it belongs in the clouds and i put plural there for clouds because there are public and private clouds and there are core and edge clouds and we're going to see more of the core and edge clouds over the next 5-10 years as 5g really takes hold and we're going to see as kubernetes becomes even more dominant that the idea of being able to move workloads both compute and and stateless between public and private and across clouds in a hybrid multi-cloud environment just going to become the standard way we do things so i said that that workload that data was moving into public clouds this is from the flexera 2021 state of the cloud report half of enterprises have workloads on the public cloud and half of enterprises have data on the public cloud today half of enterprises are also considering moving sensitive data onto the public cloud as the security concerns have been overcome and dealt with and that it's accepted that this is where you need to be to get access to the technology and the scale to actually execute on your business strategy so what does this mean for you the developer or the engineer or the architect or whatever it is what advice can i give on that you need to invest your precious time in a few areas kubernetes because data belongs on kubernetes you will if you're not now you will be running things like cassandra on kubernetes on-prem may run your own kubernetes on a public cloud and then run cassandra in it or you may be running it on like an elastic elastic kubernetes service or you're using a service that's built on kubernetes but we are at the point where the data workloads work really well we have recently had a customer um there's a webinar coming up that i did with the cto of barracuda where he moved on to datastax astra and only had one to two milliseconds difference in latency between their hand managed highly tuned on-prem cassandra and running on astra and astros are running on kubernetes apis i was around when cassandra had a thrift api and then we worked out that was really um not as great as it was we thought it was going to be we added the cql the cassandra query language api and that's a great language and it has become standard for nosql databases with it being picked up by microsoft and amazon and a couple of other vendors who use it as a standard language but multiple apis so developers can talk to databases in the way that suits their most and integrates into their application stack the best is the way forward apis and gateways allow us to put more business rules and logic between the client and the database and graphql i think is one of the most exciting things we've got in tech at the moment it is an awesome language you should have a look at it support it with astra understand what serverless and the separation of compute storage means for you does it mean that you can go and experiment really easily because you can only pay for the operations and the data that you store without having to provision three servers or six servers to get started or if you're a large organization what does it mean if you can collect a lot of data and store it and not have to pay that much overhead you don't have to pay for all of the servers if you're putting it in a traditional distributed database and then understand event-driven architectures and streaming and technology like kafka and pulsar if we're in a micro service world we've got a lot of microservices with dedicated databases behind them how do we get that data out of there to drive this pattern that we've seen so that the data that's happened that's been captured in one system can be taken to another merged in with other things analyzed and then you can take the results of that analysis and feed it back into the system of engagement we're going to feed data between system engagement system of record and system of analysis i think those are the four great areas of the next year and i think these are also great areas that you're going to hear about today you're going to hear about kate sandra which is center on kubernetes you're going to hear about apis which is stargate and you're going to hear about serverless which is astra and then and if you look at datastax you'll see some stuff on the apache pulsar as well called astra stream that'll all come together for you so thank you for your time today uh i hope you get to learn a lot of interesting things as you're going through the workshops or the other talks today [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good hey looks like we are back again hey there and that looks amazing i see all the streaming settings are good and you can hear us and you can see us and that makes me absolutely happy so we can go on we have to cover a lot of very important things today meanwhile yoshikimoto started already in the second room with what's new in cassandra version 4 what's uh what are the new features improvements and important things deliberate in the version 4. but we start with cassandra fundamentals if you are cassandra beginner but still interested in the upgrades of the recent version then we suggest you first to join this workshop and then watch the recording of cassandra version 4 and actually we have even a dedicated short course on cassandra version 4 at datastax.com so there is also a lot of interesting and useful information for those who want to upgrade to version 4. but whatever we have to start so let me check if everything is good looks like everything is good let's start then thank you for joining and we are going into wonderful voyage welcome [Music] so cassandra fundamentals uh led by me with the great help of stefano lattini i am a developer advocate leader datastax apache cassandra expert athlete educator architect one of the cassandra days organizers and a big fan of open source software so cassandra nosql distributed decentralized database management system every word in this definition is very important and soon you will see why main features are people picking cassandra are it's ready for date of any size it's a incredible level of read write performance its scalability what really matters highest availability self-healing and automation of automation things geographical distribution platform agnosticism i will explain in a moment and vendor independent uh as a great feature for and database so what does that all mean first big data ready cassandra is partitioned and distributed that means that this database is capable to handle data of any size and we mean like petabyte scale apache uh sorry apple uses cassandra to handle hundreds petabytes of data and there are companies would have even higher numbers in that so need more volume add more nodes as long as your data model is good so don't miss the second workshop done by stefano later on today read bright performance every single cassandra note is highly performant but a cluster consisting of multiple nodes and data centers brings through output to the very next level decentralization so masterless architecture means what every node is able to deal with any request read or write so there is no things like passive notes or read-only notes every note is ready to deal with any request is it read or write any of them even if there are thousands of them linear scalability for volume or for velocity for output there are no limitations you need more add more nodes linear is a highly important word like very very very very important there is no overhead on new nodes it scales with your need that means what like with many uh other databases scaling out adding more nodes means what you also uh have some decreased improvement and in the end because of the overhead you can add more and more and more nodes but the performance boost won't be the same uh cassandra scales linearly there were a great research by netflix which did an in scaling cassandra cluster from around 50 to up to 300 nodes to handle 1 million of queries per second and they basically did a great job by the way if you are not subscribed to their netflix tech blog it's just incredible it's for me always a fun source of very interesting data on how netflix runs their infrastructure so but take a look here on this bottom line we have number of servers here we have amount of operations and replication factor 3 which we'll discuss later take a look at this nice straight line isn't that amazing what really matters for me is what this line is not degrade in the end it goes straight and that's a very very very cool feature with one little uh mark it requires proper data model yes stefano i again refer to your workshop in a couple of hours so let's go it'll be fun definitely and a lot of oh yeah so pizza highest availability replication decentralization and topology aware placement data placement take care of possible down times there is no single point of failures because there are no master nodes there are always live multiple multiple life replicas network topology where data placement is important because cassandra consciously puts the data replicas as far from away from each hour as possible to keep not keep all the x in one bucket so to spread them over multiple uh data to the multiple server racks or availability zones if you run in a cluster and also on the client side with drivers it's also very smart for smart reconnection and strong retry mechanisms so basically then you run a multi multi-dc deployment with three data centers with replication factor free per data center you are going to have overall nine copies of the data and that means what you can afford losing a lot of servers still being highly available and dispatching your answers and storing your data successfully so when i say usually we say high availability for cassandra i say highest self-healing and automation can you imagine manual operations on top of the thousands and thousands and a thousand servers when you have to do everything on your own that is not going to be fun cassandra supports a high level of automation for operations and self-healing which is very important uh for the many many scenarios we will partially cover today but this workshop is more for developers so we focus more on development with cassandra geographical distribution so okay there is a cassandra trademark multi-data center deployments granting you a great capabilities to first keep your data close to your clients because your clients don't love to wait they love to have everything immediately and if you are too slow and boring we will just switch to your competitors which is not nice to you so let's keep your data close to your clients so they can get their answers immediately but also meanwhile we are getting disaster tolerance not just fall tolerance but real disaster tolerance when one of the data centers in united states for example may be stolen by aliens and other data centers still will be available i don't know why united states one is stolen but there is always something happening so all dc's are active there is no thing like read only or pacifying cassandra all data centers are active now platform agnostic cassandra is not bound to any platform or service provider helping you build multi-cloud hybrid cloud solutions and migrate from one platform to another if you feel so there are some great databases it on the same ideas as cassandra for example google cloud bigtable it's a good database but with bigtable you are bound to google cloud and you basically have no straight way to migrate to any way if you are not happy with google anymore and kassadin is platform agnostic you can have multiple data centers of the same very same cluster working with different uh cloud providers so your your database will be multi-cloud or even hybrid cloud simultaneously with some of data stored on your own data center or because of some legal reasons reasons and others will be on multiple platforms and that's perfectly fine for cassandra cassandra is free and not bound to any kind of a service provider and also very important for me capacitor is vendor independent it was originally created by facebook but then contributed to apache software foundation um you definitely know this organization already or at least use its product even if you don't know what that does that mean apache hadoop apache spark apache kafka apache zookeeper and many other projects people are using worldwide white are all guided and collaborated by apache software foundation and companies participating in their development but there is no vendor lock and vendor dependency on apache cassandra it's because apache software foundation is a non-profit open source community so how it all works first of all first everything we have to understand data is distributed what does that mean that means what if we split data into parts into partitions then you create a table by the way take a look at the screen you can read and you can understand this statement that's it you just learned the cassandra query language at least uh significant part of it cassandra query language is designed to be very similar to sql so you can easily get it don't make a mistake cassandra is different to sql databases and you still have to learn a lot of things but community did a great job making it easier to learn so when we create a table we must define so called partition key here we see it's the first argument in the primary key statement it's going to be a partition key in this case we create table users by city and city will be this partitioning key what does that mean take a look uh you use it to the situation then you have um database i don't know whatever relational database you have with the table then all of the all the tables you have are copied to each and every server like traditional approach it sounds good and it works perfectly on small to medium data sizes but then your data starts to grow you get into troubles because basically there are some issues of precise and then you have more and more data they simply don't beat and in this case we go for partitioning take a look at the table on the right population by city by country for example united states new york eight millions numbers approximate [Music] doesn't matter so how does this store we stable uh within distributed cluster very easy we keep parts or partitions of this table onto different servers now notice a trick when i created this table i allocated this country column to be partition key and now it leads to the creation of a new partition per country data is partitioned by country that gives us a very a lot of power for scaling for example and it gives us a one solid limitation any query without specifying a partition key will be highly inefficient because now you don't know if i ask for uh some uh friend friends like how many people in paris i specify friends i specify paris i get my data but if in my query i do a stupid thing and just like how many people in paris first of all we have multiple paris in the world sorry cedric but there are some more in united states not the same i know not the same then we have basically we don't know which server to ask and we have to go and ask literally every server in the cluster which may be fine if you have three servers but if you have three thousands or three hundreds or three thousands that's obviously as stupid as it sounds so remember working with partitions we need to know partition key when we ask for data or when we store data of course we must have it too but well that must be quite obvious okay so data is distributed but how exactly data is distributed take a look we have this partition key here by country and that's uh going to be a string or integer or basically whatever doesn't matter for me but it will be hashed by murmur free partitioner and throw out from a string value in this case string for example i will get a token and token is always an integer 59 12 12 45 45 so first don't get it wrong normally those numbers are much much much longer i'm just simplifying it a little bit so and now uh as we converted values of this table into numbers they call it tokens we have a bunch of cassandra nodes let's say four nodes clusters four nodes single dc cluster and every server is responsible for the range of tokens known as token range and then we can say what okay if every server is responsible for the range of tokens we see okay sydney australia number 59 hey you got here so this data will be stored on this server when toronto and monreal 1212 ah you understand what's going on this data will be stored on this server and finally berlin and nuremberg 45 you go there and fourth server stays uh like unloaded in this scenario but usually we have much more data more more free is a very good hashing algorithm in this case because it gives very good even distribution of the numbers over whatever kinds of data you have so now how it works when we scale how cassandra scales basically take a look we have every server responsible for some range of tokens from a minimum number to a maximum number again that's not 1 and 100 those numbers are much much bigger if i want to scale out and add more servers i put i bring one more server into my data center and cassandra automagically recalculates token ranges and shuffles data to the new data to a new server so that means what every server has smaller token ranges and therefore smaller numbers of partitions it's responsible for and then if i add more the more servers again this token range length will decrease again and again and each server will be responsible for less and less partitions quite opposite if i'm going to scale in so i for example black friday is over or i'm netflix and i know what uh everyone has watched already last season of squid game or game of thrones and people won't be using my service too much over next couple of weeks i can scale in to save my money on the cloud costs which can be tremendous on big numbers and then again what's going in i tell cassandra okay cassandra i'm going to decommission those two guys we don't need them anymore and cassandra does what right recalculate token ranges and transfers data to the proper servers and boom servers are decommissioned and i can take them down to save my money sounds good distribution is great but not enough because that's how we scale but how do we keep high availability in this case data is not only distributed but also data is replicated that means when we create a key space key space is basically just a folder for your tables like a box for your tables when we create a key space we must define replication factor per data center and replication strategy so what does that mean we create a key space so we can create tables in it we give it the name well quite obvious and then there are a lot of settings but two settings we must define which strategy we will use and what will be replication factor per data center with strategy it's very simple if you go for your laptop for some local development uh for some testing environments you just can go with simple strategy and that's simple strategy is good for your laptop and bad for anything else because it's not production ready it's just for very simple scenarios just to test a couple of things then second available strategy is network topology strategy as you can guess from the name it's network topology aware so basically it considers network topology on how do you spread your data uh over them your infrastructure for example you have a single dcm single data center and in init you have free server regs and you have replication factor free that means what every replica will be stored on a server in a different server rack because servers within single server rack tend to fail together power outage network outage something else you can lost single server because of a single server problems but you also can get lost can last mobile uh server rack network topology strategy puts your data as far away from each other as possible if you speak not about on-premises data center but if we speak about cloud in this case it will be not obviously server racks but availability zones so you will have your data close but not too close that is important and with replication factor that's also interesting replication factor defines how many rows or better to say partitions are stored on different nodes so basically in this case we have a data center of six servers and replication factor free it means what every partition will be stored three times on three different servers how that works when data arrives first of all uh server has to calculate its token we say hey 59 australia very good i know what those three servers are responsible for uh storing this data so in this case we will be replica servers replica nodes for this partition notice it's very important every node is a replica node but just for this partition those three are replicas and for partition 33 for example those three will be replicas so replications defined per partition right um and data is stored in this case and that's how it works now very important self-healing mechanism if anything was wrong with one of our server replica servers for this data it's already then the server what got your request notices what hey there is something wrong with this guy and it stores so-called hint or hinted handoff that means what data will be stored and then the server recovers it says like okay looks like i lost something sorry guys i was out and then i just missed something maybe and everyone who stored data for this missing for this failed server recovered server already will dispatch those hinted handoffs so consistency will be recovered automatically and you don't have to take care of that too much that's self-healing there are some limitations on this mechanism we explain it in higher details in our operations course at the academy.datastarts.com which is by the way free let's proceed then how does multi-data center replication works considering we have two data centers in two different places the application factor free then data arrives at first of them data will be spread at a synchronous theme to the local data center and also dispatch to remote data center the remote query coordinator will put the data to a proper nodes now there is a question who is this guy remote coordinator and who is this guy coordinator alex you lied to us like you said there are no masters but now i see coordinators it's the same right wrong in short every server every cli every server in the cluster is the one who gets the query becomes the coordinator query coordinator for this query so it will be responsible for dispatching data to a proper nodes another point what if you have here them data and if any another server gets this data for example this one will get this query it will be query coordinator so it's very easy use cases for everything what belongs to scalability or high performance high for output high volume a lot of rights a lot of rates cassandra is a very good choice for availability when you need your data to be available 100 of time not like 99999 but 100 of time you get your data stored and available for reading or distributed data for global presence or workload mobility it's also a perfect scenario for whatever your reason is you can specify in which data centers you want to have data in which data centers you don't want to have data and per key space and you have your data there and in such amount you want to have and of course everything what belongs to uh cloud native so modern cloud applications working on kubernetes working as an api layer over multiple clouds and so on and so forth that's all a perfect scenario for cassandra and i just wanted to answer a question from youtube chat but eric of course did it already for us thank you eric so let's move on now uh you already could have guessed replicating data we get to the dangerous grounds because of possible cross node inconsistency and yes you're right it can be a problem but there are some knobs and levers to push to kind of to keep your consistency under control first of all let's talk about cap and that's not about the cap but about the data consistency there is a great cap theorem or eric brewer's theorem which stays for uh consistency availability and partition tolerance theorem uh the trick of it like you know the joke uh job can be done uh quick uh cheap and in a good quality but you can pick only two of those job cannot be done uh quick and a good quality but uh and and cheap like it's not going to happen it's going to be expensive if you want it right now and in a high quality same with psap theorem you can decide and you can pick only two qualities out of three let's say what are the qualities we are talking consistency availability and partition tolerance what does that mean let's start with availability it's the easiest one to explain availability means you get the answer right easy as that you just get your answer enough you ask yourself you ask your cluster and you get the answer not too much to explain consistency is different and consistency in this case means whatever node you ask for data you get always the most up-to-date value you see because of the network outages power outages whatever our problems shark attack and data centers you will be one of your servers may not get the update and if you ask multiple servers the same question and some of them return most up-to-date value and some of them are outdated it means they are not consistent and finally partition tolerance is the most misunderstood quality i often i very often see people who not really realize what is it about partition tolerance is ability of the system to survive network partitioning between parts of the system it means what if you have a data center of five servers and normally they all can communicate and collaborate with each other but then there is some network outage and you have your first group of servers between this dc let's call it group a and you have two more servers let's call them group b and they cannot communicate with each other uh so group a is isolated from group b group b is isolated from group a by both half x's to the clients that's called network partitioning and there is an interesting point network partitioning can potentially lead to a split brain situation which is way much worse than downtime and now you can tell me hey alex what can be worse than downtime and i will tell you network split can split brain can indeed what's the point story is if part of your clients work with a group a and part of your clients work with the group b you run into a really really really big problem because if you don't have this partition tolerance in the end you will end up having two different copies of the database and good luck trying to solve and join them back together unite them in this single copy single version you may think what downtime may be worse but if after a couple of days of the network partitioning of the big database it will be just extremely hard and close to impossible to merge data back into a single consistent version and there is no way to automate it anyhow in in the world you will have to do it manually so that's going to be a rough time yeah based on um you want to add something no no just it's a nightmare when this happens it's really a nightmare so you better have other yeah it's really better to be uh virtually uh it's really better so now remember cep theorem we can decide which qualities we want to have but for real there are only two places where we can be available and partitioned all around so we stay here and consistent and partition tolerant so we stay here and the situation is looks like i do want to be consistent but i also want to be available and by no circumstances i want to draw partition tolerance i have to be tolerant tolerable to network partitioning which actually happens on the distributed networks no so rarely and now people always ask what cassandra is cp or ap and many people answer cassandra is app most people answer what cassandra is ap but i have a better answer for you cassandra is configurably consistent cassandra is tunably consistent in any moment of the time for any particular query you can set consistency level you require to have it defines how many confirmations you will wait before the response is dispatched take a look with cassandra you have two knobs or levers or how do you name them consistency level and replication factor replication factor defines amount of replicas per data center and consistency level defines amount of confirmations from those replicas per query and that is a very important thing i will get back to that later take a look when i execute the query for example like here in java always a lot of words prepared statement session prepare insert in the product blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah prepare it statement set consistency level consistency level one that will mean what i will wait only for one confirmation what my data was stored out of a ref three of three servers you will see it soon also i can work with consistency level using sql shell but we will skip that for now and let's go and take a look on the consistency levels there are multiple of them and they basically all of them define the same they answer two questions how many confirmations i will have to wait and what are the data centers i want to work with today now for example consistency level 1 when a query coordinator gets the data it dispatches updates to all replica servers don't make a mistake consistency level 1 doesn't mean you dispatch data to only one single server no data is still being dispatched to all three replicas of course but then those servers get the data they all answer yeah i got it thank you and we will wait for only one response who answer faster okay one server got your data and at this moment we confirmed to the client where data was stored okay we are good executed obviously with consistency level quorum quorum means majority so more than half of the nodes we will wait for a quorum of confirmations and majority for replication factor three will be two majority for replication factor five will be free and basically that means what with the consistency level quorum we can afford losing a single node with replication factor three and still being fully consistent or you will see some how do we go for that and we replication factor five we can afford losing up to two nodes and still handling all the kind of a queries we execute at the consistency level quorum and finally with the consistency level all we will wait for the confirmation from all of the nodes and now take a look now you can say okay i work the very very very important data my clients don't want to be to have anything inconsistent uh i well i'm going just to always use consistency level all you may say and there is a little problem cep theorem is still there waiting for you and it's going to make a strike when you don't expect what does that mean then you go for consistency level all you require to have full consistency and what does that cp theorem states and says to us you can be consistent and partition tolerant but you cannot be highly available at the same time you have to decide so when you go for consistency level all what happens if one of the servers is not available you won't get your confirmation or you won't get your answer and boom cassandra will answer sorry can it reach desired consistency level better luck next time now you can ask okay then i still want to have my data kind of consistent i don't want to have it eventually consistent i want it to be consistent but i also need availability how do i get in the middle cp there and cruel eric brewer states it's not possible maybe uh you cassandra guys can help him answer is yes we can there is a thing known as immediate consistency uh the very right way to work with the data very often for most of the scenarios is the immediate consistency what does that mean let's take a look data center of six servers replication factor free so every partition is stored on three different servers we write with consistency level quorum we read with consistency level quorum there are some scenarios let's take a look i've write with consistency level quorum that means what i wait for two out of three answers and those two guys answer it and this one didn't now notice we didn't know if it's really palette or maybe that was a network luck and we just didn't get this answer it may be updated maybe not but those two are updated for sure okay now another client starts to read the very same data what was recently updated and read with a consistency level quorum okay so we will wait for uh in this case uh we are lucky because query coordinator also will be replica for this request very good actually it happened most of the time and we will wait for two responses and now take a look we wait for two responses and there are two possible scenarios we get first two answers from those servers what were updated for sure in this case answers will be the same and client will immediately get his answer but there is a chance what this server will be this time faster than this one and there are two possible scenarios here it was updated or it wasn't updated if it was updated then everything goes successfully answers will match client will get this answer everyone is happy everyone is laughing but there is a possible scenario where this guy was not updated what happens then take a look query coordinator has a very important job id basically compares the answers and sees what one has most up-to-date answer and one has outdated answer what happens then there are a simple story first [Music] client will get most up-to-date answer and then uh query card generator will initiate a repair for the failed outdated node for this partition and uh query coordinator will say hey man you have outdated information please fix it us up and it will do a repair uh grab data from the uh replica of grub data from the replicas water good and recover and boom we have all three servers recovered and now guess what it works automatically so you will notice it happening only if you read the locks or if you have proper monitoring over your cluster by the way sometimes occasional repairs is good i mean like happens everyone understands but if you have too high level of repairs repair rates happening on your cluster you may want to consider like to check what's going on because under normal circumstances that's not fun that's not nice when you have too much of repairs going on like for something wrong with a network probably something you have to fix good a few more words i wanted to say about that we discussed it about the numbers and now you can understand one two three quorum all but the what does mean local and one does mean each first of all it's a very simple story if i have multiple data centers like in this case and i specify each quorum and i work with highly important data i want my data to be absolutely sure delivered to every data center 100 percent then i can require consistency level each quorum and i will wait for every quorum of every data center to confirm what they got the data good news i always know what data was delivered to all of the data center bad news if you have data centers in australia europe united states and i don't know whatever else norway why not then that's obviously not going to be as fast as a single data center query right [Music] so each room has some costs uh what's uh more often used is local quorum and local quorum means what uh take a look if you have data centers in australia united states and europe then mostly probably you have also your application servers running in australia united states and europe do you work your european application server to work your with your australian database server i guess you don't [Music] then my point here will be when application server starts it knows which database which data center will be considered as local or as closest to itself and then a request to work with local quorum means what you european application server will work with european database and expect for quorum only from one single dc which is closer to it giving highest possible performance as you see there is quite a lot of things to configure with cassandra giving you the power to keep your data and consistency under control um okay yeah by the way getting back to the immediate consistency there is a uh that's basically mathematics if your consistency level bright plus consistency level read higher than replication factor you have immediate consistency no matter what consistency tradeoffs are obvious higher the consistency level lesser chance you may get stale data but you pay for this the possible latency notice the possible part if your uh network works good if your servers are not overloaded most of them transfer within more or less the same time but obviously the more servers you wait for higher chance what one of one of them will be in some busy some delay getting out with friends i don't know but it may take longer if you wait for longer bigger number of servers by the way that's one of the reasons we usually don't recommend to go uh with replication factor on the numbers higher than free like free is a typical recommendation per data center for some kind of use cases especially with very bright heavy workloads they may benefit from a lower consistency level like getting to consistency level one for example if data is not required immediately and your system works in a stable way you can write with consistency level one and then if you're not going to read this data immediately anyway it will be recovered or in in good scenario it will be delivered immediately in worse scenario it will be delivered via hinted handoffs or repairs but the general idea is consistency level one indeed can be dangerous and if some of your servers wasn't updated like in this example if you ask with consistency level one and get to this bad guy you will get stale data so consider consistency level as a very important knob or lever or whatever you prefer to call good i will have any good questions maybe um there are no no particular questions there was one but we answered that in the chat and that was a bit a few minutes ago about using more than one column for the partition key good question and yeah so that's absolutely permitted and it's actually a very common pattern to define more than one column in the partition key and in that case every single partition is specified by the whole set of values for all columns so again if you want to specify a single partition which is what you usually want to do to reach a single node a single partition you have to specify the values for all columns so if you just give the value say of the first column that's not yet enough to go to a single node in general right yeah yeah thank you for a good question but uh sorry stupid me we have uh stefano and eric in the chat obviously all questions are answered already yeah but some question is good to bring to the attention of everyone because they might shed light on on some points that we necessarily have to just you know go quickly through right uh good so data data data how data is structured in cassandra first the cassandra is a tabular system so you are going to work with the tables as you could have guessed already it all starts with a cell and cell must be familiar at this moment it's an intersection of row in a column it stores data sounds quite obvious then row row is a single structured data item in the table keeping some cells so far so good now there is a new thing a partition partition is a group of rows having the same partition token it is the base unit of access in cassandra and that is a very important point you don't want to miss partitions are the base unit of access and that's the core thinking cassandra and there is a thread that many people get in uh traditional relational databases you have tables you have columns and rows there are some partitions oh they don't matter i will go and use cassandra as my sequel about joins cassandra is great people say so it will work perfectly for me sounds good doesn't work cassandra highest performance and all the other cool things are the shared responsibility cassandra gives you the tools but you have to use them in the right way uh if you don't know how to use the hammer and you will hit yourself in your leg it's not the hammer's fault right it's your fault you have to learn how to use your tools and the easiest way to get into troubles with cassandra is to misunderstood or underestimate the importance of the partitions don't be like that be better than that partitions are very important and partition is the unit of access in cassandra not the traditional row row is just a part of the partition then basically a table is a group of columns and rows storing partitions and that must be quite familiar then you create a table in cassandra query language you'll have to define some things key space which is a folder or group of tables right table users by city okay then there are some column definitions city last name first name address email in this example they have all data type text but believe me we have more than one data type of course and then finally we define primary key primary key consists of partition key which you know already and clustering column let's walk through the definitions so primary key primary key is an identifier for the row it consists of partition key and optional clustering columns partition key must present clustering columns are optional you may need them you may not need them depending on a good example well why not city last name first name email city will be partitioned for users by city and last name first name email are parts we need parts parts of a primary key take a look uh why this example for the same table city last name first name is not good why is it a bad example answer is simple i believe some of you may notice it already there can be a lot of john smith's in new york that's for sure and every next one will give a very uh like will give quite a bad surprise to the previous one so we add email to have this um [Music] row unique so we will have multiple different john smiths not a single one per city so this will perfectly work uh partition key we already discussed partition key is an identifier for a partition it consists of at least one column may have more if needed it partitions rows into partitions for example like a typical example you have youtube on youtube you have videos or videos you have comments it very may make sense to have comments partitioned by videos so each video will have one single partition for its comments and it will be perfectly operational sometimes we want to have single role partitions which is also perfectly fine if we don't need to search users by last name first name for example we can just go for user id and we will have a table of partition table of as much partitions as many rows because single row per partition is also fine if it suits your data model which will be later explained by stefano with clustering columns clustering columns they have two duties first we use clustering columns to ensure uniqueness per row very much makes sense as already explained the city last name first name may need email to guarantee uniqueness they also needed to establish sorting order because data in the table a sorted base it on the clustering column a very important point and finally clustering column has one more duty because partition key and clustering columns so all the parts of a primary key are kinda primary indexes so you can search and sort data by them with some limitations and be very fine with that and it's all works but notice very important thing by the way by non-primary uh columns so not partition non-clustering columns in this example it's basically going to be only the address you can not search if they are not in primary key and that is a very important limitation you may search only by partition key and clustering columns in this case address is a data column in data column in order to search by it you will need a secondary index on that and secondary index is a very different story which again will be explained in the data model part so we better go with this scenario searching and understanding how do we work with partition key and clustering column now those are the most important slides of the presentation and if you can take screenshots get the screenshots because it may change your life really it may save your life at some point so partition is the base unit of access if you fail to design your partition properly you will have some problems with your data and you will have some problems with your cluster and definitely you may have some problems with scalability but good thing it's not so hard to design partitions properly there are basically three primary rules you have to follow i call them rules of a good partition and if you see this slide of a year award i created those slides and i gave them this award because i believe they are the most important slides you will see within this year so first store together what you retrieve together example uh you open a video on youtube or your client opens a video on your youtube whatever it is we want to show comments to this video and we don't want to ask a dozen servers for those comments you want to ask one single server and then obviously we can partition our data like that primary key video id created at comment id let's take a look at this example first we partition it by video id all the comments will have all the comments to the same video will have the same video id that means what we will have a partition with all those comments together store together what you retrieve together you have to load last last 200 comments a single query to a single server very good now created we needed to have our data sorted by time so comments will be already sorted and i will get them most recent first and then finally i have comment id here just to ensure uniqueness because obviously comments per video at the same time may be created by two different people so on big numbers this collision is inevitable so i add comment id for them uniqueness now let's take a look why this why this design is wrong comment id created that comment id will be partition key right and as i told you in the beginning if you don't specify your partition key your query is going to visit every server in your data center and ask maybe you have the data for me and that is as stupid as it sounds i don't know about you but then i order pizza i give the full address to the delivery boy not just half address right and it's the same if cassandra you better give the full address it's just like much better to one who is going to bring pizza to him so okay then and with this one how do i how am i going to load all the comments per video that just won't work so second rule very important rule avoid big partitions and that is very important what is a big partition if data distribution is not even if uh one partition is noticeably bigger than the others it's still maybe not so bad although it is bad but then your partitions grows too big and that's getting hard for them server to handle them that's definitely going to slow things down there um only one hard limit up to 2 billion cells per partition but we recommend you not to get close to this limit because you will run into problems significantly earlier when you reach it our recommendation up to 100 000 rows in a partition you may go higher but like those already dangerous rounds not recommended and our recommendation is up to 100 megabytes of data in the partition um again those are not hard limits it's flexible but still some reasonable limits i know one of our clients had once found out uh partition of 1.2 terabytes of data as you can imagine that's not going to work fast and it's not really going to scale so understand size of a partition and that is a very very very important thing one more thing is take a look one hidden danger like some people get into that trap here imagine a huge telecommunication company hardware all over the world multiple data centers everywhere and they need to understand what's going on so they have different sensors reporting their state every 10 seconds every sensor reports its id timestamp and sensor value so the data structure is simple id of a sensor uuid like the long long id timestamp well timestamp and value value can be different and can be temperature it can be humidity in the room it can be current network for output and so on so there are different kinds of sensors but it's still just some value of report and in the beginning we decided to design our system like that uh primary key sensor id store together what you retrieved together and reported add so data will be sorted by time uniqueness guaranteed at the time level if this case bill will be enough because all sensors have different ids now let's take a look in the beginning this approach worked well and everything went good and everything was shiny but when after some time something bad happened and something like really bad happened and cluster performance was heavily degraded and many other problems what happened and why let's play a true detective true i.t detective and find out who is the murderer what happened in this scenario and why things went wrong please write your answer on the youtube chat and i will drink my cafe and pink we need some music here like you usually have in thrillers who is the murderer what went wrong try to guess you won't get a price for this answer but you will get my personal respect which is quite a lot meanwhile stefano if we have some good questions then you may want to prepare them to read out a lot i know we have little delay between a real translation to youtube but the data keeps growing right and like you have a clue but now find the criminal data keeps growing and what too many records coming in for a sensor no that's not a problem uh if you mean from the scale point of view as long as you have enough servers to handle all the right operations and cassandra servers are very performant the amount of records coming in for a sensor like per second or per moment of a time it's not really um big problem yes finally that is the final answer partition size will be huge one very important note is over may i say one thing yeah sure guys says too many records coming in for a sensor so the right answer is implied ah okay okay okay so okay so c c sharp guy yes and yeah so good the right answer is implied there but yes yes and that is their problem right we will have in the beginning it all will be good but overall we will have two big partitions over some time there are two scenarios to solve this problem first one called ttl ttl is a time to leave and basically that's a really cool feature of cassandra then you create a record you can assign a ttl to it to it time to leave even then you create a specific value what's even more interesting for some cases you can create a ttl for it and say like okay you have you're going to disappear after some time after a month for example and then table will be cleared that's a great thing but it's not always what you want in this particular example that's a real life example by the way company didn't want to have this data deleted they wanted to keep it over many years in this case we introduced a different solution called bucketing what is the bucketing idea of first c very simple you remember this question in the beginning sensor id month here now we introduce one more field in the partition key and you may ask what is the amount here it's never reported by the sensor and we cannot upgrade all the sensors in the world it's going to take years right month here is a scientifical scientific value we just get the current month and current year so that's the october of 2021 and month year is going to be one zero to zero to one then october is over and november starts it will be guess what one one two zero two one and boom we have an automatically created new partition and data always will be stored in a new partition so money here can be integer or a string that doesn't really matter and you this way you'll have buckets and every sensor writes to a partition till the month is over and then start to write to a new partition yeah oh thank you stefano so yes it can be like that it's generated from reported that there is no actual information that is a bucketing to split your data into multiple buckets now some of you may say why do we introduce a month here why cannot we use just like time stamp date time day week hour so we will have even smaller partitions smaller partitions are good uh yes the answer is we take a look we have to avoid big partitions but we also have to store together what you receive together and if uh sorry uh stephanie may i ask you uh to uh mute your keyboard yep yes sorry sorry no worries so let's take a look don't forget when you query for data you have to specify all the parts of a partition key right and if i query for data for example for last three months how will mike very look for this design so i'm going to show the graph of the temperatures in the in the server room number 12 uh answer is it will be look like select all nor select whatever i need from table name where sensor id equals one two three and month year equals to uh 10 20 21 9 20 21 8 20 21 0 8 0 9 and 10 so it will be simple in statement in and then there is a list of values and will it be the perfect query well it wouldn't be the perfect one because perfect query is a query which which reaches out for one particular partition in this case we will have to hit three different partitions which is not the best but which is acceptable but if i have smaller partitions weekly or hourly or minutely can you imagine how my query will look like if i'm going to query data for the last three months i will have to specify every minute of the last three months that will be obviously not the best way to work with a database so that's must be quite obvious good and um final thing are there any good questions um well there was a there was some discussion in the chat about uh this idea of adding a month here and uh yeah so um and asked why can i just use cannot we just use sensor ide it is unique yes it is unique but now the point is to avoid having a partition that grows and grows and grows as the months go by which at some point makes for a unmanageable partition eventually so now the point is to split the partition in manageable partitions uh yeah so that's it then i've seen a few questions earlier that i also see in the q a good collection so they we might save them for them so to have time to discuss them more in detail so please stay tuned because in the q a session we will have a bit of discussion in the chat with you if you ask the question so we can maybe go much more in detail so i think for now that's fine to go ahead yep [Music] um yes and there is a very good point so basically we create the partition key depending on what we need from it right i love seeing such such a remark in the chat that's exactly it yes and now there is a second point uh being a global iot i would prefer a region country partition uh take a look it may make sense or there may be better strategies so it's always very depending on the use case on the scenario you have so it may vary so it's not there is no silver bullet there are always some considerations you have to understand and country or region-based partitioning may make sense but it's not like the single only one-size-fits-all solution no sorry alex may i stop you for a second there is a very interesting uh comment in the chat balaji says it looks like the data is stored as rows and columns then how is it nosql database i think this point is very dear to you and to us all so okay not now seriously um do you want to say something on this yes sure sure just two words because that would open a longer but i know you love this point so you know what uh recently i well you know about that uh that's for our attendees recently i did a talk uh no sequel doesn't exist and despite its provocational name there are indeed some proofs and i do can prove what nosql does not exist i have to the problem is this talk was in russian so i have to do it again in english for the wider audience and the idea is no sequel if i will ask uh our dear balaj team uh if no sequel is schema-less mostly probably he will answer yes by the way uh balance if you uh may answer this question do you think what nosql is schema-less please answer it in the youtube chat it will be interesting but maybe everybody can answer if they want yeah so there's no sequel schema-less or not yeah do you think it's schema full or not yep that's an interesting question not only not only hey that is good the applause that that is good so the answer is there are over 200 of different nosql databases and they are very very very very very very very very different even to each other and some of them um are much far away much more away from oh okay so maybe it is not schema-less good answers that are good answers right so take a look there are key value databases there are graph databases there are ledger databases there are navigational databases uh there are columnar but no relational databases and so on and so forth and so on and so forth and they are very different to each other trying to group them together in the node sql we doing actually a bad work because some of them are much far away from each other when from to my sequel or i mean any sql database so idea is don't think of no sql as a single monolith there are graph databases those are much more relational than relational databases because they really care about the relations of entities no sql is not about tables there are many nosql bases base it on columns and rows and that's perfectly fine nosql is about usually missing sql which is also not always trad and the idea is nosql means not only sql so all the other databases except of sql and obviously cassandra is not the sql database and it can be schema-less for cassandra it can be essentially schema full for cassandra it can be schema-less for some other databases doesn't matter if it has schema less than how it's maintained across the cluster we cannot get too deep in this question because we have more topics to cover but let's get to ask me anything session it will be interesting so i just want to do a very short remark because back to biology question that's very interesting so how come it is table based it is a column database but it is no sequel now i had the privilege of attending alex's workshop sorry alex seminar about nosql does not exist which i enjoyed a lot it's very funny lightning talk and funny and so okay a small a small side remark i love invertebrate biology but now if you think about that invertebrates is the same thing as nosql so there is nothing there is not rate shared by invertebrates except being not vertebrates so they are not they don't have bones and the same for nosql nosql databases do not necessarily have any common trait except that of not being sql databases not being relational so in that sense uh nosql is a misleading label let me say and there are all sorts of non-sql databases all sorts of invertebrate animals okay sorry that was just to have a bit a little fun no no no no uh yeah thank you so much that's quite cool and uh final thing again there is a k-value database like redis there is a graph database like a datastax enterprise graph or neo4j or aws neptune and they are absolutely different and like nosql is a very interesting place okay finally avoid hot partitions uh sorry stefano could you please uh yes thank you so avoid hot partitions what does that mean avoid code partitions what does that mean hot partition first of all take a look when one of your partitions are being accessed all the time while others aren't it's not a big deal but then your partition is being accessed all the time on a huge scale like with really a lot requests per second more than a single server can handle then you are in the problems uh sorry stefano uh you are not muted yep so uh take a look we why do we do partitioning after all to have some uh isolated data chunks for scalability purposes then one chunk is getting too big it is bad uh it's not scalable and so on and so forth and one chunk is being accessed all the time while others are not touched it is bad then these this it success too much if there would be a multiple smaller partitions we can scale out add more servers these partitions being moved to a new servers and it's scaled but if you have this point of if you have this point of databases uh if you have this um one single partition of too big like imagine you have some uh you are an e-commerce company you are selling some goods and you have like a couple of hundred customers in one country uh one two thousand customers in another country and then surprisingly you start to sell in china and everyone in china is excited about your goods and buy something from you and you have your customers grouped by country which may look good in the beginning but let's take a look now we have one partition which is being accessed all the time overloaded servers are just on fire and overloaded and there are some other partitions those are minor and not really accessed all the time like that you can tell me hey we just got a huge success in china uh we can add more servers to the cluster you say it perfectly works for cassandra and as for your answer is let's take a look let's say we have 10 servers replication factor 3 our overloaded hot partition is located on three of them we add 10 more servers that will lead to token ranges recalculation and shuffling some of the data right okay good so amount of partitions per server will decrease but this huge partition doesn't disappear if the pressure on the partition is too high what a single server can maintain it then obviously you can add as much servers if you want as you want that won't help you can add 1000 servers you still have overloaded partition because the partition is the base unsplittable unit of access so you have to think about that some partitions may be also overloaded and they have to keep them in smaller chunks because it scales much better when higher chain bigger chunks and that's why we recommend to keep partitions smaller so it will be easier to scale and that's very important thing to understand okay stefano looks like it's your time very good okay so so uh should i switch to your screen um maybe yes because you just have this slide about lab maybe there is another slide with the url but i'll i'll grab it from here so i i'm showing it right now okay so very good yes okay so practical materials are available at github.com data stacks there's very good workshop intro to cassandra and now very important part take a look uh cassandra maintenance and operations is not so simple thing if you want to have multiple uh instances cluster you're going to do quite a lot of work but you know what we love you so we already did this work for you let's call it astra astra is a cassandra based uh database as a service so you can simply create your instance at astra.dev slash cassandra day a and z and get your cluster right now for free and you can use it even after small production workloads and definitely for educational purposes for free since today and forever so uh enjoy your free tier at astra from data stacks and you will use it for the lab work with stefanom so i'm switching to your screen right yes go ahead i'm here we are you are live okay very good so welcome to the practice part of today's core cassandra talk or workshop better um as usual alex i remind you that i'm not seeing the youtube chat anymore so you will have to be looking what happens and checking for you know the thumbs up and everything so okay so what are we about to do um we will play a bit with uh uh cassandra we will play a bit with astrodb which is a database built on apache cassandra that is available for you in on the cloud managed by us free to use and up to a very high level of usage of storage and transactions and well let's start by doing and then we will see a bit how it works so i pasted two links in the chat one is the link to this page where you will have to register for free to astrodb asteroid b as alex said is uh offered for free by data stocks and will give you the the possibility to play with basically a cassandra installation or it's built on cassandra without having to manage the database so please you should register either with github or google to sign in or you can register with name and email and password and everything you will be then creating your account as you see here obviously i have already my account so i will pretend i registered like you probably are doing and uh okay so i've been logged out give me one second you will never guess my password indeed i typed it wrong don't know why [Music] i think i was my token expired now i mean okay sorry so uh after registering and signing up you will end up with a similar interface as you're seeing now except you will probably directly be brought to create database screen like this one because as soon as you register you will directly go to a page asking you to create a database now another link that i that i gave you is the link to these github repository this contains instructions to play with the database uh we will basically follow these instructions but uh they are so these instructions contain everything to for you to be able to work uh whatever you want even later even by your yourself so it's all explained so please keep in mind that you can also go later on that and an important thing is that these exercises contain a homework as you see here so there is a small description on what you will have to do as homework which basically is completing what we are doing now plus uh taking a small two small courses and i will show them immediately and after which you take a few screenshots and submit them as github issues why do you want to do that because then as we mentioned in the beginning of this morning you will be given a badge that you will be uh able to use to break around and you know uh make uh envy in your friends so no okay i'm joking but uh if you complete the homework you will get a badge and that testifies you have been doing the first step in your journey to learning cassandra so okay there will be for this homework a bit of exercises and you will see now what plus two uh additional short courses and they have this appearance so they are they these courses are one is about data modeling and the other is about the query language that you will soon see the cql that you've already encountered in the alex's slide these courses are very cool because they contain a bit of theory a bit of explanation and then with this button you start an interactive scenario and in the browser you will be able to interact with an actual cassandra installation and do a bit of things in a guided manner so they are very cool they are absolutely hands-on learning and i suggest you to go and see what they have to offer you okay so back to the part that you do within astrodb now uh let's go so okay i will follow the these instructions first we have to create so you have to create your astra db instance so your database now let's say you have registered by now with this link and you will have to create a database now we give you here the name of your data of a database to use and also the name of a key space you have seen what a key space is it's basically a grouping of tables we don't have tables yet but we we will create a database and a key space in it and the names are here killer video cluster is the database name maybe i'm trying to make it a bit bigger but i want to be able to show you the whole screen so name of the database will be a killer video cluster and the key space name will be killer video maybe alex you might paste it into the chat just for sure opinions but okay so um one thing that so as we said astra db is a managed for you in the cloud where and from which provider any as you see you're free to choose whether you want you want to use a gcp aws or azure let's say i want to use aws i'm based in europe so i will choose europe middle east but you're free obviously to go wherever you prefer maybe you want to reduce your latency whatever i'll click frankfurt why not so database name key space name region and provider region and then i can hit create database now once you clear once you click create database a lot of things happen but you don't have to worry about them so uh the database is basically created and spun up as a kubernetes set of objects in kubernetes and behind the scenes your database starts to exist obviously creating a whole cassandra database takes some time indeed as you see this killer video cluster database is there for waiting for me actually it's still in the pending state and it will be like that for say two minutes or so now i would like you to give me a thumbs up when you achieve this step so when you see your database even in the pending state so not please give me a thumbs up so we we can track that uh you manage to reach this point so registering to astra creating the database name of the database name of the key space click create database and you should end up here um alex do we see some thumbs up uh give me a moment you actually just asked it for them and we have few seconds delay yes so not yet okay so we give you a big a few a couple of minutes in the meantime i'll show you a few cool things of uh astra db okay so as as i said uh as3db gives you usage of a database for free and that's up to quite a lot of usage so you will still be in the free tier if you do something like 40 million reads 5 million rights and several tens of gigabytes of storage if i'm not mistaken so you will have you will be able to run not only experiments but also well actual applications maybe small business even without surpassing the boundaries of the free tier so that's a pretty cool thing by the way every month you will have 25 dollars of credit for you to use every month they will be renewed for you just for your applications but look the killer video cluster that i just created has become active so how are we alex in terms did someone manage to get their database running yeah looks like we have already some people getting their database in running or at least pending state and okay so we wait a little bit more and we move to the readme in the repository so let's say we created the key space so the database and the key space so every everything is here in destruction so choose every provider every region you want create a database you will see it in pending state blah blah blah this is something we saved so okay we have a database and a key space as we saw before a key space is a is a container that will contain generally tables and as you can imagine there are no tables yet we have to create them now there are several ways to create tables there are in general several ways to interact with uh cassandra and with as3db you can do that with drivers you can do that with different kind of uh interfaces and on that there will be a very interesting talk by cedric uh london later about something called stargate but now we are going to interact with the database with the console that will make us able to just type sql commands now a cool thing about astra is that you will have access sorry you will have access to a console in the browser to just work with your database now um i will assume that most of you have your database running and active state now alex what do you think i can go ahead i think so okay so i'm here i'm seeing all of my database i locate the killer video cluster that we just created and let me click on connect so i'm now in the part of the of the astra ui about my one database and as you see there are very many ways to connect with it now this will be explained this will be seen in different uh parts of today but there are various ways of interacting programmatically with did so document api graphql various programming languages a lot of different ways and one of those look here there is a tab called cql console now let me click on it within the browser if i go to the sql console tab i will have a nice console so you see this block this black part here it's a real console where i can type commands and click enter to execute them by the way if i if this weren't astray b but if this were uh regular cassandra you would have in your own bash in your own shell you would have a way to connect with a very identical console so these are really general commands that you are seeing now let me go back to the to the readme because we have to create a table so okay we went to the sql console and let's see what you can do so this console works as any other text based uh command line interface so you type commands and you hit enter so let's see are there key spaces well we created a database with one key space so i want to see them and i type desk which is for stands for describe desk key spaces now remember that every cql command generally has to close be closed with a semicolon like here i hope you're able to see i try to make it a bit bigger but so if i type desk spaces enter now see i see all of my key spaces now you see there is my good old killer video the one we created very good all other key spaces are just system things we can don't care now we cannot care about them now okay so there is my killer video here now a good thing of cql console is that there is tab completion so you not always have to type the whole command now i want to tell my cql console to work on the killer video key space and i i use this command to do that use now i would like to type use killer video but probably if i hit tab i get the command so now enter and i have now my sql console will work on the killer video key space uh as is as you can see here from the prompt alex uh do you see something in the chat can we assume that uh our attendees are more or less following along very good we are good but never just one incredible question i really liked a lot uh joe asked if i understand this correctly so far by learning to use astra i don't need to learn specific of handling database with google or amazon web services and that is exactly the point yes takes away all of the burden of managing and operations on your database that's correct obviously in general so today is about cassandra and if you use a generic cassandra if you install cassandra whether on-premise or in the cloud by yourself that's that's a different story so in general if you use cassandra vanilla cassandra so to speak you will also have to deal with operations managing upgrade everything and there are some reasons to do that in some cases but what astra db does actually is it takes away the burden of operations that sometimes are just something in in the way between you and your working application so yes that's exactly correct uh okay so we are in the sql console and we are on the killer video key space so describe key space use killer video we are just following uh the instructions to do some practice on the database now let's create a table so this is a cool command look i am about to copy paste this command back in the sql console but look at this command i think this is something you saw already in alex's slides so create table okay there is if not exist just as a safety catch create table users by city and then there is a bunch of fields so column name column type column name column type and then this very important part of the create table command that specify not only the primary key itself this one but also with this additional set of parentheses well it specified the partition key so if you remember what you saw in in the previous slides and what alex told us we are creating a table with so and so columns and in particular uniqueness is defined by those four columns and partitions is defined by cd so every row all rows with the same value of city will be one partition in the way data is grouped and distributed across the nodes now let me copy this command to create a table and just paste it here enter done we created the table now how do you check that this table has been created that's very simple describe tables semicolon and there we go you see in the output users by city sure enough the table is there okay let's insert some data why not so the table now exists but it's empty so there are ways to insert some data but before doing that let's create a few other tables two more tables so a table called commands by user and a table called commands by video now you might see that these tables come from a larger example sample application actually called killer video that is a very big and developed sample application showcasing a lot of features of cassandra and it's basically a youtube kind of thing the example was also somewhere along the slides that you saw and it's a an application um managing videos and users commenting videos so the various ways of you know handling relations between videos and comments users dropping comments on a video and so on so we create a few more two more tables uh i want to stress the fact that in this case user id is not a text so before that you just had the text columns all columns were text in the previous table this time we have uuid time uad so just okay let's not uh dwell too much on this but just so you know that cassandra has a rich set of data types and you have you can have columns of type integer time uuid date and so on okay so let me just create those two tables that are both about comments on videos but they are grouped differently that's maybe something interesting i just pasted the commands and hit enter now um as you can see the tables look very similar to each other but they have a different primary key and a different well the primary key is the same up to perm no no so it's different and in particular partitioning is different and as you will see in the data modeling uh workshop this hints at the fact that those two tables are born out of two different needs of that single application two different ways of querying the data of getting the commands okay so we created a few tables now you now know what i want to do i want to describe tables so what are the tables in the killer video key space there we go three tables ready for us to play with okay now we want to do some crowd so we want to create data retrieve data update and delete the data just to see the usual way of interacting with a database based on tables okay so look we now can insert a few rows look at this statement here insert into table and then there is a series of column names values and a matching series of values to use for those columns so let me paste this co this command here we are now inserting into the comments by user table a row with this and with so and so values for the various fields now an an interesting thing is that user id is an id and we paste a literal for that while comment id which is a time uuid so a kind of a field type containing encoding both a unique identifier and a timestamp it's actually a uuid one standard uid one so for that we don't give a literal value but we just leave cql to handle things for us and to generate uh an id so let me paste this command in the console here i'm inserting into commands by user there we go i inserted my first row let's just do similar insertions to in comments by user again so you see always on the same table i'm just inserting a bunch of rows and there we go we we wrote a few rows okay so um now we insert another set of rows this time in the comments by video table just to have some fun okay so let me just paste all of these here no big deal just just so you know now these are several comments on the same video so one two three four five six here i'm inserting one comment another one another one always on the same video plus at the end i'm inserting a comment on a different video id so this is somehow a hint of a one-to-many relation between videos and comments obviously but okay we just inserted a few rows now we want to read those data right how do you do that well that's very simple in general you would be able to just run a select query so let's try select splat from comments by here it says by user so those of you who knows sql would probably find this uh statement very familiar and the result sure enough are there so you see we are now finally reading data from the table the very same data we inserted of course but surprise surprise this is not the right way to query a cassandra table because you now know everything about partitioning and you know that this query in general would have to go asking all nodes or to get all data because i'm doing a select splat and that's really against the philosophy of cassandra the right way of querying would always have to specify the partition key so every query even if i have a cluster of one thousand nodes the query goes to one single node straight to the right node to to get the data because it goes to the node holding the data so everything is very smooth and the access time is constant even as a function even even if if the cluster is bigger and bigger the access time stays constant which is the power of cassandra so this is the right kind of query to run so select from comment by user where user id equals something because user id is the partition key by the way if you look at the cql results there is a color code reminding me that user id is indeed the partition key and that's very handy so that's the right kind of query i i would have to run and you see now i'm getting three rows now i had to make my characters a bit too big for you to better see but you can see it's three rows because it's the three comments on the one one one video while if i just run this questionable query with the star sorry with the the full table scan there was also a fourth comment with on the 222 video and that's the right way to query so going straight to a single partition okay this is all very well explained in this readme so you can go back to this and study it better if you want to to get more insight okay so we wrote data we write the data let's uh oh okay sorry there is still some reading to do just nothing new obviously we are now selecting uh from comments by user the whole thing from comments by video similar so you would see again the whole table we these are all sort of questionable queries in a sense okay um okay so let's see what happens when you have to update an existing row that's okay so we insert a new row in the comments by video now we are inserting a comment on a given video and the text the comment the text of the comment is that guy patrick is such a geek okay so let me insert this row and let me check select comment from comments by video where video id equal oh sorry i pasted the wrong thing where video id equal these okay i have three of them so i can maybe be more precise and comment id equal this thing so just to change a bit okay so you see now in the select i can also select a specific column obviously as in sql so i'm now looking at the text of this one comment that i just inserted very well now how do you update it so um okay so this is how how we created the table and you see that video id and comment id are they formed the primary key now okay you can guess if i want to go to a single row and update a value there i have to specify the the whole the whole primary key in order to go to a single row and change its value so at least video id and comment id have to be specified if i'm about to update the value in that one row indeed this is how the the update the update statement looks like update table set column equal new value you see there is it was on such a gig and it's becoming is on flick so where v2id equals something and comment id equals something let's run this update statement but before doing that let me clear my screen so at the moment this uh comment contained this text here let me paste the update and let me run again the select aha you see i successfully executed my update the same select as before now gives me the new value and that's it for the update let's just check if i'm able to delete data as well so that's very similar because if i want to delete a row at that one single row i obviously have to specify the whole value for the primary key because i have to identify that one row indeed the statement looks like delete from table where and there are where conditions and if you look now that's very too big to be clearly seen but there in the work condition again i'm specifying video id and comment editing so the whole primary key and this is my delete statement let me run it and why not i can run again my select you see guess what zero rows now uh just a side remark the update and the delete share much more than it looks actually a delete is very similar to an update in the sense that deletions in cassandra work by inserting special values special things in the in the table called tombstones that mark the fact that that row that value has been deleted so actually no surprise that they look very similar and in both cases you have to specify the primary key to work on a single row okay so as you see the row has disappeared after deletion and we got to the end of this small exercise now let me remind you you are encouraged to run through these instructions by yourself to better understand them to play a bit with them maybe you can invent your variations you can play a bit and in particular if you want to do please do the homework take a screenshot of the results of this select before and after deletion of the row to show that a row is actually disappeared and then please go to these sorry go to these scenarios here because they are very cool and they guide you in a hands-on way and they make you learn a bit more about cassandra and how to how it works and how you operate it okay that being said uh i can give it back to you alex yeah thank you so much for their great job i will grab the screen back in a second [Music] so doesn't matter if you followed the uh lab right now with stefano you can do it also later and we do suggest you to do it because well practice is golden and just the bro knowledge won't really stick to your brain well enough it always works better than you practice and then you do it submit your homework as stefano explained it and we will issue a participation certificate or a page upgrade complete achievement to you now if you want to practice more there are slash data stocks slash courses cassandra intro and in general plenty of great courses at catacoda.com data stacks there's very many interesting things and you don't have to install anything it's all available in the cloud so it can be a very good chance for you to improve your knowledge and main place for uh main place for us to meet afterwards is academy.datastart.com because there you can pass the real full course to become cassandra certified developer or administrator don't forget to grab your voucher it's a limited offer so you don't want to miss it stephanie may ask you to copy paste the link to the voucher again in the chat please absolutely yeah we have a lot of great questions today and we have a lot of great attendees today so by no circumstances i want you to miss your uh chance to get your voucher uh later yeah sorry i'm based in the voucher form but please uh since the results of feedback when where we ask you what is the workshop you like most maybe you might want to wait until you see all of them yeah anyway before answering because there is still much more to come in both rooms so yeah right here's here's it it's open already by the way so i believe we are right on time yes thank you so much for attending it and what's our next plan okay so sorry yeah i'm going no no okay so now we have a break because we are at the end of the workshop core cassandra we have a break uh in a edt time it's now it's 1 45 we have a break until 2 30. so 45 minutes of break and then we reconvene for the quiz uh right chat then i believe we are done for now stay tuned jump in after the break take your chance to win the prizes and see you then in 45 minutes right right perfect okay then thank you so much for coming in uh you have a great questions it's nice to see how professional our community today and have a great time see you soon see you

john lee and you know me already but john could you please introduce yourself hi hi everyone and good to have you here um i'm only about two and a half months and new to the data stack family and um i'm very happy to join this community um so thank you very much i'm based off australia and i look forward to have a chance to interact with you um both now and in the future thank you uh but where exactly in australia are you located by the way i'm based out of sydney okay so looks like you have at least one neighbor of ours jeremy hannah i believe he is moving to sydney or something like that i'm not so good in australian geography sorry guys i promised to become veteran then so whatever we have to start with the questions and that's how it works first you go to mentee.com mostly we recommend you to go with your phone it's the easiest way to participate and use the code 6133 9063 as it's stated by stefano already in the chat or i will give you something better maybe you can just scan this qr code next to john and or pick the code next to me six one free free nine zero six free and please join i believe we have uh you have a very high chance today to win some prizes from data stocks so let's see how it goes meanwhile we will start with the simple questions it's not the quiz yet but just to make you familiar with the mentee so you will know how to push for button and first question is what's your experience with relational database management systems uh what what do you use doesn't matter my sequel postgrad oracle doesn't matter for us at this moment because the idea of sql is the same for all of them and we want to know what's your experience with them to understand you better okay looks like we have people with some experience already which is great uh or even a little experience also sound good to us if you [Music] not so much experience than that that's not a big deal for us but uh of course it will be easier for you to get data modeling uh better good but at least all of you have some experience that's already great meanwhile don't wait jump in because quiz starts very soon now what's your experience with nosql databases okay now distribution is a little bit different so we have people with some no secret experience okay some complete newcomer in nosql world um no rule in a room [Laughter] yeah but of course distribution is a bit different people use it to have more experience with relational databases than with non-relation what's your experience with apache cassandra or datastax enterprise astra okay uh someone has answered it known but you know what if you attended the cassandra fundamentals workshop you already have general understanding i believe i did my work well so and eric ramirez and stefano latini answering questions in chat also so i believe you already have general understanding but we don't have uh too much apache cassandra x experts today which is also very fine okay thank you so that's the last yeah let's rock uh let's roll and that is a lot last call for you to join the game and pursue your chance to win the prizes so last 10 seconds and this is getting more pain yeah okay give me one more and we will start i see we have a lot of attendees that is good but we can have more so 10 more seconds 10 more seconds okay will i have one more okay time is over if you miss the first question you will have lesser chance to win now the competition begins now oh yeah finally now we will have questions and it's important to answer fast now so you get more points if you um watch us on youtube then mostly probably you do youtube has some solid delay so easiest way for you to have higher chances read questions on your mobile phone they will appear a little bit faster than on youtube okay so you will have more chances to win let ladies and gentlemen we start and let's go answer fast to get more points how many masternodes does cassandra need at least three per cluster three per data center not a single one enough to maintain consistency how do you think yeah how do you think how many masternodes does cassandra need okay now i'm very curious okay ah some of you paid attention to what we said but some of you did not really well take a look so john how many master nodes does cassandra need well like like what is on the screen not not a single one it's uh or peer-to-peer right right cassandra is decentralized peer-to-peer that is uh not like free per cluster or free per dc the concept of masternode does not exist in cassandra there is no thing like a masternode and cassandra is decentralized so now let me see the winners and who gave the fastest answer looks like it was george with 971 point great job george and homer following him pretty close well then let's take a look on what's going on then on the next question and that's question number two so answer fast to get more points executing select query without the partition key is the recommended way to retrieve the data the right way a way if the data was inserted without a partition key a way to full clusters come illegal and punishable by law they have some interesting options here i'll pick illegal and punishable by law i'm absolutely with you on that so right answer select query without partition key is a way to pull cluster scan and it's bad and you do not want to have it and we do believe what it must be illegal and punishable by law but not yet we will work are we you know what we have to work with our legal department to make it happen maybe yeah and alex he'll come to you right right right so it's not the recommended way to retrieve data quite opposite it's the not recommended way and it's not the right way if the data was inserted without a partition key because you always must specify partition key when you insert data it just you cannot store date without a partition key so how did you make it okay homer makes a mistake and george made it right so now we have the list of the winners george such and jasper fan and alok was fastest but he made a mistake before very close yeah question number three answer fast to get more points how data is being distributed in cassandra cluster by partitions all data is replicated to each server with address locators or using post mail yeah everyone has bought it and looks like it was easy for you yes buy partitions and uh what do you think john about uh all data is being replicated to each server all right yeah i think it's is close it's a it's a close answer but yeah no data is not being replicated to each server because on a big scale like apple scale or netflix scale it will lead just to it will just simply not work because there is not a single server what can fit such sites so there is no need to replicate data to each server but the data is distributed by partitions okay so how was it a lock makes mistake hello can i see that was a mistake but dragonite was fastest good job and george such and jasper fun are still holding the first places yeah well wreck make a really good good recovery yes yes good recovery right well done let's go answer fast to get more points how to scale cassandra cluster vertically upgrading servers increasing scaling factor horizontally adding more servers don't scale cassandra performance is always enough that would be a nice option well i think if you use a data stack extra then you don't have to care about scaling right right right by the way that's a nice point is serverless so it will take care of the scaling for you but working with apache cassandra self-hosted you scale horizontally adding more servers and that's the right answer and there is no thing like scaling factor there is replication factor but it won't help you to scale out and vertically upgrading servers is the approach more traditional for relational databases but definitely not for cassandra okay so who was the fastest and who was the fastest hey george was fastest great job so yeah looks like i see homer make a good job getting very close to top three maybe if some of them will make the mistake he will catch up though let's take a look on what's going on ready i'm i'm rooting for you come on so which replication factor is recommended 1.5 3 15 42 there are some options but which replication factor is recommended everyone has vote oh that was simple take a look no one even answered wine 1.5 it's still my favorite option so far uh but i'm not really understand how it could work like half beat or half server not sure but the right answer is free indeed well done well done everyone now who is the fastest here yeah so who is the fastest this time a george game that's a good job okay okay it was easy let's take a look question six answer fast we get more points cassandra cluster can be deployed on aws only any combination of cloud providers and premises data centers only one cloud provider of your choice sega mega drive in case you need it i think it's a competition or who is the fastest the answer is very clear right any combination of cloud providers and on-premises we have really focused audience today because normally there are mistakes on this question but you did it all great well job everyone but who was the fastest okay so just for fun was the fastest getting to a second place overtaking such good okay okay okay okay so next question question number seven answer fast to get more points cassandra cluster can have multiple data centers wrong single cluster can have only one data center correct but not more than two data centers correct some data centers are passive correct all data centers are available for read and write okay and time is up correct all data centers are available for read and write first option is wrong single cluster can have many data centers second option sorry no i wanted to say that's why that's why cassandra is so powerful in in speed and performance yes yes remember so cluster can have more than two data centers uh and all data centers are always active so you can write to any of them so the right answer correct odcs are available for read and write and most of you made the good job so who made a mistake oh such is making mistake and that means what homer will take his chance and okay at least getting closer not yet and unlocks returning to the sixth place that is a good job danny then he was the fastest one but he is only starting to grow on the leaderboard and we are in the second part of this quiz question number eight keep going and answer fast cap theorem claims what in case of failure c a and p are all guaranteed only a is guaranteed only two or three capabilities are guaranteed we will need a new cap so right such audience today that's incredible right nothing to explain you all got the idea okay but who was the fastest okay george is leading still leading but i have to say what just for fun is just like 300 points difference to george it's not too much yeah question number nine answer fast to get more points recommended way to reach immediate consistency is read write one one read write one all read write quorum quorum uh viva video chat you know i don't know when i need to reach chemist consistency with my colleagues i always use a video chat maybe it's a recommended way for cassandra to for me it works okay no one no one picked video chat so the right answer is quorum quorum read write one one won't lead you to immediate consistency at all moreover with some big chances it can lead you to not inconsistency so that's wrong and read write one all though technically does lead you to immediate consistency one plus three four four higher than three mathematics works read write one all will give you immediate consistency but it's not the recommended way that's why this answer is wrong read write quran quorum is the recommended answer so maybe alex maybe they can video chat you next time right when you want to yes i will happy to have more friends on slack yeah take a look he did it homer made it to the top three hey great job man and danny danny richie is the fastest again keeping keep his climbing on the leaderboard that is a great job so it's so exciting it's like watching a horse race yes yes yes it's really exciting i love queens is my favorite part of the cassandra day so it is currently spring in in springtime in australia so there's a lot of horseradish so this is this has the same feeling i have to admit i never have been on any kind of horse races so maybe i will attend one when i will visit australia hopefully springtime springtime let's go so springtime i will remember uh then question number 10 so answer fast to get more points what is a key space what is a key space it's organized into rows and columns it contains tables and defines replication it's defined with partition key and contains rows it's the place to store keys how it goes and who will make the right answer okay most of you made it uh it's organized into rows and columns no it's a table what's organized into rows and columns uh and it's defined it with a partition key and contains rows no it's a partition so right answer it contains tables and defines replication and some other settings what we don't cover today so oh that is getting interesting just for fun makes a mistake so homer gets to the second place and rakhavendra already gets to a third place overtaking just for fun but not for too many points meanwhile home george looks like the only guy who did no mistakes as far as i remember and we are getting to the next question [Music] and notice danny is fastest again so now he's on the seventh place already despite missing the beginning of the quiz he is clumping higher and higher that is interesting question 11 answer fasts to get more points what is required in the cassandra table data columns clustering columns partition keys nothing is required everything is allowed okay so what is required in cassandra tables partition keys it was easy right partition keys data columns are optional partition keys are required so who was the fastest this time oh homer i cannot believe come on unbelievable he falls down from the top three george's fastest again and rakhavendra got to the second place with jasper fun return it to the top three only top three places are getting prizes so question number two stays there jasper homer come on battle goes on so answer fast to get more points cassandra tables contain multiple partitions only rows and columns replication factors endless seas of dreams and fears um i can relate to that yeah i do can understand that is good okay now take a look that was very important question uh because i want again highlight a thing take a look if you underestimate the importance of the partitions if you don't care about the partitions enough two bad things will happen first of all you will have a bad data model because of that and because of their bad data model second thing will happen cassandra's greatest performance scalability and so on is a shared responsibility if you don't do your work cassandra cannon does uh its own work so it won't work as it can and don't blame cassandra cassandra does its part her part very well believe me so remember cassandra tables contain partitions and partitions contains rows and if you forget about that you will have problems not with me well with me too but first of all with your production cluster so how it goes here oh my god okay that was unexpected and homer gets to the second place and george is doing amazing job looks like we know the winner already but second and third place the third is a very minor difference between such and rakhavendra and jasper fun is still close and danny by the way denny got to the sixth place out of blue out of a blue that's a great job that is a competitive soul i like it let's go and we are getting close to the end and that's question 13. couple more questions answer to get more points how cassandra executes joins joins in cassandra require dedicated joint table just like in sql it doesn't it does button kinda lazy so how cassandra executes joins and time is up so answer is simple cassandra does not execute joins cassandra it's a nosql database there are no foreign keys and no joins in cassandra why stefano will explain you in the second workshop so stay tuned and let's go okay i can't believe the competition is so interesting today there are and take a look then he made it to the fourth place already using me by powers yeah fastest and that is a killing spree of the right answers fast enough and that's the fourth one watch out for danny and homer they still have a good chance to get into number top three yes yes yes so such must be worrying today and rakhavendra is also i guess only george can just skip this question and still he secured his first place already even if he will get no uh points he already have won that is interesting i'm sure i'm sure george still wants to compete for the fastest so let's not discourage right right right fastest title is a big honor i would say so ladies and gentlemen you know what's going on to happen right now that's last question of our quiz so breath out breath in warm up and stretch your fingers and get ready because we go for the last question quite complex question so please now put on your game face you know what to do answer fast to get more points single data center cluster of 8 servers how many servers we have to add to double the performance 4 8 12 it's not possible to double the performance in a single dc how many servers you have to add to double the performance in this scenario considering our data model done right disclaimer yes that was a competition you gave you gave the hint uh in previous questions right right of course of course so let's take a look right answer with the data model done right to double the performance you have to double their account of servers easy is that that's called let's call it linear scaling and you it's a great feature it's just incredible feature what is available only on a very limited amount of a databases and cassandra is definitely one of them so answer 12 12 of course will help you to double the performance but it's definitely overkill it's not possible to double the performance in a single dc no it's possible and finally three people answer it four you know what uh there are some laws of physics and uh if you live in the place when you can double performance by half of the servers let tell me let me know where do you leave because i want to move to your place that just sounds magical but in the real life with no unicorns in dragons it's not possible in this case so right answer is second and we proceed to the leaderboard you know what uh john i am really nervous at this point me too me too oh oh oh oh oh oh that is something and he made it you know what i do congratulate job george it was incredible job it was just really incredible job such also very close couple of mistakes but overall very good performance but danny it was really well well well well done like smoothly question but question missed a couple of questions in the beginning that was smooth i know george george to not josh need to go back to the your pre question and answer the survey as uh guru in cassandra yeah i think he deserved that yes yes sure sure absolutely now i congratulate the winners winners george such denny please make a screenshot of your phone or whatever you use and send it to jack dot friar at datastax.com uh it's on youtube chat thanks stefano uh to claim your price now if you are not in top three but still of the leaderboard i do congratulate you because even to be on leaderboard in our uh competition it's already a big honor and finally for everyone you know what our prizes are nice but let's say we don't send out ferraris or we lost in italy sorry maybe we should but next cassandra day maybe maybe but what really matter is your knowledge and with your knowledge you get today and still getting on the other workshops you can be a better engineer better developer have better salary better job title and so on and so forth so you can be a better expert and that what matters in the end so i congratulate you with the participation it was a very smart smart move to join us now what's going on next we will have a next workshop in this room i do recommend you to attend we will have stefano latini speaking about data model done right and that's essential data model right is that essence is the key to be successful with cassandra it's the most important workshop of the day and in the second room we will have some more talks now starting let me check the schedule next will be uh kate sandra with jonathan jonathan will show and tell how do you run apache cassandra on kubernetes with kate sandra our special open source project which is very interesting if you are into infrastructure and kubernetes so much recommended then make your decision stay here for data modeling workshop we start in a couple of minutes or switch to the next room for kate sandra thank you so much for joining john thank you so much for being with us today thank you thank you yeah i do want to tell uh all the participants here um go spread the word um take what you learned today on cassandra and spread the word uh we we need to increase our community we need to increase the number of user that's using cassandra and hopefully the next time i run this because of you spreading the word we can get bigger sponsorship and give out better prices right right and moreover we will have cassandra day australia next year and maybe you will be already certified cassandra developers and maybe you can be our speakers we accept call for papers so go uh make some fun with cassandra and submit for uh call for papers next year and we will be happy to accept it fantastic okay so now we are going for a moment to [Music] hold on and we will get back to you in a moment so please stay tuned i have to switch to the next i'm sorry okay see you soon bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one and welcome back and applications with stefano and i will be mostly answering questions in the chat but i will be happy to do so so um i've seen the quiz how it went congratulations it's been a tough challenge for those of you congratulations to the winner i hope it's been fun and entertaining now it's time to get serious again and let's talk about data modeling yeah so data modeling in other words how not to shoot yourself in the foot with apache cassandra okay so before we start let me just remind you of a few things that have been said already this morning um this whole day is still will be recorded and available on youtube so you can go and watch it again and everything anytime you want for the questions you know that you can ask them in the chat where alex and i will be keeping an eye on maybe something somebody else as well but maybe it's even better if you put your questions in the in the q a site so we can discuss them in a couple of hours from now or you can and you are encouraged to reach us and join us on our discord channel the fellowship of the cassandra ring where we can discuss and answer your question and help you and whatever without end so as opposed to the youtube chat the discord the friendship will stay okay so we are going to there are a few other links that give you various ways to get information on cassandra and connect with us so please consider that and maybe you can also want to follow us on youtube uh okay so get ready for two hours about data modeling now uh another few another little uh point is that we are going to review some of the things that you've seen already this morning but a bit of familiarity with the cassandra might help today and in a sense also some familiarity with a relational database might help but it might also be an obstacle and you will see what i mean by that another point is that uh today i will speak about cassandra i will use i will by cassandra i will mean in a very broad sense either apache cassandra or datastax enterprise which is a commercial uh fork on it of it or even the astra db which is built on apache cassandra and this is the product that that you've been using this morning for the little exercise with it together because they share the same interface so and the same underlying uh architecture as far as we are concerned at least okay so who am i uh we met this morning already i'm stefano i'm a developer advocate at datastax and this is my these are my contacts and you are encouraged to reach me and to keep in contact with me so let's start let's start and what will uh what we will see today first we will have a bit of introduction on cassandra which partially overlaps with what alex has already told you but we will you know repeating some basic points about cassandra might help for what comes next and what comes next well we will start our journey to a data modeling technique in cassandra and we will start by looking at what is denormalization then we will have a closer look at how data is structured and organized and stored in cassandra which is important to have to understand what are the right ways and the allowed ways to query data with that knowledge we will finally look at data modeling process proper which is a very cassandra thing so data modeling in cassandra you will see is a very specific thing and pretty upside down compared to many other databases okay um that would be the the most important part of this workshop and after that we will complete your tool belt with a few other features and a few other opportunities to structure your data and your data access patterns in cassandra okay so let's start with an introduction introduction uh alex are we all right in the chat yes all good very sure okay so let me remind you that you can leave your questions in the chat or even better in the q a website so after this workshop we will have the ask me anything session and we will have more time to devote to your questions okay so what is data modeling uh because you know this morning you have been playing a bit with a database no we've been inserting data after creating a table reading data changing data and deleting data very nice but probably your real business application will have to do something more it will have to have a database structured in the right way to make your application your complex application work indeed data modeling is the act the process of building the data building the structure of your database so that your application works as best as good as possible data modeling starts by investigating uh what is your application and it will lead to the point where you can actually create the tables so create the physical structure of your database okay so before looking at data model in itself let's remind us what cassandra is cassandra apache cassandra is a high performance database and it is a nosql database it is fairly powerful in various ways but as many times power comes uh with the need to control it so you need to be able you need to know how it works and how to use it to harness and to [Music] to express this power okay so when we say high performance we mean size [Music] cassandra is able to deal with very large quantities of data the so-called big data at the web scale cassandra is able to cope with hundreds of petabytes database which is a lot it is really a lot of data think about that and what is cool is that this database can work on commodity hardware so you don't have to buy very expensive super computers high performance means means also speed in particular but not only that writing speed so cassandra is optimized to be very fast also in writing which is usually a pain point for some for many other databases indeed cassandra is able to is able to to support tens of thousands of operations per second per node uh when i say per node i mean per machine because cassandra is born to be distributed very distributed so one database can be spread across hundreds thousands even more nodes which means machines virtual machines whatever and the database is built from the ground up to be able to work in this kind of very distributed environment and also that can be geographically spread all over the world okay so what do we mean by nosql database this morning we had a small remark about the nosql being something like invertebrates so it's more like a definition of what something is not so nosql means that it goes beyond the usual relational transactional database paradigm and there are many ways to go to to be nosql not necessarily much related to one another but cassandra takes a particular approach to that we will see we will see it uh a big point is that there are no joints there are no foreign keys there are no transactions and those are all uh compromises to that cassandra chooses in order to offer you its astonishing performance but the consequence of these is that the way you model your data is radically different from a relational database approach you will see it okay so cassandra is powerful but you have to learn how to express this power because it's in a sense it's easy to get the data model wrong and it's particularly easy if you make the mistake of thinking as alex said this morning of thinking of cassandra as a relational database without join tables without joins and that's it because it's much more than there's much more to it to to have a successful data model and this requires a bit of knowledge of the internals at least how the data is handled and stored and grouped and distributed in cassandra okay another important point for about cassandra is the distinction between oltp and all up now it's not a distinction it's more like a continuous spectrum there is if you want you can place your databases on an axis the access between oltp on one side and olap on the other side um oltp stands for online transaction processing and it is the kind of workload of databases where so it is the kind of workload where your application needs to access very often a lot of rows one by one in very simple ways so you go to one row you change a value and that's it you go to one row you write a value or you read a value and that's it usually those are simple operations but there are usually a lot of them and they have to be almost real time so there might be something right behind my application right behind the table that stores information about the number of i don't know the number of items in in your store something like that so they have to be real almost real time fast reliable and usually it's always always the same kind of queries write these read that and they don't change to so much this is oltp uh on the other end of the spectrum you have olap olap which is online analytical processing is the kind of workload where you have very complex queries very complex ways of squeezing and treating and changing and analyzing and connecting your data and that might be something like the very complex analytics that runs every week to squeeze insights which make you optimize your online store the day after so very complex recommendation associations analysis of various kinds and they usually involve a lot of joints they are heavy they make they need to coordinate and to compare data from various places in your database and these are fairly complex and long-running queries luckily usually they are not facing directly the client the customer they are more something like an internal kind of thing my analytics department works for me and they provide me with a report a weekly report that then i use to do better of better structure my my offers my special offers for example such queries usually are a never-ending prototype so they are changed tweaked all the time and nobody requires them to be real time so you see those are two very different kind of things and there is everything in the middle so it's not a discrete kind of thing now relational databases in a sense sit somehow in the middle of that and they are more or less good at everything within some scale constraints now cassandra is focused on the oltp side so cassandra is very good and very fast at supporting a lot of simple queries simple reads simple rights that's not to say that this is the only thing that you can do with cassandra because there are layers and plugins that you can use on top of cassandra's the storage engine but cassandra in itself shines on the oltp site that's one very important point now alex you wanted to say something uh yes but a very simple thing i believe we as always have a lot of attendees with experience of small to medium-sized projects and that may sound a little bit not clear for them as it was unclear for me like so many years ago because we use it to use these multi-purpose databases yeah and um i we use it to the situation what our database can answer all the queries we want to have in the project of a bigger size that's already very often case when you have multiple types of different databases purpose built databases for different scenarios that's especially now great approach with the growth of microservices or servitor service oriented architectures and now we more and more often think of not a single database per project but multiple databases per project uh working in the collaboration when you have cassandra as a customer facing database because your customers don't want to wait and then you have something a site working collaborating with cassandra maybe solar maybe elasticsearch uh maybe about spark which like building a team team work is uh perfect work and then together it may answer all kind of a queries and that's uh much more often case of course for medium to big size projects yeah absolutely so specialization uh increases over time as technologies get more and more refined and the best result comes from using the best of every word so to speak so yes i agree completely okay so cassandra as the this is a slide similar to one you saw this morning so i'll go very quick on that cassandra is able to to deal with very big data is it can be configured to be very highly available because it doesn't have a single point of failure it is you can you can configure it to be able to sustain a loss of entire data centers if you want it is it can be geographically distributed or generally speaking distributed which means everything you saw this morning of the cup theorem so you have to do to pick your choices between c a and p uh it is optimized for reading and writing thanks to its very clever internal architecture and what's in what's also very important it is vendor independent so it is open source protected by the apache license on the other hand there are some cons in a sense of cassandra so it might require qualified engineers that's true because it's not very it it let's say sometimes it's not very easy to manage but that can be you and speaking of that let me remind you that on the on the job market being a cassandra specialist usually means uh having access to higher pays and better jobs because there it's there is much uh need now in the job market for cassandra specialists and guess what we offer for free to you today we offer a free voucher to try and and go and take the exam for being cassandra certified and also as for studying the academy we give is for free so please go ahead there will be some more information on that later today another point is that cassandra is not has a reputation of being hard to manage that's sometimes true so it has its own complexities yes but if that scares you there are managed solutions so you saw one this morning right astrodb okay so another point as alex remarked as is that cassandra is oltp specific that's true but it is very easy to integrate cassandra with analytic solutions such as apache spark for example another observation is that cassandra has limited search capabilities especially when it comes to the fancy searches such as nlp kind of indexing and similar stuff but again in the spirit of a collaboration between technologies it's very easy to plug search engines such as those lucine based solar or elasticsearch on top of cassandra so those those cons are actually not much of a problem they just need to be to be approached the right way okay so let me give you a teaser before jumping to the next section let's go back to data modeling so the way you do data modeling in cassandra is very different from what you would do in a relational database and this table is a brief summary of that so relational databases work with joins and indexes between tables in cassandra you you use the concept of denormalization that you will see soon relational databases are based on the idea of referential integrity cassandra doesn't so cassandra says goodbye to referential integrity which however would not scale well when it comes to very big data and very distributed systems so that's a forced choice so to speak in a relational database the primary key is used to guarantee uniqueness of rows while in cassandra it is much more because it is also related to how data is partitioned and you will see it is also related to how you can access data you can query data when you model your data to have your application work in a relational database you start with the entities while in cassandra you start with the queries so the query will determine the tables that this concept will be will come more more and more later which in other words means that when you model your data in a relational database you start with the data and you end up with the application while in cassandra it's the other way around you start by looking at your application and you end up building your data structures so this is a very short account and the rest of today will be basically devoted to expanding on this one table okay so alex can i go ahead yes please we are good oh great okay thanks okay so denormalization now let's start with normalization normalization is a old and venerable idea that is more than 50 years old and it is somehow the idea that uh is the pillar of the relational databases the idea of normalization is to enforce data integrity by uh having some formal requirements on table that in a sense boil down to one concept you will not duplicate information so let's say there are tables to relate recipes and ingredients such as pizza which is made by mozzarella and champignons well the point is that you will not write pizza more than once you will not write mozzarella more than once in your database you see there is one pizza one mozzarella and the relation between them is that is made in is is created by means of a third table that is just a table containing relations okay so that's all nice and good and it's a formally mathematically if you want it's a very good idea very elegant but on the practical side as you just as you start to go in to more complex situations than this three-table example you will start to have slow joints so when you have to get your data in the in the in the form your application needs you will start to have very complex joins very complex data queries which means very slow so your application will start to be a bit slow and so this is just another way of looking at the same three tables this is how you would create and populate tables of ingredients recipes and recipe ingredients in sql in a relational database and yeah there is a good thing in this schema so you first look at the word you describe entities in the word with as many tables as there are entity types then you create a other tables for the relations and then whatever kind of information you need you can just write the right query you can have many queries on these tables and that's it so that's handy on one side but still even just to know what are the ingredients of a pizza requires you see this select with a which has two joints so it's really not very it's a bit unwield you know to to to have to write such a thing think about a real life application that would probably boy that would probably soon explode to a lot of joins a very complex query and it's a bit of a mess on the long run okay so this is the situation that started to to appear so engineers in the relational databases as the amount of data started to increase the problem was that if if the database is relational but the amount the amount of data increases at some point the queries are just too slow if you want to comply with data integrity and to have a lot of joins in your queries it's just it just starts to be too slow so one thing is slow one thing is a slowness of these queries the other is that maybe one single computer one single machine started to be too too small for the big data but in particular speaking of of the speed even in the norm even in the relational world uh engineers started to to compromise the ideal formal idea of normalization and started to you know break the rules a bit so for the sake of having faster queries i duplicate the data here and there secretly a bit of a clandestine thing just in order to have faster queries because usually what usually it is reads that have to be very fast because usually it's mostly reads behind my application and if reads are fast and if i prepare denormalized data in my tables and reads are fast then my customers will not abandon my website to go to the competitor so there was a very compelling reason to start in doing this now you get the point this idea that was a bit of a secret a dirty secret in the relational world started to to be sort of the only way to have acceptable performance and look at this table i have a horribly non-normal form table where pizza appears more than once pizza mozzarella pizza champignons this is these are just two rows but if i want to know the ingredients for a pizza here it's a simple query and it's probably going to be very fast um now what what cassandra does is let's take this idea and make it the the pillar the tenant of how you model data in cassandra so let's say goodbye to normal forms and just accept denormalization as the right way to high performance and to big data indeed that's basically the principle that underlies the way cassandra wants you to structure data so you can formulate this idea also in another way namely let's have redundant data no problem with that i can duplicate my information i can duplicate every piece of data as much as i need in order to achieve a very important goal every query has to go to a single table no queries shall look at more than one table so you see this uh there's a sketch at the bottom of the slide on the left you have the relational case every query has to look at various tables and do some stuff look at the right case in cassandra every query has its own table at least every query goes to one single table easy linear no joins indeed cassandra has no joints there are no joints there was also a question in the quiz there are no joints in cassandra so you sort of have to prepare your data for those queries to be the queries you need so there are no other ways to get your data this is for sure a faster way of accessing your data there is also a detail that if you pre-cook your data and sort of perform the join at right time so you collate your data duplicate and then you write to a single table like pizza pizza pizza as you saw before if you do that when you write then you can perform this api side joins or application side joins you can do them in parallel while the joins of a relational database usually have to be executed sequentially so you cannot do a join before the previous one is finished so to speak not only that but usually as we said it's right can wait a bit longer than reads and this is a design that sort of goes hand in hand with this point because at the end every read that is slow is a customer lost and customer lost to competitors is not good and you might also complain yes but now i'm duplicating data i will spend a lot of money on on hard disks who cares hard disks are cheap right storage is cheap losing customers isn't so that's a bit of a practical motivation obviously there are some drawbacks because once you are responsible to maintaining these duplicated data coherent then it's you your drivers or your application will have to deal for example with writing in multiple places the same data yes but we are grown-ups and that's a price that we are usually willing to pay for the sacred sake of having faster applications right so performance important okay so this point of the normalization is very important and we can summarize it like this every column you need for a query has to go to one table all of them there will be no joins and queries are going to be very simple that's it so one table per query as we said you remember the small sketch that was on the previous slide that's implies that when you when you're writing the database for your application you start by looking at the queries and then you build the tables because you can't just do joins after words okay and don't forget that's a bit odd to relational guys but redundancy is your friend so yes you're duplicating data no problem that's okay that's so it's a law of cassandra that every query goes to a single table and usually since queries determine the shape of the table most often it's also that every table is built for one single query not necessarily but usually that's the case or almost the case okay so that brings to a point um queries are so important and they determine the shape of the tables so we have to look closely at how our tables structured okay so we've been seeing uh how what what is the idea and the implication of the normalizing data i hope that's clear because that's a very foundational concept alex how are we all good on the chat all good so okay let's move on uh sorry keys and partitions in apache cassandra so we you have seen already uh something about this let's uh look at it again okay so as we were saying the the structure of a table in cassandra is very is a very important point because it defines what is uniqueness in your table uniqueness of rows not only that but it also defines how the rows are grouped together and are distributed in the nodes and it also defines what are the queries that you can legally run on a table or at least the queries that you can do you can run on a table in production without you know grinding your cluster to a painful stop a painful production non-production kind of performance okay so we have to have a bit of a look at the tables and let's go so let's start with a familiar concept to relational database experts uniqueness you saw this morning that a table in cassandra is a table in the usual way so it is like a spreadsheet no it is a series of rows and columns like you see here so there is here a sample table we still we stay in the in the recipe example and now i'm thinking of an application uh that is a bit like a youtube for recipes so there are recipes and there are food experts who live reviews on recipes so you see there are various reviewers leaving a rating and a comment to pizza and cake and other recipes on several dates that's a simple table an example a sample table and it's very good to to use this as the running example throughout this presentation okay so back to uniqueness we want to be able to store rows in this table in a way that got in and we have to determine a primary key that is a choice of columns that defines uniqueness of rows what do i mean i want to be able to store different reviews in different rows without one overwriting the other on the other hand i want to be able to i don't want to be able to i don't want to have several rows by mistake several different rows that actually are the same review so i have to choose not too many not too few columns in the primary key the principle is that i cannot have two rows with the same primary key values and look at this table i have recipe name pizza for example i have a date i have the reviewer name such as anita carl etc i have a rating and i have a comment which is a free text field and this table reviews by recipe uh has not a primary key yet now what are the possible choices for the primary key let's have a look i can i could choose just recipe name as primary key but remember that i cannot have two rows with the same value for recipe name so that rules out this choice because you see i have three different reviews by different reviewers on pizza and i want them to be three different rows so that's not good so uh for the sake of uniqueness of rows i want to add reviewer at least so every every row has a different pair recipe name reviewer pizza anita pizza carl cake poldo and so on so that would be good let's think about adding rating as well but that is a bit strange right because i cannot it doesn't make sense to have the same recipe the same reviewer maybe the same date as well and different and two different ratings so uh is is the rating eight or two so it doesn't make sense to have everything equal except for rating so i will not add rating to the primary key because that's not the word i want to describe but now the question is recipe name reviewer or recipe name reviewer and date that's actually not well basically it's up to me so what is the application what is the kind of word i want to describe or better in my application are reviewers allowed to leave several reviews for the same recipe in different days yes no it depends that's not that's depends on on [Music] on me designing my application so this choice will have a consequence on what is the primary key so whether i allow or not to basically store the history of vote of ratings by the same person on the same recipe so let's say that we want us to store the history so we will allow our viewer to leave several ratings on different days to a given recipe so primary key will be these three fields recipe name date reviewer which i mark in blue just to to make it clear now this table is starting to look like a proper table right and if you see there is no triple of values which is the same on different rows very good uniqueness okay so there is a point obviously if i want to insert a row or even update a row i will have to provide these three values because otherwise i'm not identifying a particular row this is a concept we saw this morning already in the little exercise we did okay um now maybe i will skip this okay no let's just mention it uh now you see i'm using recipe name just the word the literal string pizza as the as the the field the value of the field i might want to introduce a recipe id which is referenced in a in a table that associates this id to pizza another id to cake that's okay so the choice between organic or surrogate keys is really up to us and it depends on what are the exact pathways the exact access patterns my application needs so okay let's just go ahead we today we will just stick to the organic key and we'll use pizza itself for the sake of simplicity but that's really not not compulsory okay so much for the primary key now let's look at partitioning which is a cassandra specific concept okay so there is a subset of the primary key fields at least one of the columns but maybe more maybe all of them which is the partition key and that is the example that is a concept that you saw this morning and it is uh the partition key decides how the rows will be grouped together and how will be they how they will be distributed and scattered through the cluster nodes basically you saw that different rows with the same partition key value will always be together while several partitions are in general spread over the nodes in the cluster and this is not just a hidden technical detail with deep in the belly of the cassandra architecture on the contrary this has very deep implications on your data model and you have to be very careful about that because that's one of the most important parts so let's look at an example we had this table and you remember that recipe name name date and reviewer are the part are the primary key now let's say recipe name is the partition key which means that every row about pizza will be so all the rows about pizza will be together all the rows about salad will be together and maybe there will be on another note so what you see here is a seven class seven node cluster and uh well it's probably a mess to look at these because we have a replication factor three which means that every partition so what you are seeing is a single table but every partition is repeated on three nodes so and that's good that's production but today i want to lower replication factor to one so it's a bit easier to to read and here we go so i have all rows with pizza grouped together because pizza recipe name is the partition key i have all rows with pasta grouped together and so on now i also have if you look at the lower right there is a node hosting both the pi partition and the fish partition that's not a problem so usually you have several partitions on a single node yes what you will never have is one partition split and half of it on one node and half of another node that will never happen because that's the essence of partition the essence of partitioning is all rows with the same values are together okay so this is what we said i will not spend time on these because this is basically what alex explained this morning with the the partitioner the hashing algorithm and the token ranges a very important point is that the your queries will always have to look at a single partition in order to be performant and to be able to scale with a large number of nodes and to be constant time access constant access time sorry okay let's look at the same table well basically the same table because it's the same primary key but i just choose another partitioning now you might appreciate that this is the table partitioned by recipe name and this is the same table partitioned by recipe name reviewer if you look closely the way the data is scattered around is completely different because there's a different partitioning so now the groups the partitions are couples recipe name reviewer so there will be a partition of salad aldo another one of pizza zoe pie can fish carl and so on and generally speaking this will be many more smaller partitions probably i can guess my point is that the way the same rows are placed and grouped here is completely different and since your queries will have to go and get a single partition now you see that depending on your query you will have to choose a different partitioning so different queries usually means different partitions now you might ask what is the right choice for this table well that really depends what is your query is the question so if you if you if you know that you want to get all pizza reviews at once you will have to partition by pizza if your application only ever needs to get the part the reviews for a given recipe by a given person then probably you might want to choose the second way of partitioning so by recipe name and reviewer and that's really depending on what is what your application is doing what kind of queries it will need to run and there is a consequence of this um there might be the case where you need to do different queries on the same data so you have your bunch of recipes and you want to group them you want to get all recipes about pizza but at the same time you want to get all recipes or sorry all reviews by a reviewer by anita so you if you followed so far you might imagine that there is no partitioning able to satisfy both indeed why don't you create two tables that's it and that's exactly what you are supposed to do you just create two tables same data different partitioning and the two kind of queries will be run against either table that's it remember that duplicating data is absolutely okay no problem performance yeah and that's the point so you can see now why uh relational trained uh engineers find it sometimes a bit odd but this is this is really the way to go so in this sense it's not only one table per query which is unavoidable but in most cases it's really one query per table such as in this case remember that your application will need to write pairwise every time there is a new review it will have to write to two tables yes that's the price to pay that's not a big problem okay so uh now let me remind uh you of a couple of points a couple of uh possible problems that uh you saw this morning already one is that sometimes your partitioning makes for a very uneven distribution of data in terms of quantity and load so i don't know about you but i like pizza much more than soup and i can imagine that in our website about food reviews if i partition by recipe name the partition about pizza will be constantly accepting new rights all the time it will be a big partition constantly being written while maybe the soup one will be just there small idle easy and this is the problem of the hot partition so because there is an uh imbalance in the distribution and this is a point to be careful about and when it comes to modeling your data this is one of the of the analysis you should do before creating before starting with your application when you when you model the data there is another problem which is you remember this morning it was in the example of the iot sensor table let's say i have partitioning by recipe name and reviewer and the years go by day after day and reviewers leave more and more reviews all the time well maybe this is not the case for reviews because you can support a lot of rows but theoretically at some point there will be partitions that grow and grow and grow and that's not good at some point i hit physical limits partitions should not be too big the solution you saw this morning is the bucketing so i can invent a new column like this year month string field they just constructed starting from the date column and i put it into the partitioning so i will sort of so jump to the next partition every month with the guarantee that no partition will ever grow forever now that means different queries yes and this is a a compromise to keep in mind but probably in my application i can afford fetching one month after the other i will probably not need to fetch all the history forever of the pizza by card so that's usually an acceptable solution okay so partitioning you need to know your partitioning and to pick the right one for your application otherwise your data model will suffer and will be suboptimal to say the least ideally we you will never have a query that looks at more than one partition which is summarized by the mantra stored together what you retrieve together you saw this this morning and that's absolutely true you should not design partitions that are too big so you see there are some limits that are better it is better to be to to steer clear of those limits to to have best performance while on the other hand if you have one row per partition that's okay that's no problem so you can have a lot of partitions very really a lot of partitions no problem indeed every time the partition key is the whole primary key you will have by definition one row per partition and that's absolutely fine then you have to be careful of having your the way the data and the load the right load is distributed should be as even as possible between partitions and that's it so these are all things to keep into account um stefano yes uh we have a very good question uh by chaser john uh we usually actually should have mentioned already before but better now than never so question is when you do bucketing in an example like that on pizza would you do it on a new table or modify existing tables with that solution in a sense i would say that's already a bit too late yeah if you so to speak yeah that's a i don't know do you want to yeah i i can take it situation is way much easier than it looks like uh you cannot change any part of a primary key neither partition key nor clustering columns cannot be altered so alter table exists and it is available but it can change on the data columns and primary key columns cannot be changed reason is very simple cassandra is designed to work efficiently with big data and there is a problem partition key defines how data is spread over cluster a clustering column defines how data stored on a disk changing on the clustering column would require to rewrite wall data of the table all across the cluster that can basically will make your nodes bc for ages and data bytes and the same right right the same with the partition key changing of a partition key would lead to repartitioning data all across the cluster which basically can take a week and there is no way to change primary key so if you um that's why that's one of the reasons why you should think ahead and do your data model ahead first think ahead and design and then do and if you uh you see the point is like uh in it's inevitable uh to have some change changes in the end for the really simple reason because uh that's like business changes requirements changes new users new workflows and so on so at some point you will find out yourself you have to migrate the data and yes you will have to design a new table and migrate the old data to the new table it happens uh well okay that means bucketing should be part of the initial modeling of the data yes exactly yes now very good question thank you yeah yeah thank you for the good question and let me just stress this point spending a bit of time on data modeling is always time well spent because if you think about about the cost and the pain of a migration live without downtime with your application already running in production it's really time well spent if you really plan well your data model let's say yeah but very good question anyway um okay so that's about partitioning and let's look at the other part of the primary key so primary key has different other columns that were not in the partitioning so they determine they are called clustering columns and they determine how the rows are sorted within the partition so in our case we had recipe name date and reviewer for the primary key but recipe name is the partition so in a partition we always have pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza now date and reviewer will be used to keep the rows with pizza sorted one to each other so if you look here clustering columns date and reviewer will be used to keep the rows sorted first by date and then by reviewer either ascending or descending but the point is that even in the belly of cassandra in the files that at the bottom of the run of the ladder are the physical ways the physical medium the rows are written even there the rows within the pizza partition will be sorted by that and cassandra you remember wants to be very fast at giving your your data back to you so cassandra will make it possible only to browse the rows within the partition sequentially but so cassandra scrolls through the partition in the clustering order only that means that yes you have a astonishing performance in reading but you have you are pretty constrained in the way you want to get your data within the partition you can't just jump here and there within the partition you have to look at sequential blocks of rows within your partition all of it part of it that's okay but still in that order so again how would you choose the clustering you look at your at your queries so re if you want so let's look at these two examples i have recipe name in the as a partition so i have a pizza partition but now my application might need to get all pizza reviews from a given date onward or i might want to need all pizza for all pizza reviews by john those two cases uh require the same partitioning but a different clustering because in the first case i will put the date first in the clustering columns and in the second date i will put reviewer in the first in the clustering columns because think of the constraint i have to i have to go sequentially without holes without the jumps within the partition when i read [Music] okay so that being said this is uh this is a create table statement in cql you saw cql this morning actually we run together we run a few create table commands this is how they were now create table name then there is a list of columns name with their type and then there is this primary key statement and you see a primary key specified the primary key in that order and in the recipe name part you see is in addition is enclosed in additional pair of parentheses which means this is the partition key then i can i can also specify the sorting order in of the clustering column so this is how i would create the table this example table okay so you will see that even the clustering order is defined when you create a table and then it cannot be changed because that would imply rewriting all the storage and that's absolutely not something that scales at all okay so a brief a quick summary of this section you have the primary key that is connected to the uniqueness of rows within the table part of it or all of it is the partition key which means how the rows are grouped and within every group every partition the sorting the ordering is determined by the clustering columns and that sorting will be followed when you read rows okay so now that the structure of the table is clear let's have a look at what are the implications for querying and let's start with writing so you are writing data on the tables this is something we did this morning we wrote a a handful of uh sample rows on tables but first i have to to say one thing for cassandra writing and writing just means writing so what i mean if you insert data or update rows it's the same almost okay let's forget about counters which are a separate special kind of column but if you forget about counter counters writing is just writing so inserting and updating are just absurd operations that means that cassandra wants to be very fast in writing right so it will never so it will not usually check if the rose is there or not and maybe give you an error oh look the row already exists you cannot write no it will not do that nobody will tell you wait this row this record exists already it will just write and if necessary it will overwrite and replace the value because last right wins another point is that when you insert or update which is the same basically when you insert a row you will need to to provide the full primary key because you have to identify that particular row you want to insert plus other data columns so you see this is a typical example of an insert nothing new you saw that this morning so i will go ahead let's speak about reading data so reading is done with select also also we saw this morning a few examples of select and uh well on a first look select statement in cql looks really much like sql select select fields from table where some conditions so this is how you get the reviews for pizza everything is good and nice and everything that's it but besides the syntax there are very many constraints that your select has to obey which ones well your query has to go to a single partition and when you read from a partition you will have to browse results in that particular order in the clustering order so what what do these two constraints mean well in particular let's look at the where part of a select so here sorry i'm coming back to this slide you see there is a where recipe name equal pizza and that's good that works but let's have a closer look i want to go to a single partition of every query has to go to a single partition that means that in the where part i have to specify the whole partition key with equal signs so recipe name equal pizza for example now i can specify clustering columns if i want i can also just leave the partition key and that's good because i'm getting it the whole partition that's okay but if i specify clustering columns i have to if i use a clustering column i also have to use all of the most significant clustering columns the one on its left and only the last one can have an inequality sign otherwise there there have to be equal signs okay that might sound a bit theoretical but the point is that i can only use where clauses that make it make the query fetch a contiguous chunk within the partition so remember how the clustering works and that defines what kind of where clauses i can use and by the way you just cannot use any other column in your where clause so that's very much different than a relational database right okay so uh by the way there is indeed actually there is a way to bypass these constraints and this is the infamous allow filtering parameter that's uh obviously something that you probably just want to do in testing or for very small tables in controlled environments this is sure not something you bring over to production please so let's not even consider that too much today okay so where closes the whole partition key with equal signs if clustering columns then all of them until up to a certain one and equal signs until the last so the the x with the exception of the last clustering column i specify that's just because of the underlying sorting within the partition okay so uh here you see five different where closes uh relative to the table you see here on the upper right and they are all good so the first one recipe name equal pizza good equal sign on the partition key good to go it will fetch the whole partition and that's okay the second one within the pizza partition will go for us a particular value of the date okay then it will fetch a part of the partition and a subset of it but a contiguous subset of it so all reviews with that date by maybe all every reviewer okay the third case is a query with within a partition and again there is an inequality there is a greater than for the date and that's okay because again if you think of the underlying order within the partition that's fine uh the fourth one will have an equal sign on the date and that's good and then also uh greater than on the reviewer but that's okay that's okay because again it will go to the partition and fetch a contiguous chunk of rows if you think about this clustering order that's legal same goes for the last one that has two different inequalities it has a range query on on the date that's okay because date is the first of the clustering columns and i can just specify a range in it so those are all valid legal where clauses let's look at these ones let me tell you all of every one of these queries of these where clauses fail for one reason or the other the first one looks at a column that is not even in the primary key so absolutely no the second one the same even if it specifies the the partition key still it is rating equal 9 that is just not acceptable that is not how query works in in cassandra the third one is an unequal inequality on the partition key that's not good because again this is such a query would have to look at potentially a lot of different partitions so no good the fourth one now that's interesting because yes it is it goes to a single partition but then it skips the date which is the first clustering column and just goes to the reviewer and again think about the sorting clustering order that would mean taking records within the partition with holes leaving holes in the middle and that's not accepted the last case again is basically the same with an additional inequality on the date but that's not okay because date should have been an equal sign to work so those are all wrong too bad okay um well this is just the full syntax of the select statement it looks very much like sql but uh many of these many of the parts of this statement will carry their own strong constraints so really this is in a sense the similarity between sql and cql is sometimes very much misleading in a sense okay so summarizing about reading and writing well writing is easy insert are the same as updates and you have to specify the whole primary key if you want to write a single row easy reading has to obey several constraints because of the underlying structure of the tables in cassandra you have to specify the whole partition key in your where you cannot use other columns and you have to keep the clustering order into account because this is the way rows will be browsed and returned and cassandra doesn't want to skip throughout the partition so you see there are a lot of constraints and there is a lot of dependency between the table structure and the queries that you can run on it so when back to the problem of designing the right data model for your application you remember that we say you first look at your application you determine the queries that your application will need and then you design the tables i think now you see why because yes cassandra can be very fast and very performant but you you need to know how to use this and this is how this is the reason okay alex how are we doing oh we are good very good some questions but answer it already okay thank you so much okay so we are ready to look at the um conclusion of the of the ladder so the highest point in this in this tower how do you actually model your data for your application well data modeling in cassandra is a bit of a science and a bit of an art well there is much science because there's a well-tested algorithm if you want a series of steps that will guide you through the right process but there is also an art part because there will be some choices left to you um in in making in finalizing this this process but basically broadly speaking the process follows this flowchart you start by laying so by writing your your entity relationship diagram much similar to what you would do in a relational database approach but at the same time you look at the workflow of your application and that's actually one of the starting points so you study your application how it works what what kind of queries it needs indeed when you start uh connecting your entity relation diagram and your application workflow you basically apply a mapping between the two that leads you to identifying the queries your application will use then the next step is clear because you have your queries and they will probably warrant a table each one so each query will need a table in general how do you create the table you look at the query and you apply a series of step of steps uh which make which bring you to to having a first draft of the at each table what is called the logical data model then it's a matter of making it physical so from the logical data model you you finalize a few things you do a bit of checks and you basically attach data types and similar things to your table and then there you go you are ready to create your table your tables so let's look at an example guess what the example of the recipes and the reviewers so let's start with the conceptual data model which is well it is um you start by looking at what are the entities in your application so in this case we have recipes and reviewers right and we also have relations that's very similar to what you would do in a relational approach you have recipes with their properties such as name preparation time whatever reviewers they might have a picture url a description a name an address you name it relations also might have uh attributes so a review might have a rating a date and so on and so this is the usual the usual thing you would do um in the meantime at the same time okay let's skip this at the same time you look at your application so i'm thinking of a website where uh visitors once a visitor to this site one wants to see all ratings for pizza well that's a query basically that is the query give me all reviews for a recipe probably sorted by recent first so sorted by date probably i can imagine this application to be makes sense then the user sees a page of results pizza recipes one after the other they might want to click to the name of a reviewer either to see all reviews by this reviewer so all reviews by anita and or maybe also to see the information of anita so profile url address don't know score whatever so you see i am identifying a flow an application workflow so a series of different queries and one leads to the other in the way the user moves through my application probably each one of these blocks is a query and each one of these queries is a table indeed it is now the the time to look at one of these queries each one of these queries and consult the entity relation diagram and write the table so let's look at the first query select all reviews for recipe name sorted recent first okay so this is the query that will be uh supported by the table reviews by recipe let's look at this query more in detail i can tentatively write that as a cql query so it would probably be something like select reviewer rating command whatever i need from this table now look at the where closed it will be where recipe name equal pizza and the it greater than something yes makes sense right so i want all reviews for a recipe well recent first probably i can put a cut off on the date so date greater than something sounds reasonable for my application okay now and a similar process for the other queries but now let's concentrate on the first one because now it's time to make this query into a table indeed you look at the query and make a table out of it at least a draft of the table what is called the logical data model now look at the the at the draft here in in blue that is what is called the chabatko diagram and basically it is a cassandra specific notation for expressing the shape of the table so columns are given one below the other and there are these symbols k and c with arrows that specify partition key and clustering columns okay so that's that's it how do you reach this table so how do you write down that particular table well you look at the entities you need from the query so what do what is what are the fields you are selecting and that's one point then you look at the equal signs in the where which are becoming partition key fields because you know partitioning you need to fetch a single partition and so on then you look at the inequalities in your query which translates to clustering columns you check the arrows so whether they have to be ascending or descending and that's not the end of it because there is no mention of reviewer in in the part in the primary key but still we know that reviewer has to be in the primary key because well otherwise uniqueness doesn't work so we add the reviewer to the to the primary key as another clustering column well that's it that's basically it and i have this algorithm told me how to create the draft for my table this logical data model so it's a bit of a deterministic procedure if you want now that's not exactly that because there is much more to do um so okay we we have this uh draft of the table logical data model now it's time to make it a bit more practical more physical so i have to attach data types you see now recipe name is a text date is a date rating is an integer etc so i'm starting to make it to make this table a physical thing um [Music] and that's where i have quite some freedom of choice actually because well in making the table a physical table there are many kind of considerations to be done first i have to remind remember all of the possible pitfalls hot partitions are partitions too big are they will they become bigger and bigger and in an unbounded manner with time so some of the problems we saw and there are techniques to estimate the size of your partition and what to expect whether the the load will be evenly distributed and so on that's not all because actually there are various ways of handling uh so cassandra supports several ways to to implement one-to-many relationships so to speak i can have several rows with the same uh partition key and different primary different clustering columns and that's sort of a one-to-many relation right so i'm the relation between pizza and the ingredients or pizza and the reviews is a one too many and it is just absorbed by by the denormalization approach but in other cases i might want to use different ways to to express a one-to-many because you see besides the primitive data types such as text integer and so on there are also composite so collection data types and these are other ways to express one-to-many's let me jump to these uh slides about data types that just to to stimulate your curiosity but look at the various types that cassandra has to offer besides the usual text float boolean integer and so on there is also binary blob which comes handy and then there are date time stamp some identifiers that you saw this morning and that's not all that's not the end of it so there is also a set a series of collection types look look on the right you have list of dates set of floats map between text and integers tuples so you have various kinds of collection types and you can decide that a given column is a list of strings and that would be one column so you in some cases you might want to have a table of ingredients per recipe where every row is a recipe and there is a column that is a set of text which would contain all of the ingredients why not so there are various ways to handle one-to-many relationships one of these ways is the is you can also define user-defined types so look at this create type reviewer you can define in that key space that there is something called reviewer that is made so and so like a bit of like a struct no and you can define a column to be of type reviewer so these are most of the ones so these are the typical ways you you can be creative when you want to structure relations in in your in your cassandra tables so all of these goes to the optimization part so all the way to having a physical data model which is finally what you see here on the right so finally our reviews by recipe table has become a completely determined table for cassandra here the only optimization i choose was to make rating a small integer because i don't want to waste bytes and i know that the rating is always 0 to 10 so i just want to allocate some bytes less just because and you see this chabatko diagram is the same as the create table you see on the left so that's the end of the journey and that's how you end up with the actual create table statements that's it so you see this is the typical workflow when you are new to an application and want to create your data model to make it work so let's summarize this the very important point is that you start from the application and then you will end up creating the table as a consequence of the application and its queries because it's the queries that will tell you how the tables will be structured for the partition key because um what are the rows that you need to get all at once for the clustering columns because you might have requirements of sorting and of sub sets chunks within the partition and also for the other columns because what are the fields you want to get from the queries so all of these will go into the choice of the table then there will be performance considerations for the physical data model the optimization part and as we as we said uh earlier time spent modeling your data is generally speaking time very well spent that's the the bottom line because changing afterwards when your application is already running and you cannot afford downtime it can be really an expensive let's say okay so i think this is this was the most important part of this presentation and alex i asked you how are we doing in the chat if there were interesting questions uh no we are all good oh good and okay just uh adrian said what he didn't study the denomination before so he is happy to attend this workshop we are happy for you we are happy what you attended [Music] yeah and obviously that's not the end of it but we will give you more pointers to to further continue your journey yeah we are almost at the end of this presentation let me just quickly go through another some other tools that you might find useful in your data modeling adventure one is absurds well one is the so-called lightweight transactions so we've been stressing the fact that inserts and updates are the same and that cassandra generally does not bother to look in your table when you write does not read before right and that's for the sake of speed and performance now i can appreciate there are cases where you really want to read before writing so there are cases where you don't want to overwrite a row if it's there there are cases where you want to update a value only if the previous value is so and so yes there are such cases because the real word is real word no now it's generally a very bad idea to handle such read before writes on the application side or the api side for that matter that's because there might be concurrent accesses to your table and you might have race conditions and you might have inconsistent results at the end so if two reads before writes happen in the in a overlapping way you might end up losing some counters for example losing some values or overwriting by mistake and then what do you do well there is a way there is the so-called lightweight transaction so look at this statement you insert values on a table and then look at this part if not exists so now we are indeed we are able to tell cassandra write this row on this table but only if there was not such a row yet only if that primary key was not a row so far indeed such a statement can result either in a yes i did it or i couldn't so cassandra will tell you yes i inserted or no i couldn't insert so there is a way to has kindly asked cassandra to read before right to check before doing the operation yes there is and on a similar note you can also update a value only if the previous value was so and so so again you see update blah blah blah if rating equal to so only if rating was previously two will this update succeed otherwise no row will be touched so yes there is such a thing and there are specific use cases where this is very welcome and it is to be used so the typical case is uh user creation password changing on on the user table something like that but it's very important so these are the so-called lightweight transactions or also called compare and set transactions but uh these are not transactions in the in the full relational database sense well one point is that they are performance wise they are heavier so contrary to the usual way cassandra works these have to these required nodes to speak to each other and to agree on something before actually going ahead and writing so this is slower because there is a particular protocol to reach consensus among nodes so this is slower and that's unavoidable and the other point is that when you say lightweight it's not performance lightweight it's guarantee lightweight so you don't have the full database lock as you would have in a relational database there is no rollback so only a local kind of lock occurs but the the very important point is that it's a performance so it it is not as fast as lightning fast as the usual cassandra writes so my point is yes be aware that you have lwt's and be aware that there are cases where these are have to be used but let's say that if your data model relies on them as the as a the main pillar you probably have to reconsider your data model okay so that's it that's one thing um another useful thing is batches i just want to mention them so batches so far you've been seeing a single statements that were widely shot at cassandra and cassandra executes them and give me an okay and acknowledgement according to the consistency level and everything so far so good uh but there are cases where i want to group statements together send them all to cassandra have cassandra execute them and get something back right yes there are such cases and this is very much uh that it is easy to misunderstand these what are batches in cassandra because these are not a way to you know do bulk insertions and spare some bandwidth in in communication this is really not that so batches yes they allowed they allow you to group statements together in a sort of atomic way and yes there is less network overhead and there is also a strong retry mechanism that basically ensures the whole batch succeeds and it's atomic but it's not isolated so and it's not a transaction so there is no rollback and the rights still are executed one by one by the way in many cases order is not guaranteed so you might end up in an inter so there might be some milliseconds where some of the instructions in the batch are have succeeded and you you read them back and the other don't and you don't even know which ones so be please be careful read a bit about batches before starting to use them and most important be aware that the proper use cases for batches are cases where you go to a single partition or you go to a single node so if you have two twin tables with the same partitioning and you want to do a parallel double write that's a good case for using batches like here i have re i have two different reviews table just with different partitioning or better with different clustering columns for some reason and i want to just do the right simultaneously in parallel that's a good use for batches that's because look at the partition it's recipe name in both tables very good so i have the guarantee that i can group those two inserts in a batch and it will reach a single node nice similarly if i have a table and i want to write several rows on the same partition again i can close them in a batch shoot the batch at the the cluster and i will be sure it will reach a single node so again performance is unaffected and it's good when batches start to to be used in different ways sometimes it's something that you want to do but just be aware that that implies some performance degradation and in particular never think of batches as your gateway to just run to just the wrap together some statements and just execute them because that's absolutely killing the performance every time a batch has to speak with different nodes that's not only is a slower kind of thing but also internally works in a different way so this becomes a logged batch which uh works by storing a log of the operation to execute then execute them then deleting the log and that that is to basically connected with a strong retry mechanism so yes again use batches if you want but that shouldn't be the whole foundation of your data model so usually you are able to find a better data model that does mostly be without batches okay so there is something else to just mention a nice feature of cassandra is the time to leave that was briefly mentioned this morning by alex in connection with the ever-growing partition problem so besides bucketing you might also want to use the time to leave you can you can when you insert the data or you you can also write update you can set a time to leave in seconds to individual cells and automatically after the given amount of seconds reads will not give you back this data because the data will be basically forgotten that is useful to keep size under control and other usages sure but be careful because time to live is always per cell so you might risk having making different rights and having a row with different time to leave and then some of the cells some of the columns are disappeared the other haven't yet and you find mysterious partial rows in your table so rows with some cells only the other risk is that you might think that time to leave means that the data disappears and the disk is freed the disk is magically free again well that will happen but you don't have control over when exactly so you don't have control with time to leave so time to leave is a guarantee that when you read and the time has expired the data will not be there but that's not the same as uh expecting that the disk will be actually free this is something that is a bit uh handled a bit internally within cassandra so don't be so relying on on that for for keeping your disk space free immediately okay so another topic is indices and that's a surprise because so far we've been speaking almost two hours as if indices uh this did not exist so i i've been keeping uh i've been telling you all the time build the two tables create several tables and so on while in this is exist so you can have a table and you can read you look at this example there is a select that doesn't work because reviewer is not so this where clause is illegal the first row here and indeed you get a nice red error then you create an index on this table on the on the column reviewer and the same query now works wow so indices are there after all yes they are but there are a bit there are some constraints on what is what columns are good candidates to be indexed and don't forget that indices the data composing the index index is distributed not according to that field but according to the base table so you might have some non-trivial interplay between the two so what's the point again yes indices are there and in some cases they might be useful and it's very important that you have a look and look carefully what they do and when they are useful but in many cases remember that this space is cheap and probably in most cases you are better off by just creating another table and keeping them in parallel okay so it's quarter to let me see quarter to five i think out there here it's quarter to eight in the morning and uh come to my conclusion well uh what you saw today is the first uh adventure in the realm of data modeling with cassandra but two hours are not enough to to go much in detail and i really encourage you to find out more because it's very cool and interesting and because it's very important if you want to be serious with cassandra and we have a lot of resources to to explore further we have hands-on exercises that are very good and they work with these interactive scenarios that and you do all in the browser and they are real use cases that are analyzed in detail and you will you will be guided through basically creating and studying the data model for real cases such as sensor networks and so on um that we have the academy data stacks academy with uh classic courses about data modeling and they are part of the study program to get the developer certification by the way and you also have other resources such as a mailing list to be informed of our workshops we have workshops reach us on discord and please don't hesitate to ask questions on the communitydatastacks.com where uh well it's a bit of a stack overflow uh for cassandra so there are a lot of things and we also encourage you to go to this datastax.com learn data modeling by example do some of these interactive scenarios they end up with a congratulations page if you want you can take a screenshot of the congratulation page you can send that to us you see here the address maybe alex you can drop the link to dataset.com data modeling by example you should have it there thank you and if you reach us and give us the screenshot you will get a completion badge again something you can use to brag about okay so this is how the congratulations screen looks like at the end of the scenario if you get everything right and uh well uh we are a bit uh earlier but i think that we did we said everything there was to say so i have to thank you great job attention and uh yes go ahead and model your data create your applications and by the way soon you will also see the development development part of of creating an application so yeah that's it thank you for the attention great and our next step is going to be ask me anything oh regarding capacitor hopefully we already collected a lot of questions yeah which is great don't forget to ask more don't forget to upload questions you like and we meet you again i believe in 12 minutes yeah amazing so when see you soon and thank you stay tuned thank you stay tuned and see you very soon alright [Music] [Music]

[Music] hey hello thank you look take a look at the amazing team we have here today now please let me check the sound stefano say something hello hello hello okay eric happy freedom day everyone if you're from melbourne congratulations and uh i got uh cedric your turn yep yeah um hello and good early morning if you base in europe like some of it yeah okay good so looks like we are fine that means we can start maybe we want to leave to let the cedric and and uh eric present themselves oh right you're right you just wanted to go and we have such a good question pre-shows and honorable guests today in the ifa so yes yes yes yes so eric could you please introduce yourself yes so hello everyone i'm eric ramirez i'm based in melbourne here in australia and i'm a cassandra enthusiast here at datasacks so i answer questions anywhere and everywhere stackoverflow community.datastax.com on six different asf's six different slacks i think um there's four or five different discord servers um different mailing lists pretty much everywhere if you have a cassandra question including here and now yeah right yeah i i do think i'm watering and i'm leading the advocacy team um stacks and i'm java geek i love coding geeking and uh i do have a little bit of knowledge on kasamha as well but no no it's not as much as eric does well uh you know what uh we think actually what eric has replication factor three enabled because he is able to answer in multiple channels simultaneously yeah okay is it consistent we will see soon good so let's proceed with the questions and first question we are going to answer uh will be quite interesting by uh tom kiley uh what happens if the hints fill the disk space because another node is down forever so looks like someone cares about operations here i love it if you don't mind i will take care of it so idea is very simple it cannot happen because hinted handoffs have some limited graceful period of time they will be stored only within in the current version three hours and after that they will be discarded automatically exactly to avoid the problem raised by tom uh then but what do we do with the note if note was down for longer than three hours answer is the are different possible actions but in general it all will be all about to run repair or on some bigger amounts of data it can be easier to decommission the node and bring it back as new but the situation of hints filling the disk space uh endlessly cannot happen but it raises one very important point what you want to understand if you are responsible for aberrations and for monitoring your cassandra notes notes does need to have enough free space and that's important for operations so you do want to monitor disk space gentlemen i mean you say it all and you know it's yeah you know eric tell you know keep saying that when i'm reading his answer it's like you know when something goes down on the cassandra node you know start to flush and hit and death and only if it's not only uh just decommission the node and bring back a new one yeah so you know not not good stuff to add here so if you don't mind i will mark this question as answer it a great job and let's move to the next one so this is an anonymous which is not anonymous because i believe i've seen somewhere yes johnny huertas um on advantages and shortcomings on astra so gentlemen who wants to take this one uh i'll i'll answer it so the the general proposition with astr is one it's a managed cassandra as a service so it's already available and two um you're not wasting your time you know doing the downloading cassandra installing it configuring it and stuff because in literally five clicks as you've seen if you followed along in the workshops earlier in just five clicks you have a cassandra cluster running operational you can start building your apps so that's the main difference with using astra but if you're an expert by all means go ahead and build your own cassandra cluster but if you're following us along on this track i'm guessing that you're not an expert so um astray is an easier start put it that way yep cedric stefano i mean uh it's it's yeah it's it's pretty complete uh yes so astra easy to use is it to easy to start have more than just cassandra also the ep so stateless api the one i presented in the other room a couple of minutes ago and it could be cool if you want to build some application using javascript mobile and do not want to use the driver but you're the api it's there out of the box the the issue is it's too easy so you won't learn how to operate guess online if you use uh only uh it's cool because it's free up to 40 million query per queries per month that's just huge so you can run your smoke warload for for totally free that's you know yes it may be enough even for small production workload yeah absolutely right uh what i can add on that uh from my point of view it very depends on which part of cassandra you are interested in so if you are a developer then astra just may be the best solution obviously a couple of clicks and you're already working and it's done if you are more on the operations side then that's exactly like eric said you are missing all the boring not boring but most exciting part of installation configuration launching building a cluster and so on and so forth uh so you are more into the operations then obviously astra as a managed solution won't be a good choice for you for developers i definitely can recommend using yeah and it's 2021 yes operators have it that manage it for you been replaced by ai yeah so i i might add another thing that is there is a shortcoming that very empathically is not there which is lock-in because uh really if you write your application working on astra and then later for some reason you have to say for data governance reason whatever you have to come back to on premises you basically don't have to touch every single line of your application and vice versa so this is really an important point because there is full compatibility and that's a precious thing in 2021 yes okay i think this one is done and that was a really good question by the way yeah we have to mark this one um good um krishna chaitanya um asks what is the stale data and when it occurs well i'll take it if no one takes it so um that's when uh one of your replicas so let's say you've got a replication factor of three and one of your replicas was unresponsive at the time that a write was sent to it so it means that it might have an old version of the data so for example if you updated a particular row so it just means that um it will have an older version of the data so when you read um data from it it might return all the data but that's what the higher consistency levels um sold for you so if one of the replicas is out of date it will automatically get the latest version through what's called a read repair but otherwise if you haven't read the data and read repair hasn't kicked in then it will get prepared by the normal repair operations that you perform on asteroid happens automatically for you you don't have to do any manual operations in astra yep nothing to add um you know that's yeah uh just say um it's really when a node is is behind so as as eric stated is uh when replica could be could be behind and this is why you would like to use a consistent syllable that is not one but chrome where when you can i've seen stale data mostly on materialized view so use them wisely materials view uh tends to be uh a bit late uh so it's good for read av use case you know you do have the data you build the materialized view and you start querying the material you're all good but if you need to update the data then the the the mv as we call them tends to be length late and not fully consistent and anyway it's still an experimental features more or less but it is where you see if you use state data cassandra you probably will eat some materials view talks yes to the point that in the recent versions of the data modeling presentation we took materialized views out entirely because of their reiterated status of experimental even in the cassandra 4 release so they actually today we didn't even mention them right just for full disclosure because i work for data stack so the version of materialized views in data stacks enterprise is production ready um but we're in the process of porting those fixes to open source cassandra it hasn't happened yet which is why by default uh materialized views in open source cassandra are disabled by default yes good point okay then uh that's a very good question which has first of all i really like this question because yes that's something you should avoid it's quite sad it's anonymous now this question from my point of view have two answers and one will take five seconds and one with the next one will take 50 minutes short transfer sounds always specify all parts of a partition key in your queries if you always specify all the partition key parts components in the query you always avoid full cluster scan so it sounds very simple now we get to a second part of my question uh which i will have to skip because the general idea is exactly as stefan explained that you first have to understand your customer behavior your user workflows your if you use them user stories to generate um these workflow diagrams and then finally based on that you can design proper data model so you will know your partitions and therefore partition keys so you will always have good queries and not full cluster scans that would be my answer yeah maybe maybe i can also comment briefly on on uh on something that happens in the real world we live in and that is a small company starts maybe new to cassandra and they are just experimenting prototyping and they happen to just secretly insert a good allow filtering everywhere in their api and then everything works because it's a small workload then things go fast iterations go fast and oops that love filtering just stays there all the time and then they hit production and oops we didn't even we didn't even think of a data model proper now that might seem a very full mistake but i think it happens all the time in small companies so earlier during the data modeling process i said we said with alex spend time on data modeling and you will not regret it now i want to reiterate that now just as a yes real life remark time spent on data modeling is not wasted but invested yeah but maybe the person asking the question maybe thinks that when you do a select on cassandra even with a partition key that maybe it's doing a full cluster scan it doesn't because the cassandra knows the coordinator knows which node owns the partition or which nodes to query for that for that select statement so it doesn't actually do a full cluster scan it targets the replicas of that partition right yeah if the if the question is how to avoid full cluster scan build your table based on your queries and if you need multiple queries on the same data it's very likely that you need multiple tables with the same data and that's something that you don't do with rationale and new and maybe but you know disk is cheap or maybe 21. you come full circle all right okay so uh i will gladly take this question because uh quite a coincidence um i asked myself this question once and even did an experiment to uh check the behavior of the system in this scenario uh so the question from jonas sounds like can you set the replication factor to more than the number of nodes where are the records stored then so answer is interesting first of all you do can set replication factor more than number of nodes you have you have a cluster of three nodes you can set replication factor 10 technically so it will work you can make great key space replication factor 10 it works but then then you execute a query with consistency level higher than reachable number you will get an exception so in this scenario if you have replication factor for 10 real replicas available free if you make query with consistency level one two or three you will get your data stored but if you get query with replication factor quorum which will be six nodes in this case so it's an unreachable state you will get an exception can't reach desired consistency level i even have a video about that to record it okay sounds stupid that we allow that but um there's a reason for it it's because um if you wanted to scale um your cluster then um we allow certain um you know we don't have strict so for example if you were adding a new data center to be able to add that data sensor and run load to rebuild you need to be able to change the replication settings on the key spaces before the data center is added right right uh good okay so i believe i can close this one okay oh that is a question people ask sometimes and that's a good question we have to answer but gentlemen don't forget we don't have uh all the time in the world we have some limited amount of time i can do chapter one let's go let's go uh okay so um if you look at distributed database exactly like gigabyte and kosh wrote as you stated those are acids so ac they under transaction and so as a distributed system they pick cp so consistent and persistent tolerance with the cap term you know remember we you cannot beat the captain so both of them pick the cp stuff so that mean they are consistent they can do uh distributed transaction which are slow packages cassandra can also do on certain circumstances do transaction uh at a partition level called elaborate but cassandra works more on availability you never do read before whites so it's all about performance and effective rights so pro and cons depending on your use case you know if you absolutely want cql because your developers only know that well it will come at the cost of the uh consistency and uh you cannot maybe scale out as much as you want so the advantage of cassandra is you know availability first and scale a lot you've probably seen some numbers over the day today like in netflix apple with more than 100 000 nodes well it's pretty hard to do in distributed system transaction if you do a 1000 node in your cluster mind you there's an enhancement proposal that's being voted on right now that will change all this in the future that will um have better acid transaction support in cassandra it's coming well it's probably going to be a rather long process because it's a big thing but yes nevertheless and you know uh no surprise it will be slow okay you know just a pack source is four times slower than a regular request because it needs to do the prepair commit validate everything and only then commit so it's slower so that's you know all about trade of performance availability against consistency it's a bit of a low of physics you can't go faster than a given threshold if you want that to work yes yes yes you see uh that's always like you can build a car what goes very fast or you can build a car what's going uh if you have a lot of cargo uh but uh considering limited amount of money some limited budget you can not build a cargo car which goes fast because you have to make you have to decide and there is always price to pay in general my opinion on acid in the distributed environments if you require performance and fast answers is it is a complete lie acid basically does not work it's simple as that it's an illusion yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but but back on boxes i understand that if egalitarian practices somehow uh gets its way within cassandra that would speed up taxes right uh yes it's complicated to implement because it's a bit more more cumbersome to handle but that is a substantial increase in performance as far as i understand yes but to take a look i mean anyway yes yes yes there can be some improvements done but the general idea is that's like this comparison of multiple writes with normalization versus multiple reads with joints of normalization yeah i agree there are some circumstances then joints won't be too slow but normally in the normal real-life world yes uh joints don't uh be cannot be executed in parallel and in general they always slower when multiple rights yeah i agree completely yes and they're two different problems right you can either have consistency so acid transactions or you can have availability you cannot have both um if anyone who's listening to us right now has a solution that gets both consistency and availability let us know now because i want to buy shares in your company yeah i'm serious you cannot have both yes yes yes so yes there are some scenarios when this new sequel distributed sql uh may well may work well uh then congrats uh and um because of all these air fancy asian stuff it can work and it will work significantly slower than with cassandra so you at some point you just have to decide i'm going to close this one okay uh this one i have to explain i believe i remember what is it about uh it was about network partitioning and partition tolerance uh for apache cassandra from cap theorem so uh if a partition uh network partitioning even a concept in cassandra if so how does it handle it by the way very good question in short very idea uh you remember is what you can you have two levels two knobs to control consistency and cap things in cassandra one is replication factor and second is consistency level uh take a look then remember my example data center five servers uh group a three servers group b two servers uh they have we have a network partitioning so group a cannot reach group b group b cannot reach group a first of all guys that's a serious emergency so at this moment your network engineers must be running and trying to fix everything what possible and re-establish connection so we speak now about the real emergency state which can as i said before lead you to the problems heavier than even a pure downtime now how does cassandra handle it very easy cassandra gives you a tool called consistency level imagine the query we execute at consistency level uh quorum that means what then we go to the we will have purplication factor three two replicas in group a two replica one replica is in group b obviously uh if the query is going to the group a it will work perfectly because query coordinator cannot reach desired consistency level two replicas for our query are is in the are in the group a it works so you store data data is stored all good then you execute a very same query but query goes to group b i don't know just because of some round-robin balancing and so on and so forth same query but now you have only one replica in this group b query with consistency level quorum cannot be executed and your client receives here can it cannot reach desired consistency level cannot reach our replicas so for example we press right it can go it can go to a again repeat for the group a for example you can try to go for it and this way this query will be executed for the group a won't be executed for group b and this is good that is very important what it won't be executed in group b um then imagine you are doing the same query you write some data with but with consistency level one in this case you may got into potentially very dangerous state then information is being stored to group a and group b by different clients separately and if there is no collisions if that's a different kind of data then it's completely fine because when it will recover after end after all but then you work with the same data of the same clients with different groups it can lead to technically to be split brain story i told you i already that's why for most of the cases we recommend to use quorum because it's able to protect you from this situation and consistency level one is better to use for them kind of data what uh cannot go into their split brain problem because it's just like different data from different sensors for example then you can reach consistency when you can use consistency level one safely i think the next question um is more related to it as well so um storing it is a way for handling network partitions because again as we talked about with the acid transactions cassandra is built for availability and partition tolerance so you can sustain if you if you have multiple replicas you can sustain outage to nodes and by default and in almost all cases in almost all of the companies that i work with you need to have a replication factor of three for each data center that's how you handle network partitions okay so looks like we are done will hint contain metadata of the nodes yes so the hint has the ip of the replica that was unresponsive so that when the replica goes back online the coordinator knows which node to replay the hint to where to send the mutation to so it has the the ip of the replica plus the payload which is the mutation itself whatever was being written whether it's an insert update or delete right okay um i believe it's more or less the same question we answer it already what happens then uh network partitioning happens when a query is fired or does for yeah so it can happen as explained before then uh partition fault happens when a query is fired uh it very depends on which stage and with this consistency level because it depends like data particularly was delivered but answer was not received it's one situation data wasn't delivered at all to the replica nodes it's another scenario in general of course i can i do can recommend what if you have a lot of network partitionings you have to fix your network first of all because obviously any distributed system doesn't matter if it's a cassandra or any another distributed database or not a database at all very heavily depends on the quality of a network connection and it's 20 21 uh yeah for the banking service the database rights transactions need to be logged to track which system updated what kind of attributes how can they achieve this in dsm data stacks enterprise and i believe the same belongs to us from um i mean the the audit part the advanced loaded capabilities is therefore sometimes in dsc already i think it was introduced in dse six um you know even for cassandra now if cassandra oh yeah with cassandra there is a pretty comprehensive yeah instead for auditing all the things yeah yeah wait where you do you get so good yeah you actually covered that in the in the um in the other opera for the what's new in cassandra 4.0 so definitely audit login and for the record there are lots of um banking institutions that use cassandra today um ing is one of our big customers um and they use uh cassandra datastax enterprise for um you know ledger transactions i know acid right it's an emergency eventually consistent people say it's not acid but it's an erosion yeah um you know monzo used only cassandra you know it's just crazy monzo a bank in the uk uh pretty famous new gen bank uh using monzo ivy league you can you can you know go go go search for monzo cassandra stuff and you will see they are using it for everything maybe at some points you know they should split the clusters but yes by the way regarding this transactions acid and things do you know actually you know but you don't realize what is there not exactly about the cassandra but what is the biggest network without ac transactions vip eventual consistency you are using all the time atms banco mods the machines that you get cash you give your card you get the cash the wall banking system is completely eventually consistent and doesn't support any kind of asset transactions and it's still perfectly operational that's just a fun fact about age it is an illusion now you um you gave the clue to the magic that's their disappointing yes okay so next one is very simple can you please explain a scenario where if there is a typo in the search the record is not present in any partition how does this search work idea is very simple doesn't matter if partition exists or not there is a token range covered by some server uh in which this partition belongs to if it would be if you randomly give a key for which partition does not exist anyway token can be calculated and the server responsible for this partition will be reached and it will answer there is no partition with such an id not found like empty answer no no rows no partitions nothing that's completely fine yeah on top of these default query mechanism you can create some secondary indexes so most of them work with exact match so if you do a typo there is no fuzzy fuzzy search except on you know datasex enterprise not pushing here but there you do have the solar index where the solar features could uh work on on fuji and the index is created with all the the fuzziness but you know for cassandra and secondary index could be default secondary index c or sai there they all both with exact matching values in the index all right all right you can use elasticsearch as well if you want on open source cassandra yes all right okay so uh i refuse to answer this question i'm walking out actually i like this question but maybe someone um wants to start cedric stefano i think we wrote a book on these questions yeah there are many this is a question that gets asked um very often because mongodb is a database that has great views that could be the title of a book i think it would be a pretty well sell sold yes yes well uh there are many differences um one one is the basic logic of being a schema-less on one side and tabular on the other side that's one of the differences uh by the way when when we say schema it's let's say it's a common parlance the real thing is that mongodb is as many schemas databases is variable schema so every single document defines its own schema and that's one of the differences even though with stargate of which cedric has given a nice presentation right before this ama session with stargate there is a layer that makes it possible to look at cassandra in a schema-less way that's one of the differences another difference is the architecture that in cassandra is completely democratic so there is no master slave while in mongol there are there are there is a leader follower architecture with periodic elections in case the leader goes down and well there are other differences i i live to you to you guys to go on with the list yes yeah i completely understand what the attraction for mongodb right so a lot of developers like working with jason and dartmouth it's flexible it's easy right but there's is that you pay a price for the flexibility and that is you cannot reach the scale that cassandra does that is the biggest difference between cassandra and mongodb one is flexible the other one lets you do internet scale yes um by the way i have an interesting point take a look there are three major leading no sql solutions radius cassandra and they all are great if you use them right so i don't want to participate in the competition that you compare hammer and range answering question which one is better french is better when you need to use french and hamburgers better when you need to use hammer obviously they are very very very different they are for different scenarios and cassandra is not exactly a competitor to and is not exactly competitor to cassandra maybe in some minor use cases but in general that's a competition of humber to range there are many different uh like that's what i say about nosql to cassandra is way more different than cassandra to relational databases by the way um but not about that exactly as say it already by eric is more for flexibility for var you remember this like very core definition of why no sql was created like different kind of nosql databases were created rule of three variety velocity volume and out of 3v  stays on the variety so you can store data in different formats put documents into the collections and it's cool if you need that and cassandra stays on the site of volume and velocity and again it's cool when you need them it will be a mistake to use cassandra when you work with small data but of a very different formats and you cannot define the structure for them okay but if you are going to get the volume and velocity so high volume high for output then definitely cassandra can be a better better choice as long as you can formulate your table structure okay so okay i will go last like every we will get transfer for everyone so uh just the differences so at the interface level so casanova are using cql  leverage on json cassandra like to have everything validated and the strong schema  is flexible okay then on the architecture cassandra pick ap all about availability super scaling mumbo pic cp you do have a master and multiple replica the master the rights will happen on the masters you can have shadow masters but it's different right it's not masterless so in the architecture as well in the storage so cassandra storing everything is stable and happened only always to avoid any uh read before rights and using his own binary storage so on each step of the stack there are differences but as told already by most of my my my peers it's not the same use cases right yep and finally uh one last point i forgot to mention uh maybe some one of you mentioned that then i didn't notice cassandra scale for both rights and reads  scales goods acceptable for reads for read yeah so if you have right intensive preparations then there is no competition like ask you the question uh intensive rights i put you in the chat anything transaction acid or master slave you know you need to you need to ask you the question yeah yeah yeah right okay so i believe we are done with this one and we had just like very quickly last last last last last points um i will start with this one because it's simple in astrodb can we import csv files to create tables as well we surely can import csv files but for sure but i'm not sure if we have to create tables beforehand i believe you have yeah i think you have to because the csv doesn't know about what is going to be your partitioning for example yes so if if you look at the astra data loader which is a tool in in the ui um it will create the schema for you but it will ask you uh what is the partition key and clustering column to to to save your data as you like but please please create your schema first because you know what the type should be what is the partition key what the clustering column focus really on how the data should be stored and only then import the csv that is a well said um okay this just really quickly tombstone is another problem if you're deleting the whole partition so it's not a problem so let's do the data stacks course yep uh so maybe maybe there is a map a non-frozen map and they are updating it all the time which also is a source of tombstones yep uh tom stones can be a big problem uh and exactly like i already said by eric uh try to wipe out the wall uh partitions then tom stones won't be a problem yeah if it's not in in general just to mention uh delete intensive operations delete and intensive workloads i in general consider it as anti-pattern for cassandra because of the stomp stone story so you don't you want to build your cue on cassandra definitely yeah yeah also so you do have tom stone at cell level roller vel partition level so you would like to delete as much possible as you can so delete per partition is the best as stated by by eric also at your data model come on you just keep appending the data put a ttl as a clustering column desk and anytime you will select you will get the last you know you can also happen only and get you know different version of the of the of your data and query the latest it is called a ledger data model and then you you avoid some some delete if this is absolutely the use case you do have okay well if i want to complete data stocks course and certification on cassandra how long would it take to complete and how many hours a day i need available we have a dedicated certification workshop starting uh um three minutes ago on this channel on yeah by the way sorry you just been saying you were really smart okay i was just gonna say if you're really smart you can probably complete all the courses in about 60 hours and maybe if you're really smart you can pass a certification but it doesn't mean that you understand the content if your goal is to pass a certification then yes 60 hours but if your goal is to learn cassandra i would say minimum three weeks to a month but maybe about two months to really understand it yeah but it pays well so i mean yes it requires time but it pays yeah but considering the question it seems like uh some so it seems like uh yoni is working and he's wondering whether maybe a few hours per day would suffice probably in that case a couple of months of moderate effort would do the trick if there is uh yes uh it's a sour day oh sorry it's a self pace of course so you can completely go with uh two four weeks uh two four uh hours per week and it depends on how much time do you have completely but in general course is quite uh friendly and doesn't require some too complicated things so you can make it and if you will have any problems with understanding get to our discord and ask there are always someone to help but please stay tuned also you know it's it's a path so on the academy you will find multiple courses uh just with the first two ds201 ds220 you can have your first set uh you know do not expect to do 60 hour big bang and pass all the certification you can you know you can have intermediate milestones but you know as stated by eric regularity a couple of you know couple of hours monday to friday and in no time you you will get the first specifications yes you know what they say it takes 10 000 hours to become an expert well we speak about associate level certification so it's a little bit different but yes i know what i mean what do you mean if if they know if they know it all that they cannot ask you a question then yep okay okay i would uh say goodbye and jump on the other room because we have an announcement now we had to switch the the two talks now so this room will host the certification talk by alex and if you want to see to follow to to to see the application development workshop please jump to the talk room yes so uh see you for the work so for the certification preparation key in a few minutes or join a stefano vive application development using next room uh see you in a moment okay see you bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey i hope you are happy to see me again because now we will talk about how do you boost your career with data stacks sponsorship program program for your nosql certification and cassandra skills give me a moment to get ready okay so here we go right and thank you so much for your warm words we are also happy to do that and okay by the way we just decided in the chat okay not decided yet i will announce that in a minute in a minute who is the winner for the questions and answers give me a few more minutes meanwhile we will start so amount of data in the world grows and it will only grow and data-driven companies are getting more and more successful but to make decisions based on data you need to have a lot of data and to store this data you need a suitable database meanwhile doing that fast and convenient for your customers so we speak about cassandra as one of the most popular nosql databases in the world for a reason of course data stacks sponsors education and certification for apache cassandra let's take a look on how do you go through this process what do you need to know how do you learn and then in the end do a little demo exam so you will try to answer questions and see how much more do you need to prepare short answer is cassandra day is great but you do need to take courses because that's not enough just to watch those workshops okay so let's go all the materials for this workshop or all these materials for this session are stored at the github.com datastax academy workshop cassandra certification um today with you me alex evaluative developer advocate lead and data stacks and we will talk about which certification to take and what resources to use steps for your certification run a demo exam and discuss resources in the end so first of all which certification which certification should i get the point is there are two main certifications administrator and developer there is also a third one available on kate sandra running cassandra operations on kubernetes but that's a special case so you better get one of the fundamental certifications and then already consider kate sandra if you are into cassandra very easy uh so then administrator certification design it for professionals who run the adorations install configure manage and tune performance for cassandra clusters obviously developer certification designed for developers quite easy to explain now take a look there are four courses at the academy you have to take but the first of them is very small basically you can do it within one hour so for real there are three courses um the s101 intra is a very short one ds201 is the foundations like the fundamental course ds 210 for operations and ds220 for data modeling now notice very important point if you are going for a developer path then you just follow the developer path ds 101 201 uh 220 and you are good [Music] you are basically ready for the exam but if you go for operations exam you have to take ds101 the s201 ds210 and i do i just beg you to take this to 220 because i you can say what operations in cassandra is not about data mode i think i know i know but anyway you not always will be working with developers who know what they are doing very often developers just go straight my query doesn't work add hello filtering and add one more and why why my database is so slow now so even if you are in operations uh you still have to understand data modeling for cassandra so administration path i consider like a harder one you have to do more but it's really worth it so i still suggest to take uh 220m what resources do i have so main page for all the certification information is datastax.com certifications simple as that for the data stacks academy workshop cassandra certification materials for this one already discussed and main main place for the trainings is academy.datastax.com is it free it is free academy has some courses but first focus on the paths admin or developer it will be the very good choice now to work with community you can ask questions at the community.datastacks.com it's like um stack overflow but dedicated to cassandra and related technologies then our discord server admit. the slash cassandra dash workshop or i would better suggest it again https boom and that text that i uh is word and we can answer your questions that there is a great community now very important resource which will be required at the data modeling part of the exam datastax.com learn data modeling by example that is a very very important step in the preparation let me even send you a link datastax.com learn data modeling by example you will have questions from these uh parts so better not miss it you don't have to work on all the examples but at least three four you have to analyze and will work through um steps for certification the idea is very simple oh thank you erica uh go to uh dev certifications read pro material and take a special note on the exam rules and process section session it is the proctored exam it's a real solid certification with a proctor you will be watched all through the exam uh too that's a very important part we do it uh for a reason we want your certificates to be valuable so we have a special proctoring company monitoring your as an student as an attendee of the exam very very thoroughly and there are multiple steps of the check how do you prove what you are not like there is no one helping you for example when i was taking my exam uh proctor asked me to show the room with the web camera um of my laptop so he will see what there is no one in the room what i'm alone no one is going to help me and i wasn't ready for that and my room was a complete mess and i was like okay man sorry it's just not normally it looks better i wasn't ready for that so don't be like me you will have to show your room to confirm you are alone you are not allowed to eat drink listen music use any electronic devices or books of course and so on so that's a strict exam then second step choose the learning path and take it at the academy okay that's quite obvious academy is free based on the learning path um complete the course at the academia get your voucher and now it is a very easy uh for to get our voucher you get for because you are attending this workshop you are attending this event today so just go to uh dtscs.iocdanz voucher again let me dtsx.uslcdimz voucher https that is your link good it's a feedback form so in the best case scenario you feel it after the cassandra day is done because when you can answer the questions properly take your exams and we wish you luck there is um a demo data stack certification online course available at the academia but we will do it basically now together re easy no we won't use maintenance now what do we do i will ask you those questions i will give you some time to think about and to give the answer and then i will show you the right answer and explain what's going on if you got the right answer just check the mark make a mark on your i don't know on a paper on your mobile phone and you will be good with that we will have i don't remember how many questions we have but not too much because this workshop has limited time and i will give you some time to answer so okay i will need my time stopwatch okay timer let's get to the first question consider the secure statement create table roller clusters blah blah blah and following inserts into that one two three four question is how many rows will the roller cluster table have after executing all the secure statements i'm counting time and you know what you are the best so i will even play some music for you do time is almost over boom okay so how many rows will the roller coaster table have after executing the sequel's tables answer is three sunil kumar kesher jaw that's the right answer no no sorry sunil kumar it's right answer not poor and now let's take a look why take a look we create table roller coasters name park rating primary key will be named so we will have as much partitions as much uh different values as names we will have right and that's all primary key that's the wall uniqueness any uh write operation in cassandra insert update and even delete isn't actually absurd let's take a look millennium force named formularosa name steel dragon 2000 name millennium force basically because we use only name as a primary key millennium force is duplicated and this value despite insert it will be it will overwrite the first one so the right answer is free first and fourth inserts have a same primary key that will lead to an absurd therefore only three keys created get ready for the next question consider the cql statements great table song blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah insert in the zones some values one two three four operations what is the result of executing all those statements table with one partition two partitions three partitions four partitions time is running and thank you for answering in youtube chat that's nice to see what there are people doing job it's not your real exam so you won't get your certificate sorry but still thank you hey time is almost over that's it okay time is over let's open the answer second question has the following story we will have a table with four partitions and i believe all of you made it uh story is very easy yeah right we will have a so partition key is the first argument of a primary key statement in this case we have it in this parenthesis oh sorry yeah so it will be artist and title and therefore here we go and watch for artist and title beatles yesterday beatles let it be abba fernando frank sinatra yesterday so basically this one is beatles yesterday beatles letter b if we would have only artist it would be single partition but we have also titled two partitions abba fernando must be clear and frank sinatra yesterday second part is matching but first part is not matching separate partition so you see it's very easy table with four partitions melvin consider the sql statement create table cards blah blah blah which of the following is a valid query for the cars table time [Music] do mm-hmm [Music] time is almost over okay we are getting first answers first try to solve it yourself and don't watch youtube chat because there will be suggestions from others time is over so let's take a look at the answer right answer is c and you all made it you are getting to that you see you already uh getting better and better so idea is very simple first rule we always have to specify all parts of a partition key so it's going to be always specified make and model and in this case we specify only make obviously wrong with spay this we this time we don't specify make and model at all so it's also obviously wrong c looks good make model in here make model in here all good c is perfectly valid but now there is important point and i see what adrian also got to this point and now i have a question mostly probably d c y d is wrong because color red is present in the clustering column and make and model are specified yd is wrong answer is there is a first rule about the partition key which must be present of all its parts but there is a second rule if you specify in your search query in their clause if you specify a clustering column they all have to be present from the left to the right in order for query to be executed so for example if you do forward mustang year and color that will work but d goes make model and color by passing here that won't work this query is not valid yeah so partition uh is mandatory and clustering column um must be in and depending on the order right from left to right okay let's start consider the following sql statement create table employs create table employees by department begin batch insert into employees blah blah blah insert into employees by department blah blah blah what is a valid statement about this budget it's a single partition batch what can be applied uh it's a single partition batch what cannot be applied it's a multi-partition batch what can be applied it's a multi-partition batch what can not be applied [Music] meanwhile eric gave a very good advice regarding columns yes you must specify the columns in the order where they appear in the primary key that's very right time is almost over very few seconds i still don't see the answers on youtube c d c any any more attempts time is over okay see adrian thinks it's c let's take a look okay that's the solution so first part of this question is very simple they cannot be a partition what is the same between two different tables that just cannot exist partition always within a table so first two answers are obviously wrong like we you we have two different partitions we have two different tables in of course and right answer is c that is a multi-partition badge what can be applied nothing prevents this badge from being applied so answer d is also wrong it's completely valid batch let's go for the next one consider the table definition we have a primary key emitted great table reviews by restaurant blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's known what restaurant reviews are uniquely identified by a combination of a name city and reviewer restaurant reviews are retrieved from the table using combination of name city and the table has multi-row partitions so partitions may have multiple rows and it's fine what primary key does this table have time uh [Music] okay there are some answers already [Music] looks like post answerers agree in their opinion and time is over so let's take a look at the answer it must be quite easy for you so restaurant reviews are uniquely identified by a combination of a name city and reviewer from that we can understand primary key restaurant reviews are reviewed from the table using combination of name city that obviously follows what at least name or city must be of a partition key right and table has multi-row partition based on that we obviously see what the right answer is b as most of you answer it and adrian gives the answer b or d which i want thank you which i want to explain separately take a look d is reviewer name c t which argument goes first which argument counts as a partition key first in this case reviewer will be considered as a partition key which given these circumstances are obviously wrong combination of name city must be the partition team good uh good so uh and yeah as i just explained that d is the wrong transfer so it's been well let's go to the next one now one more thing for you not to worry about there is plenty of questions on the exam but you don't have street limit one minute per question it's uh overall general time for the whole exam and it is enough don't be in a rush so you don't have time to spend five minutes on a question that's for sure but don't rush you have enough time to answer all of them so let's go consider the table definition and sql query create table teams blah blah blah select all from teams by means where wins equal four which materialized view definition can be used to support their query we nearly didn't discuss materialize that we use today so just try to guess of course neutralizer views are covered in the academy exams in the academic posts but cassandra is a big and powerful they cannot put everything into one single day event i see no answers so far in youtube chat well that makes sense uh we didn't cover materialized views but it can be guessed okay time is over so let's take a look on the answer hey adrian yeah thank you by the way for the question number it really helps uh wants to guess eat a c david thinks it's dem uh cheshire joe thinks it's c as well agreeing with adrian let's take a look then correct answer is d since primary key field cannot be null their clause must include and null check since where clause in the select is based on wins wins must be partition key so you see the point is we have to create mv initializer fuse which will support these query and this query tries to query data by wins that means what means must be their partition key one and only otherwise that won't work so a and c we drop them because partition key is name name and for wins wins uh we have uh so what's the difference okay it's the same but just about is not now uh we cannot build materialized view on now values so that's how it always look we specify rinse and name and that's how it works so thank you for answering and thank you for specifying question number it helps let's go when question number seven consider the table definition and the query create table blah blah blah select from it which secondary index can be used to support the query again secondary user topics secondary indexes are out of scope for today so it will be harder for you in this case ordering matters but in this case it's simpler when it looks like actually in this question it's easier when it looks [Music] [Music] 15 seconds 17 things jasper kayvan ordon agrees adrian believes it's beef david lenox agrees with adrian let's take a look right answer a quite a big surprise yeah sunil kumar is right like the only one this time uh the answer is indexes on multiple columns are not supported so you always have to specify the particular column you want to build index on in this case as we want city is already there as a partition key and cuisine sushi is a data data column the answer is simpler as i said than it looks like create index on restaurant basically cuisine boom it's done let's take a look at the next one which statement describes the were clause in a query where clauses must reference all the fields of the partition keys where clauses must reference all the fields of clustering keys where clauses must reference all the fields of a primary key where clauses must reference all the fields of a partition key and clustering key this one must be quite easy for you because you basically did that already today during the workshop okay sure joe thinks it's dim jasper believes it's a few last seconds adrian thinks it's dem okay uh and c by sunil kumar so this time let me check this time it's a take a look primary key consists of a partition key and clustering column partition key parts all parts of a partition key must present but you don't have to specify clustering um you know you don't need any clustering you you just need a full partition unsorted or pre-sorted it's completely fine you do not have to specified all the field of a primary key and you do not have to specify all the fields of a partition key clustering key because basically it is the primary key right answer is a only the fields of a partition key are required let's take a look at the next question then consider secret statements create type name first text last text create table people id uuid name name email text primary key id email which insert statement can be used to insert a row in the people table and list of examples i think you see right now is a user-defined type we didn't discuss it today but in general user definer type is a quite powerful thing so you can pre-create sometimes to use euro to have your own data types that's quite cool and now you just have to try to guess on how do you work with them and frankly speaking maybe i should just give you the answer because we didn't cover it today but try to guess on your own first okay so neil thinks it's 9a it's a what others agree disagree david agrees time is over it's not so big deal if you're out of time now we have pretty tight schedule cheshire joe agrees one more answer okay everyone agrees it is a and that is the right answer well done everyone uh okay almost everyone no it is a not b for a very simple reason cassandra heavily uses and works with jason and it's very easy when you work with udt or with some other types you just use plain json and you are good so udt are passed using json and obviously this one is a valid json and this one isn't this one just doesn't match the count one two three one two three four arguments don't match the insert statement definition and this one is not json at all let's go further consider the following sql statement create table emailed by user insert insert update select what is the result of executing those secure statements yeah adrian yeah it's indeed looks like a dictionary or json that's basically yes you the user-defined type that's exactly how it works this is a pretty tricky question some of you won't answer and it is completely fine it's called education uh here you need to know what does static means and we didn't explain it today so most of you will fail and that's not a real fail but just a part of education i will explain you based on this example and time is over and hey i see eric supports you yeah good now i don't see any answers and that's quite uh clear because okay there are answers indeed already c c a any more options we have b and d left see you okay so uh most of you think it's c some of you thinks it's a let's take a look so that is a very important point to understand there is a static nickname which really changes a lot before we proceed let me explain you about the study static field is the field what all the rows within single partition share it means what if you have partition of three different records with some static field if you update this static field for one of them it will be updated for all of them simple as that so and that's the idea because email is a clustering column table has one partition with two rows that must be clear email is a clustering column table has partitioned with two rows like shouldn't be a big deal here but nickname field is static so it was set to davey for the entire partition final update emails by user set nickname davey the username and email it is always on the as nickname is static it will be set for the wall partition that's my nickname is davey for both rows and that's transfer now you know uh now you know the answer so let's proceed here and i'm sorry uh jesse i have to ask you um to discuss whatever it is with eric not right now because there is a class in progress so static can be by the way very cool in some use cases and may save you a lot of time and basically that's it there were all our questions you did good job we didn't touch administrative exams now we will discuss resources so academy. we already discussed that i will better just show the academy to you enemy data stats good easiest way to sign in is just sign in with google or github adrian says static means only one yes if you mean one per partition okay and what matters for academia is uh their uh uh catalog you can find some courses but what matters for us is uh puffs developer puff admin puff you just choose the path and go through it that's my second account actually i have all of them completed of course for actually quite a while i would say and you go through those courses there are practical parts and also much recommended to follow and do now second place very important that will be datastax.com [Music] data modeling by example you will have questions from this part i guarantee that um it's a great example on uh advanced data on well not advanced but data modeling you pick any topic what is most interesting for you uh sensor data messaging investment portfolio time series shopping cart order management and so on sensor data okay start modeling at first um our instructor explains everything how do you do it step by step conceptual data model and how it looks like entity relationship diagram application workflow and why it looks like these logical data model what you have in the end what you create in the end physical data model and then finally sweet part you have this start scenario button which starts scatter coded scenario with cassandra installed for you and you go to katakuram so you can type your commands on the terminal on the right side or you can simply click these black fields well known to blew the fields on the left as soon as cassandra will be started of course it takes some time and then you walk through a practical part of this example obviously very useful read through it to understand how it works hey and while it's starting what else i should say data starts the phones deaf certifications notice about the rules because rules are quite strict and if you uh break them proctor will make you notice in case of multiple notices exam can be terminated don't be afraid of the notices i got a couple of them while taking my exam because i forgot what i did not allow it to drink or eat i tried to drink it's not allowed because maybe you can try to hide some hints for yourself with that and second my notice i got because when i think about something i start to read it out loud just mechanically for myself and it's obviously not allowed as well you have to stay quiet maybe you are reading the questions to someone who will help you so it's not allowed as well follow the rules but it's not like that just boom terminated you get some notices only if you don't improve on the exam then it may be some consequences one more thing for you i will be if you add me on linkedin i can i don't know suggest you something about the exam process and so on and basically i believe we are done let me check what's going on with my schedule [Music] my part is done and we meet again here in approximately five minutes uh for the closing words and uh we will be happy to see you there it was a long day but you made it just from very last words and we are done for today then see you in 5 minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay hey take a look we have quite a good team here in the end so how you all doing today it was a long day and we spent many hours together so we happy if you add us on linkedin or discord or youtube don't forget to set the thumbs up because i know you liked it after all of those hours hours and hours just few closing words very briefly cassandra world is great and uh incredible and there are plenty of great projects but this world is luck something is lacking something like for example you we need more qualified engineers developers administrators to be in this world and that's a big thing the growth of that is incredible and how it will be and how many new engineers will be required here is just amazing so more and more data in the world and we need good people to handle all of it you are going to be them we hope it's been a fun day we are really thrilled to have you all here we are happy what you learning something useful and interesting you are now ready to power up your applications with apache cassandra but you better first go to the academy because to complete the education and get your certificate that really must be the proper word to go and do things i will have to do one more thing don't forget to send your screenshots if you are the quiz winners uh to our uh jack.prior datastax.com i believe i send you already yeah i can send it again uh yes please and one more thing is um we i believe have a winner for west back for the questions and answers uh me eric agrees for uh johnny the cassandra astra uh for education question and as soon as uh stefan will confirm uh eat we will have enough voices to confirm that what johnny made it absolutely yes i agree 100. that was a good question indeed so congratulations to all qb's winners and questions and answers winner that was a great job and thank you for staying with us for so long time it was a great time together tell us how you would like next cassandra day to be there is a voucher form with the feedback or also you can catch us on linkedin or discord uh let's keep in contact for our events there is a mailing list data stacks dot io subscribe and that's not amazing list for all the marketing things you can get from data stocks but mailing lists for the community events in particular are workshops yeah around cassandra yeah we run uh usually two workshops per week which also can be very helpful for your career maybe not as helpful as cassandra days those are special yeah but still can give you a lot and they are two hours only not a full day event of course um join us on discord uh join us at communitydatastax.com for questions and answers academy you know already and youtube channel datastax developers i believe already in your subscriptions thank you for that finally if you didn't do it yet go for your voucher and get certified get a voucher at datastax.io cdanz voucher sorry and see you at our next workshop yes good uh okay let me check if we have there's a question about the voucher expiration date uh starting the moment you redeem it it has three months validity i think and it's valid to for two attempts at an exam in case you pass the exam on the first try you can use the second attempt to get the other certification so you can get developer and administrator bam right by the way that's perfectly right uh thank you everyone especially for those persistent uh people who stayed till the very end yes you are just the very best of the best congratulations yeah david jasper k van orden uh that's just incredible to see you staying here for so long with us during this friday have a great weekend thanks guys have a great weekend enjoy the weekend thank you see you next time see you next time and a little bit of a little bit of music in the end um so you can relax a bit after a huge work done so um have fun and have a great week go build something amazing [Music] on the same page [Music] [Music] coach [Music] you",
