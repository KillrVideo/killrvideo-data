been through a couple of shipwrecks so glad it's over with my ex but we stay a cause you're my index hey i think you're the best [Music] index hey alex how are you doing for audio one two three oh yeah now it's good so hello everyone i'm greeting you the second time but i believe it's the first time you hear me but now it's fix it uh so again hello everyone to make it a happy free and hi zeke hi how you doing alex yeah very well it's monday my favorite day of the week because it's a day for data stocks monday learning and i really enjoy that and this series was a real gem so our last series we did some months ago was about docker and now this series about streaming it's amazing it makes me absolutely happy i am already thinking what will we do or run next and how it goes for you it's quite an early morning for you or was it normal time for me just 9am here in the united states i don't know what time it is out there in the other parts of the world but it could be late in the evening or the afternoon or the morning or who knows yeah yeah so you know what we have many people here today so please write your local time in the youtube chat especially is it something unusual like deep at night or vice opposite quite opposite it's like early in the morning that would be very interesting to us i see familiar the faces in the chat already uh ciao saverio bonjourno high hyphy trailing privet it's my fave and many hours that's amazing we have people uh which has already midnight can you believe it's tuesday for them already that's amazing okay so that is cool i see like 9 p.m 9 30 p.m for a lot of you well then when i don't want to make you waiting for too long let's uh proceed for me it's just 6 p.m because i'm located in germany but you know what it looks like covet restrictions are being lived and lifted in many countries already so maybe maybe next time we will do something as data stacks monday learning or something as our weekly cassandra related workshops we will maybe meet one day or maybe not one day but one month somewhere later this year it would be really great because i do miss our normal conferences and days and meetups so much i can't wait to see all of you that would be great so so many people and only growing that's amazing let's start then it's data stocks monday learning and data stacks monthly learning is special program done by datastax developers from engineers to engineers open source only hands-on experience live communications with experts on the most interesting topic on the most important topics what every developer or administrator needs to know and as you guess as you know it's evan streaming series episode 3 building an advanced event streaming system so in the event streaming series we feature our special guest uh zig dean uh which is a great expert in event streaming with multiple different tools and technologies and this one is based on apache pulsar there are plenty of great tools but um why do we pick the pulsar forward but hi zeke why did we pick pulsar for this one well pulsar is like a new technology so it's based on a completely fundamentally different architecture than rabbitmq then kafka then ibm mq and jms so it's designed for both super horizontal scalability so you can scale the capabilities of your messaging and functions and etl business logic while at the same time you can separately scale your storage in both two dimensions um internal to your network or external to like you know moving data to an offload tier storage and finally um what's it called it's multi-tenant so you can basically run as many teams as you want on this platform you don't need to set up multiple clusters but anyway let's talk about all that later yep we have a lot of interesting things to discuss today and in the beginning i actually want to run to play a little main tv film so if you have attended one of our workshops one of our episodes before you already know what's the main t is meant is our tool to communicate with you ask you questions and then in the end play a little game and dispatch for prizes if you give the right answers as fast and now fast enough to be very first to make the first three places on the leaderboard so how to participate in mentee how to participate in the questions and then later in the game with a prizes you go to mendy.com easiest way to do it is just use your mobile phone openmenti.com and use the code which is specified on top of the screen six three four two seven three zero eight and actually oh there is a new button a copy link helment is being uh in development so that's the link for you to go to main team and participate in the quiz but better use your phone so it will be easier to run first question i am asking and you are answering already you are great did i told you so um first question is how's your streaming series progress done both weeks nine people that's amazing thank you so much for being persistent you are the best then done week one only it's completely fine i don't know your schedule but you do so take your time it's better to do it later than never that's for sure don't forget so we will accept homeworks for quite a long time not endlessly maybe but within next couple of weeks you definitely can submit your homework and get your page for the event streaming series and if it's your first episodes as we have so many people attending it as a first episode so that's technically the third one and the last one i believe um we will repeat very briefly in a very short um the first episode like the very very basics in the very beginning but we have to pay respect to those who attended the two already so it will be a very quick one but yeah it's clearly having a lot of newcomers in general i do recommend you when to later watch recording but you know what stay with us don't leave uh it still will be uh fine enough to see all the power of event streaming technology technologies and apache pulsar so you will see how cool is it and what kind of advanced uh deployments advanced infrastructures you can build that today zeke has an incredible just incredible play incredible demo for you to see and we have a special scenario for you on katakuri new one developed by stefanolatini exactly for these one episodes so you see what's going on and how it works now next question what about the labs what about the homework where are you in this list and while people are answering um zeke there is a question for you savario asks we have mentioned kafka many times well kafka is one of the leaders on this market that's for sure but i've never heard anything about fling what do you guys think about it my answer is going to be very simple i'm sorry i have no real experience with fling so i um i will stay quiet we can discuss it later maybe in discord hello and i have me or zeke have a problem with the connection but i believe it's on his side i will call him back so zika stuck that's not good but don't worry we have time to recover uh okay good uh so while i'm trying to reach uh z uh back we have to uh we will proceed it's fine call me back because we have things to start so i see most of you didn't do uh the labs at all and people it's free it's anonymous and it's incredibly cool for you just to push the button and you don't have to install anything so please do this work we spend a lot of time preparing for series for you and only then you click the buttons with your own fingers you learn how it works in the best way so that's a real practice and it's very much recommended i see eight people done labs for week one and two and that's amazing and some people are moving fast doing the lap one and moving to the next episodes it's indeed very fast to do the laps team of fa is absolutely right if you want to make an experiment and try to change something it's really worth it but if you just want to want to run through our practice yeah it takes like maybe 15 minutes per lap and we did three laps only so today we will do more so then do you think evan streaming and messaging will help you to build better apps most of you attended or at least half of you attended the previous episodes so now you're gonna have some understanding of how it works some of you have practical experience already or at least our catacot labs i believe some of you like don't know what is it because it's a first episode for them then you just may not vote for this one and wait for a moment good so okay and most of you are very um sure what it will help build better apps and that's pretty clear yes i'm very agree to that because indeed evan streaming helped me a lot on this way and that's indeed i'm absolutely sure you are right that's one thing what really helps to build better scalable reliable apps good so and the oh okay zeke is back that's amazing hey yeah he's back amazing sorry about that no worries as long as we can proceed i was asking questions anyway so let me take a look at the sound level if you are live yes you are live good so at least no one thinks it's useless technology so we did our work well enough in the last episodes that's great and finally this one is a little bit funny considering the situation but which q in messaging technology you want to use in your next project and notice it's not necessary to answer apache pulsar it's not a right answer there are no right answers because no one knows your situation maybe for your next project you don't need any queueing or messaging technology then obviously you don't have to pick one but that will be very interesting and i see what most people still choose apache kafka and it makes sense in some situations kafka will be a better fit but what really makes me happy i bet the number of people who is going to use apache pulse are significantly higher than it would be three weeks ago so that's an interesting story and we are done with the questions don't quit mention we will use it to play a game in the end but now we are ready to switch to them slides so now i will run and you going to be running if you didn't attend first and second workshop let us start so very briefly what is messaging what is messaging and queueing and why should you care the normal way to communicate between different applications in different systems is synchronous and blocking when you execute normal rest api call when you execute normal rest call grpc call or whatever it's always synchronous and always blocking if your application a asks service b for an answer it has to wait but all the time for the response and it it's very often just redundant especially if service b needs to make a huge work then application a is being blocked for all the time while service b do some work so it's a huge risk with networking it needs service discovery or something like that so application a will need they will know how exactly to reach service b it's a point-to-point communication one sender one receiver it's slow as you have to wait for a second server to answer if the receiver is not available no one will process your query and no one will answer and process is failed and the sage one and only one receiver uh some time later message systems so it was a great approach it's still in use and in many cases it's enough but various situations then it's not enough or you may want to have something better than with normal synchronous network calls second point uh second tool what uh happened to be is a message system which solved these uh issues over all those issues by introducing a mediator between application who sent some data and up an application or service which receives this data we decouple message sender from receiver by using a messaging service it's kinda a persistent buffer to handle requesting data but actually it's much more um this mediator this messaging service doesn't do any messaging any processing you get the answer okay i got your message as soon as it reached that so it's very fast you can have multiple receivers to the same notification within this process and it's really cool it's a perfect fit for any kind of a distributed systems and micro services and feature is also very cool message will be consumed by the next available receiver well depends on the your configuration of course um if it's required so way maybe process it in the background or asynchronously it's a very powerful technology which is used in literally every middle to big project like in literally everyone so if you are new in the event streaming messaging use but you want to be a good engineer you want to be a good software developer you need to learn how it works that's not a question at all so general idea is very simple uh those at first our service provider so someone who dispatches events or messages or queue messages uh goes to something what is kinda event manager we will call it for now event manager and say hey there at some moment of time some event we will call it event a may happen it's not happening right now but it may happen and i will deliver you information about that then uh service consumer in our case from the last uh picture it's going to be service b it says hey i've heard that event a may happen i'm interested in that so please let me know then it may happen significantly later doesn't matter as soon as application a known in this slide a service provider dispatches information hey event a occurred what is event a it may be an order in your e-commerce store it can be some notification from a customer it can be literally anything it doesn't matter on this particular scenario what is it exactly but request was something happened like my client ordered something for example event manager that gets the list of all the subscriber service consumers there can be many of them that can be zero but there can be hundreds maybe thousands and some most complicated scenarios and then event manager sends those details of event a if there are any events subscribed if no one is subscribed it will simply drop it okay no one is interested it's not it's not dispatched well there are some configuration options of course it depends on the settings for queue maybe you want uh to wait if anyone will come later for that you don't know but in general idea is what there can be many subscriptions or zero subscriptions there are two main kinds of um workloads here cues and notifications and there is one principal difference between them the purpose what's the purpose of vacuum the main purpose of a queue is to share the workload imagine you are going to process a lot do to do a lot of work like you need to process one billion of images you may say like that sounds too big no that doesn't sound too big for the big applications i don't know whatever facebook size it's not a question at all it may be actually even be much bigger for example you introduce it and you algorithm to compress the images and you want to recompress them into new formats to saves to save some time on their huge systems size and scale it can make a huge benefit from the money point of view from a disk space point of view for example and you need to share with work somehow there is no single server on earth what is able to do this work but you may have a lot of servers and how do you scale this work about them you run a consumers you land you run your workers across all them servers you have you want to have and then you need to somehow distribute the workload to them and you don't want and single picture to be processed twice because it's going to be just a redundant workload you want to avoid id is very simple you send one message to a queue and this message will be processed by one and one only consumer but they will be 1000 let's say of those consumers exactly the same just sharing their work and that's the main purpose of the queue so what's the main thing of the queues you have to remember maybe multiple producers but always one and only one consumer you can have thousands of them in parallel consumers share work that's what matters perfect feed for background processing at any scale easy to scale because they're usually stateless and because they're usually very easy to scale and very easy to distribute so you can have 1 000 of workers in this data center 2 000 of workers and another data center and so on and so forth so use case is workers a very different thing a notification kind of workloads in this case you may you will have different consumers for the same time or type of event and every event may have multiple producers and multiple customers at once it's a perfect feed for decentralized processing and it's very easy to extend logic when you need to add when you for example need not only to process an image but also for example to send an email on that and to add something to a bill of your custom consumer if you are processing images for a consumer for i'm sorry not a customer for your client to earn money on that then you maybe need to add one more service to bill consumer to build client for amount of images processed so notifications a better feed to work with multiple to extend the logic and have different services processing the same situation from its own specific point of view yeah and question by absec if you have multiple ports of notification service uh how to ensure sharing of work it's easy because you have these messaging platform between them for example apache pulsar all of those just go and subscribe for that and they when they will get the notifications and you need to distribute the workload so you may have different units it's also done via topics it's mostly explained in the first and second episodes i don't want to stay on that for too long hey z hey how's everybody doing today yeah it looks like there is a lot of people interested in this topic for some of them it's midnight already well i'll keep it fast can i share my screen or should i just answer questions or how should i proceed i want us to proceed because we got a little delay in the beginning so i want us to proceed and we will answer questions in background oh well okay so give me a moment i'm switching are you sharing your screen already i'm trying to figure out how to share my screen just give me one minute yes sure so i when uh let me know when you will be ready and i will walk through questions so far okay uh in the queue slide the diagram shows more than one consumer mosby is intentional yeah so take a look i may need to improve those slides because it's indeed uh smith gopalan first of all hi i'm glad to see you again second i indeed may rework those slides a bit to make it more clear take a look on cue we have consumer one and consumer two and in notification we have consumer one and consumer tomb but those are very different uh so in this case consumer two consumer one consumer free which is not shown but may present uh different instances of the same service you have this batch image processing service which processes images for you and you launch one in data center west you launch second in data center east and you launch a third one in the data center europe one and they are exactly the same just running in parallel they are subscribed to the queue and they are processing messages one by one so it's the same application just a launch it multiple times okay that's why that is consumer one consumer two but they are the same just different instances running running on different servers and for notifications there's consumer one and consumer two those are mostly probably different applications service a service b service c i believe it's clear all right yep so you are sharing screen now yes okay switching give me a moment ah okay yeah you are life beautiful so i just want to do a very uh very quick refresher on the pulsar ecosystem so we all know where we're coming from here so pulsar depends on zookeeper for metadata storage configuration and coordination between multiple geographies remember pulsar is a global cluster technology so you might have a larger global zookeeper or a local zookeeper so zookeeper is used for metadata information not a lot but it's fairly important for tracking all these different configurations now a apache pulsar broker is responsible for receiving and sending messages it is the broker between the apache bookkeeper which stores and replicates the messages and brokers interestingly enough are where you can run apache pulsar functions and the connectors so brokers are really application servers that's kind of how i view them you use a broker to deploy pulsar applications and a broker is responsible for distributing messages to clients it handles namespace bundling and election of different application states now bookkeeper is responsible for storing those messages right so bookkeepers are distributed they have multiple bookies and all those records are stored in topics and those topics are composed of multiple ledgers and those ledgers have fragments and those fragments are stored on many many many different servers and basically the wonderful thing about bookkeeper is it's a you know it's an append only log exactly like kafka so you can enter an entry in one bookie it can be replicated to multiple bookies so you have that reliability and storage capability guarantee so putting all these concepts together this is a rehearsal of last week all your client applications whether they're consumers or producers send data to a topic and those topics are stored on brokers now topic information the metadata of course is on zookeeper as you can see in the middle of the screen however the actual entries of those topics are in ledgers on the bookkeeper which are stored as fragments on multiple bookie nodes and these bookie nodes form a cluster so here's a diagram i just went over all of pulsar in like 30 seconds any questions so far oh i was walking through our upcoming steps on the on our laps so let me check uh no no new questions so we are good to go beautiful beautiful well let's get right into it today is very hands-on and very technical so um now i've built a covid19 datapol uh parser using apache pulsar so the dataset i have is over a hundred thousand records it's updated once a day and it's a fully empowered rest api the graphic that you're seeing how here i apologize if it's hard to read but basically it shows you like coveted cases by country in elasticsearch so the demonstration i'll give you and the link in the code is right there if you want you will go there as a group we'll fetch some data records from the covet 19 data parser clean up the data in a pulsar application written in python push it into a covid19 topic and then use an elasticsearch connector through pulsar to send the data into elasticsearch so it's a very simple data flow but it has powerful implications because using this workflow which is exactly what i would do in kafka all the time you're able to build a massive powerful data set and tool chain so um through the code example and you know we'll go through it a little bit later but basically um the producer code is about 30 lines and we pull the records we connect to a time series data series and then we connect to the client we can create the producer and then we go through the records and then we clean up those records one by one because you know elasticsearch expects a certain data structure so you have to form the data to match elastic elasticsearch's expectations and on the connector code itself basically you have to one turn on the connector and two configure the connector so at the top you see the ammo for configuring the connector at the bottom you see the code to run the connector all right now it's demo time so let's just if you have a chance you can get the code here i'll put it into the chat window this is not a cat coda exercise yet this is just code that works and it's good for learning um either during this exercise or after this class but basically what you do is you make sure you have docker running so you need four gigs of ram and four cpus available in your docker environment you turn on the docker compose so i'll just run that docker compose up right so if docker compose it's running we view that the messages are in fact running and then we load the data into pulsar so i'll just clean everything up for everyone so you can see what this all looks like and as i said the link is right here i put it into the chat window so to turn on pulsar it's pretty simple um this is like what i call a local data science workbench it's a little simple docker file that runs apache pulsar standalone 2.72 and we also have a container to run elasticsearch we can also do this with cassandra which we'll be doing right after this in fact so we'll be integrating apache pulsar with many many many different technologies which is a fantastic learning opportunity for all of you out there so apache pulsar is starting which is pretty exciting we have to wait until it stops printing to the screen and then we know it's ready i think i think we're almost there okay let's just run this little test yep not yet looks like it's almost ready i think it's good to go let me just check schedule summary that looks finished when it stops printing to the screen it's done so now we're going to run the um the producer and i'll just walk us through the code very quickly so it's processing entries for afghanistan albania so it's very simple code as you can see so basically we do have in fact a schema um but we're not doing anything with it really so this is really good for later when you send data into cassandra and basically this is the api we're calling so if you open this url in your browser you can see the original data set and it gives you all the coveted cases that have happened since january of 2020 and this record is updated every day it's pretty fantastic so we establish a client connection to the cluster of pulsar.client right we create a producer creating the topic covid19 and for every record we process them by country so we go you know afghanistan first and then we send the records so basically we clean up the time because an elastic search time is time sensitive and we set the date to record date and the key then we compile a record so again we're using the schema so the wonderful thing about schemas and pulsar is that they can be you know basically they can be avro schemas they can be json schemas it really doesn't matter so the point is it's a flexible and very uh balanced architecture so you can validate your schema and then encode it as json which is what we're doing so we have json schema up here and then we send the record so that's the data it's sending the records right now now what about the connector itself the so the connector itself is pretty straightforward all that we're doing is we're sending the data to the elasticsearch cluster which has a hostname elasticsearch and we're creating the index name my index and then we just run the file right we give it the admin url we say local run we give it the connector we subscribe to which topic covid19 and then we think to it so it's pretty straightforward if anyone has any questions so far let me know uh we have some questions indeed yep first one by saverio uh what's the role of elasticsearch in this use case so basically the role of elasticsearch in this use case is visualization so in this use case you want to basically visualize the data elasticsearch is a visualization engine much like solar and cassandra good then i'm not sure if this one uh relates to this particular demo but what are the components may help to build an event streaming application and prerequisites to satisfying um i would transfer basically um it depends on which platform do you use but whatever platform do you use it still be the same idea uh you need some client driver in your application to be able to send data to your messaging platform for example if you work with pulsar and your application written in python you will need to have a python pulsar driver and you can use this driver to both uh send them and consume them on another application for example so that's the main idea yep so now we've turned on the connector it's sending the data records and if we want we can actually query the col um elasticsearch cluster and we can see records we have records for south sudan we have records for spain we should have records for sweden i believe switzerland anyway so if you've already got this running on your laptop and you've already have everything working up until this point you just click on this link and it will launch a direct link to your locally running elasticsearch cluster and you can create your first index pattern select your time field and you can you know start visualizing which is pretty cool so that's kind of like my uh hello world example on writing enterprise grade applications with pulsar right you use connectors we got this up and running in what 10 minutes not very hard and we can do this with many many many many more examples but i think everyone in the audience wants to get their hands on the keyboard so let's talk about something far more interesting pulsar functions right so pretty much uh pulsar functions is a way of getting data into your cluster but also it's a way of running lambda functions on your pulsar cluster so what you do is you write code and you upload it to the server and then the broker actually runs your code with something called a queryable state so if you're coming from a kafka background or a flink background there's something called a rocksdb so when you run applications you have a um a in-memory key value datastore that you can use in your applications and the benefit of a pulsar function is you can use this to do what are called lambda server-less functions in the application stack so basically pulsar functions this example you're going to see in the next few slides are in java basically the first one we see is we're doing what's called a word count simplest function in the world right you just want to count how often a certain word appears in a data stream so we're reading from the topic i believe the topic in here what topic is it named no when you publish the function you actually define the topic you're you're running the function on so functions are designed to be um like lego bricks that you can attach to a function if you need to so you don't define your topic in the function you define it outside the function pretty much exactly like how we'd applied the elastic search function another example would be sorting vegetables and fruit so if you're a retailer and you need to go through you know filtering through different um freshness of food basically what you need to do is you would do a simple function called if it's a fruit or if it's a vegetable so if the definition is fruit and it returns if an item is within the subset of you know apples oranges and pears and if it's a vegetable when it goes into the carrot lettuce and radish category and once it's in either or we put it into the fruits the vegetables or the non you know food topic so that's pretty much it all right lab number one i want everyone here to write a pulsar function today so you see the link on your screen go for it uh wait a second um we got an issue with katakurdum uh so this training will be available in let me check like 15 minutes approximately so we have to postpone the exercise and we have to do something we have to proceed now with the slides before we will get back to these pulsar functions sorry okay so that's a live stream so happens it's not recording now you see it's fine it's fine um all right so does anyone have questions in the code i shared earlier yeah we have some questions there so let me get back to them um going can these wait have you shared the code with the students i mean i'm happy to you know help people deploy this on their laptops uh if you send me the link to your could you please send me the link in skype so i will paste it i don't want to launch launch slack my laptop is overheating and i don't want to launch an additional app you have it i sent it to your flag thank you so i will paste it now got the link so uh to uh for the code of the example just dispatch it it's here oh stefano did that already thank you uh well so this one is good what so now getting back to the questions let me check uh okay any more questions yes uh you just answered the question is it possible to build views time windows over messages like we can do using streams api with kafka streams unfortunately no no but but but but you can run link time window analysis on pulsar so flank on pulsar though if you're from a flink world you can actually run um you know flank jobs directly on pulsar including flank sql so if you're coming from a more serious streaming background i highly suggest you take a look at link it's far more capable [Music] let's see yep so you can run flink jobs directly on pulsar which is pretty cool um which does time window analysis and you can do you know you can fetch like 30 seconds of data sorry sorry could you please um zoom in a little bit um because now it's not really clear to high resolution of your display i guess just comment plus a couple of times or something like that that should make the job [Music] so apache flank is designed specifically for just streaming kafka streams has limited functionality and generally when i was a kafka consultant that would actually steer customers in this direction so you can run it as a self-contained application it's pretty straightforward and pulsar functions are also just a much easier way of running your applications uh good uh sorry are you done have you fed yeah yeah yeah so there is again question uh what are some of your key takeaways for advantages of pulsar over kafka we answered expression during this event streaming series approximately 15 times i believe already so in short it's multi-tenancy geo replication and better scalability on the huge scale but if you really interested in this question you better go and watch the workshop sorry not a workshop but dedicated webinar kafka to pulsar comparison done by zeke it's available as a recording on youtube so uh it's fine uh you know it's uh no worries i look three four five it's better to be late than never so still still much uh welcome it and timofey confirms lower storage cost yeah because you can scale separately storage and computation so that's correct uh and a couple of more points um another a question from the ml question i personally really like another real-time applications created using apache pulsar recently so take a look pulsar is a big system to take care of a big load and that is used by the big companies over the world and that's a big problem with mostly all of them they don't share information so easily for example now we are working to get on our cassandra de india to get a speaker from apple and basically he needs to pass so much of the verification for is for his talk by the security teams uh and they will decide if he is allowed to do this talk at our event or not allow it what i'm talking what i mean is that it's really hard to get information sometimes so there are a lot of huge systems using pulsar what uh pulsar what are most famous is using pulsar you would mention zeke okay well um give me one second i'll pull up my fun slides which cover all of this so basically uh splunk is probably a company you've heard of yahoo um where's another one yahoo verizon media verizon is a big one of course in fact if we go to the apache pulsar website oh 10 cent by the way those are really big attention is the creator of wechat and that's mostly probably the world most used uh application for messaging and hours in china and they they have a huge experience to work in like very high load situation yeah here you go so you have 10 cent newtonians hawaii we also have best buy big co comcast pandyo splunk toast vipkid zaufin is the largest employer in china and they actually replace both rabbit mq and kafka with pulsar and also out of the known names huawei and china telecom are also very big uh users of the pulsar okay so i don't want to stuck on that for too long uh what was one more question i want to answer um it's very close um a question from abhishek ram krishna if there is an issue with indexing in es um elasticsearch uh during indexing dashboards are relay the message again well that question did they relay a message again uh if there is an issue with indexing inelastic search um during induric indexes indexing does pulsar relay the message again oh that depends on your acknowledgement setting right if you decide yeah it's just like kafka if you decide to move your offset to an earlier point in time then you'll re-read those messages um i can say like it's uh it's not pulsar specific because it will be the same for every messaging system at some point client what consumes the message needs to acknowledge what it's been received and from one point of view if you want to move these a moment in time to happen as soon as possible so message got a message has gotten done by your worker it has to be acknowledged it's good because then this message is considered consumed and and pulsar maybe proceed to the next one and so on and so forth so this one is cool but if it happens what you are nola acknowledge message and therefore pulsar considered it considers it process it but your worker is broken because of i don't know power outage on a server and if it wasn't persisted it wasn't really processed or persisted in on disk for example then this message can be lost it's not a pulsar fold you are no you acknowledge what message has been delivered another point of view is your attempt to move acknowledge uh to as late in time as possible for example as we discussed batch image processing you got a message what you has to process an image then your worker has to download this image execute their processing so risky do some scaling resizing whatever put a logo tip on that and then upload it back and only then acknowledge that the message has been processed this scenario has different benefit because if your if message wasn't processed and your worker fails and image it all wasn't persistent then message will get back to pulsar and then it will be received by next available worker so it's more reliant more reliable but it may be it will keep connection open for too long and for pulsar it's not clear if message was delivered was not delivered what's going on on the client side it's also not the best scenario so you need to find the balance at which moment of time you confirm uh you are acknowledge a receivable of a message and it's not so easy in any moment of the time developing a service you need to think should i acknowledge it here here or here that's correct and there's different ways of um pulsar has also the advanced functionality that kafka doesn't even have called um negative acknowledgement so if you don't get a message you can negate you can tell pulsar that you know i had an issue if the message said it again you can do timeout topics and you can do retry topics so retry topics mean you put a message that you were waiting for so like let's say you're writing a client application that's calling a third-party api like i'm calling this covid19 dataset what if the covid19 data set was down for a few minutes uh my application if it was in kafka would probably crash however with pulsar you have the ability to you know put it into a retry topic so you can move it to try again later the second thing too is let's say i call this api and this ipi is sending me very bad data like dangerous data that would break my application so what i could do is my application gets this bad data it can't process the data it can move it to a dead letter topic and clean up that data for later processing so those kind of paradigms aren't built into the api you have to write your existing code itself you have to google search it it's not an easy solution to find if that makes sense yeah definitely okay and the last one because we have to move on uh is question from timothy uh does pulsar fully covers uh kafka consumer group pattern with fail of consumer scenarios yes yes i actually gave a demo of that earlier today but basically if you were to develop a consumer for consumers in a consumer group of three the other two consumers will start reading that message alex if you're interested i'm happy we can you and i can give a a interactive you know uh coding on pulsar workshop where you do producers consumers you kill the consumers i ran it today for a client um we can do that as well as another developer activity so that could be fun yeah definitely that sounds good to me let's talk and maybe we can announce something later i really like the idea okay good all right guys uh can we run our lab no we if we we still need few more minutes so can we move could we please move on to the next scenario and i will let us know as soon as it will be ready sadly katakuri requires uh some warm-up time some significant warm-up time so give me a moment to check now training not started so we cannot proceed right now sorry so yeah let's move on with the next slides uh and i will let you know we have like five minutes before it will go live okay got it got it got it so basically um you're going to do pulsar functions after this and then after pulsar functions we would then be doing a pulsar to cassandra sync and source connecting so a lot like elasticsearch except it's in catacotta so you're coding so pulsar and cassandra are extremely similar right they're distributed systems they do partitioning and hashing replication of partitions multi-data center by design so both pulsar and cassandra work in multiple geographies they're both log structured and there is a ttl or retention policy to messages now cassandra excels at high volume intensive data storage and workloads at scale it's suitable for as a system of records so it's a good replacement for a database and it's highly performant searching via the um the uh solar instance in a datastax enterprise now pulsar is phenomenal and streaming data doing functional data flows and integrating into legacy data systems and then doing what are called etl pipelines or revisioning pipelines or streaming data pipelines so a good pattern to keep in mind is you have some producer which is a pulsar application which goes to a microservice which writes into cassandra and then that microservice will also publish to a pulsar topic which will hit other consumers so that's kind of a way of looking at pulsar alex you want to chime in on this slide or well not really my uh i actually would like to just add a word on that if you never heard of apache cassandra point number one you definitely should it's one of the most powerful databases it's used in like half of the biggest companies in the world or maybe more and we have a dedicated intro to cassandra workshop we did last friday so just after this one you can get to the recordings today tomorrow yesterday it stays available forever and watch intro to cassandra i believe you will fall in love with that all right so next slide so the next use case is um basically where you use pulsar as a single source truth for streaming event data so you have geo data system of records uh financial and sensitive data mobile records iot and click stream data all pumping in and out of pulsar exactly like you would do with kafka however with pulsar you can have this data coming in from multiple business units and multiple geographies so think of pulsar as a way to enhance the capabilities of kafka to enhance the capabilities of rabbitmq think of pulsar as a single unified event streaming platform for your entire company and all your friends and you can pump all that data in cassandra as a permanent data store so what are connectors well i think i already gave a demo of what a connector is with the elasticsearch so you have two things in connectors right sources which feed data from an external system into pulsar and syncs which feed data from pulsar into external systems now you have a couple ways that you can basically turn a con connector on you can basically design certain processing semantics for reliability at least once at most once and effectively once effectively once is a way of giving a transactional guarantee to your connectors and this is extremely useful for large organizations that need a reliable data source so why would you use a pulsar connector of cassandra well the interesting thing is you can actually do spark jobs on pulsar using uh the spark streaming connector so basically if you need to pull data off of pulsar via spark jobs you can run them on pulsar so exactly the same way that you can run flink sql you can also run spark streaming jobs on a pulsar cluster as well which is also a phenomenal solution and i might add a easier to use implementation than kafka streams yep that's actually an incredible thing i mean spark i don't know how many of our attendees knows what the spark is in short we can define it as a huge um computational framework for multiple servers like if you want to do some machine learning on your own laptop you or have to work on the small data sets or if you work on a huge data set it's going to take approximately forever time of your life and spark allows you to distribute workloads and run different computations around different operations on multiple servers efficiently working with large data sets distributed over multiple servers so it so any work can be done very fast we have a great workshop on introduction to machine learning with apache cassandra and apache spark much recommended and do you want to say a word about spark what is spark and spark streaming specifically for those who have no idea of spark not i don't really know spark i just know that there's a lot of organizations using it and we should collaborate on that machine learning with spark and cassandra we can probably do a similar thing with pulsar as well um pulsar basically an io connector allows you to push data out of pulsar into any other system so for the next lab basically what you're going to do is you're going to run a java producer and consumer push it into pulsar and then sync that data into cassandra so when we're ready to start we can you can sign up for an astra streaming account and do it in there or you can just do it in catacotta so it's been five minutes uh this yeah i think we should be good so let me check but it all started or will be started in like 30 seconds so we just can chat maybe answer questions if there are any uh question from smitha uh have there been any scenarios where companies have actually moved from kafka to pulsar yeah yeah uh zaufin so i'll run the slides on that just give me one minute so let's see yeah actually yeah it's uh give me a second so at the strata conference presented by o'reilly and cloudera this is a company called xalfin and basically what they did is that they're the largest recruitment provider in all of china so they have 2.2 million clients and over 70 million page views oh my gosh yeah so basically they had a an event center and for many years they did msmq and rabbitmq and kafka and they had all these three systems uh pumping together huge maintenance costs extremely hard to scale and there was no sla they could consistently do as a as someone responsible for slas and maintenance uh somewhere back in my life i can tell it's going to be a maintenance hell to have three different messaging platforms like guys that's a shitty situation seriously so basically they came up with a unification platform so they built what they called their mq service where they had you know avid rabbitmq kafka all these different things going through it and then mq services would talk to kafka so they built their own event center but they still had a separation of rabbitmq and kafka data so generally speaking when i was a kafka consultant i could never replace robin mq of kafka as much as people pushed me to to do that i just there's no way it was impossible they're distinctly different technologies but the cost of operating both raven and q and kafka is highly expensive and that's where pulsar comes in because it has the messaging capabilities of pulsar and kafka sorry of ravencue and pulsar and they made similar diagrams to mine but basically it has a layered architecture as you already know you can have multiple brokers which then serve data from multiple bookkeepers and apache pulsar's many benefits because it provides a better abstraction of consumption patterns fault tolerance a more scalable storage system than kafka and you have a hierarchical topic management you can send these sides to the attendees i think it's an excellent deck i didn't prepare it of course so they have 20 core services and they process 6 billion messages a day yep yeah that's a big number six billion messages per day it's a big number yeah yeah three thousand topics three terabytes of storage per day per day per day yeah cool okay i bet we uh we gave a very good answer to this question and let me check i believe we are good to go to katakura wonderful yeah katakana looks good to me let's do it finally we can go and i will paste the link in the chat if you give me a second youtube oh stefano is doing that already okay thank you yes yes yes yes that's the right one we should we should also tend to uh tell all the attendees about our yeah kafka to paul farm migration yep just a second which particular scenario are we doing right now uh transforming and routing message is an apache pulser with pulsar functions oh yeah the new one okay so that's very refresh today we are doing transforming and routing messages in a bicycle service pulsar functions i hope you will love it because i definitely do you are good to go to start scenario and execute transforming and routing messages in a patch pulsar with a patch functions maybe you want to go through it and show them uh yeah i think it makes sense i think it makes sense so if you cannot do it right now you can watch me doing that or you can do it on your own so i will share my screen give me a moment don't let me stop sharing my screen no need no need you don't have to stop uh i will just switch you on my side boom okay so transforming and rooting messages and about your pulsar with pulsar functions first thing i will do is i will move my head to another place on the screen still keeping social distancing and not getting too close to zeke funding is not over and now i am starting these transforming and routing messages and a budget pulsar with pulsar functions so we will do it with python but if you have no prior python experience don't worry it's very simple and i will support you on that and it's all well explain it in the function in this scenario so in this internet of things sensor based scenario we will create a pulsar producer create a pulsar consumer create a pulser function in python and configure it in pulsar so it will be hosted in pulsar start producing messages which will be transformed and rerouted with pulsar and we will use consumer to receive and view the resulted processed messages good so we are going to start with scenario and first thing we have so what we are going to do in this scenario we will create pulsar producer and consumer let's discuss it but the focus is on a pulsar function so there is a special function which will do something that pulls our side and process some of your work what's going to happen we are going to emulate to iot sensor stations first and second those are sending some data into sensor data in this date is going to be about pressure and temperature so let's say one station is located in my living room and one station is located in my kitchen there is a pulsar function to make some control work on that and we are going to put them into different topics you see those stations are stupid they send everything to one single topic and it's not configurable let's imagine the situation because iot stations very often can be highly limited and we want to fix that so the function will put them into different topics we will put pressure information into pressure top pressure topic and temperature information in the temperature topic but there is one thing those stations are different versions and one of them send information into celsus degrees and one of them sends information into fahrenheit degrees so we want to convert it everything and to have all temperatures stored to be as to store it in our database in kelvin degrees so we won't need to make any processing in our consumer but it will already receive prepared information and converted information first steps we have to do is to initialize the terminals that's just a little trick to hack on katakura to buy a bus to bypass some category limitations so please ignore these steps push those buttons but you don't have to understand what's going on it's about katakura now because we are going to on the step 2 because we are going to work with a python application we are going to develop a python application we will have to install pulsar client for python so we do it with pip install pulsar client very simple thing if you know python you know what's going on right now if you don't don't worry about that pip is just a package manager for python which installs pulsar client for us uh on our demand good and now i want to check with pulsar admin functions list to check if there are any um functions and we can see downstairs but nothing happened that's because there are no functions we didn't create them yet i'm going to continue now we will need first topic uh created with pulsaradmin for say sensor data in that's the topic our weather stations we'll send information to them pulsar so i'm pushing the button and puts our admin topic create blah blah blah blah blah no answer mostly probably it means what everything is good linux style style silence is gold so pulsar admin topic create sensor t out in this way we create a topic in the public default sensor t out for temperature and the next command will be to topic create sensor p out for pressure matrix out boom now we can list topics in public default and we will see what we have free topic sensor data in pressure out temperature out continue good now we have to create pulse pulsar function python code to take a look at our sensor functions we open the file iot sensors sensor functions you can just click on this link or open it here but well i don't have to do it right now it's here so uh first thing and that's um just prepare it file very short one which is half ready for our work but we need now to introduce some pulsar uh specific things so now we only ready to work with jason here we define the libraries we are going to work with if you are not familiar with python so first one i'm going to need from pulsar import function boom uh pulsar import function that works now next thing we will need to do we will have to disrealize the input message bytes in the process method of sensor data transformer pulsar function class so take a look there is a process function or method and this method is called by the pulsar functions framework whenever a new message arrives to its input topic so this message will get whatever we are going to process and process it as required here for example it takes care of input dict if input dict mass type means measurement type so it's a temperature or uh pressure at this moment we don't do anything because well it's the function is not ready so first one we go to a process method and we make an input dict json loads input bytes the trick is here we work with input bytes and that's kind of a binary let's say so we have to process that to json to get a string load it as a string okay input dict is going to be now some json processed now we have to process differently whatever is coming in if it's a measurement of a type temperature use the conversion utility method wrestlerella arrest realize the result and route it to the right topic so i will copy it to the editor and now let's take a look what's going on here so that's the process the method which is executed every time this function pulls our function will process will get a message if measurement type is team so it's temperature first we convert message to a format required for the temperature topic so we will use a method convert temperature and then dump it with json to be a string and encode it so we form the out message and temperature is now in kelvin degrees we can take a look at the convert temp method it should be somewhere yeah it's here ah but it's not implemented yet okay so i'm watching too early on that and then finally we are using context publish so we public uh context publish we publish this one to the temperature topic and out message is the message we just created me next one if the measurement is of type pressure we just simply prepare the message for the pressure topic so we don't do any processing particular processing for the pressure but we just um simplified to beat we exclude redundant datum so we don't for the pressure topic and for the pressure processing application we don't need for example this mass value mess type we know it's going to be pressure and then finally we publish it into pressure topic so give me a moment good now self-pressure to pick out measure good and then in the end uh in the temperature conversion utility method implement the conditional conversion uh to kelvin if version one so if sensor station if then we have weber station sends information uh using the old protocol it will send it in celsius so we just make plus twos to 273.15 if it's version 2 we think it's going to send data in fahrenheit so we execute a more complicated conversion to get kelvin from our fahrenheit if a version is not currently supported we will send an exception a noun station version we don't know what to do if it's not version one if it's not version two we have no idea what to do with that i'm pasting this code done and finally in the temperature conversion utility method prepare and return the converted temperature message so it's done now so the math sensor function is ready it has some initialization in the constructor it has convert temperature static method so we will have this converted temperature into kelvin we have the main method which is a process so it will make the processing depending on the measurement type and basically it's done so this one is ready now we have just a file it's not enough we have to tell to pulsar what there is something happening now it has to load this function so i execute this one pulsar admin functions create and i specify with pi so it's going to be a python function root iot sensor sensor function spy so this is my file uh tenant public name space default name sensor message router input sensor data in so with inputs we specify the topic to build which will be used to which will be let's say attach it to this function i'm pushing that and let's take a look created successfully hey that sounds great and finally i can execute the command pulsar admin functions list and now i have these my registered successfully sensor message router sounds amazing let's take a look what's going on now we will need sensor data consumer so i will do it uh quickly uh we will need to import import pulsar so we have pulsar json and sis everything what we needs to know in this service which will process our data then we have to prepare a map from the single letter shortcuts to a full topic identifier so just an short abbreviation to make it easier for us to map to them topics now we create a pulsar client and use it to create a customer subscribe it to the right topic a client pulls our client whatever pull service connects and consumer client subscribe topic name my subscription and measurement type so good uh within the loop we will read a single message this realize it and print it contents so we'll print measurement type station id and volume after successfully receiving the message a knowledge acknowledge to pulsar so notice that's the point i was talking to you here we first received message and decode it and print it because it's a demo there is no real processing but there can be and that's the function you have to think of do you have to put it in the beginning of the function or do you have to put it in the end of a function in our case this print um doesn't matter how much time i print that so i can put consumer acknowledge in the end that second good and finally i have to close this reading loop so client close boom in the end i have this client closed and we see what i'm going to do it in range 100 so just to avoid my function keeping there forever it will quit after every 100 measurements on your production [Music] application you mostly probably want to handle it somehow differently but for demo purposes this one is the best one so good as it's ready now i will launch the consumer for temperature measurements in its terminal window so notice i've launched these viva type team so it will take care of the temperature it prints reading measurements for temperature and awaits because there are no measurements for temperature central stations aren't sending any data yet now i execute the same command but now with argument p so i will run the second consumer but for the pressure okay and now finally we are go i'm going to install those sensor station in my kitchen and in my living room so be my guest follow me we will open this raw data producer which is our sensor station first obviously i will also need to import import pulsar library pulsar client then i will have to create a pulsar client and producer for the raw measurements topic boom by the way notice here i hard code the localhost ip address obviously for your production it will look a little bit different mostly probably it's going to be a configurable view there are some configuration or maybe environment variables good now in the main loop we will generate the temperature reading depending on the station model version and from station name and loop index so station version v1 this station will send information in celsius for the v2 this station will send information in fahrenheit boom okay it looks like ready now finally the most important part uh this my this python application the sensor will send prepare it one prepared message so we go with producer send notice what the producer is the thing we created earlier client create producer so client is them think of pursar and topic name depends on uh topic topic name is defined is defined higher good so let me see [Music] now we are going to publish pressure measurement for this loop iteration boom now we have also pressure measurement and finally we are going to complete the pulsar now okay it's the it's uh not exactly the kitchen or living room but it's going to be forest one and canyon two but no big difference uh it looks like i just got a natural disaster here so i'm running first one and it starts to publish some information notice it's established it sends temperature pressure temperature pressure and so on and i'm running the third one and um [Music] i believe we have those two sensors running so we can continue and switch to step eight watch the messages being routed to a p and t topics uh verifier so we have notice now sensor one publishes everything and sensor 2 publishes everything to the same place and they will do that but if we go to temperature reading we have only temperature in kelvin and if we go pressure we go to we get only pressure so we have values we have stations and we have only pressure in the pressure topic on the temperature in the temperature topic it's all done by our friend sensor function now there is a huge warning i gave you last uh episode and i will do it again be very careful on what you put into pulsar functions don't try to put your business logic into that some conversions like this one it's cool it's great it's amazing it really helps but like with the database triggers uh you don't have to you should not put your business logic into your database uh triggers into your database procedures at some point it will became uh just unmaintainable and the worst and like it was said but one of the greatest developers i completely lost the name controlling complexity is the essence of software development um i believe it was then this reaching so controlling complexity is the essence of a software development the more you put into places like that that's one step into the complexity side so you control your functions don't make them too big keep them all of course in geek and under control and understand what is it and don't make them too big so zig do you think you want to add anything and don't forget to set the scenario rating five stars that's important it's a great scenario yeah you know pulsar functions are okay just you know just like alex said you know this is um i don't think pulsar is at risk of becoming an oracle or you know you develop a million different stored procedures on the platform think of it as a convenient way of running serverless code um on your cluster so it's an open source lambda is kind of how i phrase it um on streaming technology but the wonderful thing is you know you can run pulsar functions outside of um you know brokers you can just run it as an application so it's completely up to you as a developer how you'd like to proceed now let's begin the next lab exercise so i'm going to share my screen again okay uh so stefan stefano uh fixed me uh quote uh belonged to uh kernigan brian kearney and yeah my bet it was indeed brian kernighan ah you google it okay i can google it as well uh but yeah yeah it's a good one so always keep your application and your system maintainable yeah and there is a great question from team of a can pulsar be used for communication between services for real-time applications it was not recommended for kafka yeah it can because um the wonderful thing about there's a couple reasons and i can tell you why in slides so apache pulsar if you go to the documentations uh first of all you can run websockets on pulsar i'm just gonna yeah websockets so if you wanna have a real-time chat application you have websocket functionality built right into the application layer i'll just put this into the chat window so that's really good for like streaming real-time data the second reason why you should actually use pulsar for super real-time data is um you know pulsar can be just as fast as redis i know that sounds insane but i can show you how pulsar features something called non-persistent memory meaning all of your data can be right in memory in real time just as fast as redis messaging now isn't that exciting imagine processing all your functions in memory sending all your data in memory that is the uh non-persistent messaging use case so i'll send a link to that as well you absolutely should use pulsar for real-time messaging it's far more flexible than kafka and rabbitmq because you can do in memory built in and there is a one well not the question but the point i want to highlight uh timothy asks when will we add the same with java or scala you know what uh we love open source so pull requests are world-heartedly welcomed please make a poll request yeah definitely i mean pulsar has more contributors than kafka right now because it's an open platform and we're trying to make it a very um very open environment so you know not everything is baked into the pulsar platform we we bring in other things like you know presto db for sql for instance so there's different developers adding different flavors to the pulsar ecosystem but anyway we have less than 30 minutes left and we have one more lap to do so we're going to run apache pulsar talking to apache cassandra so if everyone can navigate to that lab and get started i'll give everyone 10 to 15 minutes to complete the exercise alex you're welcome to go through it again with the students yep give me a moment uh so the environment data has not been configured for instructor-led workshop um smitha where do you get this uh message where do you get this aurora should not happen but okay so give me a moment next scenario okay so now we are doing give me a moment let me take a look at something so looks good we have many people completed for pulsar functions already i've seen some people completed install and run which also makes sense as you complete uh scenario don't forget to make a screenshot of the scenario completed you will need that for the homework and who of you is getting after starting scenario on the pulsar cassandra scenario on the pulsar cassandra scenario we are pull circus under this one you mean yes let me check okay good may happen and astra amazing okay give me a moment i think i have an idea okay yeah indeed uh stefano please send the link to pulsar cassandra to youtube we will use a plan b for the pulsar cassandra so yeah i see you are getting the same roar as meme now stefano will publish a link for us to use yeah this one if you cannot connect if you are getting a roar please follow the link pasted by stefanon uh connecting apache pulsar to apache cassandra so uh eat uh uh and there is a great question by smitha will those scenarios be available in the future to try out uh leisure first of all i really like the usage of a word leisure in this context like that's my man that really makes sense to me yes i do understand so yes those scenarios are available there are two kind of catacort links workshop link which is workshop specific and expirate when workshop is done and normal catacordalinks like this one so katakura data stocks courses pulsar pulsar cassandra those are available in any moment of the time you can execute them in any moment and they don't need anything so let's take a look on what's going to happen here there are some scenarios you need to have multiple units multiple service and sometimes multiple databases to get your data what for for example we know what cassandra is incredibly fast and cassandra is able to store tera petabytes of data and dispatch them 15 milliseconds like single digit milliseconds on a proper hardware of course and that's an amazing database but there is always a price to pay for their features in not literally price so i don't mean exactly the money right now but i mean the balance cassandra is more fast than smart and if you want to execute any kind of a complex aggregations you may need for example to use patch spark for that that means what you need uh to get your data into spark and in term data in into cassandra there are multiple ways to do that and one of them is to have pulsar in front of them so you may have pulsar you can get data from something from your service from your clients from your web application mobile application internet of things that doesn't matter so whatever is able to publish messages to pulsar or all of them at once it still works and you can have um you can use pulsar as a multiplier and put the same data into the different places into cassandra and into spark and into your microservice to do some job over this data so you'll you will be able to use cassandra to dispatch your data to your clients 15 milliseconds you will use spark to make some complex aggregations or maybe machine learning over your data also very makes sense because spark supports machine learning operations and finally your own micro service doing whatever job you want to do over this data simultaneously in the distributed scalable manner so now we will get some data and publish it to cassandra and later you can extend and put the same data within the same process into multiple consumers of a different kind so create a topic in pulsar first to publish messages we will need a topic which we will use as a channel to pass messages from producers to consumers in this example we use topic sensor data what belongs to namespace default and tenant public so i execute this command pulsar admin topics create public default sensor data so tenant namespace name of a topic uh and uh okay nascar please ignore this warning you may get these nest horn and jainist planet to be removed just ignore that okay next horn engine this planet is not important for us right now and okay took some time don't forget it's a training instance so those servers are very small um it works quite slow it's fine yeah and smitha you are absolutely right it's taking a long time to start up cassandra ipulsar now take a look guys this workshop is free to you but it doesn't mean it's free we pay quite a lot of money to o'reilly publisher's house and katakura to this to run this environment training environment for you thanks datastax we are happy to help you but of course we are trying to use as small instances as possible because we have many hundreds people at some trainings so now i'm going to get topics list so pulsar admin topics list in the tenant public name space default it's all fine and yeah katakura indeed sorry together cassandra and pulsar are consuming a lot so it's not working as fast as i would like you and thanks mitha we appreciate what you appreciate come on you can make it meanwhile let me do something i will need it for the future reference good uh not really good i want to check what my topic exists and meanwhile we will proceed we will need to create a schema is cassandra we will need to create a schema in cassandra what does that mean so cassandra is a nosql database but it's schema full so it has normal schema now don't get too deep into what is cassandra and how it works we won't cover that we cover that in intro to cassandra workshop again if you want to be a better engineer and learn bigger money uh go get our workshop into cassandra it's free so to store data in cassandra we need to define a key space and create a table in that key space since we intend to pull data from full subtopic sensor data into cassandra table temperatures by sensor the table columns must correspond to the fields of messages we expect to publish to a topic so i assume that each message has three fields oh my god yes thank you i'm not sharing my screen my bad it was cheap boom now you have my screen so okay we didn't miss too much i just created a topic as you can do on your own topic create sensor data and listed the list of the topics now i create a schema in cassandra so schema in cassandra i create with the help of cqlsh which is cassandra query language shell and i will create key space iot network topology strategy data center 1 out of a topic for today and i will create table in the iot key space temperatures by sensor sensor timestamp value primary key so i will execute this command and looks like we are done yes so we are created no errors which is great now i will need to download cassandra enhance it pulsar sync prepare it and develop it by data stacks so the downloadsdatastucks.com pulsar cassandra enhanced pulsar sync so i just push the button and we get will do all the work for me well it was quick now we have to untie the turbo ontario unpack the archive and copy the nar file to a pulsar connectors directory so currently so there are a lot of databases and places you want to you can put your data with full server and multiple different things they are not installed by default because for example you aren't going to need a spark sync if you are not pushing your data to spark so now i install it unpack it create a folder for that and copy the file to a special folder for connectors in pulsar folder okay well done now notice i'm going to load the connector it's not enough just to copy it into a folder but now i have to do pulsar admin sync reload okay it may take some time but i believe we are almost good and okay it's done and finally i can check the link of the syncs with pulsaradmin syncs available things good so we see available syncs cassandra enhanced data stacks pulsar sync to load records from pulsar topics to apache cassandra or data stacks enterprise or data stacks astra we can say so continue now we are going to create a sync i hope you remember what the sync is uh sync is like we have source to get data into pulsar so sync is to get data out of pulsar to something to configure a new sync we will use the yaml file sensor data sync it's here and that's a configuration now this file is derived from the sample configuration file what comes with a connector distribution we only made a few changes to specify how messages and topic sensor data can be mapped to a table iot temperatures by sensor with columns sensor timestamp and value look for these lines in the file so we are going to find the line topic yes and here we have the mapping for topic sensor data we will use key space iot we will use table temperatures band sensor now that's a very important thing if you don't specify the mapping that won't work so we specify what sensor is going to be value sensor id timestamp will be value timestamp and value will be value value consistency level so we will execute that and the consistency level of vocal one we won't set ttl it's a cassandra detail so please ignore for a moment and basically that's what's going to happen those are the main uh parts of the of this mapping and there are some codecs what also makes sense so like ale date time unit and so on so the trick is uh you where the stem stamp comes without the specification of the time zone so we specified time zone here to avoid any possible misunderstandings let's say uh and so on and so forth so temp stamp and the result is going to be cql timestamp and some other conversions required so now we are going to create a sync instance again it's loaded it's available but not initialized yet so now we create it finally and it will be operation so we do pulsar admin syncs create obvious so far name what's going to be the name sensor data sync sync type will be a name of the sync we imported recently cassandra enhanced by data stacks inputs it will be sensor data we created presently and sync config file will be sensor data sync again we just looking at the screen at the moment so the status is created successfully so far so good uh in the next step i'm going to run our custom producer to publish 1 000 messages to topic sensor data so i simply execute these java sensor data producer jar file must be present so we should be good and if you are curious what's going on behind you can check this file sensor data producer blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so it's quite a simple file basically you see all the content on the screen it will publish information about the measurements so we can find it here okay now we can verify what it all goes good and indeed it goes quite good so i'm executing executing cassandra query language command select count from iot temperatures by sensor and we have 1 000 rows exactly as much as we dispatched recently and we can get some results from the table and we see so that's how result looks in the cassandra table basically that's it now if you want uh to be able to build advanced applications you can proceed later after this workshop with these exercise and as we recently created a topic what was that let me find it yeah uh sensor datum you can get um you can make some application uh from for example with the python example we did today subscribe to the same topic and see how it works and how you can make it working to cassandra into another application there are no special prizes for that uh in our homework in the participation certificate but it definitely helps you to get better understanding of this system so we are done uh vp step and um zeke what's our plan than next well we have just one more can you see my screen just a second i can but they can't so uh give me a moment to switch okay boom yeah you are good so briefly reflecting on multi because now we're getting into deployment and architecture so multi-tenancy basically is a way to deploy your applications with multiple business units into multiple stakeholders on a single cluster so what this means is your application should be subscribed to a topic which falls under a namespace and a tenant and ideally you and your application team would fall under a tenant or a namespace and then would have many topics they can subscribe to therein and these topics can be replicated either to stay in one data center or to be worldwide and each of these different tenants name spaces can have their own authentication their own security and their own rule set so this is why i keep saying at the very beginning pulsar is built on top of rabbitmq on top of kafka it's a technology that enhances the capability of messaging and what is geo-replication you ask well basically what you can do is your topics are replicated on a tenant basis and named space level and you can also have what's called a replicated subscription so a consumer can subscribe to multiple clusters in case of a failover now geo-replication gives you multiple ways of replicating data you can do geosynchronous replication per message and you can set it at the application level to restrict it to certain clusters there's different ways that you can geo-replicate one is you can have um you know two-way replication between data centers another way is one way for failover and a third way is aggregation so you might want to have an aggregated data center as well so how do you deploy and operate pulsar well generally speaking pulsar consists of multiple components you have you know this is a diagram for multiple data centers and this would be an on-prem deployment so you'd have bookkeeper nodes you'd have pulsars and zookeepers and beh in front of all of this per data center would be a proxy so pulsar proxy acts as like the gateway between everything else so to configure and launch the global zookeeper first you need to deploy optionally global zookeeper then you need to deploy what's called a metadata node and the metadata node just stores initial initialization data for zookeeper then you turn on bookkeeper then finally after bookkeeper you turn on the brokers and then the the proxy is turned on so you're already well aware of the security features of pulsar you have pluggable authentication so you can do caberos jwt authentication and tls encryption you can do monitoring with the built-in um luna streaming charts which we offer so you can already see these prometheus alerts and metrics with the admin console the pulsar manager and the cli tools i have demos planned here apparently not really i think it's a good time to do a quiz yeah i think let's do it i really like this idea [Music] so give me a moment i'm going to switch to quiz here we go and my display boom yeah so we are good so quiz it's the final quiz of these series and we don't want to make it too hard but well we did so we expect some not so simple questions obviously people attended all three episodes will have higher chances to win that's no doubts on that and i'm launching the queen in the sequence in the second i'm just giving you a moment to jump in so if you are in already check your mentee is open and it's all good if you uh have mentee if you didn't go to menteu.com and use the code 63427308 how many people do we have on youtube let me check we have many dozens of people a question from timothy am i able to increase again well you can try and you can win in theory at least but in general we ask uh people who who has won already uh to require to announce that and we will uh how to say transfer the price to the next place so if you are getting into top three you won't get the price and next one so place number four will get your price instead so feel free to participate uh it's still like quite a cool competition i want everyone to be able to participate so quiz time evan streaming series episode 3 and we are going to start in a moment you have just last few moments to join don't mata don't make us wait for too long don't make the chances to wait for those people on the screen or well icons on the screen i see we have more people on youtube i don't know why you do not join it's unanimous you don't specify your name you need to give your address for the price delivery if you win if you want everything looks good so 26 people i see join network piece now give me one more give me one more and i will start i won't start without 27 people on the screen [Music] no more joining and we are done no quiz no more series okay we can go so welcome to the last episode quiz answer fast what is q for to share workload between multiple identical workers to notify multiple different consumers about an event to deliver a message directly appear to appear to a known recipient to get a newly released iphone and most of you gave the right answer cue is to share workload between multiple identical workers now many people gave the answer number three deliver a message directly peer-to-peer to a known recipient yes you can in theory but those are dangerous grounds sending a message to a queue your service a who is a sender never knows who exactly is going to process this message and does anyone is going to process this message don't forget messaging platform is about decoupling receiver from sender that's why third answer is uh not the best one let's say although you can implement your system like that technically but i would not recommend that it's still a tight coupling which is not recommended so let me see the answers who made the best result now and the fastest answer was done by fire dancer vitra alimo familiar name is on the second place and with one point difference very slowly with one point is different so it's going to be a rough competition again so let me take a look on what's going on here question number two answer fast to get more points what is notification for uh to share workload between multiple identical workers to notify multiple different consumers about an event to deliver a message directly peer-to-peer to a noun recipient to notify your boss what you deserve for race time is up and most of you gave the right answer notification is to notify multiple different consumers about their about an event and if you've noticed that the square breaks it's because multiple key is optional indeed uh but yeah that's the right event and it's not to deliver a message directly appear to appear to a known recipient notification or cue message it's still about abstraction and decoupling and the right answer second right answer was to notify your boss what you deserve for race but no one has given this answer cool so uh uh how it goes on the leaderboard who was the fastest swiss time looks like ruby was the fastest getting into the top 10 which is a good result and gabriel take over both lalit and fire dancer gogeri getting to first place lalit is on the second knight with two points difference and fire dancer is like breaking directly to the neck from behind that's very close there is a little little difference a lot of people running and you have to answer fast to get more points pulsar stores messages in mutable files through false only if configured to do so it depends on the current moon phase so how does pulsar stores messages through polls only if configured to do so and the answer is no pulsar does not store messages in mutable files i promised you the last quiz is going to be complex right answer this statement is false and no it cannot be configured to do so the trick is that's exactly the same like with cassandra mutable files are slow file operations on mutable files and changing files are slow so i bet there's going to be some changes on the leaderboard you guys were in too much hurry i didn't pay enough time didn't put enough time into that fire dancer with the right answer gets to the first place again returning and that was the fastest answer and it was the right answer and welcome nikolai uh deborah pazzalovic to the second place it's amazing to see you here and robbie ruby because of the right answer gets to the third one you was on the 10 just a second ago now welcome to the top three on the leaderboard so the battle goes on and that's a question number four you know what to do you know answer fast to get more points pulsar functions cannot act as message black holes can duplicate a message to several topics cannot be written in haskell where the pulsar engine is made of so your time is up and full sir functions indeed can act as message black holes that's a wrong answer pulsar functions can duplicate message to several topics we did something very similar today they cannot be written in haskell indeed and they not what the pulsar engine is made of and only four people gave the right answer which makes this quiz very interesting and unpredictable so and then now everyone made a mistake at least once fire dancer makes a mistake and lalit was fastest but still fire dancer was fast enough and good enough in the previous questions to keep the first place and lalit now is on the second with 30 points difference okay hey hey saverio you are in top three well done now let's take a look what's going on question number five answer fast to get more points a sync in pulsar is a nominal topic no consumer can subscribe to it's a connector from an external data source to pulsar it's a connector from pulsar to an external data source a failed costly setup as in money seeing this one was much easier that's good so that definitely makes sense now it's indeed a connector from pulsar to an external data source so this one was easier but who was faster who gave the right answer and who was fast meanwhile and lalita and savario are doing mistake i cannot believe that's amazing that's a competition so goodbye it wasn't for long hope to see you again then kat made it fastest getting to the seventh place fire dancer is on the first nikolai on the second and lalit's still in top three um but with vitra lim so close just like 22 points exactly the difference that's amazing and ruby still has chances so you know what it's going to be question number six are you nervous even i'm nervous and i have no chance to win a prize but i am nervous already i believe you do too does it feel like a super bowl so question number six answer fast to get more points pulsar has stateless brokers it means all brokers must serve all topics if brokers crash they had no storage state hence must be replaced brokers can transfer topics seamlessly to each other broker must apply for a citizenship okay yes it was hard one it was hard one statement all brokers must serve all topics completely wrong if brokers crashed they had no storage state hence must be replaced no vice versa stateless is good stateful is painful stateless is good try to make your services as stateless as possible preferably perfectly stateless and it makes your life so much easier that's for sure so brokers shouldn't be you replace it on crash because they're stateless right answer is brokers can transfer topics seamlessly to each other that's the right answer so i i just i'm like oh my god that's incredible that is a real fight that is a real competition savario makes it back to the top three overtaking nikolai but only for minor minor difference ruby with the fastest answer in is on the second place and fire dancer still keeps the third one so and you know what there is no clean leader there are still some minor difference between for example third place and fourth place so ladies and gentlemen that's a question number six now that's a question number seven sorry this we still have many participants pertain trying and competing to be in the top on the leaderboard on preferably in the top three and that's a final question so let's go question number seven answer fast to get more points what best describes pulsar and cassandra and their communication pulsar push-based cassandra push-based pulsar push based cassandra pool based pulsar pull cassandra pull pulsar pull cassandra push that's a nice distribution but the right answer is indeed pulsar is push-based because you push against the cassandra pool base that was a tricky one that was a tricky one that's a good question and that's a good competition okay well done saverio fitra smitha that's amazing that was incredible that was really incredible savario makes it to the first place in the end my congratulations otimo lavorow fitra ali makes it to the second one well done and fire dancer managed to stay in the top three with ruby just few points behind its life must be very uncomfortable to be in the fourth place you could have been on the top three well done so if we have but still if as long as you are in the top 10 that's a great job and even you just participated in this quiz that already shows you are doing a great job working on your skills as said please send the screenshot of your menu screen to jack dot friar at datastax.com to claim your prize and i congratulate all the winners all the people on the leaderboard and in the end all the participants of this workshop and of these event streaming series few last points please do not close maintain okay uh first question and what's going on yes we've seen that already uh so two questions yeah and stefano is very right try your luck next time better luck next time we have several workshops a week around cassandra and other technologies so find us at datastax.com workshops first one what did you like the most in the series and what would you uh what would be improved it's the first topic we cannot keep this question for too long because you know what data stacks monday learning event streaming series is over but uh data stacks monday learning is not so we going to have more interesting topics so next question will be what do you want us to run for the next episode for next series or a standalone workshop as a part of a data starts monday learning so take a look hey zeke take a look best workshop of data stocks so far loved it learned a lot wish you could have a certification for it you guys should get verified yeah well participation certificate is not as like a normal certification still got it yeah yeah yeah so yeah um i was some workshop interactive workshops were good thank you pulsar and cassandra integration so we shown it partially today can have some workshop and astro stemming yes we will do that uh so that's not a question we will do it now and the last one uh beach technology tool or concept data stacks monday learning should cover next i will keep this one open for a longer time so you can give your suggestions within next 10-15 minutes it's completely fine now you oops it's a wrong screen give me a moment yes a few next slides first a few final slides tomorrow cassandra certification workshop hbs workshop we explain what is apache cassandra certification why you should care how it helps you to boost your salary improve your career and get your better job how do you get ready for the certification and how do you pass the certification and in the end of the workshop we run a demo exam so you can try your skills and see if you are able to pass the exam or what fields are lacking so there will be questions not exactly questions from the exam but very similar to the questions we asked at the exam uh there there is no participation certificate for cassandra certification but it helps you to prepare better for the real globally recognized verifiable certification on apache cassandra done by data stacks and it's free now well again not free for you for not free free for you not free for us but your certification for apache cassandra is a developer or administrator is sponsored by datastax and link for the event is directly on the screen is dts.io slash cassandra cert-2206 um tell um oh there is a good question how do we get a participation certificate for puts our series i will tell you in a moment nan well next oops this week on 23rd and 24th of june build spring microservices with nosql database led by cedric london cedric london is a director of developer advocacy at datastax and he is a complete java geek and great cassandra enthusiast and he will be help you building spring microservices with a nosql database so i do recommend to get on this one with a dtr6 dot io stream dash 2306 as stated on the screen and finally an online open conference which is a cassandra day india official language english it's on july the 10th one day two tracks over 12 hours of pure data knowledge with the best nosql experts and guest speakers we have confirmed speaker from netflix cloud database architect uh netflix renek marcella we are working to get some people from apple it's always hard with them because of their streaked security requirements so it's not always easy to get them to speak at a conference and what really matters call for papers is open so go to if you are a cassandra expert or work in that you work with a technology which relates to cassandra please make your call for paper proposals we are going to close it within next few days so you still have some time to do it at dts6 dot io cd india cfp good uh thank you and now the last question how do you submit your homework and how do you get your participation certificate first of all i do ask you to do that you did great i will push our people to develop a special design for v7 streaming series not the standard gray one but something improved because it's not a single workshop it's a series and it basically brings you to the situation you have to do multiple steps and do a lot of labs to complete this one and watch overall six hours of video content so that's definitely not so simple how do you do that it's explained in this um data stacks devs evan dash streaming dash series and then on them on the github wrapper i've pasted uh it here and it's explained in the participation certificate part so i will make it bigger a little bit i will try at least yeah uh story is very simple to complete the series and get a participation certificate watch every episode live or record it they stream it live on mondays blah blah blah blah blah ask your questions using our discord server complete the labs complete the practice pair each episode make the screenshots of your practice and submit your homework here so we already have some i believe they are not complete actually next week i will review them and issue their pages their participation certificate pages for hume and actually i have to do one thing cut the so which particular exercises you have to do those at katakoto.com data stocks courses pulsar you could have completed some of them during the workshops it also perfectly works so you can choose apache pulsar to apache cassandra or you can choose apache pulsar data stacks astra or both also works what's important getting started producers consumers readers in java data streams we have apache for samples are sql uh pulsar functions and or data stacks astra or apache cassandra both work to me and i'm sending link to the youtube chat again [Music] and i'm sending link and actually i will put the link to the github repo so you will complete the practice so you will have it right here a little bit of live coding can it changes so you will have it in a moment uh cataclysm as you could have seen right now is published just one message about yours and uh last part i wanted to sh to tell you to show you uh you did a great work working over these uh evan streaming series so that's absolutely amazing i want uh like we spent together over six hours working together so what i want us to do is to catch us on linkedin so we can communicate on the upcoming events and so on so where is my linkedin various linkedin and we will be happy to meet you again on the upcoming events this week next week one month later and then maybe in few months on our live events so zeke do you have anything to add to that there's one more thing i'd like to add to this whole workshop and if i can have everyone's full attention so if you would like to continue learning uh apache pulsar we do have a serverless implementation of astra oh indeed let me switch to let me switch to your screen actually okay you are sharing yes uh yeah here we go so go to astra.datastax.com and create a a trial account on streaming um it's very easy to create a database so i can create you know my own tenant give it a location and i can create a tenant i can download the client.conf it gives you all the example code you need to get ready python golang node.js and yes even web sockets yep you can try it out it's pretty good um that's pretty much it for me yep i just wanted to add a point on that so uh first of all astra always features uh quite nice uh free tier so you won't be billet for making experiments with pulsar with astro streaming so pulsar as a service that's the first thing and second thing i can tell you uh as someone responsible for infrastructure and things for many years at first when i first met serverless solutions managed solutions i was completely against that seriously i was one of the biggest haters of serverless things ideas were simple i use it to keep everything under control under direct control under my control but that only works as long as you work on small to medium applications at some point i've realized that for twerk people and aws data stocks and some other companies those are better experts and this particular technology engine pulsar for example uh than me and i cannot be expert in everything and i cannot maintain now every technology what my big project uses and then finally as someone responsible not for them maintaining of um project but on the development of a project on the success of a project i realize it i don't want maintenance and operations to be my headache anymore i want it to be let's say data stocks headache and i want just to develop my application make it useful to customers earn money on that and be i'm good with that so the idea is now with astro serverless you can have pulsar streaming as a serverless solution you can have cassandra as a service as a serverless solution it's not your headache to maintain those it's not your headache to maintain cassandra with astrodb because it's well not it's a powerful but not the simplest solution same goes to pulsar pulsar is very powerful very scalable but it's not the easiest to run and operate solution with astrodb and after streaming it's not your headache it's our headache to take care of pet and you just use it and it is amazing now i use serverless solutions all the time i believe we are done with that a huge huge huge huge thank you for you stay with us we will be happy to answer questions uh on discord server later we are done for today and you are great just thank you for joining us and staying with us for such a long time that's truly amazing thank you and last one from saverio i can confidently say what i am much better engineer since i started following your workshops thanks a lot guys and thank you thank you that's uh really incredible we are happy to be here thanks zeke thanks stefano our invisible hero in the chat and we are happy to see you again send your messages and linkedin send your questions on discord we will be happy to see you again we are done for today you are the best and enjoy your week we hope we did it better for you more formats to change [Music] [Music] you",
