youtube chat so we will know we can start that's alex volchniv developer advocate at datastax and today with me zig dean i hope you know him already from the last episode hey zeke how are you doing hi how you doing alex yeah very well i'm happy to be here today could you please greet our attendees and i will leverage the sound level for you sure well nice to meet everyone today i'm uh zeke dean i'm here at datastax to talk about developing applications on pulsar today yep perfect now it sounds much better i believe and let's start then so let me see at our youtube it looks like we have a lot of people today and that makes me happy and we will have much more people in few minutes because there are always late commerce but you who joined us already you are the best so let's start let's not wait uh too long i see some familiar names in the chat i see some new names which is also very great i want to answer a question from ivan garcia is there any homework to be done on our own all of them are done during the live sessions so yes and no uh you we do the laps during the lab session during the live sessions indeed you can do them after that so it's not necessarily to complete them during the workshop but you can do them after you like to have more time to think about that to try to make experiments and so on or better try both and then later to get your participation certificate for this workshop series as it consists of three episodes you will need to submit the screenshots of your um all the laps done we are going to do overall zeke fix me if i'm wrong we are doing going to do overall five flaps correct well for right now we have three but yeah yes eventually there is a plan for five labs yeah so last episode we did one it's available online so you can do it uh after all it's no no worries today we are going to do two more to next and uh then for the last episode we will prepare some more for you so we will see in the end so we will be at least i believe four different laps and to get your participation certificate you have to watch all the streams live or record it and submit the homework i will explain it in the third episode so i'll say a question miss it the first session any place i can catch up yes absolutely so recording is available and all them labs are available as well i will send a link to the youtube chat and we will proceed because we have to start already we have a lot of things to do today so that's the repository week one is updated and i will update week to today and that's the main repository with all the materials for this uh series uh but in general uh don't be worried we will be very briefly but we'll repeat the materials of the first episode i think so we will see so now we proceed ladies and gentlemen welcome to data stocks monday learning it's a special program that engineers talk to engineers about the open source technologies about the with the hands-on experience live communication with the experts about the most important topics which every developer needs to know personally for me event streaming and the related technologies messaging notification queues are essential and i would never consider a civil developer to be a senior level developer if he or she doesn't know those so let's go what are we doing today today it's the episode 2 pulsar in action for evan streaming series led by zig and mim and that's the second one june the 14th hope you watch it live but if you watch it recording the recorded no worries you still can ask us questions in our discord server so we will talk about few things today why messaging review pools are messaging patterns schema management and sql sql vive pulsar it sounds a little bit weird because we use it to use query language for relational databases and now what do you mean by sql with pulsar could you maybe clarify that a little bit zig yeah so imagine you're a data engineer or you're a business analyst or you're an engineer and a business analyst comes to you and says hi i want to query a pulsar how do i do it so the the thinking behind pulsar sql is it gives you an ability to query for specific data within your pulsar topic to solve a particular problem so it's a very good and easy way to gather information from your cluster without having to write code basically yep and that's quite cool because well ability to communicate and retrieve data like that i would say it's i mean i don't know each and every messaging platform in the world but for those i was working with i did i haven't seen anything like that before yes it's based on presto db and we'll discuss it later we'll have a hands-on lab as well yep perfect and um last point before we proceed if you have been to our workshops before then you know the story um we use main team over two things first we ask questions to you with mentee so we know what's your status are you in for this series since the beginning or you are a newcomer and so on and so forth and in the end of this um episode we play a game we ask you questions and if you give the right answers and do it fast you get the prizes from data stacks so that's quite cool and that's amazing basically i see i know why the first answer yes live or just recorded comes in uh first because those who watch at the last episode of the first episode they know what to do and if you wasn't there then answer is simple please go to mentee.com and use the code 26484290 or just scan that qr code next to zig i will move myself a little bit so you will see the code pum that's good and you will just put your answers there so if you want to have chance to win the prizes during the competition during the quiz you better run menti.com easiest way to do it is just open it on your mobile phone go to mendy.com and put the code or scan the qr code as say it already so well well well well well mentee.com code26484290 and let me see how many people transfer it already oh finally we have some newcomers it means what you managed to deal with mentee and jumping and that's great and you are doing well so most of you watched the content live or recorded and we have some newcomers today as well okay good so we can move on have you completed the first episode lab i will remind you it's in katakoda and it's very basic one we're working with pulsar in command line interface using pulsar admin pulsar a client and so on hmm so that's actually quite a lot i would say i've expected what the proportion will be completely different take a look see we have like almost 50 15. i thought so now we have finally clear 5015 well done i thought it will be much worse so that means you are doing really really really well today we will do it again i hope you like katakura as much as i do because it helps you to do the exercises without installing any software on your laptop you know what we are running workshops we clean and the different topics and if you if we would make you to install all the software for offer or for all the workshops we are doing at your laptop your laptop will be exploded very very very soon that brings me to the next question have you been to any of our workshops before i believe we have some fans what and all of them and i think some of you visited at least once or twice we have some newcomers which is great congrats that is nice and those who do it regularly those who are our fan that you are the best like and thank you so much for joining again and again that is cool so welcome newcomers and finally which queueing or messaging technologies are you familiar with you can pick multiple options hi ritwik happy to see you here okay there's a luck in alex audio video okay as long as audio is on time video doesn't matter too much but i will check what's going on with the synchronization so okay so looks like kafka is a clear winner and that's pretty understandable now for today i do expect to have more answers for apache pulsar for real most of you attended the previous episode it means what you are kind of familiar already so please grow the raised bed number on apache pool service definitely makes sense and doesn't matter if you have experience with things like zero mq or rabbit mq that works well for us and if you have no experience with queuing or messaging technologies you are very welcome as well although it's episode 2 already of course so it's maybe too much so we are done with the leading questions and we are going to switch to the slides and then to the left but don't close maintain because we will run the quiz using the same code and you may better keep it open till the end of a workshop so perfect let's go we are going to cover some topics and i want to be sure what everything is going well for you uh and first one will be very briefly why messaging and what is it and how it works now if you didn't attend the first episode it will be a rough ride for you but you can grasp at least the basic concepts so here we go why messaging what messaging how it works in the any case of the situation when your application works with different application not only with the customer before like making an api call to google or youtube for example you normally do something like rest call rest request or rpc request or whatever request you do but normally with http and that means what it's a synchronous blocking call as long as service b won't respond or timeout will not be reached application a doing the request in this case is blocked and we'll just wait for service b to react and hopefully service b will react but actually network may be down or maybe service b is down or anything else bad happens and so on and so forth so where maybe there can be a really a lot of different painful situations what was the main problems of standard blocking synchronous calls doesn't matter if it's rest rpc grpc or whatever you prefer first huge risk with networking as soon as the network is unstable even if service b has completed their residual has completed the thing your application a may not get the answer it needs or maybe definitely service discovery so application a needs to know how exactly to reach service b and as long as you have only application a is service b it doesn't seem to hurt but for example one of the last projects i was working with included approximately three or four different dozens and dozens of different services bcdef and so on and so forth and communication and service discovery wasn't a simple thing there was always a point to point communication so application a needs to know which particular servers it needs to reach you will ask me like what's the difference between point two service discovery or service location at least and point-to-point communication i will tell you the point is in the second point we speak about it needs to know how to reach and in point-to-point communication i mean it mean it knows which particular service to reach you know it's like with a message have you ever sent a mail like bypost well for email it's usually the same but sending the mail like the paper mail it really makes sense you can have on that only one sender and only one receiver and can you imagine working sending a post mail then you have to stay at the post and wait till the answer you know what even in the countries where male post is very efficient like germany i'm located in it would take days and in some countries for mail is not working so well it may take weeks or maybe even months do you really want to stay in the post for all this time i don't think so so that's exactly the story that's why synchronous goals are bad from us from our human point of view they are very quick but in the computer time it takes ages before you get the response and application a or sender will be blocked all this time so slow blocking as you are waiting for your service to respond or maybe not yours maybe third party idea is the same okay so uh what's that situation if receiver is not available if no instances of service b is running processes fail it and you know what sometimes it makes sense because if you don't get answered from service b right now you have nothing to return to your client processes fail it indeed but in some cases um your message your event your notification processing can be safely delayed your client doesn't uh wait for your answer right now for example yesterday i made an order ordered some um spare parts for more for my motorbike on amazon i made an order and i quit a browser and when to do my own things at some point then everything will be fine with the order they will send me a mail like okay we are dispatching your order but i don't need this mail right now the idea what okay we dispatching your order right now doesn't make any sense to me because i will anyway get this order after some days and this situation happens very often so we need to understand what the background processing is i will say a lot i will say again about that in a couple of slides is a very open way use case tradition traditional flow in the web application specifically web applications makes the most of the applications in the world now then is like um client is requesting something we will do all the steps all the steps all the steps to do to reach the goal and then it's done we will give the answer to the client and client was waiting for it as long as internet was slow and there were not so much to do for your application it was okay because client waits for some seconds for answers anyway but it was over for you know years already people don't want to wait if your application works two hundred milliseconds slower when your competitor people people people will switch to your competitors application so time is money and we all know that and what does that mean now the workload has changed significantly and we are trying to dispatch answer to a client as soon as possible and meanwhile do as much of a required job as possible in the background again link to the next slide and finally next point on this slide and last one one and only one receiver so when you are executing an http call you are going to always specify who is the particular receiver which brings us again to point-to-point communications you need to know what is it receiver and you cannot send the message to multiple receivers if you want you have to do it at the application layer watch them in parallel and process all the response and so on and so forth okay so that's how it was before and it is still the same for most of the applications all small to medium businesses were more or less fine with synchronous uh api calls rest calls and so on and so forth for bigger companies or for for more complex projects it's not the answer already messaging systems and answer systems work in another way so they see they are a mediator in between of your application and all and every services you are going to reach and it decouples message senders from receivers and it's actually quite a huge benefit at first you may say like well before application a was communicating with service b directly and your messaging service glorious one doesn't make this communication faster it doesn't affect my network before i needed one network call and one network response and basically from the transport point of view it was two uh two p two packages of information uh first direction section direction direction back and now i have this messaging service in between and that basically means what i need at least four or maybe if i have multiple receivers as you say maybe even more does that really help does it really worth the price i'm going to pay because in general this scheme will work slower and yes that's correct under the same circumstances you need to make more network calls and in theory it looks slower but the price really worth the things what we get what do we get now application a is free as soon as a messaging platform gets your message because it doesn't wait for service b to answer and messaging service confirms the message received nearly immediately they are very fast well then what's next we can have multiple receivers and it's on the messaging service point of view to process this thing if you need to deliver message to multiple receivers which is a quite often use case for event-driven architectures it's done easily with messaging service and you don't have to care about that in application a basically you don't have to touch application a code when you add some more receivers consumers processors and that's cool so because they're decoupled it's easier to extend your system it's a perfect feed for distributed systems and or micro services and one thing i really like so message will be consumed by the next available service instance it means what i can make some updates on service beam and my message won't be lost my message will be delivered as soon as service b recovers and requests okay i was missing what are the things for me from anyone sorry i'm service b i'm now ready for duty and that's really a lot and basically i believe literally all of the projects you know all of the projects you use uh are using uh one or another messaging platform you use um iphone 100 your message went through some messaging systems you using uh android phone doesn't matter still the same basically you use any phone even in case you use like an older one let's say uh it still mostly probably will be processed by your telecom company telecom provider with some messaging services and so on and so forth so if you are using messaging services all the time they are used by all the big companies and big and medium sized companies literally everywhere idea is different to the normal messaging with normal messaging you have one service dispatching initiating the message and one receiver which gets it with messaging usually it goes differently first the one who is interested in some messaging some information in some data so basically a receiver one of them or multiple of them have to subscribe for the messages you get and most of the cases it's also of course possible to unsubscribe then if anything interesting happens sorry service consumers subscribe for the message and then service provider dispatches the message it will be um yeah service provider dispatch event e in this case event manager dispatches these message to each and every consumer who was interested in that well not each and every but let's take a look at that on the next slide so there are two main types of messages you have to consider queue messages and notifications let's say so what about cues they are very different to notifications to events an idea of the queue is what every message in this queue will be processed one and only one time therefore by one and only one consumer and they may have multiple producers so if you have microservice oriented architecture and you have a dozen of services and some of them may need to send a notification to a customer depending on its settings so the origin of the notification to a customer can it be in a short text message or can it be an email or maybe can it be a push notification via his uh phone okay the origin can be different every of your microservices may need to dispatch this notification and here you have some choices first choice will be just okay that doesn't look too hard i will implement a notification for my customer in each and every service because now i want to send them only emails and then i will simply send an email to a customer from each and every service i have and at first it may look like a bad idea like a good idea but in general it may be ain't so great because you need to understand the story and what's the story today you dispatch on the emails tomorrow you send short text messages sms today and day after tomorrow you need like push messages and maybe something else comes in maybe tomorrow you will use i don't know post p jones to dispatch your messages uh well not really but definitely something new can happen and then basically you need to extend every of your service to understand when to notification i went to notify customer how to notify customer what's the current customer settings maybe customers say write me no emails anymore write me nothing do not notify me about anything i don't want to hear a word from you well maybe he was disappointed that something you did before should happens and then it means what now every service instead of doing his own job need to understand what's going on with your customer notifications that's maybe wrong what do you think so in my personal experience we practice we prefer it on a huge e-commerce platform i was working on some years ago we decided to do it in a different way better way i believe all the macro services don't have to care about how to reach customer and do we have to reach customer at all if something happens what maybe a customer has to be notified they dispatch a message for the customer uh if as you see multiple producers one consumer and this message goes to a queue why a queue don't forget every queue message is processed only once you don't want to send to your customer hundreds of exactly the same messages he won't be happy and then each of those consumers that's basically the same consumer but multiple instances of that if today we dispatch thousands of messages per second we may need multiple instances of the same processor but if tomorrow we have a low count we may decrease amount of instances we can scale down infrastructure and save some money it's really easy when you round on the cloud but you need still need to understand what you are doing with the cloud otherwise it will be easier to spend more money on your infrastructure than you would do with old school on demand approach okay so then we send all of those messages to a single uh service which is a messaging service it has it may have multiple instances so those customers are the same just two different instances that's very important to understand and each message from the queue will be processed accordingly to the rules set configured for messaging to this particular customer and when we will send only mail only email only push notification or all of them or none of them is constantly if customer is unsubscribed for this particular message now i really want to get this idea for you those consumer one and consumer two they are exactly they are exactly the same just different instances it's like the same consumer i launched it two times they are doing the same job and that's what brings me to those points with use we have multiple producers single consumer but we can have thousands of those consumers in parallel consumers share work and that's again important to understand especially in comparison with notifications from the next slide consumers share work they are like a team which every one of them is doing the same job and first one who gets the message will process it and send it somewhere and what's the um what makes the two main features you start to think of cues first perfect fit for a background processing when you have to do some work for your customer and you want to do it in the background not making your customer wait you send the message uh to the messaging system messaging system immediately confirms okay i got your message next available consumer will process it and then you and it takes it's very quick so the point is overall system of multiple network messages is of course slower but funny enough your customer gets answer faster and that's quite cool so um anything for background processing what exactly do i mean for background processing for example application with screen viv profile pictures and you your customers um creating their accounts uploading their profile pictures and they sometimes upload huge photos like many many megabytes 20 megabytes 40 megabytes or maybe high res row quality professional pictures those may be like really a lot those may be really heavy and you have two options first option make it uncomfortable for your customer and say we don't allow upload anything of more than one or two megabytes will that work yes that will if you are a government structure which has no competition to others that may be the option you would take but if you are a commercial company which wants to earn money you have to respect your customers and that means what you don't want to depend on your background on your servers processing those pictures and make your customer wait customer uploaded the picture okay we say okay we got you you can go on and take your time do whatever you want use our service already and in background this huge image he uploaded will be processed by the first available consumer which will make a thumbnail of it and if you never used these asynchronous background processing before i really ask you to have an extra homework working on your project working on your real project thinking on your future projects think about this part of the processing must be synchronous it makes no sense to deliver any answer to client before this one is not done but maybe this part is uh groundable maybe i can make these part this part of my code to move to move this part of my code into background processing of requests it really makes your customers happy then they get answers faster especially now it's easier with front-end applications so and second feature of the queues we need to think a lot is easy to scale easy to distribute as the consumers are all the same and basically they consume messages one by one usually it's configurable but usually we take messages one by one you may scale them and launch new instances depending on the amount of the queue depending upon the amount of messages in the queue so it's really easy to scale within the single data center over multiple zones over multiple regions and that's one of the most powerful things so think of that as a background processing first and of easy to scale mechanism which helps you to dispatch billions of messages per second with ease so um then we talked about use our first think is use case are basically workers when you are making a move you want your um table to be moved to the car to a truck only once and there is no need to keep it move it to a track multiple times correct so that's for the job what has to be done only once and then we come to the next and last point you need to learn is a notification they are very different by the so it's still them message as well but it's very different to a queue message what is a notification with multiple producers you also can have multiple consumers and in this case consumers may be very very very very different what does that mean when producer dispatch an event but something happened i want multiple parts of my system to react on that so take a look many years ago we were working on a distributed management system for a hosting provider a company what runs web applications for you company you can host your website on and so on and so forth and when you have a lot of customers and a lot of different offers that's quite a lot of things to do and typical situation was then the client requires for example a creation deployment of a wordpress you know wordpress i guess so we have an offer client pushes the button he gets wordpress deployed and ready for work and actually that read is if you can do it against all simultaneously step by step very slow and execute all the steps from the main centralized management system which will get this query from a customer we'll go put the files when we'll go to create database for them when we'll go set up a proxy server in front of them and then launch the setup process and then give the results to a customer do you feel like how i'm talking about that and get some slower and slower and slower and slower yes it is so even a pure deployment of wordpress takes some time and we want it to be quicker so how do we do it in a decentralized way with notifications idea is very simple service what works with customers dispatches an event so request for wordpress and that's a one message or better to say one notification which goes to a single topic but there are multiple subscriptions on this topic from multiple servers server which responsible for files service which responsible for files we will call it consumer one we'll put files uh for the wordpress installation on disk then symbol at exactly at the same time exactly in the same moment exactly the same message but different subscription and different consumer different consumer will change best configuration shall change the settings on the proxy in front of all the installations and the last service which takes care of a database will initialize proper database operations uh for this deployment often at the same time by one single message and you know what producer one has no idea of this group of consumers so don't forget in this case those customers are the same for the queues they share with work and with the notifications those consumers are different they don't share the work they do the different logic and that's from logic business logic and also when you need to do different things if we would need to do more things like a person wants to deploy an application he immediately has to pay for when we just attach four consumer on the same subscription on the same event and it will react on this event so the main things of the notifications are multiple producers but multiple different consumers possible you may have one it's allow it it's not illegal it's a perfect fit for decentralized processing and it's really easy to extend typical use case for micro for uh those are micro services or basically any distributed applications including service oriented um well it's more about microservices muslim so that's it um hi z how you doing alex well thank you for that fantastic real world examples of messaging in the real world i mean it's one thing to talk about features but it's very important to talk about the software development life cycle and it's true you can't solve most problems by just making a restful api call it might work sometimes but not all the time yeah not for every project so based on our our last surveys um it looks like about half of the audience has done the last workshop and the other half has not so i'm thinking we can review the first lab and then we'll get straight into messaging paradigms how does that sound to you yeah that sounds good to me so i think i will switch to your screen correct well let um very quickly we can just share slide 22 and we'll just do the first lab directly i think that slides 22 give me a second this one okay so yeah that's right uh so you know what don't be lazy we deploy it already or nopes yes yes we should have deployed that architecture the infrastructure for you to do a work so you basically go to data stocks dot io slash uh evan streaming series ess episode 2 epdo dash lab and now we do only this one getting started fifa apache pulsar so and let's make it big because we have more work to do and some of you did that already okay so we have about five minutes for everybody to refresh the lab and uh that should keep all the people who've done it engaged from before yep uh [Music] um so let me check how it goes gts x dot io slash s slash ep 2 dash lab i will yeah so it's available so you can proceed i will throw the link in the chat install and run so um a question from smitha gopalam what's the difference between messaging systems and notification system so take a look first of all that's quite surprisingly good question um i mean because uh obvious answer would be there is no difference because usually the same system can support both queues and notifications and some other options but it's not exactly this way because it depends on the particular solution you are using so for example if you think of amazon web services if you know aws they provide two different systems uh for notifications simple notification service and for queues simple queueing service simple queue service but for example apache possibly we work to dave provides you both options so uh answer is it really depends on one particular system you are going to use normally usually um [Music] every messaging system supports both types of communication fix me if i'm wrong zeke we have a little bit different background on that no i mean i think your answer is pretty good notification and messaging systems are essentially the same um there's always a listener on a notifi notification system and a and a producer so conceptually they are the same thing yep perfect so when you are done with your exercise please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat we will know you are done yes and ashish kumar also makes a good addition to them things i was talking about right now um the difference between push mechanism and pull mechanism and actually that's a really great addition i should have added to my slides so ashish kumar uh thanks a lot from my site i will add edit to the slides indeed um they um that's not every it's not exactly the same for every system but talking about aws sns sqs that makes difference indeed uh i want to make uh push and vif notification service so notification service will go and notify the receiver and see with simple query service in aws uh service will wait for consumer to come and retrieve the data so mechanism comes from the consumer in this case but normally i would say anyway in other systems our initial connection is initiated by the consumer doesn't matter if you speak about notification or consumer that doesn't matter if you speak about queue or notification yeah so the big difference between a push-based and pull-based system is a application that is using a pull-based system has to continually pull the service for new messages so the perfect example of this is actually apache kafka if you write a kafka consumer you actually have to request new messages from kafka every x number of milliseconds so that's kind of um it's feature design it works exactly like a shark you know if the consumer stops pulling messages or stop swimming the application will die and fall off the cluster if you look at something like rabbitmq or other more traditional based messaging systems basically it's the broker itself that sends the message to the client application so that's a traditional messaging system and architecture [Music] right so i want to see how it goes and i see many people are doing work already nice so you are best that's amazing is anyone done yet i see five uh install and run completed okay that's good and java client seven started one completed no no no no one do the java stuff yet you're cheating you're cheating whoever you are yeah please don't run in front in front of a train we will reach this point with the java parts uh so if you did their homework uh for if you did the first part already then go get your tea or cafe or whatever you prefer but don't proceed with the java client we will do it soon but not right now but yeah that's cool to see what people are doing that and people are reaching that as well should we give people more time to complete the lab or should we just jump straight in i see so far only one thumbs up and i see so far in katakura dashboard what we have on the let me check eight completed um install and run scenarios so let's give a couple of more minutes we will try to answer questions sometime for example um ritvik if you did getting started fifa patch pulsar already no you don't have to run it again uh you just can i don't know grab some tea or whatever we will proceed give us three minutes and we'll get started with the rest of yeah this is for for the 20 or so people that didn't attend the first workshop yep and then uh zia who didn't say claims kafka and pulsar a dump pipelines well i can accept pipelines part but about the dump part if you can't if you would take a look at the architecture diagram of pulsar for example i wouldn't use the word dump in this case um so hi savario great scenarios completed scenario complete okay more and more people are done i wanted to answer one more question so uh zea odin says in web application websocket serves a websocket service for push notification to ui uh yes from the push point of view push pull point of view that's the idea which is similar to simple notification service of amazon web services but normally uh for them applications working with messaging platforms we use the approach then the consumer goes to them messaging service and says like okay i'm ready is there anything for me and that's indeed maybe a bit better approach because that's exactly what helps me to avoid the issue i explained it in the beginning then your push service tries to push something when a simple notification service of amazon tries to push something to a receiver if receiver is not ready it will retry a couple of times and well drop so okay there is a retry mechanism at least but that may be not the idea not the best uh case and so normally messaging platforms work like then you are available you go and tell them okay get me what you have and keeping this connection so scenario completed successfully completed completed completed i'm happy to see you are doing the things and i see 34 people started 15 completed what makes now almost half of the work done okay which is great and you know what nearly no one has started a java client after your words good yep good so do you need some few more minutes to proceed you can complete their lap after them you can complete the lab after them workshop and by the way let me give you a link the point is now uh for these uh for this uh particular scenario we run a special training infrastructure we pay money to o'reilly publishers house because it owns catacoda now for you to be able to execute their steps which is great and now we go for um as soon as the workshop is over after 15 minutes infrastructure will also be terminated and the question is how can you do the exercises after the workshop answer is this link so when you will want to do the things after the workshop cb send it to your co-worker send it to your friend you should use this link not the current trading cling because this one is dedicated for this particular workshop running right now and there is a question from smitha the first few slides spoke about messaging services cues and then notifications i am confused as to where this evolved in this order or are we just going over constants here so that's evolving exactly to the practice now you know the theory and we can proceed with a practice applying everything what we discussed it in the first part so keep going you will see the answer and one more thumbs up from tamarai kanan hey welcome to the club and i think we have to proceed 35 started 18 completed so over the cult all right that sounds like i think we're ready to move on all right everybody now let's talk about all the different ways you can process messaging and all the different capabilities that pulsar has to offer and then we'll do a hands-on exercise in java and we'll also be writing a pulsar sql application zig but wait a second i should switch to your screen i guess ah yeah yep just a second okay yes you're good thank you so as we recall with all the messaging systems there is always a concept of a topic a topic is where messages are sent to and where consumers read the data from so on a topic you have producers which send the data consumers which read the data and then acknowledge their reading position via a subscription cursor or if you're from the kafka world that's called an offset then finally there's another feature called a reader a reader is basically a way to audit a topic without actually acknowledging a reading position now there's two ways you can create a topic one is a partition topic so if you want to work in a kafka type workflow you have partitions the other is a non-partition topic so if you just want to send data to a topic and do traditional messaging that feature is readily available and topics of course have you know security and multi-tenancy we'll cover that in far more detail in our next workshop so the diagram of how a message is actually stored in a cluster so basically a topic is a logical channel right but a topic is not a physical thing it's like an address on a website so when you go to an address on a website you're not going to a particular location on a server it's a logical place to put information or retrieve information so a topic is exactly the same thing it could be forward slash users forward slash news that's exactly what it is so topics are actually stored as partitions and segments and entries on apache bookkeeper as you already know so each message has an id and this id consists of a ledger id an entry id a batch index and a partition id so as you can see a topic here has two partitions it has four segments and multiple entries and in this particular case you have the batch index of the message because it was produced the ledger id so which ledger it was written to then finally the partition id so pulsar is pretty interesting in that it allows both traditional messaging and streaming based messaging so we basically allow you to keep all messages and also to delete all messages after they are read so you have that functionality so the two rules to keep in mind when it comes to you know messaging of kafka and there's two rules one pulsar will keep all messages until they are read by a consumer that then acknowledges the messages so if there's no messages that are um outstanding like unacknowledged then they won't be deleted and that's the default behavior so if you just queue up a bunch of messages pulsar will store them indefinitely so that's rule number one and you can change it later rule number two pulsar does not intend to keep acknowledged messages in a topic with no subscriptions so messages will only be retained until they are acknowledged and once they are acknowledged by a consumer they'll be marked for deletion meaning they have a time they have tombstones on them so the difference between let's say pulsar and a much older school mq system is in those system those messages are deleted pretty much right off the disk you know they do random disk access they do a lot of searching operations um and it's deleted off the hard disk so in pulsar deleting of messages is a background you know operation that's part of the garbage collection and the um the tombstoning mechanism is very much exactly the same as cassandra and kafka in fact works exactly the same way but circling back to the actual slides here as you can see you have a producer which sends unacknowledged messages right and then you have a subscription which is the subscription cursor or the consumer which has read you know to acknowledge messages and every time a consumer reads a message the subscription cursor gets advanced so it can read the next unacknowledged messages and once the message is acknowledged it will then be deleted now there is something called a backlog so basically a backlog is all unacknowledged messages on an existing subscription and the slowest subscription determines the size of the backlog and the ttl or time to live is the age or life of messages within a particular topic and basically this allows you to store messages to handle things like backlog growth so it's very possible to oversize your backlog so pretty much you know in this case you have a producer which is producing too many messages and you have a backlog of unacknowledged messages and a consumer is reading them as often as it can now every message has what's called a time to live now this is an optional configuration and what it does is it allows you to configure the age of unacknowledged messages so if you're coming from a kafka world you know default messages are saved only seven days regardless of you know um the consumer groups so you have that feasible functionality in pulsar as well then finally you have something called a retention policy so a retention policy again this is to if you're coming from a streaming or kafka-esque world um basically a retention policy allows you to keep messages that are already acknowledged so if you don't want to delete the messages and you want to just read them for later maybe you need to replay data maybe you have to save two weeks of data that's a retention policy is so this allows you to run for example existing kafka applications on a pulsar cluster which if you haven't had the chance we gave a workshop a webinar on that i believe last week or the week before but anyway you should check it out it's on our website um there's also sample code for that exercise i think i think sorry for interrupting i think that we can put all the additional materials into the github repo we created for these uh series so everyone who is interested to get more will be able to get more cool so i'll upload the code to github as well for that should be good so putting all these concepts together basically you have a producer which sends a message to a topic and the messages are at first unacknowledged right they go straight to the topic and they're stored on the apache bookkeeper and these messages are queued up now assuming that they within their attention policy then those messages won't be deleted or even in the ttl policy they won't be deleted but those two settings play different roles now once the message is read by the consumer then the subscription cursor will move and you know acknowledge messages now if there's a retention policy the messages you know will be deleted after a certain amount of time and if the messages are within that retention policy then they won't be deleted so does anyone have any questions on um message size ttl backlog please sew um can we create a retention policy for our uh convenience uh to create message application question by the malka yes so you do have the ability like you do in kafka to create topics directly from a producer um it's not recommended but you can do that you know there's administrative apis generally speaking you should just do it separately you know write an admin command write an admin program do it from a ui but yes your producer will create a new topic by default and you can configure that topic in the producer side so it's possible but i would not recommend it um it's just not best practice if that makes sense yeah i think so um maybe we will get an extension for this question later and let me check one okay uh from bala narasimha rao anne can you elaborate more about namespace and tenant in terms of kafka language yeah so the way to look at namespaces and tenants um kafka doesn't have anything like it but essentially what namespaces and tenants do is that they allow you to basically create a group of topics that can span multiple geographies as in multiple clusters and also you know those tenants and namespaces have security policies applied to them so let's say for example you're a forensic accounting team and you need to have your own special topic that spans worldwide and no one else in the company can see that data you would create a special tenant called forensic accounting and you create topics like auditing and you know financial security stuff topic and yeah that topic would be exclusive to that team and it would span multiple regions another example would be a tenant called um china only data so imagine you're a global company and you need to do business in china very common and china basically they require you as an organization to lock your data in china so it can't enter the country it can't leave the country it just has to be there so in that regard you could technically create like an isolated data set or even gdpr right same thing you can create you know a topic or a namespace well really a namespace that would span or just run in a particular apache bookkeeper client along with a um a particular topic i hope i answered your question yeah i think so and let me check the rest of that so how many brokers exist per topic um that's up to you you could have you could have okay so i i need to go back way far so basically topics are stored on a broker right and a broker is responsible for messaging of the data now bookkeeper is responsible for storing up that data and those topics are stored as fragments on apache bookkeeper and generally speaking you should have three but yeah you need to have at least three for leadership election but um yeah the answer is at least three technically you could have one but you know it's a clustering technology don't have one of anything just reliability engineering 101 right okay so let's talk about storage so ledger is a message storage operation unit so basically deletion of data happens on each ledger and a message is not deleted individually so the way ledgers work and we can do a separate workshop on just operating a pulse hey zig wait a second we can't hear you okay sorry looks like we have a little interruption hey okay we lost zeke give me a moment to recover connection can you hear me yeah now we can i was writing slack okay okay i don't know what happened but we're good so basically um with pulsar you store your messages on ledgers and the storage size is limited by your backlog size and your attention policy and your disk size should really be always greater than your storage size so the other thing to talk about is tiered storage so pulsar has the opportunity to store data um in cheaper storage mechanisms so maybe of s3 buckets azure blobs or another hard disk sitting on your network somewhere or hadoop nodes so tiered storage is how you can use pulsar to be a cheaper messaging solution than let's say any other technology because you can use very cheap storage it's transparent to the client and you know the same rules apply right you have message retention and backlog policy so what this means is anytime you're using you know tiered storage with a particular topic that particular topic will have the same backlog retention and acknowledgement settings on the tiered storage or as a storage on the physical device that's something to keep in mind so let's talk about producers right so producers are responsible for sending messages to the brokers producers have a local message queue which gives it a max pending message size so this cue size is a local queue so basically let's say you're entering a tunnel with your producer you have an iot device and for whatever reason you know it can't connect so it'll build up these messages until it can finally send you have the option to block if the key was full and you can also do cue management which means you're working for a broker using a receipt the other thing too is sort of message batching so you can send you know chunks of messages and groups and stored as a single unit and this is very good for you know networking issues and performance there is also a re-delivery concern for unacknowledged messages so you can do batch index acknowledgements we'll cover partitions producers more a little bit later but that kind of covers the basics of it so partitions what are they well basically you can use them if you want and i generally say that they're necessary partitions are how you do parallel processing systems like pulsar and kafka so basically they are what allow you to handle you know large volume traffic application so the more partitions you have the more parallel processing of the data you have partitions are also used for message routing so basically you can do partitioning of the messages based by key so particular keyed messages will go to a partition you have round robin and then you also have custom producing messages as well and then there's hashing schemes you can dynamically update these partitions in a topic and the settings are done on the apache bookkeeper side so all topics will be becoming a partition topic right and message ordering is guaranteed from the same producer and from the same key in the same partition so kind of putting the concepts together right you have a producer that writes to three partitions and each of them are on three brokers and then you have two consumers one consumer is reading just one partition and another consumer is reading two partitions so this is what i mean by the power of partitions right the more partitions you have the more consumers can read the data and the more consumers reading your data the faster your application can be uh we have two good questions maybe you would like to answer three questions um go ahead yeah yep so i will start in order of coming uh first question i think you will like from ashish kumar has pulsar better performance than kafka it depends um it depends so basically um kafka stores you know the message bus and the messages themselves in the same broker so there's no like networking there so when everything's working in kafka in theory that should be faster however if you've ever operated a large kafka cluster before that's just simply a nightmare because you're going to deal with issues of running out of disk space and you need to add a new broker when you add a new kafka broker to a cluster that has tremendous operational overheads the second thing too is um you can't do tiered storage yet i think that's an upcoming feature so in that regard logically speaking should be faster but it comes at a great operational cost now you do have a much more interesting feature of apache pulsar called non-persistent topics so non-persistent topics are exactly like redis topics meaning these topics will exist only in memory now why would you want something like that well if you want to make a pulsar topic be as fast as conceivably possible you could do it in memory topic only and there's a lot of advantages to that one it's in memory and um it's replicated you know multiple times and it's highly available so that is very available and it's exponentially faster than kafka but you don't have you know your data written to disk so pulse is flexible and that's kind of the value of it has over the performance of kafka next question yep uh good so a question from tanay balanim if producer and consumer are in different zones under different bookkeeper with totally different gdpr when we will require a novice microservice to share data from one queue or message server to another yeah so that's um that's called multi-tenancy and that's when you set the policy at the name space level we don't really cover that in today's workshop in fact they don't even have slides for it for today but we can cover that more into the third workshop which is all about integration and design patterns of pulsar and you know deployment patterns how to do geo replication all that fun stuff but broadly speaking you know what you do is you set a tenant to span multiple geographies and then you assign specific users to it now in regards to gdpr itself um you know pulsar does let you do encrypted messaging so if you need to encrypt individual messages there is some java code on the website and how to do that you can also delete messages when you need them and non-persistent topics are a guaranteed way of deleting messages so um there's different ways of doing gdpr it's a common question i get from banks so if you're interested in talking more i can run you through those slides send me an email coordinate through alex and we'll get back to you yes question definitely uh so a question from uh savario guzzo uh ciao saverio can you process just the messages what are still within their ttl if they're still within their ttl yes definitely i'm i'm not sure i get the point uh maybe point is in the just so so if the messages still exist on the broker you can read them with either another consumer or reader you can also move the offset so just like consumer groups and kafka have reading positions pulsar have subscription group positions called offsets you can move them to an earlier point in time so if you need to reread acknowledge messages you do have that facility yep um question from smitha gopalam in cassandra touching multiple partitions at the same time is not recommended our partitions in kafka and pools are different from partitions in cassandra from this point of view oh i'm not a cathan or a guru i've never actually used cassandra i'm more of a kafka person but um you do have the ability to do like local quorum with pulsar so you can acknowledge your messages to just one particular cluster and that it and then let the data replicate um asynchronously in the background the other option you have is if you know you're you're like a bank or a large organization and you can't afford to lose any message is you can do global acknowledgement of messages right you send your data to one cluster you wait until it's replicated to the other cluster and then your consumer can read it after it's been fully acknowledged by the producer so i hope i answered your question i think so um so in the last one uh i mean yeah maybe we have to move on you see like there are a lot of questions and that's amazing actually thank you for all the questions thank you for your participation last question though uh we will uh answer ours in the end if we will have time for questions and answers and if we don't then please feel free to contact us on discord well so ruby ruby i mean it's a name of the one who asks not for language in this case oh maybe that's the language asking questions uh so to recap the difference with capcom here each partition are not assigned to a broker because that's the issue with kafka right when it comes to adding a new broker we will have to rebalance yeah yeah so when you add a broker to kafka it's a massive pain or adding a adding a partition or just doing any kind of operations with kafka as a pain because fundamentally all the core technologies are you know through a single server which you can then replicate the the power of pulsar is the fact that each component of the pulsar service is open source so apache bookkeeper has been around for a while a broker as well in zookeepers they're all independent clustering technologies that have all their own different ways of operating and they're all very easy and focused on what they need to do so if you need to for instance add more processing power you can add more brokers if you need to add more storage capability and more processing power for storing those messages you add more bookkeepers if you need more metadata just add a more zookeeper but honestly zookeeper plays such a small role in pulsar you're really fine with just three nodes and that should be good all right guys we really need to get on because and last point before we move on i see uh many dozens of people watching us live right now but i see only 33 likes set on youtube and then guys we're answering your questions that's not fair set the thumbs up right now and we will move on okay uh so we are good to go so zeke what's next so partition topics are not bound by the number of brokers they're implemented as internal topics right and partitions allow you to do parallelism they increase control they do throughput and they increase um the routing mode so consumers have different ways of doing subscriptions so consumers use subscriptions to track message consumptions a subscription cursor is a reference point or an offset to track the current message consumption so it's used to keep track of many things right you want to know your reading position in a book so if i open a book like developers are the new king makers um you can consider this to be a ledger right and i need to know my reading position in it so a very good example would be your offset you take your offset you put it in your ledger that's your reading position it's an offset so i know i'm on page 33. that's why you call it apache bookkeeper you keep track of all your books um so you have cues and different ways of keeping track of these so consumers subscribe to multiple topics generally speaking they have to be in the same name space you can't have a consumer spreading multiple namespaces or tenants you can have the same user but the consumer application ideally should just be federated to what it's trying to do you have a you can subscribe to multiple topics within that tenant or namespace and you can follow a regular expression if you need to and subscriptions start from two different positions by default either earliest or latest and like i was saying later consumers can work in a geo-replicated fashion so they can only read from a replicated subscription state so you have that ability as well so generally speaking consumers attach to a subscription and they consume from a broker which has a subscription cursor you can receive messages asynchronously or synchronously and consumers will request to receive messages via flow control as a receiver queue and we'll cover acknowledgements in a bit so consumers are flexible in pulsar you can use consumers exactly like you would in kafka and you can also use it like an mq traditional messaging system so there's really no consumer group well there are if you're using key shared or shared and you have different messages methodologies between them so basically the first two subscription modes are very traditional keylink systems so we have exclusive which is the default mode exclusive is very good if you want a particular application to always read from a particular topic and you want no other application to read from that topic so consumer a is exclusively subscribed to that subscription and no other application can join why would you want an exclusive mode well basically if you don't want to add any consumers you don't want to do any parallel processing you just want that one consumer running the next other feasible option is called a failover subscription this is good if you have the computer resources to have a second consumer running in case the first consumer fails so this allows multiple consumers to attach to the same subscription only one master consumer which has the highest priority of messaging and messages are delivered to the master consumer only the delivery of messages to the next consumer fails in line when you know the consumer fails to acknowledge messages it times out etc next is shared mode the shared mode this is a very um kafka-esque pattern so basically depending upon the number of partitions you have or actually the partitions don't even matter here you can do shared mode just based on consumers but partitions are how this works um you need partitions so basically it allows you to have multiple consumers attached to the same subscription the message is our distributed round robin so if there's three consumers each consumer will receive exactly one message and any message is distributed to only one consumer when a consumer fails all are sent to the messages that are not acknowledged and will be rescheduled to the remaining consumers now key shared mode is an interesting feature but basically what this does is it allows you to do key based message delivery on a consumer side so a consumer will subscribe to a topic and a particular key and that consumer is guaranteed always to get both the data in that topic and only those keyed messages this is extremely useful if you know you're trying to write business logic that depends on a particular key and you're trying to solve a particular problem so i can't emphasize how valuable this is doing key based messaging and consuming with koski is very painful and it's not easy with pulsar it just works so message consumption has a lot of flexibility you can do fan out publish and subscribe you can have multiple consumers and unique subscription names per consumer and the default subscription mode is exclusive now queuing has multiple consumers they can share the same description name and you can do things there's also plenty of flexibility you can combine these two in different ways you can subscribe to multiple topics so by default one consumer subscribes to one topic and multi topic subscription is doable you can give it a list of topic names or you can use a regular expression pattern but ultimately they have to belong to the name the same namespace so namespace is a security policy and a way of organizing data so let's talk about readers so you can read from the same topic directly with no subscription needed and you just basically you can also explicitly specify a message id so if you need to read a particular message you can do it and you can then iterate from one message after the other now another new feature that just came out is a transaction support so what this does is it allows you to send messages atomically to pulsar and then read messages atomically to pulsar as well now these transactions are not enabled on a global cluster level it's only transactional to a single cluster uh global acknowledgements will come later transactions i mean but it's on the roadmap at least i see it on the roadmap next we have message deduplication so basically producers each message is produced to a pulse or topic is persisted to disk only once this is useful if you're dealing with a lot of duplicate messages so pulsar has the ability on the producer application side and the broker side to remove extra messages so another thing you need to know is that consumers by default and pulsar have dead letter queues so basically every programming language whether it's python java ruby c-sharp all these languages that connect to pulsar have dead letter cues built into it out of the box so a dead letter topic enables you to consume new messages with some of the messages which cannot be consumed successfully by consumer and in this messages messages that are failed to be consumed are stored in a separate topic which is called the dead letter queue you can then decide hand how to handle those messages a dead loader topic so the code you're seeing is in java by default dead letter topics follow the same naming standards the other interesting thing about pulsar is you can do um priority based messaging so basically if you set a priority on the consumer level you should theoretically be able to consume the messages faster than others delayed messaging so delayed message delivery enables you to consume a message later rather than immediately in this mechanism a message is stored in bookkeeper there's this um delayed message tracker which gives you to set a time index so it could be now plus a certain amount of time in memory after it is published to the broker is then delivered to the consumer once a specific delayed time is passed so you can in fact use pulser i'm not going to say the koran tab but you could do delayed eventing which is extremely useful so basically a broker saves a message without any check and when a consumer consumes a message if the message is set to delay then the message is added to the delayed delivery tracker and a subscription checks and gets timed out messages from the delayed delivery trucker so message delivery only works in a shared subscription mode in exclusive and fail over subscription modes the delayed message is dispatched immediately let's talk about acknowledgements so basically a message is persisted is persistently stored and deleted only after all subscriptions have acknowledged it so you can acknowledge your subscription of particular messages either individually meaning one at a time or cumulatively after you've read several pages in your book so to speak so you can acknowledge a group of messages you can also have an acknowledgement timeout so it will automatically redeliver the messages if you timed out to read it more interestingly enough you can do what's called a negative acknowledgement so if for whatever reason you don't like the message you received and you couldn't process it you can ask pulsar to send the same message again maybe there was some network error maybe there was some you know nefarious actor injecting bytes into your network um you never know but you can negatively acknowledge message to request a new message immediately so you don't have to wait for a timeout and that's a feature kafka doesn't have you know you can set your timeout but you can't explicitly ask for a new message so this gives you precise control so again you have dead letter topics and then finally you have retry queues so retry queues are different from a dead letter topic basically a re tri-letter topic is like let's say you're running a bakery right and you have a lot of customers standing in line and you're serving a lot of customers cookies and people are in line now let's just imagine that you have an order ready for one customer and the customer is not there to receive the cookie so what you do is you set that message aside to the retry letter topic and then when the consumer returns it can then receive the message so that's kind of what the retry letter topic it is it's just for retrying messages a good use of this is if you're calling a third party api from a consumer application right so if you're using a third party api service that's where retry letter topics are extremely useful i can't emphasize how valuable every trial letter topic is if you're using third-party services same thing with dead letter topics if your third-party api is giving you bad data you need to clean it up somehow so that's kind of the use of both of them so summarizing everything so basically you have the retention policy so basically once a message is acknowledged by default it should be deleted eventually the retention policy lets you store messages even if they have been acknowledged and the expiry policy sets the ttl for messages that have not been acknowledged all right lab time so now we're going to do that java code i'm sorry to keep you waiting i know everybody's been waiting to do this one but time to do that java code um should i stop doing sharing my screen or should everyone just do it or uh i i think you keep sharing okay there is i mean there is nothing to switch um to i can do those uh steps maybe if you want me to demonstrate the lap but i better ask our guys to do that on their own if you do if you have laptop or computer you have to do it right now we will give you something or if you are on the mobile phone not at home not in the office and cannot do it right now then go get some tea or lemonade or whatever you prefer and do this exercise again later again if you're doing this exercise with us together during on monday 14th of june you have to follow this link on the screen if you are doing this exercise after that so if you are watching the recording then maybe you know what i will indeed switch to my screen and show what to do in this case i sent the link already into the youtube chat but i want to sh show it again so i will indeed switch to my display and if you are doing exercise don't get distracted uh keep doing things that's for those who are watching for recording so it's going to be katakuri.com data starts and here somewhere down you will have this pulsar series where is it by the way apache pulsar learning series here we go a hands-on introduction to apache pulsar you push start the course button and then select the appropriate scenario we have five of them now we are doing creating apache pulsar producers consumers and readers in java and the last one for today will be the third one with sql over pulsar yes uh next so i think i can switch back to your display okay i'll share my screen again should i go through the lab with everybody would that be beneficial or what do you think you see that's always like that's always a good question i see people when we are doing exercises from them when they don't do it manually and just watch what we are doing and i don't like that i want them to learn yeah yeah so but so maybe we can answer oh yeah and the number of people doing the second one it grows a lot beautiful yeah beautiful beautiful cool well maybe we can answer not for questions meanwhile yeah let's answer questions and then we'll we'll get into sql after this yep cool so there were some questions to talk about give me a second okay maybe this one for the beginning um asks is there a replication factor concept or something like that like how is the hey availability is ensured yeah that that was covered in my first workshop but basically um there is what's called a quorum um read acknowledgement and a quorum right acknowledgement and ensemble ensemble size determines the number of um machines in the cluster acknowledgement right determines how many you know machines should be written to so that's kind of a replication factor and then acknowledgement read is how many to read from i think that's a global setting you might be able to also configure something on a topic level but um at least as far as i know it's global setting but you can read up more on that in your own time okay so not a question but i just uh want uh to voice it up uh smita thinks it's an awesome love thank you yeah indeed so what's next um question was answered in the chat already so we can skip that if you want a question is what's the difference between a reader and the consumer so a consumer has a has a uh let's look at this this king maker book right so consumer you know it reads the book it reads the book and it tells apache pulsar my offset my index my reading position now a reader could be someone on the subway right that just reads the book but it doesn't keep its reading position anywhere there's no offset there's nothing so reader is just a way to take a peek inside the data that's what it means okay yeah that's uh am i right but in most i don't i my working experience was mostly it was mostly the prohibited queue um yeah am i right what readers are rarely use it well in comparison uh in comparison with consumers so consumers is the main tool to work with data yeah i don't i don't really think readers are used all that often they're useful for like taking a peek inside your data um it's also a good way of just like it's good for like auditing you know you want to just like see like what message like basically if someone tells you there's a problem they say okay let's look at page like 23. that's what it is so reader is just basically a way to take a glance at a particular message in a particular offset so that's what it's used for as far as i know but i could be wrong i mean you know pulsar is a flexible platform and we'll never know what people are going to do with it we're just making this new technology great and i think the last one for now because we have to move on um i'm not sure i got it uh how does a consumer consuming from a specific partition work in conjunction with a kd type kd type what is k yeah that's my point as well so uh k uh single quote d ruby if you would clarify what you meant we will be happy to answer and by the way i wanted to say you i see so many people moving on doing their work in katakuri dashboard and i also see so many new likes so thank you for liking this video it looks like you are happy to be here with us as well good and um last question which i will answer very briefly smitha asks at the end of a session three will there be a slight going over the differences between kafka and pulsar it would be helpful my answer is take a look you we have something much better than just a slide in the end we have a real webinar uh for like one hour take one hour approximately yes yeah taking care of all the main differences between kafka and pulsar and it's recorded and it's available already for you for free so i will get the link i will set the link to the youtube chat and i will attach the link to the additional additional resources to our github repo so you will have access to this link while zig will be talking i will take care of that thank you any other questions um nothing what we would answer by voice i would suggest ask to move on okay are we ready to move to the rest of the workshop and let me check so how it goes on katakura everyone i see 26 people started the work 29 already but i see only four completed it so it looks like java client takes longer time and there's a lot more stuff yeah all right a lot of more stuff indeed more clicking yeah it's a hard one i i would love to just do it for you but that you you won't learn anything will you yep so uh regarding the forward questions if you have further crash questions to us easiest way to communicate with us is via our discord server i will send the link to the youtube chat right now boom done so if you are done with the second lap please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so we will know you already or maybe not the thumbs up but okay or maybe happy smile whatever you prefer but i want to see this number growing okay it's already eight so people uh start to finish that's dead yeah start to finish sounds a little bit funny but that's um when we get 50 i'll move on yep so please move on do your work on the java client and we will move on notice what you don't need to have like particular knowledge of java i believe there are some developers with non-java experience and that's completely fine because basically all code is prepared and you just need to follow that and try to get as much from it as possible it will be easier if you have a background with java but anyway as long as you can read in english it's um was it it will be very easy like you know what zig it was really easy for me to learn english it looks very similar to c plus it does good so i will meanwhile check for some questions [Music] oh okay good question from smitha again is there a certification for pulsar we're hoping to so yeah uh answer is at least from my side from what i have heard at this moment there is no certification at least not from data stocks side i'm not responsible for our companies of jerusalem but i believe we need to have it yeah and personally i will try to push this idea to add courses about pulsar intra into the academy.datastarts.com and obviously add certification for pulsar 2 but it's definitely will take time because you know what certification must be valuable certification my must really validate your skills and that means what it will take some significant time so i won't expect any pulsar uh certifications from data stacks in at least within next three to four months i would say sorry we wanted to be really high quality so we will not hurry doing that okay yeah we'll just take these content and add some more i think we need harder questions really harder questions harder labs that would probably get us to good certification standards yep yep okay so i see more people are setting thumbs up in the youtube chat and yeah recorded dashboard gives me 32 started 10 completed which makes one third so okay we are almost on the end of a workshop that's what i'm worried about should um should we just move on because we have a third lab we have to do yeah we have a third lab we have to do today uh we have to move on and we have quiz by the way to play a game and to dispatch prizes those who did the best so you know what everyone i'm sorry we have to move on and if you haven't done with this workshop you can do it after the workshop these training infrastructure will be terminated after some time it will be terminated in half an hour uh but you still will be able to do the exercises uh on uh katakura as i shown to you using different link so i think at this start i'm sorry we have to move on all right let's talk about schema management so basically if you're coming from a kafka world you're probably very familiar with the concept of avro but essentially a schema registry is a way of giving your data a data governance essentially so what this means is you apply a rule set to your data and schema is also useful for sql we'll cover that later but basically your data has type safety which is very important for protecting your consumers from reading malformed data with bad fields and the schema registry itself is operating on bookkeeper so it's not a separate service you have to run you can also register schemas via a client application or a rest api and you can do json avro and i think even protobuf if i'm not mistaken but generally speaking the industry style standard is avro pulsar stores the current schema and ensures that the producers and consumers conform the schema will be validated and there is um schema evolution just like an average schema so your existing kafka average schemas should go right into pulsar very nicely now i have a python example this is code for the upcoming workshop so you know next week we'll run another workshop in covid19 data but i wanted to draw attention to the schema here right so basically you create a new class where you give it all of its attributes you know a date which is a string and then some integers and then a country so you can see the field type here right in front of you and when you actually call it you know you connect to your pulsar cluster you create your producer which then you define the schema to the type and then you actually send up to pulsar using the producer.send method and you have to compile you know a record so as you can see in the very middle of the screen we have record is equal to covid19 and then you have all the fields so that's kind of the power of schemas and it's very very easy and i i happen to love python it's such a readable language so the producer's side of the schema basically the producer sends this game information to a broker this the broker then checks to see if the schema is registered if it is then it returns the schema version and the producer is connected and done with its job if it's not then you have to check if you know the producer has the ability to even write schemas and if it is well then it writes to schema manager now how does the consumer do this well basically as you know a consumer subscribes to a topic but it first checks to see if there's a schema for this message it's receiving if there is then it checks for the compatible strategy and it will get the data if it's not then it will see if the schema is registered and then it will upload it i can take schema related questions afterwards because we really have to do the next lab we have a limited time sql on pulsar so basically pulsar messages have a well-defined schema right pulsar is a built-in schema registry therefore you set schemas on a per topic basis and this feature is only available in java python go and cnc plus plus clients now pulsar sql is actually not a pulsar product at all it's actually made by a fantastic other apache project called presto so presto is a open source distributed sql engine for various different technologies and it has both a coordinator and workers so presto wrote a pulsar connector which allows you to read data on a pulsar cluster via presto db which is an open source project so you have many different commands so um basically the example you're seeing here is a data schema so at the top you have a job search request schema which has you know trace id a user id request id city id and keywords and then you have another schema called job search response so let's say we wanted to display the top 10 keywords in today's job search requests so basically you would do a select star sd keyword from pulsar looking through the topic search job basically where the current date as you can see in the above you can root by the keywords another query you could easily run is selecting the trace id so you do trace id from the response attribute so the overall presto architecture so apache pulsar is used to store streams of event data and the event data is structured with predefined fields right because we're using schemas now with the implementation of schema registry you can then store structured data in pulsar and query the data using prestodb as a core feature of pulser sql the presto sql connector enables presto workers within a presto cluster to query data from pulsar the query parent performance is highly efficient and scalable because pulsar adopts the two level segment based architecture as you can see in these diagrams so topics in pulsar are stored as segments in apache bookkeeper and each topic segment is replicated to sunbrook bookkeeper nodes this enables concurrent reads and writes through throughput and you can configure the number of presto workers the default is up to three finally the wonderful thing is you can deploy a pulsar sql worker cluster as well on multiple nodes so as you can see from this select star statement you can see all the different sql worker nodes running so understanding the presto term well we can get this slide but essentially presto pulsar sql is a distributed worker technology and it's very good in that you can query live data provided your data follows the schema if you don't follow a schema you can't do any sql sorry guys but if you want to use sql on your data you need to use the schema rule number one all right final lab final lab let's do it by the way you can keep the other lab running if you're still doing it um just open another terminal is what i would advise there is a little limitation we found out but basically every lap is executed uh in the same uh vm in in the same vm yeah in the same container so they now intersect somehow usually on katakura every scenario executed in the new container so if you you shouldn't have any problems mostly if you have some write about that in the youtube chat and stephano will help you with that because he run into his problem already so he knows how to solve it i think next time i'll give two lengths one for the live audience and one for the youtube audience that would probably be very helpful or or we could update these links later you know um to point to the the normal catacota link that might be a good idea yep uh so while you are doing the exercises i see what we have how many people 24 people started for last quarter club the last lap only three finish it they finished that okay we finished it yeah already well they did that like one hour ago i told them don't do it yeah yeah but okay uh so um i want to check while you are doing the lap how how it goes with the question so give me a moment uh g lunch i i'm getting exceptions while executing their comments and it will be really hard to support you in the youtube chat so i suggest you to join our discord and publish them screenshots so we will see what's going on with your infrastructure and with your environment uh ritwik city vastava so basically the same story can't run show catalogues in pulsar sql client showing kuror we need to know which error it has what is an event hub what is an event hub yeah what does an event have okay well do you have an idea in this context yeah yeah i'm just going back to your slides um okay okay so an event hub is just like in this diagram right it's an event manager so essentially um service provider a sends data and then service consumer reads the data from the event hub so an event hub is you know it could be a topic it could be multiple topics um but it's basically what pulsar or kafka or rabbitmq what all these technologies are trying to do it's um you know a messaging oriented middleware did i answer your question i think so it wasn't my question you see so i cannot confirm that yeah there is a question i really like i believe uh this question shows we did our job well okay so question he is from vimal uh s i kindly suggest any ebook for apache pulsar to learn more ah um so there's a very great author here his name is uh david k and it's a manning book he's publishing right now it's called um apache pulsar in action so we need to provide a link to that book in the chat window don't we i apologize i can't pronounce your full name um let's see patchy pulsar in action david k yeah david consumer god yeah i see it's by money you know yeah david kierungart that's by manning publications publisher's house and i can send the link on that so give me a moment yeah that's it youtube chat here we go with them all so give me a moment good and read pick posted the screenshot of aurora in discord okay we will take care of it but right now we have to finish in two minutes and we still have things to do and thank you stefano for helping and assisting all the possible issues in the youtube chat good pokemon morning you know so uh what's the next step for us tell me please we are done and we are proceeding to quiz yeah you want to proceed the quiz or you want to know i wanted to ask if you have any slides left that's my question ah i have no more slides it's quiz time ah so okay it's a quiz time i'll stop sharing my screen okay give me a moment then yes you can switch off and so ladies and gentlemen i see not all of you have completed the third lab and some haven't completed the second after the workshop you will have time to do it on your own pace uh via hourlying instances will stay for some more minutes and then they are terminated you can do the same exercise as i've shown to you at catacodo.com pulsar learning series those are the same exercises you can proceed don't forget to make the screenshots of successfully completed tasks you will need them submitting homework for web participation certificates and pages and so on and now we are switching to quiz so get your mobile phones uh switch to main team and we are going to ask you questions and you are going to answer fast if you are doing it fast enough you will win prizes from the data starts and code is the same two six four eight four two nine zero and i want to see everyone joining i want to see literally everyone here okay that's it how many people do we have 30 we have i see we have over 70 people on youtube and only 30 people on mentee and you know what don't make it it's been easy for those who will get the prizes make the competition mentor.com is completely unanimous you don't have to put your mobile phone number or email or i don't know credit card just jump in answer the questions on your mobile phone and win the prizes so i will give you 15 more seconds to proceed jump in again mandy.com code 26484290 i will show you the code once six again eight two four two nine zero i hope you can see that right now okay okay okay so how many people do we have right now over 180 concurrent viewers and i have only 35 people on quiz so okay if you already got your price and don't want to prevent others from getting theirs that's quite fair we will start then so ladies and gentlemen i gave you enough time to jump in that means we are starting right now we will go so answer fast to get more points that's the question number one what does producer do it sends data to the consumer it sends data to pulsar it reads data from fuser it reads data from the consumer and i bet many people made a mistake and got into my trap today okay six well you did well surprisingly well i thought you you will be in a hurry in a rash and you will made a mistake but most of you've answered it correctly it sends data to pulsar notice not to the consumer not like the normal messaging works when you have to reach directly the one who is going to receive your message but it sends data to pulsar that's what right and you did well and you paid attention now i see it doesn't send data to consumer and it definitely does not read data from pulsar or from the consumer neighborhood so most of you gave the right answer but who was fast enough i see fire dancer did great and bala baroners ebala narasimha on the second place and artem on the third one which is a great result i see some familiar names here already hi ruby hyper full and that brings us to the second question question number two so answer fast to get more points the pulsar messages are stored on zookeeper broker bookie transit only never stored will it be easy for you or not how many of you will make the mistake i'm very curious and the right answer is pulsar messages are stored not on zookeeper not on broker and yes they are store it and they store it on bookie which is a part of a bookkeeper apache system which is a part which is a part of a pulsar i should have reviewed the architecture a little better in the beginning but it's okay just review the first workshop yeah that's the second episode so those who join laid they don't know where beginning for foundation quite clear so ruby was the fastest giving the right answer which brings him to the third place and that's very well because first three places will get the results but fire dancer and bala narasimha keeping the first two places and well well well i see what fitra alim is like with just few points behind ruby ready to fight for the third place and artom has lost his place but maybe he will recover let's see so ladies and gentlemen that's question number three and you have to answer fast to get more points shared subscription mode in shared subscription mode all customers get all messages each messages goes to exactly one consumer you cannot share a subscription every message is sent to aws because sharing is caring time is over and the right answer is in shared subscription mode consumer yet all consumers get all the messages because shared subscription is used to distribute the messages over multiple subscribers or consumers in this case so no sure that's uh what was the name of the mode when the message goes down it's a round robin is what a shared subscription is so basically if you have three consumers and there's three messages each consumer will get a message good so no results in that question sorry if uh oh that is a mistake what brings bala directly to the 10th place away from top three and but that was quite lucky for our tom who makes it back to the top three and ruby was fastest again with a very good result getting already to the second place using the mistake of balan okay now proful kataka is on the fourth place following our term so close so that's going to be question four and you have to answer fast to get more points which subscriptions are available in pulsar share it exclusive payover 9.99 per month some people must be worried at this point and time is up and first three answers were correct so whatever you choose share it exclusive for failover you was right and regarding the money apache pulsar is an open source system so you don't pay for it only for the infrastructure you use to run it uh okay chat is quiet no questions in the youtube chat everyone is very focused and that makes sense so who made a mistake and who was fast enough to get higher are there any changes okay there were slow slow downs and fidra alim was the fastest one jumping directly to the top three on the leaderboard with fire dancer and ruby holding first two places and manjit on the fourth okay that's a competition that's what i like and that's question number five so answer fast to get more points what is the name of connectors to push messages from pulsar to other systems think source think sing see some of you may know the answer but who will be the fastest and yes definitely sing sync is the name of a connector to push messages from pulsar to our system that brings us to the next question i will ask in a moment and i can't believe on their leaderboard two leaders made a mistake jumping back and now we have only five people who made no mistake uh before fire dancer petra lim with pasta sansa got to the second place papi was on the third welcome to the top free papi i hope it feels great and artem is on the four well well well well that looks interesting so you know what i will not make you wait mate wait that's a question number six answer fast to get more points what is the name of connectors to pull messages from other systems think source sync sync seek that is interesting just one word difference but correct answers not the same no yes that was easier for you like why the second question is so much easier yes it's source source is indeed the connector to pull messages from other systems so what about leaderboard and featurally makes a mistake i can't believe okay that is like really interesting one ruby was the fastest getting back to the fifth place but will it be enough to compete again for top three i don't know i don't know so uh that's uh going on here fire dancer on the first one bobby made no mistake as fire dancer and stays in uh approximately 100 or ever in like 200 points difference quite solid difference already probable kotaka made no mistake and hips the third one our tom hounds him just shoulder to shoulder step to step that's going to be the last question ladies and gentlemen so that's question number seven last question release warm up your fingers release your mind and get ready we are going into the last competition answer fast to get more points when a messages deleted from pulsar when they are acknowledged by the consumer then ttl is configured and the time has lapsed when you send the delete message command from the consumer immediately deleted when requested time is up and most of you made no mistake boss both two answers were correct and or rather they are acknowledged by the consumer on that detail is configured and ttl is elapsed then they will be deleted from pulsar and last to answer options the wrong so looks like most of you made the right answer but who did it fast enough who was fast enough and who made no mistake saverio was the fastest one getting into top 10 but that was not enough to make it to top three so i congratulate fire dancer with a first place fifty 6058 points that's a good result bobby on the second with a very low difference over seven twelve questions with five thousand nine hundred and ninety questions um points archon congrats with the third place and then uh if you are in this in the least fire dancer bobby arton please make a screenshot of your winning screen i know you have been in screen right now and send screenshot to check.friar at your datastax.com well done and yeah praful koteka has six points difference to a third place like take a look at that that was so close really like six points difference and you have some luck that's indeed very good result if you didn't make it to a top three don't worry it's still uh quite a cool thing to be on our leaderboard because many people competed and you did well and if you are not in the leaderboard don't worry and don't take it too personal what really matters is that knowledge and skills because your knowledge and your skills bring you better salary better job position more interesting tasks to do and that's just cool in the end so congrats and a couple of laws a couple of last slides uh first one please give us feedback i won't stay for this slide for a long time but what did you like the most in the workshop what would you improve which topics we have to ex take care more in the last episode which comes next monday or maybe you want us to run next monday learning on some particular topic because this series will be over thank you so much i will keep this window open and you can write your answers even after the workshop that brings us to the last slides so next week last episode and that already feels a little bit uh sad and disappointing because it was so fun working with you and next monday will be the last episode maybe we will have to organize something like bonus episode what do you think bonus episode is always a good idea to do it yeah because like i don't want to stop this show uh speaking about messaging queues notifications pulsar it's all cool so uh what to do and how to get to the third episode go and subscribe now datastax.io dot io slash ess-ep3 link is on the screen and that's going to be very interesting can you give us a little teaser what are we going to do next week yeah so we're going to be doing some think and source stuff you know writing into cassandra writing into elasticsearch maybe a pulser function we'll see but it's going to be a lot of you know how to use pulsar in an enterprise environment and we'll cover um you know tenant multi-tenants and geo-replication a little more in depth as well yep and one of our attendees just found the mistake on this slide yes it's not going to be 14th but 14th plus seven so one week later 21. 21. yeah 21 definitely so but same time same speakers when this week if you are hungry for more knowledge and skills if you enjoy our workshops then subscribe now for the introduction to nosql database lead by cedric devin ryan and me it's going to be on wednesday and thursday notice what this link will offer you to choose between wednesday show and thursday there is no content difference same content but different speakers and different time zone so just pick one which works better for you i see jai gurav asks can we get the recording yes same link for all the workshops we do they stay available for you after the live workshop using the same link then one of the most powerful nosql databases is definitely apache cassandra i was running cassandra days for multiple countries and now we are coming to india if this year event will be online that's kinda great because everyone can attend that even if they not live in mumbai for example about in canada but still it's focused on india business and indian speakers because well there are a lot of great people with extreme skills on the nosql databases so july the 10th mark the day cassandra de india this conference is the free and you can so it's open you can register and you don't have to um and the main thing for us you don't have to be an expert in cassandra to participate because we offer you two tracks one track is uh for no sql beginners and there will be workshops like the one today about what is it and how it works and second one is for talks and that's for more advanced audience talks already confirm it as speaker from netflix uh principal database cloud uh cloud database architect from netflix vinay kumar chellam and we now are discussing like what exactly he will be talking about and we will have more great uh speakers from uh different industries talking about how they use cassandra whatever main features and so on and so forth people are asking for the link and link is to be published uh in a couple of hours actually so you will get link on the next episode or on wednesday on the workshop but what matters call for papers is open so if you are a good expert in apache cassandra or related technologies and you have something to talk about then please i ask you in person go to dtsx.ioslash cd india cfp and submit your proposal and we will take care of it and we will get back to you very soon that was it for today uh there is one more question i want to answer when us vox dispatched to a leaderboard toppers as i mentioned last week we got some problems with our logistics company we are changing and that takes some time so you may get a little delay on getting your spec but you will get it i keep it under control and we will get the points so do you have anything to add uh zig do you have anything to add i can't think of anything new to add um if you haven't had a chance to watch the first uh part of this training workshop please watch it on youtube it is available there so i really cover like the architecture of pulsar you know the background and history of application messaging which was led by alex and uh next week we'll cover like um you know using pulsar in the enterprise and enterprise messaging patterns yes okay so i believe we are done for today i will play a little bit of music for you to enjoy to celebrate your win maybe and we will see how it goes and we will meet again maybe this wednesday for nosql databases and definitely next week on monday at data stacks monday learning event streaming series with zeke and alex thank you so much for coming and have a great week that's why we do it on monday to help you get better week i found someone new now i have more room no more formats to [Music] change [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign",
