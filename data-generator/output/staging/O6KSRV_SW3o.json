    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hi everyone and welcome to a new episode of the distributed leadership I'm Mary DT and today I'm with Jeff a cantata and originally and today we will speak about a killer video I'm new so maybe Jeff can you introduce a little bit of video application oh yeah I could talk for a while about killer videos so that killer video is a reference application that is maintained by the Evangelist team you're going to be working on it very very soon sure and so the it's a reference application that we use to teach people how to use Apache Cassandra paaji spark data sacs Enterprise everything that's part of our product suite the reason why we talk about it and why we're talking about it today is it's it's really you know we're developers and we want to learn and kick the tires on our own products and learn how to use them in order to help people get good I mean that's a big part of what we do as evangelist is helping people to get skilled at using our products and get excited about them well we kind of have to be excited about them and we kind of have to know how to use it ourselves so we're actually spent a decent amount of our time coding and adding features to this killer video application and as new things become available in data sacks Enterprise we extend the capabilities of killer videos so huge shout-out to evangelists of days gone by loop Tilghman others that put together this great application that we're continuing to build on okay I'm quite wait reinsure true to be part of the team now I know that we will code I will be there for sure so we had him at hello I'm Cody maybe can you tell us what you did lately on killer video on killer video yeah oh let's see so recently added the DC search capability to the java language very killer video I'll have to admit we already had it there Thank You Luke between both the C sharp and nodejs versions we finally brought parody to the to the Java version so that was that was really the major thing at least one of the major things recently was to really switch it over from uu we already have some kind of search before so what changed he knows our app yeah apparently he's looked at G download would you like look at it and he's already finding all the all the bugs yeah he's already hit me up with like a list like all these things I've done wrong and then I'm like oh that's no js' that's the question honestly so you're right search was already there that's a really good point so previously you you could perform searches whether it was the type of head bar or if you clicked on the tag buttons or if you had the more videos like this section on in the video details page those were all searches underneath the hood now they were using Cassandra only tables though that was the big difference so they had specialized tables that were meant specifically to handle various search operations and so what we did or I guess I should say what I did actually that was yeah was to then move that to actually using DC search so moving away from using Cassandra only tables and actually using DC search that that particular workload so was the big change there okay right yeah yeah and wait you know okay so so don't undersell that I mean there was a lot of there's a lot of simplification yeah you actually deleted code from the app yes that's amazing Serge yeah I was just gonna tell you like yeah we moved search thanks no no right so so as far as like simplification and such like one of the really nice things that came out of that is it did allow us to pretty significantly consolidate the the code base around search about about 40 percent of consolidation so if you look at the before and after shots between the lines of code that were lines ago that removed right it was it was very clear that it was it was a definite consolidation there there was also the capability I mean one of the big cool benefits we got from it was that DC search itself greatly enhanced the search capability they the example I like to use is if you were to have in the cassandra only set up it was all based off of tags right so when somebody uploads a video in the killer video you have to upload a tag it's a requirement as per the UI however comma we in the generator services not to go too far into this but is particular video in the stack there's a generator service that makes it look like the applications alive right so it adds videos and users and readings and comments all sorts of things now we purposely loosened the restriction on the generator service to allow it when it was pulling YouTube videos from the back end to add videos that did not have tags and the reason why is just because for some of the areas that we were looking at some of the topics we were grabbing videos from it actually you know because YouTube doesn't have that requirement we do in our app so there were a lot of videos out there that just don't have text videos with no tags right so so what would that meant in the original way since all of our searches were based off of tags only if you pulled up a video that had no tags mm-hmm right you wouldn't get anything the more videos like this section you wouldn't see it in a tag search or anything like that so one of the really cool things that DC search allowed us to do is greatly expand not only the variation in the results we got from searches but then instead of just looking at tags we can go look at cross tags name description whatever we wanted in the videos table so now if I go to a video that has no tags but it's got other relevant information in its name or its description then you'll see all sorts of relevant videos to come up in the more videos like this section and it actually expands in the tag search so if I actually was in another video that had a tag let's say that I had a tag of data stacks in my video and another search or another video did not have the tag of data stacks but in the name it had data stacks well when I click on that tag button that video will now show up so it essentially just it really enhanced I know I keep saying it but it really enhanced the the search capability and now we can even be missing McKey Parsa data and it will still find results it's really kind of cool nice seems three pretty good features but he's one more thing on that though did you I want to dig into a little more cuz I wanna you did some great work there so did G isn't it faster like oh yeah it was a two-stage look up before yeah yeah yeah there was there was one particular case um this is actually a part of some of that code consolidation right so there was one there was one particular case where in the Cassandra only table approach where we would have to do one search and then do a subsequent a set of subsequent asynchronous queries after that to put all that together right and you just ended up having a lot of like nested looping and the kind of the element made the code a little bit more confusing and complex and such and now in every one of the cases of the cql queries that we execute it's one great one query one query returns all the data yeah yeah and again it's even more comprehensive data so yeah it was a lot of benefit from that standpoint okay nice and if I already have to dig into what to do I just have got to do a diff between previous code Anna now I think you have documented quite a lot on this stuff right I am now someone can call me out on this right if I oversell this but I am a prolific commenter I'm I do that really for myself though because otherwise I forget what I'm doing with the I know bones to future David yeah yeah no it's true but no no there's one of the intents one of my intents as as as a Technical Evangelist right is Jeff mentioned earlier is our job is to try to help other people learn how to use this stuff soldier when I was implementing DC search and for the some of the other features we've done and the kind of deal I really try to put like code blocks that have reference to the documentation explain what's going on how do you use this so hopefully somebody stepping true it will be able to get a lot of reference material they can use to find out like okay if I want deeper information on on some of the details like where can I go okay didn't you write a blog about this yeah I think so hello buddy this is great you guys you guys just keep them like who okay there's that - there is that yeah yeah I mean I'm all about like not plugging your own stuff too much but that's ridiculous okay okay yeah no no no I wrote a whole blog series detailing detailing yeah no I hope I wrote a whole blog series detailing um like all what the searches look like in the Cassander only approach looking at like what they look like underneath the hood how they were implemented and then took that into you know what considerations you know we took into approach or took into account not approach when we move to Dec search what benefits we got from that looked at comparisons between the two different types of searches and then there's one tail-end thing that comes on with that is the advanced search capabilities you get for free right which allow you to do things like wild carding phrase matching and that kind of deal that you just get as part of a Z search so so all of that there's in the whole blog post the series and it goes through like pretty much just trying to give you the start all the way to the end of what that with that whole process they will put that in the show notes yeah yes nice so Jeff what about you did you run yeah I was busy too okay Wow thrown a little shadow I mean throwing a little shade inside joke perhaps so yeah yes I've been pretty busy as well what I've been doing is mostly focused on the docker integration of killer videos so when when you go to killer video calm you can download the source code and then run it on your desktop in docker containers so everything that you need to run the application will be there so for example of course like a node of do to sax Enterprise a DSC server to store your data at CD is a service registry and then you'll run like either the Java or the node J S or the c-sharp implementation of the service layer okay and there's a web app and yes everything is download just stop everything and we walk right yes as you discovered right when you yeah of course so yeah there's a you know there's a couple of rough edges that that we know that we need to work out there the startup sequencing so we're continually making improvements to the to the UX on this whole thing so I in particular there was a previous integration in into docker containers using docker compose to get everything up and running and that was based on sort of a I don't know not officially approved docker image and we've actually had some previous episodes where I talked with you know Kat Ericsson about the official data stacks docker images that are available now so I was integrating those into our dr configuration and there's actually a number of pretty cool features that are supported by the official data stacks docker containers so one of the things that i did was you can use an external volume like on the host machine so a volume that's external to the container that's on your host machine you can mount into the running container so what this is really useful for is preserving your data files your SS table files of course across multiple runs because you were asking me about this like what happens when I do this run the bootstrap and of course so I didn't make that the default configuration but I provided a docker compose file that you can swap in and use if you would like to preserve the volumes one of the other configurations that I did again not the default but an alternate configuration is enabling authentication and authorization okay so it's in order to do this you actually swap in a different yeah mole configuration file to enable okie authentication to be on and yes II would switch to mighty clean right yes and it's not you were asking me before about what is the authentication and authorization mechanism DSC allows you to plug in two different things like if you have a Kerberos or Active Directory configuration you can hook into those we're just using the out-of-the-box built-in Authenticator that comes with DSC so the scripting that I did for the athough enabled configuration actually when it boots up when when DSC starts up have a container that goes in and configures it it rim it logs in as the administrative user and then creates another administrative user that's not the default one with a new username and password and then it goes and deletes to the original one so it's all like kind of the security best practices that you would want if you were actually doing a real deployment and then then you also give it the name and password that you want it to use for basically got like an application-level user and then the rest of killer video is configured again this is these are values that are passed their environment variables for the username password credentials so that all of the applications that are talking to data stacks enterprise and that core cassandra server underneath they're all everyone that's talking to DSE basically is using those credentials yes I think that in the application that properties files you put some credence shelves at runtime and when the killer videos start up you just pass this parameter and log into the cluster using your password and one of the next additions that that Jeff added as well as now this gives good code examples right in the code of you know one way you could potentially handle some of the authentication in such a Minion's in that part of that's part of what you added in there that's right yeah so it was all we had already integrated the application level credential passing right but it wasn't part of the default configuration you kind of had to add it in later like via setting environment variables to provide the credentials now it's just a little bit more automated and there's a good kind of example way to execute that so one of the final things that I did there too is we actually had we have different environments that we deployed killer video into so you can run it on your desktop and docker but we also have a deployment at killer video comm so because I don't know because I felt like it was necessary I combined those configurations into a single configuration basically a container a docker container that you run and it can configure an existing DSC that's running somewhere external to your docker or it can run an instance it can configure an instance of DSA is running in docker so this is now available to you to integrate because you've been working on the deployment of killer video in in AWS right so anyway this is kind of like okay yeah I do a script yeah use it yeah no there's a lot of feel like so so just to talk a little bit more about the multiple I mean we had two different repos right then you would use git repos github repos that one was for the docker based configuration and setup and the other one was for this external piece right and this is before Jeff consolidated everything now at first when we did that there there were reasons for creating a separate repos and part of that was to create to keep the developer like docker ecosystem untouched so it would not add added complexity or anything like that to to that setup because we want to make it as easy as possible for people to get in and download this thing get it running in touch but then at the time you know once Jeff started getting into it we found that there was actually a good amount of overlap between what I was doing in the external repo that we had and then what Jeff was doing now so it made sense to just consolidate those and put them together there was 90 percent over yeah yeah well why do we have two scripts that essentially do the same exactly two different docker containers yeah so now I get to take that I get to take that and use it up in the cloud because you know we've got our as Jeff mentioned we have our cloud implementation if you go to the www killer video comm site to yeah you like that ya know there's that there's a cloud implementation and that that obviously has authentication and security and stuff like that I had but it was funny enough the way I did it was probably have heavier handed than what Jeff did a much more finessed kind of implementation that is a lot nicer than what I have in place and so that's all about choosing etcd clients and stuff like that Xterra is everything yes pretty nice yeah I like it and we know the ceedric has high standards so that's good that's high praise well it's the one that yeah the one last thing that I did when I was this is actually the intersection of the work that you and I have been doing I just remembered this so the last thing that I added to the configuration was a new to leverage a new feature that was added in DSC 5.1 to be able to create search indexes like pretty much previously the in order to search index you had to use DSC tool now we've actually added on search index creation commands into CQL in the cql shell i'm taking you can do those so that was the very last thing that I did is changing over the search index creation from the old-school method to the new and that parallel very nicely with the search work that you were doing is sort of kind of all came together there pretty nicely intersection of search and docker work at the same time yeah okay nice nice you say that that pretty eyes turned out true you know I think the docker and docker compose stuff is very nice but it's now to play LIGO on your laptop now if we really want to go to the cloud maybe we have to switch to kubernetes at the point in time and integrate things and I think a good way so what coming next in killer video probably that well you know as far as any the the serves and pieces of the container pieces like if we're talking kubernetes or something like that I will defer that to the Jeff however as far as like this is not the roadmap meeting okay you know honestly I mean I there are some definite avenues I mean places that we've looked at as far as that ends up going like servers manage and and you know that kind of deal but we have some fun things on the road we have some fun things on the roadmap as far as that goes which which would be really neat I'm actually excited to take the version that Jeff has now reworked the consolidated version and get that up on the cloud and that way wouldn't kind of cut you know finish that piece but as far as like what's what's coming next so we've got well there's spark SQL that work we've already been doing right right and matter of fact that all ties in on ok I get stoked about so yeah what is that hold on like oh yeah just Rob yeah so we've got really the analytics portion is what we're missing right now so if you look at all the stuff that's going on killer video it's all transactional kind of stuff right between graph search and Cassandra and so we we've always been wanting to I like to call it the four horsemen the four horsemen of data stacks Enterprise right which is Cassandra graph analytics and search so we just need to bring in the last horseman right I don't know which one it is if it's the one with the big sword or the big I don't know we'll figure that part out but we've we've been looking to round out killer video and bring in the analytics picture right so spark SQL is one part of that and that I'm really excited about it because that will allow us in an SQL syntax right so for all the the relational folks out there who are used to you know working with SQL and stuff it'll allow us in that syntax and and this is what I get so excited about it so like before if I wanted to say query well you couldn't really query across if I wanted to combine analytics data across multiple nodes and stuff like that there were there are ways to go about it but spark SQL allows me to just write a regular SQL query with the same types of say joins where clause and stuff that I've been familiar with for the last 20-something years and it will go off and handle all of the communication that's needed to bring that stuff across all my notes and everything it's it's awesome then you've got the the gremlin OLAP piece of that right the analytics piece separate from spark SQL we're essentially bringing in the analytics workload it's those two things they come together but where it gets really awesome is that between spark SQL and some of the newer capability is coming with DSC 6 and they look ahead right some of the newer SQL capabilities and stuff coming it is now more and more just getting more and more unified where I can use the same drivers the same query language and everything like that's you everything that I want to do ok and I'm getting like so anyway the analytics part though that that's like a big part both on the rumblin and on the cassandra in search end ok so I've already started hearing some rumblings from this end of the table see Turk has a lot of ideas I can tell so like what yes I saw quite a lot of energy here new features coming pretty exciting right but you know killer videos needs to be really good design applications yeah and I think to jump in the best I will have a review and maybe I will add some unit testing automatically build stuff like that to a very pretty nice and then I think features as you write well this is like this is a reference app but it's really no different than maybe most applications jobs like well are we gonna focus on performance are we gonna pay down some technical debt are we gonna add new features I mean it's all the same oh we do have integration test but really needs some love yeah c-sharp come on guys I mean we're supposed to be keeping all of the language variants up-to-date right and keep them with Beecher Perry he was waiting for you to start the Python implementation Wow okay take us home thank you very much James we we have some pretty good and pretty exciting features to come and you have made quite a good work this weeks as well with the search and the docker stuffs so we'll see you next time to to speak about new features of Kedah video or any subject on the distributed edition thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we
