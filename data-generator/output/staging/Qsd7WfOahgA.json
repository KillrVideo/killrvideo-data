    "text": "so a little bit about me I am currently a engineering lead for developing one of the analytic products that we have at Deloitte that I'll go into a little bit more but as far as my background I grew up not far from here in Bethesda Maryland and then went to school also not too far at UVA I studied systems engineering and joined Deloitte I've been at Deloitte for nine years now and in that time I've worn a lot of different hats I've done everything from the traditional consulting through to the more technical side of things so I've done ops I've done data science I've done software engineering I'm a committer on tensorflow so my passion is really more around building analytic solutions for clients and so I identify more with the developer side okay awesome oh yeah so you're you're an engineer you're a developer not an accountant exactly I thought but I thought Deloitte was like all accounting in yeah it not so that's what every time you say oh I worked for Deloitte because everyone in this town asked the first question is where do you work course and every town and they're like oh so your accountant it's like no I'm not an accountant I'm actually part of the technology consulting practice and then specifically within that do analytic product development ok cool so there's a whole group that you're a part of and I want to I want to hear from you a little bit about I'm gonna give you the clicker because these are your slides okay let's pretend that that didn't just happen so all right so what kind of problems are you solving for your customers yeah what the use case that I want to highlight at a generic level is more around identifying high-risk actors or entities in a network so what what does that mean what is that a guy yeah bad guys so that can be a lot of different things some examples if you're in the financial services and just identifying fraud rings national security identifying terrorists supply chain is important for companies talked about before they need to identify potentially risky suppliers in their supply chain oh right okay gotcha okay so that's your problem space right yeah and so as far as in order to do that there are a lot of challenges that the either the business of the mission analysts have with identifying these high-risk bad actors okay and so I like to like what challenges I like to categorize them under two big buckets one is more the the data side so a lot of the challenges with the data and then the operational side and so I'm going to talk a little bit about the data side since you got data problems yeah we got data problems who does it from a data perspective weed analysts that are trying to identify these bad actors have the typical challenges that a lot of companies have around dealing with the scale of data dealing with the high velocity of data but add additional challenge from a data perspective is how do you connect a lot of different data sets together into one to create one network that they can analyze so not only do you have to connect a lot of different data sources but you also have to connect a lot of different data types right so if you're doing the financial services fraud detection you're probably looking among other things that people organizations transactions to name a few right so how do you how do you connect all that a join yeah exactly how and so that and that's part of it but then get even more challenging you talk about connecting things around that might not be strongly keyed so for example let's say I'm looking at airline data in Delta all my tickets show up as max Melnick but in American they might show up as max Jay Melnick and the analyst doesn't want to see two different people when they're doing the analysis they want to see the same person it's you it's all you exactly and so how do you say that max Melnick and max Jay Melnick are the same for the analyst so that they can analyze it in one cohesive picture so that's a little bit on the the data side okay the challenges then there's obviously the operational challenges right now a lot of analysts have to go back and forth with IT which takes a lot of time to actually get an answer IT struggles with how do I write the queries so that I can answer these questions in an efficient manner so I can because they're trying to get the answers back to the analyst as quick as possible and then also how do you do all this at scale and fast right so how do we identify bad actors more quickly and easily is the big problem okay so you're talking about being able to kind of turn around that knowledge that's coming from analysts and build it back into the system so then the next round can be automated and right exactly loading that loop that feedback loop yeah okay cool so how have you solve this problem what do you got so the those problems inspired us to create a product called mission graph and I'll go into a lot of detail on what it is but at a high level the way I like to explain it is it's a self-service platform that helps business and mission analysts really do the analysis where it requires you to create a comprehensive network that combines lots of different types of data at massive scale okay and if you can't explain it in this sentence then good yeah it's not worth explaining if you can't explain it in a sentence so that's good and I'm a pictures guy I think a lot of people are more visual so what what does that look like right I talked about the self-service aspect of it so I'll take the persona of the analyst first I'm gonna go through a few of the personas for the overall solution but that might be relevant to you all as well but from an analyst perspective again we wanted to create a self-service platform an interface so that don't have to go to IT all the time and wait for an answer I also don't want to have to connect all this data myself manually right whether it be in Visio or something there's a robot and so specifically what we have here just to set up the example little bit what are we looking at here is imagining at the indirect air carriers or cargo carriers and I want to identify where there might be high-risk cargo carriers okay and so I don't expect that you all can see this I'll talk through it but what we've done is create one comprehensive picture of the air carriers and identify certain risks from from them and allow the analyst to actually start with hey here there's some high-risk carriers and explore okay well why might they be high-risk so a lot of times in these use cases one of the entry points is they get some information about a particular entity right in this case it's let's say jet wire is a air carrier that they saw in some report is high risk it's like okay well tell me is it really high risk and let me look into it a little bit so there's a tip that indicates that you might want to look at someone in particular so now you're going in and looking at that particular supplier exact provider and then what so again starting it's kind of a search right you want to find within this huge Network show me the entity that is potentially high-risk that I saw in some report and I want to explore and so a lot of the question they're asking is is this entity in this case attic cargo carrier jet wire high risk and one of the big questions in order to determine that is well are they related to any high risk entities and so what we've done here is a very simple example where we have some information about the air carrier some of the people associated with it but we've also connected data from the Panama papers and so over here on the the right hand side you start to see some of the nodes in red that indicate potentially high risk so what we've done is allow the analyst to start with hey this carrier might be high risk and then dig into the details to understand exactly okay why is it high risk where might I need to actually investigate further okay good and that's like very visual that pops out at me that like oh there are red notes that are not one hop away but definitely two hops away in terms of this tree of relationship so they can begin and there's that might be a little bit concerning that there's those three there and is that indication of a pattern etc right okay cool and then I told you I'd go into more detail look behind the cover so I started with more of the analyst view and the UI that you saw screenshot of is built mostly using some tools called key lines which I like to call kind of d3 on steroids for network analysis and then react so that's the analyst view okay now let's talk about kind of the ops for you so one of the problems I said earlier is how do you operate all of this at scale and fast so not only do we have to a platform or we need to support the platform and be able to scale so we can run in AWS GCP on Prem but also how do we get enhancements to end-users quickly right and so that part of the the orchestration piece jenkins is one example of what we one tool that we use among others ok cool so you got you joined the container revolution you've got a build pipeline going on exactly right ok cool now let's talk about more of the data scientist data analyst side and that's where from analysis tools and some of the entity resolution come in and so what we're able to do like I showed you is provide an application to the end users but a lot of times they have questions that are tangentially related to the data that we have access to but they might not be able to answer it directly with the application and so what we can do is we have data scientists and analysts that can use certain interactive notebooks whether it be a DSC studio Jupiter notebook Zeppelin connect to the cluster and run certain ad hoc analytics some of the things the more interesting side of things are ok tell me where I should be looking for potentially high-risk things so it's kind of like Spotify discover weekly for bad actors in the network right and then can I get a playlist of me yeah so it's it's kind of this recommendation workflow where the data scientist is saying ok you're potentially high-risk communities or high-risk actors and the nice thing is then we can take the UI and actually build out and explore it and say ok is this actually a high-risk network ok what I really like about what you're saying too is that there's a kind of like the the more well refined processed version of the visualization that's built into mission graph but then alongside that you can combo with these tools and do more ad hoc analysis exact discover more things discover more rules that can get built back into the system kind of like that those two levels of interaction it's great yeah and that's one feedback mechanism the other from entity resolution perspective they're able to we use one tool called tamer we also use some other just data scientists are able to go in and create certain machine learning models that can then be deployed back in to and the resolution is what I guess I didn't really go into that so that was when I was talking about the connecting on different entities when you don't really have strong keys so the max Melnik vers max j Melnik how do you connect that resolving one interest that's the entity resolution piece exactly okay so that's the data scientists angle of this and then from the core of it data stacks enterprise so I know we were talking yesterday and you're like well okay tell me why data stacks and I think part of their the biggest thing is the scalability and the availability that we're able to provide but also kind of the flexibility around things that you talked about earlier around tunable consistency so depending on the use case sometimes it's more important to be consistent and others it might be okay to sacrifice some performance right and then flexibility and deployment models like I talked about before right so we can deploy in any of the cloud providers but we can also deploy on Prem any combination thereof okay and so specifically we actually do use all the different workloads of data stacks so I talked about when I showed the UI before house a lot of times people start with analysts start with some information about an entity or a lot of entities so that's kind of the search problem all right right so Solar allows us to do search at scale spark allows us to do both the data integration at scale so how do we get the source data in to what I'll talk about next which is the graph yeah but also the analytics right so going back to what I was talking about with the data scientist doing the bad actor Spotify discover weekly equivalent so that's why we use solar that's why we use spark cassandra runs underneath of all of that and we mainly interact with Cassandra we do some straight to Cassandra but we also do a lot of using the graph um and so why why graph and why DSC graph I the first piece of that is again we need to be able to support massive scale data sets and connect data across a lot of different types of data yeah and answer a lot of those relationship based questions and so to kind of underscore that this always resonated with me when I saw it is so this kind of goes back to the idea and forth with ID right a lot of times analysts were asking these questions of IT and IT had to write these really long convoluted sequel statements and had a ton of joins yes probably had to change it every time that they had to answer a question depending on how like the relationship like again tell me everyone or everything connected to this person well that could go on infinitely and so there why we need to know what a query plan is so that becomes a lot easier when you have these network based questions if you can write it in graph and interact with the data in graph yeah that's that's pretty powerful because this is a real-world example of how much easier it is on the left there to write a graph statement if what you're really doing is navigating through a network I mean that's why this is so complicated on the right right because yeah I have to go from table the table or from entity to entity to get to the next thing which is so much easier and more intuitive to write from a graph perspective yep well I know you're gonna talk through some lessons learned oh that's yeah yeah give me that give me the nutshell like I know we're almost out of time here from our morning session but what would you suggest to somebody who is adopting this technology what are your key lessons learned that you want to share with them first one is know the DSC and Cassandra anti-patterns and best practices it's my little anecdote around that is at one point we had to deploy to an on-prem data center and all that was provisioned for us was Network back storage SAN and that was kind of a nightmare we saw a lot of challenges with throughput the variability in the throughput specifically which caused a lot of jobs to fail and when we were trying to load lots of data you just said one of my trigger words saying yeah trust me we know the pain so just that's kind of a friendly reminder to data stacks online has a few one or a few pages on all the anti-patterns and best practices so definitely especially before going to production recommend looking at those even if you are in production you probably want to look back at them and see if we get a lot of balls after people the first time we hear from somebody is after they're in production and having a problem and we can help but it's a lot better if you come to us earlier yeah and there are also tools I know there's a DSC for the ops guys there's a DSC pre-flight check that you can run that will identify certain issues op Center probably has other stuff that you can that will identify operational issues so ya know the anti-patterns and best practices and okay gotcha give me one more one more let's see so I think as far as onboarding new team members there can be somewhat of a not a learning curve generally what I recommend start simple relative to the person's skill level so for example with junior engineers you might want to start more with not necessarily going into a complex application code that has a lot of moving parts but start first with some of the basic tutorials that are on data stacks academy and other sites like the killer video I know is a kind of application that run a little gloss I have a slide on that there you got Tetum up you you knew it would okay cool and then the last thing I know we're almost out of time here just wanted to say where we're hiring there are a lot of growing opportunities at the weight to do cool product development for applications like missions and platforms like mission graph so if you're interested come talk to me after my emails down there but you probably can't read it ml Nick at Deloitte calm so with that awesome they hand it over to you Jeff thank you thanks for coming out this is a hey thank you yes yes [Applause]",
