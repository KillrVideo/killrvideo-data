  "description": "Today's agenda is to demonstrate how to hook up Stargate with DataStax Enterprise™ (DSE) using:\n- Docker\n- Stand-alone\n\nStep by step description can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/msmygit/dse-titbits/blob/master/scripts/stargate-dse687/Working_with_Stargate_and_DSE.md\n\nReminder on Stargate:\nStargate is an open source data gateway that sits between your app and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project. Stargate abstracts Cassandra-specific concepts entirely from app developers and supports different API options, removing barriers of entry for new software developers. Watch this introduction video about Stargate to get excited about!",

    "text": "hello everyone and welcome to this session my name is madhavan sridharan and i am a senior solutions architect with datastax today we are going to talk about how to hook up stargate with the datastax enterprise backend as we all know datastax recently made the general availability of stargate on december 9th which is natively available in datastax astra in today's quick session we are going to see how to leverage stargate with a datastax enterprise 6.8 version so for that what do we need there are a couple ways to get this done one is using a docker approach or another one is to use a regular tarball install approach in today's video we are going to see how to get this done so for that we need a couple things one is to get the stargate dsc 68 image from the docker hub and then another one is we also need a dac server the latest version on the dsc server is 6.8.7 as you can see as of today and then with stargate we have version 1.0.0 so with that let's get started i'm going to also provide a github repository link which has all the instructions that we need to get this done and we will see all these things in here there is also a quick introduction video of what a stargate is as we all know stargates gives us with a rich api set it has json rest graphql and cql api let's go right in all we need is this docker compose yaml file and then this little utility script to start our dsc so let's see what do we have within that compost ammo first off i have taken the dse server version 6.8.7 which is the latest one and i'm calling the container name bracket one and i'm actually having two other backends backend two and backend three with the same dac687 version and what i also have here is the stargate version that we saw there just a couple moments ago with the stargate dsc version 1.0.0 before getting started we will need to have docker installed on our machine and then docker is up and running all we need to do here is to get the script started which is going to start up a single backend for me here with dse 687 and then also startup stargate and then get them hooked up so let's see what do we have in the script as i said it's starting up uh dse687 i'm only going to start uh one back-end here in my local machine but the docker compose yaml example file has like three backends if you want to leverage that after this one is started up fine okay we are going to go startup stargate and i am sleeping here to provide enough time for start gate to startup and then we are also checking to make make sure if it's fully up and running and then i'm also creating a temporary auth token in here which we will need anyway to interact with stargate in executing all the apis so let's get started here is my dsc687 end which is already started and then the next step it is also starting my stargate container and then it is sleeping for about 60 seconds to see everything is up and running if you notice your docker dashboard you would now see the backend one that we just started and you will also see the now we can see both of them are running it's just waiting to get started fully and they should be running in no time what we can also do while this is happening is we can actually inspect the logs for both our dse backend as well as our stargate are using this helpful commands okay looks like our stargate is up and running and we do have an art token that is ready for us so as i said uh we can inspect the cql shell in here i'm getting into my cql shell which is the familiar dse secure shell out of my key spaces you're good to go there you go i have my 687 running up and running let's see what we can do this is the auth token that we'll be needing to execute all the other api related uh things let's target here i have my uh postman it could be your application it could be your front-end application trying to execute commands or whatnot stargate gives us the ability uh to have all these api features set rest document graphql sql i'm not going to go in detail for this session but just to give a teaser of what is possible with that here i have an environment variable where i'm setting a couple variables and parameterizing it and i'm going to substitute the auth token in here hopefully i copied that in full or what i can do in here is also execute the auth related rest api which is going to get me another auth and then store it in my variable so this is ending with a002 and this is matching here if i want to go invoke a document api using the pushman so here is my uris and i'm using a post requestion here and in in the header i'm actually using the cassandra token which is getting the value from this variable that we just saw in our environment section then i'm also passing in a content type of application json and here is the name of the namespace that i want to create so let's go execute it there we go it just executed and then created me a namespace called devices let's check if we do have this so we already have the discrete key spaces and there you go i now see the devices namespace which in secure term is a key space in here it automatically created that for me and then there are also other apis with that you can do in here namely to check if the created namespace is available i'm not passing it anything in here in the body and i'm doing a get request yes we do have the namespace available so it came back with that one and if i want to go ahead and then play with that by entering a document structure as you can see this is the dot sample document structure that i have i'm doing a post requestion here using the same devices namespace into a collection called inventory so let's see what happens i'm doing a post request what it is doing for me the very first time is it is actually going in the background creating me that inventory collection into the device's namespace and then it also inserted my json and then it came back to me with a unique id which is a document id which will need to retrieve or fetch the document from the database if you need to so if we go back in here again do a describe in here or better let's use this devices let's describe tables and there you go i now have my inventory table created all with the the document api so now if i want to retrieve that document back i'm going to use that document id if i want to fetch that particular document that i just inserted into the dse 687 back-end you don't have to memorize this one but this is just for an example if you want to retrieve a particular document from the collection within the device namespace i would need this document id if i want to fetch the uh all the documents that are available in my collection i can simply go ahead and then use like this get request and what i also can do in here is i can selectively pull add some query parameters where i can pass in some conditions in here i'm just passing in like certification type which is equaling full certification we only have one record inserted into our table so it's going to fetch me with that matching my criteria where the certification type is of full certification if i don't use anything at all in my query parameters and just retrieve everything in my thing inventory collection it's going to get back to me but i can have other queries and things like that it's like go ahead and then get me all the documents matching the condition that i've given here you can do where predicates what we can also do is like i don't want to retrieve all my fields but only [Music] pull a selective set of information you can pass in this field query parameters by giving the field name so in this case i only want the connectivity information and i don't want the other items i can do so as well so as you can see i fetch the record from my namespace uh devices and then collections the inventory collection and then it's going to get me only the connectivity information as i have queried for so we only have one recording to that so let's try to do a couple more cuts here is another json which is having a different id and couple different values i got a different id i'm not going to copy that i'm going to try and insert another json document in here with a different id and couple different values there we go if we want to pull all the my documents from that particular table i can go ahead and as i said you can use the same get request and it's going to get me everything in here so i can also do a pagination in here if i restricted to use just page one page size of one meaning only pull a single information for me it's going to get back to me with the page state it knows that my collection has more than one document stored in it and then it is actually going to give get back to me with the page state so if i want to do pagination type activities i can use the page state and then use the page state that we got back from our earlier request let me make sure if i do the proper ur encoding and this time if i fetch as you can see it fetched me at the my next document with a different id and it also gave me another page state because we now have like three documents stored into this stored into the in our collections inventory and then it gave me another uh page date what i can do is i can use this page state information in my query for the next time and then fetch my other things we can do all sort of thing i'm not going to go detail into that i'm just going to show you like all these things like you can have where classes and then you can pull in specific things so for in here i'm trying to pull all my documents which has certification type value of full certification this is equals and then i'm also adding an approximate cost in here which is greater than one so it is satisfied two documents in my table and then it fetched so these are a couple apis that you can do as i said i'm not going to cover in detail just to give you a teaser of what we can do with the stargate and dse back in that's all you are up and running with docker now that we have seen how to get up and running with stargate and datastax enterprise 6.8 backend we'll now go ahead and then stop our containers as you all know these are resource intensive there is yet another approach that one could follow to get and running with target and a dac68 backend we can do a tarball approach for that what we need to do is since we have only one ip address in our local machine if we want to start up another loopback address of datastax stargate developers have given instructions on how to do so all we need to do so is to configure an additional loopback for running our startgate instance with it that's all for today's session i hope you all enjoyed it see you all next time with another video until then please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or for any of your other needs thank you",
