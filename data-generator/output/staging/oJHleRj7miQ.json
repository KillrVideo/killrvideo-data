  "description": "Amanda and Jeff talk about their latest project: implementing the microservice layer of KillrVideo in Python. They talk about what was easy, what was not too easy, and what was just plain fun. They spend some time on discussing recommendations engines and ask the audience should they implement this in DSE graph  or using PySpark or other python package? Comment below! \n\nHighlights\n0:24: Jeff and Amanda talk about how and why they wanted to add a Python implementation of KillRVideo \n1:06 Jeff asks if apps/services are actually written for production with Python\n1:15 Amanda talks about how Python is one of the top languages and that developers do develop for production in Python. \n02:08: Jeff mentions Python and Data Science and rapid development\n03:14 Jeff and Amanda share a Little know fact that cqlsh is written in python and uses the python driver\n03:37 Only reimplementing on the microservices in Python (not the front in)\n04:10 Jeff: What was the easiest part of this project \n04:30 Amanda: It was important to Amanda that there was a lower barrier to entry for KillRVideo and Python provides that\n05:05 Jeff: He increased his productivity by 3x by prototyping in the console. \n05:50 Amanda: Loves python because its so easy to learn and get things moving up and going. All the libraries help with that. \n06:23 Jeff: No need to use REGEX, can just import a library to do email valid form checking\n6:49 Amanda: Asks Jeff about how it was to learn how to use the Python driver. --It was easy!\n07:44 Jeff: The least easy part was using the mapper \n07:58 Amanda: When to not use the mapper?\n08:23 Jeff: Can't use paging with mapper need to manage that yourself\n08:50 Jeff: So easy to use Search queries and was so easy that it just worked\n09:24 Jeff: What was not so easy?\n09:40 Amanda: Dependency hell!\n10:18 Amanda: Use virtual environments (Anaconda etc) \n11:00 Jeff: Did not like the lack of strong typing in Python. Typing doesn't resolve until runtime. \n11:44 Jeff: Java is his jam. ",

    "text": "hi welcome to this episode of the distributed day show where we're talking all about killer video and all about my favorite language Python Python from date stack this is a distributed data show maybe two months and what's the focus of that project that we've been working on tell the audience here whoa so we are doing an implementation of the killer video reference application in Python yes I think well one of the reasons that we started working in Python is because I kind of made us because it's one of my favorite languages to code in but not everything's about me right well and okay it was also about me because I've never done app dev in Python before so I said hey I'm game let's do this but that actually sort of begs the question a little bit like do people do production app development in Python right well honestly I mean I think we've seen like multiple articles cuz there's always those year in articles right and all of them have been saying you know Python you know number tough language of 2008 or 2018 so I mean we know it's one of the number one languages out there number one is definitely the top five right but I think going back to your question do people actually do you know production level development in Python and I think that answer is absolutely do right now I think kind of I mean there's a lot of reasons for that um and we're gonna talk about a few of them as we go through the episode right but I think one of them the major ones that I see is you know when you're prototyping something pythons so easy to get something up and running really quickly but we're all crunched for time so how often do you take that prototype that you made make some tweaks and then off into production it goes so I think that's why you're definitely gonna see a lot of apps right right yeah and I think I saw that might have been the case in the past like maybe I do a little bit of prototyping in Python maybe I throw it away maybe I keep it but there's this whole world of data science applications that's happening right right now and I've seen you do amazing things jupiter notebooks and like you can do that right right exactly so it's like a whole new world right where you know you are rapid prototyping is kind of WYSIWYG almost like you're you're doing things and then it's like yep that's the product right there you go and then you can also do data analytics on top of that right so you kind of have the full full gambit to be able to do whatever it is you want to do right okay so let's talk about our GM here yes it is Cassandra Davis X Enterprise right so we are doing application development with Python in Cassandra and DSC right so what are some of the unique aspects of that and actually actually I was thinking about this um there is a one of the first Cassandra applications that everyone uses is actually written in Python do you know what I'm talking about I think I might but you can go for it I think it might be sequel Sh yes that's right that is actually written in Python and it actually uses the Python driver under the hood to talk to Cassandra so there I would argue hey there's an example right of that so you know kind of inspired by that and based on that we're gonna do this killer video we're specifically we're implementing the service layer of killer video so like we're not reimplemented the front end this is the back end the Micra services on the back end that we're reimplemented in Python actually you could do the front end in Python as well if you really wanted to but right but it exists and it works and we yeah we wanted to demonstrate again the key part was like let's demonstrate how to interact with Cassandra using using Python so that's that's what we did on so I won't ask you even we've been collaborating on this for a little while now like what what are some of the pros and cons of doing that or like what was the like what was the easy part right so I'm definitely gonna say the easy part and and really kind of why I wanted us to do this is because there's a lot of languages that we have done that we've implemented killer video with the services layer we have Java nodejs c-sharp yes and all of those are great if you already know those languages but let's say you're coming in and maybe you don't even know Python now a lot of people do but let's say you don't let's say you don't know any of the ones that we have there yes okay Python is the most easy to just if you know how to program you know how to read Python that's right okay so low barrier to entry yes absolutely yeah and I found that to be true I found like I could kind of say things and express things a little bit more concisely yeah in Python as compared to some of the other language implementations that we've done so that was definitely the case I also really liked the fact and actually I had to learn to do this over time I realized this about myself that I would like I have this classic Java lather rinse repeat thing we're at you know write a little bit of code run you know run a little bit of a test to see if that last part worked and there's like this whole compile process that's built into it and I kept doing that with the with Python in a sense and I was like why am I not just prototyping and learning the syntax by typing at the at the command problem right rank of course makes life so much easier you can just try something out and boom right away you know there's like a 3x productivity booze okay and I probably should have known ahead of time but again like learning curve or write new language so what was the some of the stuff that was the easy part for you I think also besides what you've mentioned right I know but I want more there's so many well that's why I love Python because it is so easy risk so easy to learn and it's so easy to get things implemented up and running I think one of the other things is all the libraries that there are for Python that Chris makes it so much easier to implement things I think you had a really good example of an email checker yeah okay bright yeah the Java implementation has this whole thing where it's kind of like building a regular expression to sort of validate whether and you had to think through like what's a valid email address and we build this regular expression so they parshat where the @ sign is and all this right a library that checks for a valid email address and it actually has multiple levels of functionality I just use the first where it checks like valid format there's another extension to the library where it actually goes in like checks if that's a real domain I mean it's all there I mean you've just imported that library right you were going to oh yeah so um so there must have been some other like was there any easy thing that you can talk to us about about using the driver yes okay so yeah this was um it's funny because of all my learning curves in developing the application the Cassandra part and incorporating with the driver was the easiest now you might argue that's because I already know Cassandra and there might be some truth to there but um you know learning the language syntax of Python that's one part of the learning curve you know it's so funny like how many different ways could there be to implement an if statement but every language has to put its own spin on it right yeah but uh you know basically and I admit I was cheating a little bit too because uh you know all the work that that David and Luke and others had done on building up the java application was already there so I was more or less copying over the queries I didn't have to figure out what the cql queries were gonna be right I was just like okay here's a cql query I'm gonna take it and this I mean I'm mostly using prepared statements and the object mapper which actually maybe we should talk about oh that's the least easy part of using that yeah and I actually talked with a driver team about this and they you know they were like definitely there are some cases where it's good to use the mapper and then there's some cases where it doesn't fill your functionality what's an example of when you shouldn't use it um well there was just some cases where I had to do a little bit more of a complex query ok um specifically paging okay so we have a couple of services where we have to we actually have methods on micro services that allow you to get one page of results for a web page at a time that's um is that's not something that you can easily handle directly through the mapper is managing that page state that's not exposed so at that point you have to kind of dive down and just you raw or more regular cql queries at the manage the paging state yourself yourself okay yeah so that's an example so my motive operation was I want this to be as easy as possible I'm gonna use the mapper if I can and then if I can't I'll back off to using other methods so that was kind of how I did it um one of the other things that was really easy was doing the DSC search queries okay like that's all integrated with the Python Python driver yeah exactly you know I have this image in my mind that are like okay you know I'm really comfortable I'm strongest at Cassandra I'm this is gonna be easy okay got that part down I'm gonna have to get my big-boy pants on to go do turn on the search stuff you know get all ready for that and it was like it was a non-event like it was so easy it just worked so once I I mean I already had the search indexes built right because we have all the - we have all that tooling and scripting built out so again the search was super easy so what about the not as easy yes I did you have some pain points in your work yes now this is not so much specifically - killer video yeah but anytime you are doing development in Python you're going to have dependency issues so yes yes so you have all those beautiful libraries that are gonna do so much work for you yeah you have to import them have to have them there in your environment so I like most folks I'm assuming of course I think okay I'm just gonna just do everything just quick quick quick I'm not even gonna think about setting up my environment I'm just gonna pip install sudo all over the place it'sa magical and then just hope that it all works well lo and behold everything breaks down everybody's had those dependency issues you go down this rabbit hole and then you're stuck Ram is broken so for me lesson learned as I should I've learned many times I don't know I had to learn it again but you always want to do virtual environments to set up your dependencies like anaconda or something like that once I started doing that oh okay I'm gonna listen to the pro here I just realized why I didn't have this problem it's my first hardcore Python dev project I don't have a bunch of other stuff installed but I did on I for whatever reason that you know kind of the permissions I have on my laptop I I wasn't able to do pit just pip install raw anyway so I didn't develop a bad habit I was always doing the pip install - user and then a so that's at least a little better right right I should go the full route and do an a comment in the future but okay good enough for right now right okay here's my Bugaboo is in Python so Python is not enforce a lot of strong typing at compile time now I was reading up on this and I kind of got lost in the debate about whether python was officially a strong typing language or not and it kind of made my head swim so send me the hate mail later if I got it wrong but the point is there's a lot of times where you you can get into situations where you don't know the type of something or that's not checked until runtime right messed with my head so much yeah I mean that's where like kind of working through things that the command line really did help me maybe if I was a stronger Python developer it would be like super natural to me maybe this is why I suck at JavaScript too but Java is my jam Java for the win strong typing all the way so okay so we talked about we talked about what's been easy yeah what has not been easy let's talk about what's been fun thank you I know you have something that you really want to share about what's been fun yes okay well so so far all the killer video implementations have basically implemented it's a micro services architecture all them all the micro services could theoretically be running in separate processes or you know running on different servers we could scale them independently we haven't implemented it that way because we were trying to make a simple app we have started down this road of sort of breaking up the monolith and and doing that so part of the step of that is actually we do have some events that asynchronously services are communicating with each other like hey a video was added the suggestion service might want to know about that so that it can calculate recommendations of what videos someone might want to watch so we've been using events for that I was like I'm done doing this in memory stuff I want to use Kafka okay like hey I'm learning Python yes okay hey I haven't used pipe I haven't used coffee yet I'm gonna use Kafka so that was the fun part for me was getting all that going so I guess I'll segue into you hopefully that'll be fun for me because actually that's still pending for me to be working on since we're not all the way done quite yet implemented maybe when this episode comes out maybe we will all be done and I'll be talking about how awesome it was to integrate my service that I've been working on with Kafka I want to congratulate the future version of me she's watching this episode later on good work yeah that's work thank you thank you I'm really hoping that I also will echo that how fun and easy it was one of the other things that we haven't tackled yet that I'm really looking forward to is maybe using graph for the recommendation engine but we were just talking a little bit ago and maybe I don't have to do it the same way that we implemented it in Java so we have an implementation in Java that's heavily dependent on DC graph which is a great way to kind of exhibit some of the capabilities of that tool right but you're telling me we have other options right if we're gonna be doing a recommendation recommendation of videos we don't necessarily have to use graph like you said graph is a great way to do that and we actually have that all implemented in the Java versions right but we can use the I mean Python is all about data science yeah doing recommendations in Python is going to be probably really effortless now makes new little pandas or what is it are you using well that's now that's a good question there's all kinds of things that we can use and I can't think of one right off the top of my head okay so this would be this yeah I turned the distributed data show into you like a feature road mapping session I have this bad habit of doing such things but I think what we want to point and ask to the audience is should we implement this in graph or should we go down this pipe on data science route for a recommendation engine yes we really want your comments let us know because we haven't done it yet so if we get some feedback then that's what we'll do perfect so that wraps up this episode talking all about Python and our implementation with killer video and seriously on social media let us know whether we should how we should implement that recommendation engine that would be really cool get your home yeah exactly let us know what you think we should do and we'll go do it and so stay tuned for our next episode we're gonna stay on this languages track and we're gonna focus on the go language so stay tuned and see you next time [Music] you",
