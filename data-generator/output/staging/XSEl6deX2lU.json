    "text": "hello everyone I'm Aaron plett and I'm going to take you through a quick video on Vector search with astridb so the first question you might ask if you haven't heard very much of this is what are vectors and secondly why would I want to search on them so vectors in the mathematical sense are properties or expressions of data as coordinates or Dimensions with both a magnitude and a Direction this representation of data in a multi-dimensional space allows us to quickly and easily assess and approximate similarity back your search is a generative AI approach for quickly and easily assessing and approximating the similarity of data based on its tokenized vectors which are usually generated by a machine learning model there are actually a few different algorithms out there in Vector search which can be used to determine similarity between vectors the one that we're going to look at today and probably the most popular is what's known as an or the approximate nearest neighbor which is a cosine based approach to Vector similarity searching in this case we're going to use a natural language processing technique known as a bag of words and in the bag of words strategy essentially what we have here is we're going to look at specific products um a couple of types of dog food a couple of toys you know a couple of types of treats and what we're going to do is we're going to tokenize these product names to assess their similarity so the first thing we do is we go through each product name and we look for The Unique words to actually build our vocabulary in this case there are 14 unique words used among these six product names uh that that we can build our vocabulary from then we'll build out a matrix with you know our vocabulary at the top and our products on the side and each product essentially gets a zero or a one based on whether or not the word is in the name um so for that first product there you can see that this is our healthy fresh chicken raw dog food um the second product there is our healthy fresh beef raw dog food you know in the the next one too we can see that this is a um you know a dog tennis tennis ball toy next one down is a dog's um ring chew toy next we have pepper sausage uh bacon dog treats and then finally pepper sausage beef dog treats as you can see based on our our vocabulary and whether or not those words are present with each product we've been able to go ahead and create vectors for each of them let's create a new table and you can see that I'm going to create this product Vector column of type vector and it's going to be a float with 14 dimensions and then those 14 dimensions are going to represent our vocabulary for the bag of words approach next we'll want to create a storage attached secondary index so I'll say create custom index on and we'll say pet supply vectors and we want that on product vector and we're going to say using storage attached index there so with that created now let's go ahead and insert a row here and this row into Supply vectors is going to have our product ID our product name of healthy fresh chicken raw dog food and it's going to have the product Vector embedding on the end of it let's take a look at that there we go that's in there this is how our Vector embedding should come back now let's go ahead and get the rest of our product rows in there there we go okay and there you can see we have our six products um with their names and their vectors so now let's assume that we've gone ahead and added the healthy fresh chicken raw dog food product of PF 1843 into our cart and we want to trigger the nearest match of that vector so let's go ahead and say select product ID product name and then we'll say similarity cosine and we'll say uh product vector and we'll grab our chicken vector and then we'll save from Pet Supply vectors order by product vector a n n of and then put our Vector in one more time and then we'll say limit two I will say we'll say limit six we'll bring them all back and you know real quick for clarity let me redo this query by giving the similarity cosine an alias so let's say clear and then we'll up arrow on that and then jump to the end of our similarity cosine function and say as similarity there so as you can see uh this query did return all of our products however notice in the similarity column here the first product that comes back so the vector we queried for obviously is a 100 match but this healthy fresh beef raw dog food is a 90 match so that's the one that we definitely want to show so yeah this is a little bit of how this all works at the cql Shell level next let's have a look at a service that we've written to go ahead and bring back um the next nearest suggested product based on uh based on the vector embedding um so in here I've created a spring boot service we're going to call it promotion service uh we're going to give it a product ID and essentially right here you can see that it's doing a select based on that product ID it's pulling back the product vector and then it's running a query from that same table but pulling back the approximate nearest neighbor doing a limit two after going through both results and only including the different product in the result set so not the 100 match it then returns a response back to the caller let's give this a shot you can see that we have our Maven project here so let's go ahead and do a maven clean install all right so we have a clean build here from maven um let's go ahead and start our spring boot app [Music] there we go that's running and then from a different terminal window let me go ahead and call that service so I'll say let's do a curl dash s Dash X get and we're going to say it's a local HTTP [Music] 127.0.0.180 and we're going to say promo promotion service and that's going to be promo product and we're going to say PF 1843 and let's see if this works all right and as you can see here running a an Vector search for product PF 1843 using its Vector embedding we have returned product PF 1844 which we know is a 90 match um so in this case we could pop up an advertisement saying hey we see that you like the healthy fresh chicken raw dog food perhaps you'd like to try the healthy fresh beef raw dog food at 10 off or you know some discount like that to view the materials code and data that were used in this session feel free to check out the following git repo of github.com aar0np Slash customer promotion Vector search thank you very much and have a great day",
