    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hey it's the distributed data show i'm jeff carpenter and i'm here in the studio with patrick McFadden hey Jeff how you doing as is often our habit we have on the on the phone on the line with us we have Luke Tillman hello fellow humans good to have you Luke and we also have mr. David Gilardi no no coming at us live from the lovely state of Florida also we have an additional East Coast guests with us today he is a solutions engineer here with us at data stack sebastian Estevez well thank you it's good to have you I hear you're a man of many talents so why don't you give us a little bit about your background what you do here at data sacks sure yeah so I've been with the company about three years and I've had three roles throughout those years the first thing that I did was work for our starter program so for those of you guys that aren't aware we do give out our software freedom small companies we have had historically varying levels of support that through for my first year and habitat effects I was kind of free helped for the post of the program which means that I interacted with lots of but small companies with not a lot of resources trying to be really awesome impossible things with our software and that was a lot of fun and I've learned a lot about distribute technology in general specifically about DSP after that I took on a similar role as NFC as a social engineer in the Northeast with enterprise customers helping basically them start out on projects and undertakings with with DSA and finally most recently maybe I'm supposed to go a little to our Bangor team that's kind of a concentrated smaller team within the sous-vide team let's focus on our accounts internal Nabal beneficial gut Wow well I am super stoked that you're here you know I'm a big fan of the sebastian show you've always done really good work and i I've always enjoyed your presentations about some of the more say truthy parts of you know running a large scale system how how our product works you know how to make it work really well and that's why I'm really excited you're here today so what do you have to share with us today so like that with truthy right because three systems are are right really and really hard yeah and I've been thinking a lot recently about distributed graph technology specifically kind of real-time transactional raps like the easy graph and you know that's certainly I think it might in my eyes it's a little bit of kind of an expert here in distributed data it's also so it's something that's evolving fast as it was changing it's hard to do but something that's got a lot of value add as well well you know I know that that's but maybe one time we were talking and I I didn't really quite this a few years ago maybe a couple years ago you told me the future is graph and that was the first time I'd ever heard someone say that exactly and it was from you so congratulations it's working out yes um I don't remember that conversation I would have expected that like latias or somebody people do that now you congratulate if you did looks good well I've been doing a lot of thinking about graph up and a lot of working work specifically around automate basically write perform and gremlin queries of using VSC so for somebody that's out there listening to this you know what there's not going to have any idea what you're talking about you know gremlins like I'm thinking we need some more Mogwai on this show like this was an awesome eighties movie but like if somebody doesn't know what a gremlin is explain to them you know what is gremlin and what does a gremlin query why why should we care I think I might uncle drove one of those back in the day yeah AMC car the AMC Gremlin fantastic vehicle now you should never grab that it's like a pacer but worse all right not about movies are cars dentists so well yeah let me let me actually a little bit of background that really useful for posted that haven't gotten into like the most recent wave of kind of rap technology there's a few different graph databases there that are kind of coming out and they've been growing over the past bunch of years and to kind of bind them together and have a little bit of a community effort a community effect there's also some graph standards that are coming out and that are gaining a lot of momentum and so some most of these graph data people support those standards the standard is called tinker pop which is an Apache project it's another weird weird kind of like gremlin basically take a pop consists of this cast of characters right a whole bunch of little kind of cartoony very beautifully drawn and we have their own personality and cool character in each of them represents like a different layer and they pick up up stack right into an up set of standards for graph database and so at the top of that stack of the interaction layer between the graph database and the user right the developer we have a query language called gremlin the way that I like to describe gremlin is if you picture your graph which is just a bunch of birds even edges right nose in things that connect those nodes and you can kind of take your VRD and turn it into just a graph by drawing it on a whiteboard really I like to talk about gremlin by thinking about picturing a little gremlin guy on the graph some we're standing on maybe a vertex and then you know through the language which is a functional which is a functional language Turing complete proposal things called steps you can tell that little gremlin to jump around that graph and to move up and down in and out and over through the vertices in either and through the ages okay and so kind of the goal in the purpose of a gremlin is to give you high like a high transactional or high perverse Lex passivity right when we take this grim in traverse the graph and you jump around the graph and the language is very expressive you can they can be backwards in front puts in all kind of stuff he had a little sacre cour stuff into it all sorts of thing so yeah so because of that I'm really weird with all the analogies like the movie I was just wrapping it was like do you put it in a blender because I remember that was in the movie too don't get him wet yeah that's me I want to go back on necklace after this and check this up sweetie I getting anything - yeah well yeah that's kind of it we'll put that the show notes and like half of our audience is right there with your psyche IMDB link please read this because they will make more sense well because of all that school traversal expert if ax t there's a lot of ways to get the data that you want in the graph aids right that's kind of what condensed and so we go the reason we spend a lot of time on grammar queries and optimizations because you could write a grim and crazy to get to a data but you might write it really an efficiently at my table on top right whereas you might write it the right way knowing all the underlying structures of how things work under the hood and BSE grep and then you'll get some very performant queries to get you the right data and so through that through that scope I've been thing a lot about how to how to improve people's experience okay so can you tell us a little bit why optimizing a gremlin query is necessary or you know how how it's useful yeah for sure uh so I think that a lot of folks were are going to jump into their developer tool most likely PC studio which is a really nice tool to kind of play around with and visualize and write their queries at and they may like in a query and it runs and it comes out right or something like that and so there's kind of a little bit of techniques and strategy and tactics and be able to get really good results from your from your from your Brett from your graph words because at the end of the day the distributed system with tens or hundreds of machines running around and you know the data may be a lot of places and it's very easy for you to kind of go write something that just simply won't come back in transactional chess right we're going to find out okay so we need some more details here we have time right let's dig into this what are some of those tactics specifically that we can use to get more performant gremlin queries yeah definitely so kind of the kind of the way I've been approaching the problem is iteratively right and so I'd like to start with the first thing I'll do is I'll slap a time limit step on my grandma query and you guys can check out that and think about that being patient for what for what that looks like but basically you save time with it and you give it a number of milliseconds right and that's going to be the maximum amount of time that the query will spend running at the gremlin server wooden DLC and so asset at that time after those let's say 100 milliseconds have expired it'll take the data that's got so far and shoot back and so that means that you won't kind of be waiting forever for something to come back or timeout you'll just be able to get responses and troubleshoot through your query to make sure you're getting what you want kind of without without losing all your time right so that's kind of the first thing that I would say is really useful to split the time limiting where like enforce my SLA kind of thing would you use in that case you kind of I guess you could but maybe not it depends on it depends on you know how sensitive you are to the data that you're getting back if you need an entire result set or if you're really just looking for kind of first ten days and you could also so it was very similar to a limit clause instead of but instead of a number of things I want back I just want whatever you got so far I could come back to the fence back so I guess you in some cases you could use it to enforce not too late one thing to note that's not like that's query like that's not the query back and forth time right there still you're still pushing stuff stuff through the networks is over the wire back under your client and it's just the amount of time it'll spend within Gremlin within the gremlin server context we'll see probably the coordinate so yeah that's the first thing and there's a few other tactics but I think maybe one of the one of the interesting parts about this whole thing is that now that you know gremlin queries are so expressive and there are so many different ways to get the data you want we're back in a world that again is really different from CTL which a lot of times distributed data is folks not used where you were doing pinpoint queries and you know exactly where they are and is so you can seat over and you and you you know scan the right parts of this and there's really only one way to get that right and maybe you have a couple represent that's it on the other hand with gremlin like you are do a kind of complex stuff you can you know go through a bunch of the vertices you can group now you can do all these things right and so that means that there's a lot of ways that to do it and so they're back in the world where we have to be like I explained by it and where we have quarry profiling because it's actually really deep kind of like we used to in already be event right and so kind of thing is kind of going to open this up and so kind of kind of coming back to your experience sitting in sitting in our studio and chronic composting requires will also slap us out profiles you know that query because that's going to tell you the different kind of steps they're happening underlying and where you're spending time so you can kind of take the big ones and try to narrow it down and it'll also tell you you know if you're if you're leveraging indexes with within the database right which is a significant kind of a performing performance improvement so if you can have scaleable queries going to pick it up your indexes and you can see that in a photo op so this is a pretty new thing like Patrick kind of alluded to it I guess a little bit you know two years ago we had this conversation with you and you told him graphs were the future all craft and so give us a sense you know how how fast is this technology evolving oh yeah I think it's really evolving super fast right so one of the things that one of the things in my thought problems are working with a bunch of customers to help them build fast grimille queries is I've seen the same kinds of problems and then kind of tactics will run over couple times and so I've been writing those down like those thoughts that I've been writing down I'm actually hoping and kind of seeing that they're quickly becoming obsolete right because in the same way that we have explained plans with profiling back in our queries like you're used to in the old days we also have a database up collage right and that database optimizer gets better and so something's like a gremlin query that it's written efficiently next way and can be rewritten in why way the negative well some of that suppose things start to happen automatically so I think like in the next release is one that actually improves it with me the way we handle the ores and ants that's significantly and so now you don't have to kind of think about it that much yeah so I mean that you know in this world as optimizing spreaders you're saying code when you're saved queries is going to just keep performing puzzle is about which is pretty cool that's hard to keep up with I mean I was just a graph day in San Francisco and the talks there were of course on the on this topic you're just talking about like how fast things are moving and trying to keep up with it we're preparing for graph day in Seattle which is an October same story I'm sure there's going to be something new and cutting edge there as well and it's great to keep up with it and that's why you know I keep going to Congress and these are getting bigger these graph compasses are now growing they're not just meetups anymore but if I want to learn more about this I mean where would I where would I learn more where you know who are the people I would reach out to give us some idea where to go because this is confusing and we need help yeah so well one shameless plug of the data science engineering blog has a lot of great material including a blog post specifically about tuning your gremlin queries things I called it good better best driven query or something comfortable they wouldn't put a link down here to like Sebastian mess yeah yeah that guy's what he's really good I hear anything on that same definitely need a blog by Marco or there's a couple really good on ideas as well or definitely worth your read of your site going through and dive down the grab rat hole some of those are pretty dense but there's very useful awesome nuggets and oh yeah so so really material I think a number one place to go as with everything DfE is to start off with the base tax Academy courses that are in beautifully filmed and that's something that I'm hoping to really take advantage of and we also have a PSA slack now right how do you hope to get there on the website and sign up yeah if you have a data stacks Academy account it's part of that you can ask for an invite or one can be out here you can just go to your profile send me an invite sought Ematic no humans involved which I love but once you're in there there's a channel for studio there's one for graph and then there's some other general things just any really lots of topics lots of mech for this show we have a channel for this right we distributed data show we have a room there for our channel there so yeah plenty of places to ask questions and interact with other users oh yeah so you know a lot of us a lot of us that affects try to spend some time over it could could be s a select channel once in a while I know a lot of people is room so have to be places of help as well yep Wow well you know this has been a wealth of information and your blog post I think is a good follow up for those people that want to read what you've just said it is you need a new technology that once you start to get to know how to use this this is really helpful information as you're starting out how do i how do i make my best queries and what are the tricks and things and so this has been really helpful thank you very much for joining us today also thank you guys for having us up very excited that the show is that yeah well and for everyone out there thank you again for joining us and we'll see you next time thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data stacks Academy and tell us what you think you can also find us on the data stacks Academy YouTube channel or find our podcasts on iTunes Google Play or wherever you
